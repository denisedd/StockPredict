                "bodyText":"David Cameron defended Britain\u2019s decision to reject higher EU tariffs on Chinese steel on Friday as the business secretary faced the anger of Port Talbot workers whose livelihoods have been undermined by cut-price imports. The prime minister, on a visit to Washington, said that the UK was right to block plans that he argued would \u201crewrite not simply the tariff rules on steel, but the entire tariff infrastructure of the EU\u201d, while Labour accused the government of failing to protect British workers from China\u2019s \u201chighly aggressive approach in this economic battle\u201d. On Friday morning, China raised tensions by imposing a 46% import duty on a type of steel made by Tata in Wales. Hours earlier, Downing Street sources said Cameron had confronted Chinese president Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the nuclear security summit in Washington DC to express his concerns on Thursday night. Business secretary Sajid Javid returned from an official trip to Australia to face a tense scene in Port Talbot, south Wales, where thousands of steelworkers face losing their jobs. Arriving three days after the crisis first broke, Javid said that it was the government\u2019s interventions that had stopped Tata from closing down the Port Talbot site overnight, and urged the Indian giant to get on with selling the business. He left to shouts of \u201csave our steel, save our steel\u201d from workers. Earlier, speaking to hundreds of Port Talbot workers outside talks with trade union officials and Tata management, Javid said he expected there to be formal expressions of interest once the sale process officially launched and described steel as \u201cabsolutely vital to the future of the UK industrial sector\u201d. One Port Talbot worker also handed Javid a Save Our Steel badge. Workers were not convinced by Javid\u2019s pledge. Lyndon Jones, who has worked at the steelworks for 30 years, said: \u201cWe feel abandoned by the government. I don\u2019t think the government wants an industry. In this country we are happy for other people to come into our country and sell commodities.\u201d Adrian Morgan, a 27-year worker at Port Talbot, said: \u201cIt would be devastating for south Wales as a whole if it closed. The next biggest employer in the area is Amazon.

You would naturally expect them to want that early on \u2026 so they can complete that due diligence as quickly as possible,\u201d he said. He reiterated that nationalising the Port Talbot steelworks was \u201cnot a viable long-term solution\u201d but said he would \u201cwork with potential buyers and listen to how we can help\u201d. But sources who met with the business secretary at Port Talbot told the Guardian that he had failed to set out any potential steps that the government could take, claiming that \u201ccommercial\u201d sensitivities prevented him releasing any details. There was speculation that the purpose of the meetings had been to \u201cmuzzle\u201d outspoken figures fighting to save jobs in south Wales.

Stephen Doughty, a Labour MP representing communities in south Wales, said Javid had \u201crevealed the motivations behind their failure to stand up in Europe for the UK steel industry\u201d. Both Cameron and Javid have come under huge pressure to act since Tata Steel announced its decision to sell off its British arm this week, arguing that the assets were losing \u00a31m a day and were now worth virtually nothing. Javid was criticised for travelling to the other side of the world, taking his daughter with him, when he knew that the Tata decision was pending. He claimed that he had been unaware that the plans for closure could carry a timetable of \u201cweeks\u201d rather than months.

Javid admitted that finding a buyer for Tata\u2019s loss-making assets would not be straightforward and said he recognised that any potential buyer may require the help of the UK government. Meanwhile Cameron raised the issue of the future of the Port Talbot plant with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, on the sidelines of the security summit in Washington. A Number 10 spokesperson said: \u201cPrime Minister Modi said that the Indian steel industry was facing similar challenges from global over-capacity and the Chinese economic slowdown. \u201cThey discussed what could be done domestically to support the steel industry, including through public procurement, and they agreed we should work together to address this issue at an international level, including at the G20 in China later this year.\u201d",

An evening worth flying in from Panama for Now this is timely. The Resolution Foundation thinktank had no idea that the Panama papers, revealing details of how the rich can exploit secretive offshore tax regimes, were about to hit the headlines when it organised its latest bash. Taking place in London on Wednesday, the event, entitled \u201cTaxing the top: what history tells us about when and why it happens\u201d, marks the launch of a book on taxing the rich by US economist David Stasavage. Other speakers will include Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Topics covered in the evening will include: \u201cDo the richest in society need to pay more, or are they already sharing an unfair burden of the UK\u2019s declining tax base?\u201d (No and yes would seem to be the likely answers from the Panamanian offshore brigade, to judge from the recent revelations.) Stasavage argues that those at the very top are paying a lower effective rate of tax than the merely well-off, and that this goes against basic principles of equality and fairness.

In a week in which David Cameron has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/10/david-cameron-tax-affairs-what-figures-show\">published details of his tax records</a>, why shouldn\u2019t public companies with a chequered track record \u2013 Google, Starbucks, Vodafone and others \u2013 be made to disclose more too? </p> <p>A seemingly constant stream of tax scandals involving these and many other of the world\u2019s best-known multinational corporations has exposed the way big business has become increasingly aggressive in its international tax planning. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/12/brussels-pressures-multinationals-to-declare-taxes-and-profits\">Brussels pressures multinationals to declare taxes and profits</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/05/-sp-luxembourg-tax-files-tax-avoidance-industrial-scale\">LuxLeaks revelations</a> two years ago further demonstrated how, in equally aggressive fashion, it is possible for European member states \u2013 not just offshore tax havens \u2013 to tailor their tax policies to court multinationals hungry for tax favours. </p> <p>The result is a betrayal of the trust between countries that are meant to underpin international trade. Pliant states have struck private deals with powerful multinationals, creating colossal artificial flows of income across borders and eroding the tax take of their neighbours.</p> <p>It is a scandal costing the world economy hundreds of billions of dollars a year. According to the most conservative estimates from the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), between <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/05/oecd-hopes-reforms-will-end-era-of-aggressive-tax-avoidance\">4% and 10% of global corporate income tax revenues are being lost</a> to tax avoidance. </p> <p>The EU alone says its member states lose each year between \u20ac50bn and \u20ac70bn (\u00a339.9bn and \u00a355.8bn) to those avoiding corporation tax. It estimates that multinationals can pay up to 30% less than rival companies which do not operate across borders.</p> <p>In October last year, world leaders representing 90% of the world\u2019s economy <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/05/oecd-hopes-reforms-will-end-era-of-aggressive-tax-avoidance\">agreed to a raft of measures</a>, thrashed out through an OECD tax reform programme, designed to stamp out the most egregious tax avoidance practices among multinationals. </p> <p>Top of the list was a requirement for big businesses to produce so-called country-by-country reports. These reports \u2013 to be shared only with tax inspectors \u2013 provide a schedule of business and tax information, itemised by jurisdiction. </p> <p>Many tax campaigners believe country-by-country reports will become the most powerful tool for exposing the mismatch between where big businesses are most commercially active and where their income is taxed.

                "bodyText":"Public confidence in governments\u2019 ability to make sure big business contributes its fair share in corporate income tax has been blown to smithereens in recent years. One of the most persuasive solutions on the table is enforced transparency. In a week in which David Cameron has published details of his tax records, why shouldn\u2019t public companies with a chequered track record \u2013 Google, Starbucks, Vodafone and others \u2013 be made to disclose more too? A seemingly constant stream of tax scandals involving these and many other of the world\u2019s best-known multinational corporations has exposed the way big business has become increasingly aggressive in its international tax planning. The LuxLeaks revelations two years ago further demonstrated how, in equally aggressive fashion, it is possible for European member states \u2013 not just offshore tax havens \u2013 to tailor their tax policies to court multinationals hungry for tax favours. The result is a betrayal of the trust between countries that are meant to underpin international trade. Pliant states have struck private deals with powerful multinationals, creating colossal artificial flows of income across borders and eroding the tax take of their neighbours. It is a scandal costing the world economy hundreds of billions of dollars a year. According to the most conservative estimates from the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), between 4% and 10% of global corporate income tax revenues are being lost to tax avoidance. The EU alone says its member states lose each year between \u20ac50bn and \u20ac70bn (\u00a339.9bn and \u00a355.8bn) to those avoiding corporation tax. It estimates that multinationals can pay up to 30% less than rival companies which do not operate across borders. In October last year, world leaders representing 90% of the world\u2019s economy agreed to a raft of measures, thrashed out through an OECD tax reform programme, designed to stamp out the most egregious tax avoidance practices among multinationals. Top of the list was a requirement for big businesses to produce so-called country-by-country reports. These reports \u2013 to be shared only with tax inspectors \u2013 provide a schedule of business and tax information, itemised by jurisdiction. Many tax campaigners believe country-by-country reports will become the most powerful tool for exposing the mismatch between where big businesses are most commercially active and where their income is taxed. Finding and defeating this artifice is at the heart of the battle against avoidance. On Tuesday, the European commission revealed a new proposal it said goes further than the OECD reforms. As revealed in the Guardian in February, the commission is promising to make all large corporations active in the EU publish some data from their country-by-country reports in the public domain. That means fresh tax data on most of the world\u2019s largest multinationals will be publicly available, broken down by each member state. While the proposal stops short of demanding data for non-EU jurisdictions \u2013 much to the frustration of those campaigning for tax justice in the developing world \u2013 it will extend to recognised tax havens, a list of which has yet to be thrashed out. The new reporting rules will apply to multinationals with a turnover of more than \u20ac750m \u2013 estimated to be at least 6,000 multinationals, two-thirds of which are thought to be headquartered outside the EU. Unveiling the new measures, Valdis Dombrovskis, commissioner for social dialogue said: \u201cClose cooperation between tax authorities must go hand in hand with public transparency.\u201d Jonathan Hill, the European commissioner for financial stability, added: \u201cOur proposal to increase transparency will help make companies more accountable.\u201d However, the proposal comes amid fierce lobbying from business interest groups, particularly in the US, where the National Association of Manufacturers has led calls for Washington to resist disclosures of what it called \u201csensitive, proprietary business information\u201d.

                "bodyText":"Mining shares are leading the way forward after better than expected Chinese trade data renewed hopes of a positive outlook for the world\u2019s second largest economy, helping the FTSE 100 to a new high for the year. But retailers are also in focus, with Tesco leading supermarkets lower despite signs of a turnaround, and Halfords higher following a strong fourth quarter. The car parts and bicycle specialist has reported a 2.6 per cent like for like rise in fourth quarter revenue and confirmed full year profit guidance of between \u00a378m and \u00a382m. In cycling bike sale rose for the second successive quarter, but parts and accessories fell. Motoring sales were boosted by in-car dashboard cameras, car cleaning products and travel equipment, while its Autocentres business benefited from investment to refurbish the sites. Halford\u2019s shares are up 4% at 401.8p, and Stifel analyst Scott Ransley said: Sales exceeded our low-end expectations although profit guidance is unchanged. Nevertheless against some challenging comparisons we would view this as a positive retail performance, following the resilient third quarter in Retail. Given the flat 2017 growth outlook, we believe the shares could continue to trade in the 320-420p range. Liberum analysts were less positive: We see a strong fourth quarter as encouraging, although one quarter does not make a trend and we need to see further momentum before turning more positive. We maintain our sell recommendation, but acknowledge that there are some clear positives, including a healthy balance sheet, a 4%+ dividend yield and the potential for near-term special cash returns. But WH Smith is down 45p at \u00a317.60 following its half year results, and Tesco has dropped 7.45p to 188.85p on worries about a cautious outlook even though it reported its first quarterly sales growth for three years. Joe Rundle at ETX Capital said: The headline figures are promising, but Tesco is like an oil tanker that takes a long time to turn around and although not through the turn at least it\u2019s started to head in the right direction... Nevertheless, there appear to be no shortage of problems ahead for Tesco, with continued competition on both sides of the high street; from the likes of Aldi and Lidl at the low-end to Waitrose at the high-end. Tesco also has to contend with the emerging threat from Amazon in the online sector. Despite reducing net debt by 40%, at \u00a35.1 billion Tesco still has too much debt and its bonds are rated as junk. Morrisons has also fallen, down 1.8p at 199.4p. Overall the FTSE 100 is up 78.02 points at 6320.41, with Anglo American up 42.3p at 681p and Rio Tinto rising 113.5p to \u00a322. This is the highest level for the leading index since early December. Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said: That\u2019s been a rather impressive start to the day\u2019s session for equities with the FTSE-100 charging higher at the opening bell and punching rather unexpectedly through the 6,300 level. Commodities remain very much in focus \u2013 we\u2019ve seen base metals soaring in the last few hours helped by upbeat Chinese import data and even if oil prices are coming off the boil a little, the bulls are still winning out at least for now. Critically there\u2019s an element of uncertainty hanging over whether producer nations will be able to agree a meaningful production freeze this weekend and we\u2019ve seen a little profit taking on crude as a result, but so long as we can hold onto the majority of these recent gains \u2013 that $40/barrel level holds psychological significance - then the broader based equity rally may be sustainable. Despite a dip in the oil price - Brent crude is down 1% at $44.18 a barrel - it shows no signs of a serious plunge ahead of this weekend\u2019s meeting of oil producers. There are hopes that there will be some kind of agreement to freeze output in an attempt to tackle the supply glut.

The result of less consumption but greater wellbeing could be \u201cespecially important for debates around secular stagnation and ecological sustainability\u201d, he says.

                "body":"<p>Before the forfeiture committee is summoned to consider <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/26/bhs-collapse-sir-philip-green-must-repay-400m-pounds-or-lose-knighthood\">de-gonging Sir Philip Green</a>, it\u2019s probably wise to introduce some proper process into the unpicking of the BHS fiasco.</p> <p>Frank Field\u2019s work and pensions select committee can do valuable work on the narrow question of assessing the impact on the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), the lifeboat for defined-benefit schemes. It can also invite Green to give evidence \u2013 and, by the way, it should also call Lady Green, since she was the formal owner of the department store chain. And the Pensions Regulator can assess whether the Greens should be asked to contribute more to the pension scheme.</p> <p>But what is really needed is an old-style Department of Trade and Industry investigation, which may even be wider than the inquiry Sir Vince Cable called for last night. Were the trustees of the BHS pension fund asleep when Green\u2019s family was extracting dividends? Did those famous names on the BHS board \u2013 Allan Leighton, now chairman of the Co-op Group, and bankers Robin Saunders and Chris Coles \u2013 assess long-term risks to the pension fund? Did property transactions between BHS and the Green family weaken the pension fund\u2019s covenant?</p> <p>How did the trustees and Green decide in 2012 that 23 years would be a suitable period in which to attempt to close a deficit that now stands at \u00a3571m? Should the Pensions Regulator, in future, approve the sale of any business with a deficit in its pension fund? And, after the sale of BHS to Retail Acquisitions, were the \u201cprofessional fees\u201d charged by the owners justified?</p> <p>Proper process these days means the administrator to BHS filing a report on the collapse, which will cover the conduct of current and former directors. The insolvency service then reads it and can make recommendations for further inquiry to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. Sajid Javid, the secretary of state, can then order whatever investigation he wishes.</p> <p>Javid should opt for the fullest possible inquiry, assuming there are grounds to do so. In the last big collapse in the retail industry \u2013 Comet in 2012 \u2013 taxpayers were left with a bill to cover redundancy payments. Yet the insolvency service\u2019s report was never published, despite then-business secretary Cable\u2019s promise to share details. At BHS it is possible the PPF will have to increase levies on other defined-benefit funds. This time, let\u2019s have the full facts on the table. If Green\u2019s knighthood is to be removed, let everybody see why.</p> <h2>Barclays\u2019 new chief needs to get tough on bonuses</h2> <p>Jes Staley\u2019s pitch at Barclays is that, once he has shed the dross, the rest of the bank will finally sparkle for long-suffering shareholders. The new chief executive puts it less excitedly, of course. \u201cThe performance of the core today shows the potential power of the group once it is freed from the drag of non-core,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Up to a point, that\u2019s a reasonable analysis, and one Barclays was keen to emphasise. The bank boasted about its 18% increase in \u201ccore\u201d pre-tax profits in the first quarter before mentioning <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/27/barclays-profit-slump-confirms-interest-africa-arm-jes-staley\">the all-in 25% decline to \u00a3793m</a>. Fair enough.</p> <p>But don\u2019t run away with the impression that the core is entirely healthy. The plan to sell the African assets was not the biggest decision Staley has made since arriving last autumn. Rather, it was retention of the investment bank, which has earned its keep only about one year in every four since the financial crisis.</p> <p>This year is already shaping up as yet another non-vintage offering. Underlying profits declined by almost a third in the corporate and investment bank as revenues fell.

                "bodyText":"Before the forfeiture committee is summoned to consider de-gonging Sir Philip Green, it\u2019s probably wise to introduce some proper process into the unpicking of the BHS fiasco. Frank Field\u2019s work and pensions select committee can do valuable work on the narrow question of assessing the impact on the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), the lifeboat for defined-benefit schemes. It can also invite Green to give evidence \u2013 and, by the way, it should also call Lady Green, since she was the formal owner of the department store chain. And the Pensions Regulator can assess whether the Greens should be asked to contribute more to the pension scheme. But what is really needed is an old-style Department of Trade and Industry investigation, which may even be wider than the inquiry Sir Vince Cable called for last night. Were the trustees of the BHS pension fund asleep when Green\u2019s family was extracting dividends? Did those famous names on the BHS board \u2013 Allan Leighton, now chairman of the Co-op Group, and bankers Robin Saunders and Chris Coles \u2013 assess long-term risks to the pension fund? Did property transactions between BHS and the Green family weaken the pension fund\u2019s covenant? How did the trustees and Green decide in 2012 that 23 years would be a suitable period in which to attempt to close a deficit that now stands at \u00a3571m? Should the Pensions Regulator, in future, approve the sale of any business with a deficit in its pension fund? And, after the sale of BHS to Retail Acquisitions, were the \u201cprofessional fees\u201d charged by the owners justified? Proper process these days means the administrator to BHS filing a report on the collapse, which will cover the conduct of current and former directors. The insolvency service then reads it and can make recommendations for further inquiry to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. Sajid Javid, the secretary of state, can then order whatever investigation he wishes. Javid should opt for the fullest possible inquiry, assuming there are grounds to do so. In the last big collapse in the retail industry \u2013 Comet in 2012 \u2013 taxpayers were left with a bill to cover redundancy payments. Yet the insolvency service\u2019s report was never published, despite then-business secretary Cable\u2019s promise to share details. At BHS it is possible the PPF will have to increase levies on other defined-benefit funds. This time, let\u2019s have the full facts on the table. If Green\u2019s knighthood is to be removed, let everybody see why. Barclays\u2019 new chief needs to get tough on bonuses Jes Staley\u2019s pitch at Barclays is that, once he has shed the dross, the rest of the bank will finally sparkle for long-suffering shareholders. The new chief executive puts it less excitedly, of course. \u201cThe performance of the core today shows the potential power of the group once it is freed from the drag of non-core,\u201d he said. Up to a point, that\u2019s a reasonable analysis, and one Barclays was keen to emphasise. The bank boasted about its 18% increase in \u201ccore\u201d pre-tax profits in the first quarter before mentioning the all-in 25% decline to \u00a3793m. Fair enough. But don\u2019t run away with the impression that the core is entirely healthy. The plan to sell the African assets was not the biggest decision Staley has made since arriving last autumn. Rather, it was retention of the investment bank, which has earned its keep only about one year in every four since the financial crisis. This year is already shaping up as yet another non-vintage offering. Underlying profits declined by almost a third in the corporate and investment bank as revenues fell. Many competitors are doing worse, but an incoming Barclays chief executive should know his duty when return on equity in investment banking is still sub-par \u2013 cut those bonuses. The efforts of his predecessor, Antony Jenkins, were limp and he will forever be remembered for his confession that he could not be tougher for fear of a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d, a remark that encapsulated how Barclays\u2019 high-earners have a stranglehold over the shareholders. Staley has already added to investors\u2019 suffering by pre-announcing a 50% dividend cut. That setback demands a stiffer response on 2016 bonuses than Wednesday\u2019s vague promise to adjust \u201cappropriately\u201d. Maybe Staley\u2019s end-of-year action will be stronger than his words \u2013 it had better be. Amazon\u2019s man at the DWP makes a discreet exit How convenient. Doug Gurr, the Amazon executive whose appointment as a non-executive director at the Department for Work and Pensions caused a storm in February, has got a promotion. He has been switched from Amazon\u2019s Chinese operations to leading the UK end. You might think a UK posting would make it easier to rock up at the DWP occasionally, but Amazon says he needs to \u201cfocus on his new role\u201d and thus his government job has ended almost before it began. Take a bow Labour MP Margaret Hodge, who questioned the sense of putting an Amazon exective at the heart of government when so many web-based multinationals\u2019 tax affairs are under the spotlight. It rather looks as if Amazon has opted for discretion.",
