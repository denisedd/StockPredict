                "bodyText":"Saudi Aramco, the world\u2019s biggest oil producer, is studying plans to privatise some of its subsidiaries as well as offering shares in the main business. The news follows comments made by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Thursday that he supported the trillion-dollar company being prepared for an initial public offering (IPO). If the float goes ahead it will be the world\u2019s most valuable quoted company, dwarfing Apple, Exxon and Google. The moves have astonished the oil sector and led to speculation about whether a share float would change the Saudi strategy of driving down oil prices by refusing to cut back on production. Analysts believe the world\u2019s most valuable business will attract a lot of interest from potential investors, but warn that the Saudis could underestimate western concerns about Aramco\u2019s traditional secrecy and the impact of falling oil prices. A statement from the oil group said: \u201cSaudi Aramco confirms that it has been studying various options to allow broad public participation in its equity through the listing in the capital markets of an appropriate percentage of the company\u2019s shares and/or the listing of a bundle its downstream subsidiaries. \u201cThis proposal is consistent with the broad and progressive direction pursued by the Kingdom for reforms, including privatization in various sectors of the Saudi economy and deregulation of markets.\u2019\u2019 Prince Mohammed expected a review of the business, which has reserves of 260bn barrels and 60,000 staff, to be completed within months. Any float could take place after that. The Saudis have recently introduced a raft of changes to the economy, not least has been a decision to cut subsidies on domestic energy bills and a plan to introduce VAT taxes. Both are considered risky in a conservative country with such fragile democratic credentials. Jason Tuvey, a Middle East specialist at Capital Economics, said it was difficult to value Saudi Aramco and he had come across speculative figures ranging from $1tn to $10tn. Even the lower figure means Aramco is worth three times as much as Exxon Mobil, and a 5% stake of that would easily dwarf the $25bn raised by China\u2019s Alibaba group, whose $25bn float is the largest so far. Fadel Gheit, a veteran oil analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co brokerage in New York, questioned how easy it would be for the Saudis to pull off a significant flotation given Aramco was used to a very low level of transparency. And he pointed out that Prince Mohammed had raised another issue at Aramco that could concern any potential buyers: corruption. \u201cIf western investors are to be interested in Aramco they are going to want all sorts of details and reassurances about the way the company will be run, its growth prospects and dividend policies. Will the Saudi government be willing to provide these and relinquish control? \u201cThe company may have huge oil reserves but look at what happened when Petrobras (the Brazilian state oil group) was privatised. There was a total lack of understanding of free markets and the stock dived in value.\u201d",

The stores being shuttered account for a fraction of the company\u2019s 11,000 stores worldwide and less than 1% of its global revenue, but according to workers\u2019 group Making Change at Walmart, this announcement will affect 10,000 US employees.</p> <p>More than 95% of the stores set to be closed in the US are within 10 miles of another Walmart. The Bentonville, Arkansas, company said it is working to ensure that workers are placed in nearby locations.</p> <p>The store closures will start at the end of the month, and many closures will be of the company\u2019s Walmart Express stores: all 102 of them (out of the 154 locations to be shuttered in the US).</p> <p>In 2011, Walmart Express marked the retailer\u2019s first entry into the convenience store arena. The stores are about 12,000 square feet and sell essentials like toothpaste. But the concept never caught on as the stores served the same purpose as Walmart\u2019s larger Neighborhood Markets: fill-in trips and prescription pickups.</p> <p>The announcement comes three months after Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told investors that the world\u2019s largest retailer would review its fleet of stores with the goal of becoming more nimble in the face of increased competition from all fronts, including from online rival Amazon.com.</p> <p>\u201cActively managing our portfolio of assets is essential to maintaining a healthy business,\u201d McMillon said in a <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fnews.walmart.com%2Fnews-archive%2F2016%2F01%2F15%2Fwalmart-continues-sharpened-focus-on-portfolio-management&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHv7ITT1fAe3WCQAlWfb1D6rP8RXg\">statement</a>. \u201cClosing stores is never an easy decision.

Its global workforce is 2.2 million, 1.4 million in the US alone.</p> <p>Walmart has warned that its earnings for the fiscal year starting next month will be down as much as 12% as it invests further in online operations and pours money into improving customers\u2019 experience.</p> <p>Also covered in the closures are 23 Neighborhood Markets, 12 supercenters, seven stores in Puerto Rico, six discount stores and four Sam\u2019s Clubs.<br></p> <p>\u201cWhile it pretends to value its employees, the reality is, for Walmart, its workers are disposable,\u201d said Jess Levin, communications director for Making Change at Walmart (MCAW). \u201cSadly, these latest store closings could very well be just the beginning. This sends a chilling message to the company\u2019s hard-working employees that they could be next \u2013 and with no one standing up for them, that is no doubt the reality.\u201d<br></p> <p>In October of last year, Walmart issued a profit warning and cut its sales outlook for 2015. At the time, Charles Holley, Walmart\u2019s chief financial officer, said Walmart\u2019s plans to raise hourly wages accounted for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/14/walmart-profits-warning-cuts-sales-outlook-2015\">75% of the lower earnings target</a>. </p> <p>Earlier in 2015, Walmart announced it was raising wages for about half a million of its employees, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/19/walmart-to-raise-wages-half-a-million-workers\">paying them at least $9 an hour</a> \u2013 $1.75 above the federally mandated minimum wage. The company plans to further increase their pay to $10 an hour this year.</p> <p>While MCAW has lauded the pay hikes as a step in the right direction, the workers\u2019 group said it would continue to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/12/walmart-workers-protest-wages-fast-for-15-stolen-lunches\">fight for $15 an hour</a> and full-time schedules. </p> <p>\u201cNow more than ever, Walmart\u2019s workers must work together to change Walmart for the better. Clearly, the livelihoods of all Walmart employees depend on it,\u201d Levin said on Friday. </p> <p>Walmart will now focus in the US on supercenters, Neighborhood Markets, the e-commerce business and pickup services for shoppers.</p> <p>The retailer is closing 60 loss-making locations in Brazil, which account for 5% of sales in that market. Walmart, which operated 558 stores in Brazil before the closures, has struggled as the economy there has soured. Its Every Day Low price strategy has also not been able to break against heavy promotions from key rivals.</p> <p>The remaining 55 stores are spread elsewhere in Latin America.</p> <p>Walmart said that it\u2019s still sticking to its plan announced last year to open 50 to 60 supercenters, 85 to 95 Neighborhood Markets and seven to 10 Sam\u2019s Clubs in the US during the fiscal year that begins 1 February. Outside the US, Walmart plans to open 200 to 240 stores.</p> <p>The financial impact of the closures is expected to be 20 cents to 22 cents per diluted earnings per share from continuing operations with about 19 cents to 20 cents expected to affect the current fourth quarter. The company is expected to release fourth quarter and full year results on 18 February.</p> <p>Shares of Walmart Stores Inc. fell $1.12, or 1.7%, to 61.94 in morning trading.</p> <p><em>Associated Press contributed to this report.</em></p>",

The store closures will start at the end of the month, and many closures will be of the company\u2019s Walmart Express stores: all 102 of them (out of the 154 locations to be shuttered in the US). In 2011, Walmart Express marked the retailer\u2019s first entry into the convenience store arena. The stores are about 12,000 square feet and sell essentials like toothpaste. But the concept never caught on as the stores served the same purpose as Walmart\u2019s larger Neighborhood Markets: fill-in trips and prescription pickups. The announcement comes three months after Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told investors that the world\u2019s largest retailer would review its fleet of stores with the goal of becoming more nimble in the face of increased competition from all fronts, including from online rival Amazon.com. \u201cActively managing our portfolio of assets is essential to maintaining a healthy business,\u201d McMillon said in a statement. \u201cClosing stores is never an easy decision. But it is necessary to keep the company strong and positioned for the future.\u201d Walmart operates 4,500 in the US. Its global workforce is 2.2 million, 1.4 million in the US alone. Walmart has warned that its earnings for the fiscal year starting next month will be down as much as 12% as it invests further in online operations and pours money into improving customers\u2019 experience. Also covered in the closures are 23 Neighborhood Markets, 12 supercenters, seven stores in Puerto Rico, six discount stores and four Sam\u2019s Clubs. \u201cWhile it pretends to value its employees, the reality is, for Walmart, its workers are disposable,\u201d said Jess Levin, communications director for Making Change at Walmart (MCAW). \u201cSadly, these latest store closings could very well be just the beginning. This sends a chilling message to the company\u2019s hard-working employees that they could be next \u2013 and with no one standing up for them, that is no doubt the reality.\u201d In October of last year, Walmart issued a profit warning and cut its sales outlook for 2015. At the time, Charles Holley, Walmart\u2019s chief financial officer, said Walmart\u2019s plans to raise hourly wages accounted for 75% of the lower earnings target. Earlier in 2015, Walmart announced it was raising wages for about half a million of its employees, paying them at least $9 an hour \u2013 $1.75 above the federally mandated minimum wage. The company plans to further increase their pay to $10 an hour this year. While MCAW has lauded the pay hikes as a step in the right direction, the workers\u2019 group said it would continue to fight for $15 an hour and full-time schedules. \u201cNow more than ever, Walmart\u2019s workers must work together to change Walmart for the better. Clearly, the livelihoods of all Walmart employees depend on it,\u201d Levin said on Friday. Walmart will now focus in the US on supercenters, Neighborhood Markets, the e-commerce business and pickup services for shoppers. The retailer is closing 60 loss-making locations in Brazil, which account for 5% of sales in that market. Walmart, which operated 558 stores in Brazil before the closures, has struggled as the economy there has soured. Its Every Day Low price strategy has also not been able to break against heavy promotions from key rivals. The remaining 55 stores are spread elsewhere in Latin America. Walmart said that it\u2019s still sticking to its plan announced last year to open 50 to 60 supercenters, 85 to 95 Neighborhood Markets and seven to 10 Sam\u2019s Clubs in the US during the fiscal year that begins 1 February. Outside the US, Walmart plans to open 200 to 240 stores. The financial impact of the closures is expected to be 20 cents to 22 cents per diluted earnings per share from continuing operations with about 19 cents to 20 cents expected to affect the current fourth quarter. The company is expected to release fourth quarter and full year results on 18 February. Shares of Walmart Stores Inc. fell $1.12, or 1.7%, to 61.94 in morning trading.

The online giant\u2019s rise, after all, is blamed for laying waste to independent bookshops across the country.<br></p> <p>But Amazon is only among the latest, if largest, e-commerce players to take a stab at traditional retail after starting life online.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/05/amazon-book-store-seattle\">Amazon boldly goes where no internet bookseller has gone before: the real world</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the last few years, some 20 online companies in the US have launched a physical presence to better market their wares, forge closer customer relations, and yes, boost online traffic and sales. Amazon aside, these include mostly specialty and clothing stores such as Warby Parker, Bonobos, Birchbox and Casper.<br></p> <p>The trend also reflects the broader industry imperative around \u201comni-channel\u201d retailing, where merchants aim to provide customers with a seamless experience whether shopping online via desktop or mobile device or at a traditional retail store. <br></p> <p>Underscoring that point, the National Retail Federation\u2019s annual \u201cBig Show\u201d conference in New York earlier this month featured half a dozen sessions that included the term in their titles.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to launch a brand these days that\u2019s just online-only. It\u2019s an incredibly difficult and crowded e-commerce environment,\u201d said Sucharita Mulpuru, a retail analyst at Forrester Research. She noted there are more than 800,000 online stores, all vying to attract customers through the gateway of Google.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Online real estate has become crowded and expensive. Bidding on keywords against the likes of Amazon and large traditional retailers to land on the first page of search results is a costly game.<br></p> <p>Macy\u2019s and Nordstrom, for example, spent an estimated $6.4m and $4m, respectively, in paid search listings for the top 1,000 apparel-related keywords in the first quarter of 2015, according to a study this month from <a href=\"http://www.l2inc.com\">L2 Inc</a>, a research firm that tracks digital brands. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cClicks disproportionately go to the highest-placed search ads, with little room for differentiation,\u201d states the L2 report, which examines what it calls \u201cevolved retailers\u201d \u2013 online merchants that have opened brick and mortar storefronts.</p> <p>By opening physical stores, they aim to increase awareness and draw customers in a realm where the retail options aren\u2019t infinite or influenced by an all-powerful gatekeeper.

                "bodyText":"Remember when the future of retail was online? Now it seems that online retailers have decided they can\u2019t get by without bricks and mortar. Amazon raised eyebrows in November when it opened its first brick and mortar extension \u2013 a bookstore in Seattle\u2019s University Village. The online giant\u2019s rise, after all, is blamed for laying waste to independent bookshops across the country. But Amazon is only among the latest, if largest, e-commerce players to take a stab at traditional retail after starting life online. In the last few years, some 20 online companies in the US have launched a physical presence to better market their wares, forge closer customer relations, and yes, boost online traffic and sales. Amazon aside, these include mostly specialty and clothing stores such as Warby Parker, Bonobos, Birchbox and Casper. The trend also reflects the broader industry imperative around \u201comni-channel\u201d retailing, where merchants aim to provide customers with a seamless experience whether shopping online via desktop or mobile device or at a traditional retail store. Underscoring that point, the National Retail Federation\u2019s annual \u201cBig Show\u201d conference in New York earlier this month featured half a dozen sessions that included the term in their titles. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to launch a brand these days that\u2019s just online-only. It\u2019s an incredibly difficult and crowded e-commerce environment,\u201d said Sucharita Mulpuru, a retail analyst at Forrester Research. She noted there are more than 800,000 online stores, all vying to attract customers through the gateway of Google. Online real estate has become crowded and expensive. Bidding on keywords against the likes of Amazon and large traditional retailers to land on the first page of search results is a costly game. Macy\u2019s and Nordstrom, for example, spent an estimated $6.4m and $4m, respectively, in paid search listings for the top 1,000 apparel-related keywords in the first quarter of 2015, according to a study this month from L2 Inc, a research firm that tracks digital brands. \u201cClicks disproportionately go to the highest-placed search ads, with little room for differentiation,\u201d states the L2 report, which examines what it calls \u201cevolved retailers\u201d \u2013 online merchants that have opened brick and mortar storefronts. By opening physical stores, they aim to increase awareness and draw customers in a realm where the retail options aren\u2019t infinite or influenced by an all-powerful gatekeeper. And for purveyors of tactile and personal products like clothing, eyewear and jewelry, selling stuff in person has an obvious appeal. For many, the offline foray has started with a trial pop-up shop before launching flagship stores in high-profile shopping districts like New York\u2019s SoHo neighborhood or Chicago\u2019s Michigan Avenue. Encouraged by the results, some have since expanded quickly. \u201cThe big benefit of the flagship stores is that they\u2019re terrific marketing vehicles,\u201d said Jason Goldberg, senior vice-president of commerce and content at digital agency Razorfish. \u201cNot only do those stores tend to be economically successful on their own but they generate a huge lift in incremental shopping to the online store.\u201d That\u2019s been the case for Warby Parker, which has created a popular brand by selling stylish eyeglass frames for under $100. After starting online in 2010, it opened its Soho flagship three years later and now has 20 stores nationwide, with plans to add another 20 this year. Co-founder and co-chief executive Dave Gilboa said Warby Parker stores that have been open at least two years are already profitable. \u201cWe also see a halo effect where stores themselves become a great generator of awareness for our brand and drive a lot of traffic to our website, as well and accelerate our e-commerce sales,\u201d he added. Gilboa declined to disclose actual sales figures but the company\u2019s rapid ascent hasn\u2019t been lost on investors. T Rowe Price last spring led a $100m round of funding in Warby Parker at a reported $1.2bn valuation, making it a so-called unicorn. While someone can leave a Warby Parker store sporting a new pair of glasses, other e-tailers have opened what are essentially showrooms. This approach allows customers to size and sample products while minimizing real estate and other traditional retail costs. Among the best-known brands adopting this model is menswear shop Bonobos.
