Its economy is slowing as it transitions from investment and manufacturing to consumption and services. But the global spillovers from China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reduced rate of growth, through its diminished imports and lower demand for commodities, have been much larger than we would have anticipated. Serious challenges to restructuring remain in terms of state-owned enterprise balance sheet weaknesses, the financial markets, and the general flexibility and rationality of resource allocation. Growth below the authorities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 official targets could again spook global financial markets\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut then again, time-honored methods of enforcing growth targets could simply extend economic imbalances, spelling possible trouble down the road. </p> </blockquote> <p>On how 2015 turned out:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There was good news and bad news. The U.S. economy continued its solid growth and job creation, while Europe generally picked up speed and Japan remained a question mark. But with some exceptions (such as India), emerging and developing countries continued to slow in the face of falling commodity prices and tighter financial conditions, and synchronized and sustainable global growth remained elusive.</p> </blockquote> <p>The comments follow a prediction from IMF head Christine Lagarde last week that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/30/imf-chief-christine-lagarde-disappointing-global-growth-economy-2016\">global growth will be disappointing this year</a> as the prospect of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/16/federal-reserve-us-interest-rate-rise-fed-funds-janet-yellen\">rising interest rates in the US</a> and a further <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/19/slowing-growth-china-commodities-global-economy\">slowdown in China</a> feed into uncertainty around the world.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-568a8d2ce4b03b24c8fe0ee2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-04T15:28:57.672Z\">3.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Separate date from the <strong>US construction sector</strong> also strikes a downbeat tone.</p> <p>The Commerce Department said construction spending fell for the first time in nearly 1-1/2 years in November.

This marks a disappointing end for what was a difficult year for the manufacturing sector given external growth concerns and sterling strength. Looking at the details, Markit said that input prices continued to fall sharply in December, which they attribute to lower commodity prices (principally oil). Furthermore, export orders continued to grow, albeit at a slower pace.</p> <p>All in all, this suggests that the manufacturing sector contributed very little to fourth quarter GDP growth (released at the end of this month), although it is worth noting that manufacturing only forms around 10% of the UK economy (versus 30% in the late 1970s). The service sector, which makes up over three quarters, is performing better and we should get a further indication of this on Wednesday when the services PMI is released.</p> <p>Overall, the economy remains strong and the case for a rate hike in 2016 looks very compelling. Although we continue to forecast a hike in the second quarter, the risks surrounding the EU referendum are beginning to build and the probability that the Bank of England will leave rates lower for a longer period of time is increasing.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-568a40cde4b03051a013845e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-04T09:54:53.793Z\">9.54am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Despite the disappointing UK manufacturing figures, Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said there could be a pickup in GDP growth in the fourth quarter:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Despite December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dip, the purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 survey does show overall improvement in the fourth quarter of 2015; and it does look possible that the manufacturing sector managed to eke out a modicum of growth in the fourth quarter after contracting in both the third (by 0.4% quarter-on-quarter) and second quarters (by 0.6%). In fact the manufacturing PMI averaged 53.3 in the fourth quarter, which was markedly above the third quarter average of 51.8 and clearly above the 50.0 level indicates flat activity. Meanwhile, although latest hard data show that manufacturing output dipped 0.4% month-on-month in October this followed increases in both September (0.9%) and August (0.3%) so it was actually up 0.4% on a three-month/three-month basis.</p> <p>If the manufacturing sector did manage to eke out some growth in the fourth quarter, it would boost the chances that the economy managed to achieve some pick-up in GDP growth after it dipped to 0.4% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter. We have pencilled in GDP growth of 0.6% quarter-on quarter in the fourth quarter of 2015. </p> <p>Even if the manufacturing sector did manage to eke out some growth in the fourth quarter, 2015 was undoubtedly a torrid year for manufacturers. </p> <p>Furthermore, the pretty lacklustre December PMI suggest that 2016 is also likely to be challenging for manufacturers.

In addition, a weak euro is boosting Eurozone manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 competitiveness in international markets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so they will be hoping that the euro does not rise any further after firming to be currently trade close to $1.09 from a seven-month low of $1.055 earlier in December. Meanwhile, the fundamentals look reasonably solid for consumer spending in the eurozone which should be supportive to demand for durable manufactured goods. Consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 purchasing power is getting a serious boost from very low inflation/deflation across all countries while labour markets have generally improved. Indeed, it is notable that the European Commission reported that consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 perception of whether it is a good time to make major purchases now and during the next 12 months in November were only just below September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s respective strongest levels since September 2001 and February 2008.</p> <p>Nevertheless, there are still appreciable challenges facing Eurozone manufacturers. Foreign orders are being hampered by mediocre global growth, most notably the slowdown in China and emerging markets.

                "bodyText":"So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a not-so-happy new year start on stock markets. Any investors hoping 2016 would bring some fresh market forces will have been spooked by a very familiar pattern today, as weak manufacturing data from China again provided much of the (downward) momentum. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a closing summary of the first trading day of 2016. The FTSE 100 lost 2.4%, its worst opening day to a new year since 2000 and the second-worst on record The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 lost 2.8% and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax lost 4.3%, its weakest start to a trading year in the history of the index On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average has sold off sharply (down 2.4% at the time of the London close) and could end up setting its own multi-decade record: if the losses stay this deep, it will be the worst start to a year since 1932 Brent crude has lost earlier gains made on the back of tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Having rallied more than 4%, it is now down 0.9% at $36.9 per barrel In China, shares were suspended after a drop of 7% activated \u00e2\u20ac\u0153circuit breakers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on their very first day. The Chinese sell-off came as a closely watched survey of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vast manufacturing sector showed it shrank for a tenth month running US manufacturing reports were weaker and construction spending data pointed to a muted finish to 2015 for the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest economy Manufacturing surveys from the eurozone were more upbeat The latest UK manufacturing PMI showed Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories grew at a slower pace in December while consumers continued to prop up the recovery with debt-fuelled spending as figures showed the fastest growth in net lending since 2006 The IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new chief economist, Maury Obstfeld, said he was putting China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s transitioning economy high on his watchlist for 2016 Sweden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank moved a step closer to intervening in currency markets to weaken the crown That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Thanks for reading and the comments, we will be back early tomorrow with more rolling coverage from global markets. Time for a round-up of European stock markets at the close and on many exchanges it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clearly been the worst start to the year for many years. The FTSE 100 has lost almost 2.4% on the first day of trading in 2016, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a drop of 149 points to 6093. The bluechip index is now at its lowest since 22 December and today marked the biggest one-day drop since a 2.5% fall on 28 September 2015. It is also the second worst opening day on record, says RBS. Here is how markets stand around Europe: France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC 40 down 3% FTSE Eurofirst 300 down 2.8% Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax down 4.5% FTSE 100 down 2.4% Those falls follows a plunge in Chinese shares - the worst ever start to a year for the Shanghai Composite index - which saw trading there halted. Over on Wall Street, things are not looking much better and the Dow Jones industrial average is down 2.4% while the S&amp;P 500 is down 2.3%. Just when you thought it might be safe to bet on a rising oil price, Brent crude has turned negative. It had rallied to a session high of $38.99 a barrel earlier on the back of predictions supply could be hit by tensions between Iran and Saudia Arabia. But the price fell back on worries about slower demand after news of a further factory slowdown in China and releases from the US showing its construction and manufacturing sectors had lost steam. Brent crude is currently down 0.9% or 31 cents at $36.97 a barrel. Meanwhile, former Bank of England policymaker David Blanchflower has been scouring the skies for omens.... Sweden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has come a step closer to intervening in currency markets to weaken the crown, which it worries is keeping inflation from rising back to more normal levels. Against the backdrop of negative interest rates, a quantitative easing programme and a Swedish inflation rate in negative territory at -0.1%, the Riksbank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governor Stefan Ingves said last week the central bank was ready to start currency interventions to stop the crown from strengthening. Today the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy-setting board said in a statement it has voted to give the governor the power to intervene immediately in the currency market. The decision at an extraordinary meeting of the six-member board means the central bank will be able to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153instantly intervene on the foreign exchange market if necessary, as a complementary monetary policy measure, to safeguard the rise in inflation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The statement adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Since the last monetary policy meeting in mid-December, the Swedish krona has appreciated against most other currencies. If this development were to continue, it could jeopardise the ongoing upturn in inflation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The crown weakened against the euro and the dollar after the announcement. With global downturn fears prompting such a rocky start to the new year for global markets, what perfect timing for the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new economist to share his predictions for 2016. Maury Obstfeld has put China and its slowing economy high on his watchlist for 2016. He also highlights \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the crisis of refugees fleeing Iraq and Syria\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, climate change and international trade\u00e2\u20ac\u201d \u00e2\u20ac\u0153which has had setbacks in recent years\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Obstfeld says, citing the effective end of the Doha trade round. Obstfeld, former chair of the economics department at University of California at Berkeley, joined the International Monetary Fund in September to succeed Olivier Blanchard. Shortly before the start of the new year, IMF Survey magazine interviewed Obstfeld and has just published the chief economist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s views online. Here are some extracts: On key issues to watch in 2016: China will remain high on the list. Its economy is slowing as it transitions from investment and manufacturing to consumption and services. But the global spillovers from China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reduced rate of growth, through its diminished imports and lower demand for commodities, have been much larger than we would have anticipated. Serious challenges to restructuring remain in terms of state-owned enterprise balance sheet weaknesses, the financial markets, and the general flexibility and rationality of resource allocation. Growth below the authorities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 official targets could again spook global financial markets\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut then again, time-honored methods of enforcing growth targets could simply extend economic imbalances, spelling possible trouble down the road. On how 2015 turned out: There was good news and bad news. The U.S. economy continued its solid growth and job creation, while Europe generally picked up speed and Japan remained a question mark. But with some exceptions (such as India), emerging and developing countries continued to slow in the face of falling commodity prices and tighter financial conditions, and synchronized and sustainable global growth remained elusive. The comments follow a prediction from IMF head Christine Lagarde last week that global growth will be disappointing this year as the prospect of rising interest rates in the US and a further slowdown in China feed into uncertainty around the world. Separate date from the US construction sector also strikes a downbeat tone. The Commerce Department said construction spending fell for the first time in nearly 1-1/2 years in November. Spending fell 0.4% after a downwardly revised 0.3% rise in October. As Reuters reports, the government revised construction data from January 2005 through October 2015 because of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153processing error in the tabulation of data\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The revisions, which showed construction spending was not as strong as previously reported for much of 2015, could prompt economists to lower their fourth-quarter gross domestic product estimates. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending rising 0.6% in November after a previously reported 1.0% increase in October. Unsurprisingly, this trio of disappointing releases is prompting questions over why the US Federal Reserve thought December was the right time to raise interest rates - the first increase for almost a decade. Meanwhile, US stock markets have sold off further, with the Dow Jones industrial average down more than 2.3% at one point in its biggest one-day fall for more than four months. The Dow Jones is now down 2%, the S&amp;P 500 is down 2.1% and the Nasdaq is down 2.7%. Hot on the heels of that weaker Markit PMI report on US manufacturers comes the separate Institute for Supply Management report and it makes even gloomier reading, suggesting the sector shrank again in December. The main activity index fell to 48.2 in December from 48.6 in November, confounding forecasts for a pick-up to 49.0 in a Reuters poll of economists. As with Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI reports, a reading above 50 signals expansion, a reading below suggest contraction. The new orders index in the ISM report edged up to 49.2 from 48.9 in November, but was still below the all-important 50-mark. More details on that weaker Markit U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Index: The authors note the latest reading (51.2 in December) was much weaker than the survey average (54.2) and pointed to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153only a marginal upturn in operating conditions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The report also shows output slowed in December and that input costs declined again. On new orders (which expanded at the weakest pace since September 2009), Markit said there was anecdotal evidence of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153softer underlying demand conditions, intense competition for new work and subdued business confidence among clients\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, while export sales were also close to stagnation in December, with manufacturers noting that the strong dollar continued to act as a drag on demand from abroad. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The manufacturing sector saw a disappointing end to 2015, and its plight looks set to continue into the New Year as headwinds show no sign of abating any time soon. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Order book growth has stalled as producers report some of the toughest trading conditions since the end of the global financial crisis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The strong dollar is hurting exporters as well as hitting domestic sales as firms compete against inflows of cheap imports. Low oil prices are meanwhile hitting demand for goods and machinery from the energy sector. There are signs that consumers are becoming more cautious in relation to spending as interest rates lift off their historic lows, and overseas demand remains in the doldrums. All of these factors look set to continue to hurt manufacturers, and even intensify, in coming months. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, with the Fed stressing that the trajectory of interest rates will be data dependent, any extended period of weakness at least suggests that the rate hiking process will be very gradual.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The US manufacturing sector grew at a slower pace in December, expanding at the weakest pace for more than three years, according to the latest PMI report from the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest economy. The survey by data company Markit also pointed to a slowdown in orders, with the weakest reading since during the financial crisis in September 2009. The headline index for manufacturing came in at 51.2 for December, down from an inital estimate of 51.3 and from 52.8 in November. That was above the 50-mark that separates expansion from contraction but the weakest reading since October 2012. The report follows a flurry of manufacturing surveys from around the world. The picture was particularly weak in China, where the factory sector shrank for a 10th month running. Reports from Europe were slightly brighter with eurozone manufacturing activity picking up in December while in the UK, manufacturing continued to grow but at a slower pace. Ahead of the latest US manufacturing data, American markets have joined in the global rout prompted by weak Chinese figures earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has slumped 350 points or 2% in early trading, while Nasdaq is 2.2% lower and the S&amp;P 500 is off 1.2%. With the FTSE 100 down 2.3%, here are the major movers. With commodity prices falling on renewed fears of a Chinese slowdown, it is no surprise that mining shares are among the biggest fallers. Standard Chartered is also down due to its exposure to emerging markets, and commodity company lending. An exception to the mining slide is Randgold Resources, lifted by a rise in the gold price as investors seek a haven for their cash: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax, now down 4.1%, has seen a broad based fall with the best performers being companies recording, not an increase, but the smallest declines: Danny Blanchflower, former member of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee: German inflation figures are one positive in a flurry of negative news, according to Carsten Brzeski at ING Bank: With these December data, the year 2015 marks the lowest average annual inflation rate in Germany since the start of the monetary union. Looking at the available components at the regional levels shows that the drop in headline inflation was not only driven by lower energy prices but also some tentative second-round effects on consumer goods and probably first discounts in the Christmas sale season. Looking ahead, it should take at least until the second half of the year before German headline inflation at least crosses the 1%-threshold again. With the continued slump in energy prices, further second-round effects on other goods and only little pricing power from retailers and producer, it is hard to see a strong acceleration of German inflation any time soon. Even the strong labour market and latest wage increases have done little to push up \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at least \u00e2\u20ac\u201c core inflation. All of this means that German consumers are currently enjoying the best of both worlds: a strong labour market with decent wage increases and low inflation. The perfect combination for an improvement of German consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 purchasing power and hence private consumption. Looking at other deja-vus at the start of the New Year, like new tensions in the Middle-East, tumbling Chinese stock markets and new problems with structural reforms in Greece, at least German inflation data provide one comforting and positive signal for 2016 today. German inflation figures have come in slightly weaker than expected in December: The harmonised figures have been brought in line with other European countries. Apart from the weak data, there is another reason for the slump in Chinese shares, according to Mark Dampier, head of investment research at Hargreaves Lansdown: Contrary to reports, the fall in the Chinese stock market has little to do with the December PMI data coming in at 49.7 against a consensus of 49.8. It has far more to do with worries that major shareholders will reduce their positions after the ban of share sales and short selling which came in at the end of trading on Friday. The slide in global markets is getting worse. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax, now down 4.3% is heading for its biggest daily fall since August last year following the global market rout in the wake of renewed worries about the Chinese economy. Germany of course is a major exporter and likely to be hard hit by any slowdown. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac is 2.8% lower while in London, the FTSE 100 has now dropped 162 points or 2.6%, on course for its worst daily performance since September. It looks like the global share sell-off which has followed the weak Chinese data will extend to US markets: Daniel Vernazza, lead UK economist at UniCredit Research, said: With economic growth slowing and consumer credit growth rising fast, the risk to our forecast for the first Bank of England hike to come in May this year is that they delay further and try to use macroprudential policy as the first line of defence against risks to financial stability. The weakness in UK manufacturing activity is explained by a number of headwinds facing UK manufacturers. First, sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s past appreciation is still weighing on the competitiveness of UK manufacturers. Second, external demand remains subdued, particularly in emerging markets. Earlier today, Caixin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s China manufacturing PMI surprisingly fell back to 48.2 in December from 48.6 in the prior month; and the new export orders sub-component fell sharply from 51.6 to 47.8, suggesting weak external demand. On the UK manufacturing data, economist Malcolm Barr at JP Morgan said: The December manufacturing PMI release was a modest disappointment, with the headline index nudging down to 51.9 (J.P. Morgan 52.5) from a revised 52.5 in November (previously reported as 52.7). Having stepped down in late 2014 the PMI has been in a range between 51.5 (the survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long run average) and 54 for nearly all of 2015. The data increasingly make the move up in activity in to 55.2 in October look like it was a blip. The pound has hit a nine month low against the dollar, as weakness in the economy cast doubt over an imminent UK rate rise and worries grew over the impact of any departure from the European Union. Sterling was down to $1.4684, its lowest since April, and is currently at $1.4795. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a nice graphic showing how China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CS! 300 suffered major falls last year. And the new year is already on the way to a similar performance. The grim start to the new year means some \u00c2\u00a334bn has been wiped off the value of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top one hundred companies with the FTSE 100 down 133 points. Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, said: Anyone hitting the trading floor expecting a calm and quiet start to 2016 was given a rude surprise as Asian chaos affected European markets. Worries over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to keep up its pace of economic growth have been hit with an early warning sign as the Caixin PMI data came in weaker than expected, and stretched the contraction in China to ten months. This swift return to the 2015 template of worrying about China looks to have been the trigger for the selloff in Chinese equities. It is the first time Chinese regulators have activated the suspension in trading as a circuit breaker safety measure. Starting the year off by suspending trading an hour and a half early on the back of a 7% fall has set an ugly precedent for the year ahead. Tensions in the Middle East have escalated again as the relationship between Saudi Arabia and Iran is being stretched to breaking point. Considering the prominence both nations take as far as global oil supply is concerned, the subsequent spike in oil prices is, if anything, a little on the mild side. An interest rate rise is still on the cards this year, even though the manufacturing sector has come in weaker than expected, according to ING Bank. However any increase in borrowing costs may now come later than forecasters currently believe, said ING\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s James Smith: The UK manufacturing PMI fell unexpectedly to 51.9 in December, from 52.7 previously (consensus 52.8), consistent with levels seen through most of 2015 before the surprise uplift in October. This marks a disappointing end for what was a difficult year for the manufacturing sector given external growth concerns and sterling strength. Looking at the details, Markit said that input prices continued to fall sharply in December, which they attribute to lower commodity prices (principally oil). Furthermore, export orders continued to grow, albeit at a slower pace. All in all, this suggests that the manufacturing sector contributed very little to fourth quarter GDP growth (released at the end of this month), although it is worth noting that manufacturing only forms around 10% of the UK economy (versus 30% in the late 1970s). The service sector, which makes up over three quarters, is performing better and we should get a further indication of this on Wednesday when the services PMI is released. Overall, the economy remains strong and the case for a rate hike in 2016 looks very compelling. Although we continue to forecast a hike in the second quarter, the risks surrounding the EU referendum are beginning to build and the probability that the Bank of England will leave rates lower for a longer period of time is increasing. Despite the disappointing UK manufacturing figures, Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said there could be a pickup in GDP growth in the fourth quarter: Despite December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dip, the purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 survey does show overall improvement in the fourth quarter of 2015; and it does look possible that the manufacturing sector managed to eke out a modicum of growth in the fourth quarter after contracting in both the third (by 0.4% quarter-on-quarter) and second quarters (by 0.6%). In fact the manufacturing PMI averaged 53.3 in the fourth quarter, which was markedly above the third quarter average of 51.8 and clearly above the 50.0 level indicates flat activity. Meanwhile, although latest hard data show that manufacturing output dipped 0.4% month-on-month in October this followed increases in both September (0.9%) and August (0.3%) so it was actually up 0.4% on a three-month/three-month basis. If the manufacturing sector did manage to eke out some growth in the fourth quarter, it would boost the chances that the economy managed to achieve some pick-up in GDP growth after it dipped to 0.4% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter. We have pencilled in GDP growth of 0.6% quarter-on quarter in the fourth quarter of 2015. Even if the manufacturing sector did manage to eke out some growth in the fourth quarter, 2015 was undoubtedly a torrid year for manufacturers. Furthermore, the pretty lacklustre December PMI suggest that 2016 is also likely to be challenging for manufacturers. Indeed, the breakdown of the December purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 survey shows new orders growth matching July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lowest level for 2015, with export orders only inching up. Furthermore, backlogs of work contracted markedly. Meanwhile, more signs of a buoyant UK housing market and confident consumers, with higher than expected lending figures. Reuters reports: British lending to consumers expanded at the fastest annual rate in almost a decade in November and banks approved more mortgages than forecast, showing a buoyant mood among households towards the end of 2015. The Bank of England said net lending to consumers in November was up 8.3 percent compared with a year earlier, the biggest such increase since February 2006 and a growth rate that may raise concern at the Bank about lending standards. Lenders also granted more home loans than expected, with 70,410 mortgages for house purchase approved, the highest number in three months. The figures add to signs that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing market is accelerating after a dip in mid-2014 when tighter rules on mortgage lending took effect, requiring banks and building societies to make more rigorous checks on whether borrowers can afford their loans. Here are the key charts for the disappointing UK manufacturing data: The manufacturing data is more bad news for chancellor George Osborne, and his chances of hitting his Autumn Statement targets. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit said: The UK manufacturing sector ended 2015 on a disappointing note, with its rate of growth slowing further from October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent high back down towards the stagnation mark. This suggests that industry will make, at best, only a marginal positive contribution to broader economic growth in the final quarter of the year. Although this would be an improvement on the second and third quarters, it does also suggest that manufacturing output over 2015 as a whole may be below the level achieved in 2014. With the latest revisions to official data also suggesting that GDP growth earlier in the year was softer than previously thought, the emphasis has really shifted to other sectors of the economy if the rate of expansion for the year as a whole is to come in close to the OBR forecast as outlined in the Autumn Statement. And after the positive eurozone figures, the UK purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index has come in below expectations, recording its slowest growth in three months. The index fell from 52.5 in November to 51.9 last month, below expectations of a figure of 52.7. New orders came in at their slowest pace for five years, according to the Markit survey. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story on the rising oil price: Economist Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight said: The improved Eurozone manufacturing survey for December supports hopes that Eurozone growth picked up to at least 0.4% quarter-on-quarter in the in the fourth quarter of 2014 after dipping to 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter from 0.4% in the second and a peak of 0.5% in the first quarter. Eurozone manufacturers are currently getting appreciable help from very low oil and commodity prices which is boosting their ability to price competitively to win business. In addition, a weak euro is boosting Eurozone manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 competitiveness in international markets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so they will be hoping that the euro does not rise any further after firming to be currently trade close to $1.09 from a seven-month low of $1.055 earlier in December. Meanwhile, the fundamentals look reasonably solid for consumer spending in the eurozone which should be supportive to demand for durable manufactured goods. Consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 purchasing power is getting a serious boost from very low inflation/deflation across all countries while labour markets have generally improved. Indeed, it is notable that the European Commission reported that consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 perception of whether it is a good time to make major purchases now and during the next 12 months in November were only just below September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s respective strongest levels since September 2001 and February 2008. Nevertheless, there are still appreciable challenges facing Eurozone manufacturers. Foreign orders are being hampered by mediocre global growth, most notably the slowdown in China and emerging markets. Eurozone manufacturers will also be wary that the current uncertain global growth outlook could lead to increased business caution over investment and the purchase of capital goods. Commenting on the eurozone PMI figure, Markit said: The eurozone manufacturing sector continued to make solid progress at the end of 2015, as rates of growth in production, new orders and new export business all improved. Although input costs and output charges fell again, trends in both provided further evidence of deflationary pressures easing. With the Greek PMI edging back above 50.0, December saw PMI readings in all of the nations covered at levels signalling expansion for the first time since April 2014. Italy remained the fastest- growing, with its rate of expansion improving to a 57- month record. \u00ef\u201a\u00a7 So the overall picture for eurozone manufacturing has shown an improvement. The purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index for the eurozone came in at 53.2 in December, according to Markit. This compares to the 53.1 initial estimate, and the 52.8 recorded in November. And Greek manufacturing has also shown an improvement: Markit said: Greek manufacturers reported a slight improvement in operating conditions in December, ending a sequence of deterioration which began in September 2014. The upturn in manufacturing was driven by higher production, which returned to expansionary territory for the first time in 12 months. Encouragingly, a slight increase in staff numbers was also reported. The German manufacturing sector has recorded its best performance for four months, according to the PMI survey. The Markit index rose from 52.9 in November to 53.2 last month, and economist Oliver Kolodseike said: Reflective of the trend observed throughout 2015, the Germany Manufacturing PMI posted above the no- change mark of 50.0 in December, thereby signalling sustained growth in the sector. New order intakes continued to grow at a healthy rate, with demand for consumer goods particularly strong and exports showing the largest monthly rise since February 2014. However, the strong rise in new business resulted in capacity problems at some plants, with business outstanding rising at the sharpest rate for nearly two years. It is therefore likely that employment and output will continue to increase in coming months. Downward pressure on inflation meanwhile persisted at the year end, as the recent falls in energy and oil prices led to a further sharp drop in manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 input costs. Meanwhile in France the purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index hit a 21 month high, according to Markit. The index climbed to 51.4 in December from 50.6 the previous month, its highest level since March 2014. A strong performance in December meant Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector ended 2015 by growing at the fastest rate since early 2011. The Markit PMI index came in at 55.6 in December, up from 54.9 the previous month and the best reading since March 2011. There was a sharp and accelerated increase in production levels at manufacturers. Markit economist Phil Smith said: The headline PMI maintained its recent ascent in December, moving to its highest level since March 2011. This completes what is a drastic turnaround from the situation just one year ago when the index was languishing below the 50.0 mark as the economy contracted. Since then, a weak euro, recovering domestic demand and falling global commodity prices have provided the necessary tailwinds to get things moving. The goods-producing sector has solid momentum heading into the New Year, with new order growth accelerating and companies taking on new staff to cope with rising production requirements. The weak Chinese data has, inevitably, hit metal prices on concerns about a slowdown in demand. And that in turn has meant shares in mining companies are among the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest fallers so far, with Anglo American down 5%, Glencore 4% lower and Antofagasta off 3%. Spanish manufacturing activity was virtually unchanged in December, but both output and new orders rose at sharper rates than in November. The Markit purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index came in at 53 last month, down from 53.1 in November and slightly below forecasts. Markit senior economist Andrew Harker said: The latest Spanish manufacturing PMI data signalled a solid end to 2015 for the sector as growth rates for output and new orders continued to accelerate following a brief slowdown around the end of the third quarter. The rate of job creation remained weak, however, with companies perhaps cautious about making decisions on hiring and investment ahead of the election on December 20 (the data were all collected prior to the election) and subsequent results. With the FTSE 100 now down around 2%, market analyst Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct said: It might be a new year as far as the calendar is concerned, but the market seems unwilling to be taking a fresh view. Disappointing manufacturing data out of China overnight resulted in such a marked fall for domestic stocks that trading was suspended in Shanghai for the remainder of the session, so there can be no surprise that many of the mining stocks in London have once again been left wearing more than their fair share of losses in early trade in what is by all accounts a sea of red numbers. One notable exception here is Randgold Resources \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the equity slump in China is driving gold prices sharply higher, leaving the stock as the only winner a few minutes into the day. A degree of volatility was probably to be expected this morning as normal trading conditions resume, but it appears that the big sell-off is being driven largely by the overnight news out of Asia, rather than any New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hangover of the so-called Santa rally we saw start less than two weeks ago. With further tensions in the Middle East, notably between Saudi Arabia and Iran after the execution of the Saudi Shia cleric Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, crude prices have edged higher. Brent crude is currently up 0.7% at $37.57 a barrel, and would probably have been higher if not for the weak Chinese data. In the wake of the Chinese data disappointment, European markets have opened sharply lower. The FTSE 100 has fallen 87 points or 1.4%, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has dropped 2.8% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac is down 1.2% and Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex has lost 1.3%. But bear in mind that while the FTSE 100 lost 4.9% in 2015, both the Dax and the Cac moved higher, up 9.8% and 8.5% respectively, putting these latest moves in context. More on Chinese manufacturing: Ahead of the UK PMI figures, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a preview from Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight: The manufacturing purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 survey (out on Monday) is likely to show modest overall expansion in December, although it is unclear to what extent activity may have been affected by the flooding. Specifically, we expect the manufacturing purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index (PMI) to have edged back further to 52.5 in December after dipping to 52.7 in November from 55.2 in October (which had been the best performance since June 2014 and a sharp improvement from 51.7 in September). Even so, this would result in the PMI averaging 53.5 in the fourth quarter, which would be markedly above the third quarter average of 51.8 and clearly above the 50.0 level indicates flat activity. UK mortgage approvals and consumer credit figures are also due to be released. The weak Chinese data and the subsequent plunge on the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets is likely to have a negative impact on European shares: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good day for data junkies, with snapshots of December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing figures from the UK, US and Europe. But as traders return to their desks for the first full week after the festive period, things have got off to a bad start. After weak manufacturing figures last week from China, a private survey on Monday showed factory activity contracting for the tenth month in a row. The Caixin/Markit PMI fell to 48.2 in December, down from November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading of 48.6 and below expectations of a figure of 49. Anything below 50 signals contraction. The disappointment led to weakness in the yuan, and prompted a 7% fall in the blue chip CSI300 index, before circuit breakers kicked in to halt stock market trading. This was the first time they had been used to curb market volatility. The poor manufacturing data could well lead Chinese authorities to bring in further stimulus measures to help boost the flagging economy. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest PMI data implies more stimulus may be required in 2016. The surprise monthly drop in the Caixin report comes off the back of the official manufacturing PMI that saw factory activity shrink for the fifth month in December with a reading of 49.7, up slightly from November. A big swing factor for this coming year will be whether Beijing makes better use of its ability to stabilise the Chinese economy. The government has been walking a tightrope of growth stabilisation and economic reform. The way Chinese authorities lean in 2016 could determine whether market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s have a good year or not.

                "bodyText":"It was not as turbulent a day as Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout, but stock markets still suffered another volatile session. Weak Chinese data and a halt in share trading sent investors running for cover on the first trading day of the year, and while a subsequent attempt by the Chinese central bank to stablise shares did manage to calm things for a while, the mood was still skittish. Commodity companies - hit hard on Monday by concerns about slowing growth in China - recovered some ground and gave support to markets, the FTSE 100 in particular. But an uncertain opening on Wall Street took off some of the shine. Oil prices were weak again, as fears of falling demand outweighed supply concerns in the wake of growing Middle East tensions. Brent crude is currently 2% lower at $36.47 a barrel. More Chinese news due overnight could set the tone for Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s markets. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct said: There is more PMI data [for the service sector] out of China overnight that could again unsettle sentiment, whilst the US ADP payroll number tomorrow will start to offer some clues ahead of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non farm payrolls. Although the US has made that first step up the interest rate ladder, the question now is the pace of change and again anything that looks too hasty could see the bears back in play. Overall the final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 43.81 points or 0.72% at 6137.24, having risen as high as 6166 and fallen as low as 6079. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax edged up 0.26% to 10,310.10 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 0.34% to 4537.63 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB added 1.2% to 20,983.24 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.24% at 9335.2 But in Greece, the Athens market lost 0.57% to 617.59 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 89 points or 0.5%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow for the latest services PMI data and other financial developments. Sterling fell to a nine month low against the dollar, down half a percent as the US currency continued to gain ground. But the pound edged up a similar amount against the euro following eurozone inflation figures which suggested no rush for the European Central Bank to sanction further stimulus measures. Strong UK construction figures vied with the uncertainty of a possible Brexit from Europe to influence the direction of the pound during the day. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something from Bloomberg showing that - despite this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s falls - the Chinese market is still expensive: Given the backdrop of disappointing Chinese data and growing tensions in the Middle East, this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US main economic events - the minutes of the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate-rising meeting and Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm payroll figures - will be closely watched. Christopher Vecchio, currency analyst at DailyFX, said: Weak economic data from across the globe - particularly China and the Euro-Zone - has the US dollar on stronger footing ahead of key event risk this week. Despite some alarming signs coming from the US economy (soft consumption figures, mixed housing data, and recession-level industrial production), investors and traders alike remain focused on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe big picture\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: how fast will the Federal Reserve tighten policy this year? With the December Federal Open Market Committee minutes due on Wednesday and the December US non-farm payrolls report due on Friday, market participants - short- or long-term in nature alike - will have a fresh look at where the Fed stands... Parsing the FOMC minutes and reviewing the details of the December labor reports should help provide enough clarity for judgement to be made on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153who is wrong\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: either the market, currently pricing in two rates hikes for this year (via Fed funds futures); or the Fed, currently suggesting it will hike rates four times this year. In the event that the FOMC meeting and the US non-farm payrolls prove to be supportive of the US dollar, it will likely come at the detriment of higher yielding currencies and risk-correlated assets. Any signs that the Fed could tighten policy faster than currently expected, against a backdrop of rising tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia as well as Chinese/emerging market growth concerns, would seem like a caustic mix of influences for the commodity currency bloc in particular. Wall Street has followed other global markets in attempting to stage a rebound after Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s China-induced rout. But as in Europe, the rally is rather tentative. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 42 points or 0.2% in early trading, while the S&amp;P 500 has opened 0.16% better and Nasdaq is 0.3% higher. In Europe, the FTSE 100 is currently up 0.79% while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has added 0.33% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.48%. Oil prices remain under pressure, on fears of falling demand in the wake of the poor Chinese data seen over the past few days. A stronger US dollar is not helping matters, since it makes holding dollar-denominated commodities more expensive. These factors are outweighing the growing tensions in the Middle East - especially between Saudi Arabia and Iran - which could hinder supply. So Brent crude is currently down 1.2% at $36.77 a barrel, while WTI is nearly 1% lower at $36.40. Accountancy group ICAEW reckons that British businesses are actually more worried about the domestic situation, rather than problems in China. A survey of its members found that the the UK economy is the number one concern for 2016. However, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re less concerned about the eurozone economy, geopolitics, or the looming referendum on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s membership of the European Union. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the details: 41% of businesses feel that the growing uncertainty around the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position in the EU could have a negative impact, compared with 50% a year ago Businesses are less concerned about the negative impact of low economic growth in the Eurozone than they were two years ago (44% v 56% in 2014). Although exporters are displaying the same concern than they did last year, with 60% expecting a negative impact. Low UK inflation is expected to have a positive impact on over a third of companies (36%) but over half (52%) would be negatively impacted by any interest rate rise in 2016 Instability in the Middle East and Ukraine is much less of a concern to business with 29% of respondents expecting a negative impact (down from 41%). Time for a quick recap. European stock markets remain fragile today, after an early attempt to rally back from Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump floundered. The main bourses are mixed as traders snatch lunch in the City. The German and French markets are down around 0.5%, while Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is managing a slight recovery, up 18 point, having been 70 points higher in early trading. Investors are bruised following yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump, which was the worst start to a trading year since the dot-com crash. China remains a big worry today. Overnight, Chinese authorities intervened to prevent another slump on the Shanghai market. State-backed authorities bought up shares, in a bid to prop up values. This helped the Chinese market to end the day roughly where it started. However, the intervention may also shows that Beijing is worried about future problems, given its slowing economy and the build-up of bad debts since the financial crisis began. Chris Beauchamp of IG sums up the morning: Early optimism on the London market has faded as investors continue to fret about the situation in Chinese markets. As in August, state-directed buying of stocks is competing with individual selling of equities, but China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest attempt to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbuck the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is likely to end as well as its efforts last year. The butterfly effect has been felt in Europe again this morning, with an initial bounce giving way to more selling, while in London the FTSE is fighting hard to hold on to small gains. While Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets warns: ...the prospect of another Summer-style Chinese rout (the one which made the Fed hold off from hiking) remains a real possibility. There is disappointment that eurozone inflation remains at just 0.2%, despite the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus measures. And there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also drama in the City. with Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threatening to pounce on Home Retail, the firm behind Argos and Homebase.... ....while the unusually warm weather has hurt sales at high street chain Next: If Sainsbury takes over Home Retail, it will reunite the company with the homes-and-gardens chain Homebase after a 15-year break. Big news in the City..... supermarket chain Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has revealed that it made a takeover approach to Home Retail (which owns Argos and Homebase). The offer was made, and rejected, in November, Sainsbury says. It is now considering its position, and has until February 2 to make a new bid. Rumours have been swirling for weeks that Home Retail could be a takeover target. Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to out itself as a possible bidder has send Home Retail shares soaring, up 30%. More here: William Hobbs, head of investment strategy at Barclays Plc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wealth-management unit in London, sums up the situation well -- it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153really messy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the markets right now. He told Bloomberg that investors around the globe are on edge today, and fearing trouble ahead. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Not much is expected of the world in terms of growth, risk appetite is biased to the downside and weak data from China to the U.S. hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helped at all. Plenty of people out there believe that the next global recession is imminent.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd US stock markets are expected to post fresh losses today, when they open in three hours time. The Dow Jones industrial average is tipped to fall by around 100 points, adding to Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 276 point slide. The euro has lost ground against the US dollar since December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation figures came out. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down over half a cent at $1.076. Although eurozone inflation is clearly weak, it may not be bad enough to force more stimulus out of the European Central Bank, argues Teunis Brosens of ING. While headline inflation was stuck at 0.2%, core inflation (stripping out energy and food) was also unchanged at 0.9% in December. Brosens says: Hawks may argue that weak core inflation is unsurprising given the still high unemployment in many Eurozone countries. Moreover, despite this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakening of core inflation, the presence of second-round effects is not yet convincing. We think that the ECB will hold its fire for now: it will take more convincing evidence of second round effects or other really disappointing economic news to stir the ECB into further action. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why shares have fallen back this morning: So much for the bounce-back. European stock markets couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even stay in the green until London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pubs opened for the day. The weak eurozone inflation reading has helped to pull the major indices into the red for the second day running. The German Dax has shed another 1%, on top of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 4% slump. The Paris CAC is down another 0.8%, and London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is off eight points. Ipek Ozkardeskaya of City firm London Capital Group says China is still worrying investors, even though Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank, the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China, stepped in overnight to prop up its stock market. She writes that market sentiment is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very much fragile\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: The apocalyptic Chinese story keeps the headlines busy. The intervention from the PBoC eased tensions at the heart of the storm, yet the chaotic start to 2016 warned of a challenging year ahead of us. The first trading day of the year has clearly wiped away some of the optimism and the risk-off flows dominate. Shanghai\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Composite opened the day 3.1% lower yet managed to recover later in the session. State-controlled funds bought equities to halt the $590bn worth of sell-off suffered on Monday, and a selling ban for investors would extend beyond a week according to several sources. The European Central Bank will be concerned that inflation remained so low last month, says Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight: Good news for Eurozone consumers but a headache for the ECB as consumer price inflation remained down at 0.2% in December, thereby defying expectations of a small uptick. The failure of Eurozone inflation to pick up in December is good news for consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 purchasing power; but it will maintain ECB concern that prolonged very low inflation could lead to a renewed weakening in inflation expectations thereby making it harder still to get Eurozone consumer price inflation up to its target rate of close to 2%. December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unexpectedly weak inflation report is hurting the euro. The single currency has hit its lowest level against the yen since April 2015. One euro is now worth \u00c2\u00a5128.03, down from \u00c2\u00a5129.33 earlier. Breaking: inflation across the eurozone remained uncomfortably weak last month. Prices across the single currency region rose by just 0.2% annually in December, Eurostat has just reported. That matches November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading, and dashes hopes of a rise to 0.3% or 0.4%. Cheaper energy costs are partly to blame..... but food and service price inflation did also slow last month: Eurostat says: Food, alcohol &amp; tobacco is expected to have the highest annual rate in December (1.2%, compared with 1.5% in November), followed by services (1.1%, compared with 1.2% in November), non-energy industrial goods (0.5%, stable compared with November) and energy (-5.9%, compared with -7.3% in November). The European Central Bank is meant to maintain inflation close to, but below, 2% -- but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a long way from that despite the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quantitative easing stimulus measures.... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s builders didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get much rest over Christmas, judging by the latest healthcheck from the sector. Data firm Markit reports that output jumped last month, pushing its PMI index up to 57.8 in December, up from a seven-month low of 55.3. That suggests the sector grew at a faster pace last month. Markit cited \u00e2\u20ac\u0153favourable demand conditions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with builders reporting that clients were more willing to commit to new projects. Commercial construction had a particularly good month, with growth hitting its fastest rate since October 2014. The unusually warm weather in December may also be a factor, as Britain didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t suffer the kind of heavy snowfalls that can scupper construction work this time of year. Firms who can build flood defences could be busy in 2016 too, as communities across the country try to shore themselves up. This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally is looking a little fragile, after less than 90 minutes. European stock markets have shed much of their early gains, and are now broadly flat. Invesotrs Here comes the latest measure of German unemployment..... and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better than expected. The number of people out of work across Germany fell by 14,000 last month, on a seasonally-adjusted basis. That smashes expectations of a 6,000 drop, and shows Germany is still outperforming many neighbours. This leaves its unemployment rate unchanged at 6.3%, compared to a eurozone average of 10.7%. Spain has also reported that its jobless total shrank by 8% last year: Mining stocks are leading this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally in London. Commodity giant Glencore is up over 4%, as fears over China ease a little (for the moment....) Tony Cross of Trustnext Direct says traders are taking their cue from Asia: London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE-100 has recovered some of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses at the open, thanks in no small part to the fact that Asian equity markets appear to have stabilised overnight \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at least for now. The vast majority of blue chips are trading in positive territory although the handful of losing stocks are being dominated by clothing retailers with that trading update from Next this morning providing little reason to get excited about the sector. High street chain Debenhams\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 shares have fallen by 2% in early trading. That reflects concerns that Next\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak sales over Christmas could be mirrored across the sector. Marks &amp; Spencer are down 0.5%. Shares in Next are out of fashion this morning. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re down by 3% at the start of trading, leading the FTSE fallers, as the City digests this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing Christmas trading. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction: Shares are rallying across Europe at the start of trading, as investors recover their nerve after Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heavy selloff. In London, the FTSE 100 has jumped by 72 points, or 1.2%, to 6165 points. That claws back almost half of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout, when the blue-chip index shed 148 points. The French CAC, German DAX, Spanish IBEX and Italian FTSE MIB are all up around 1.1%. Yesterday, the DAX slumped by over 4%, so today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally is only a partial recovery. Traders are encouraged by the news that Chinese authorities took action overnight to prevent their stock market tumbling again. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, explains: In the aftermath of a global sell-off over China growth fears, UK and European stock index futures are taking their cues from the Chinese stock market on Tuesday. After an initial wobble, shares in Shanghai and Shenzhen turned positive on Tuesday thanks to an injection of liquidity from the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China. High street retailer Next has sent a shiver through the sector this morning, after posting weaker than expected results for the crucial Christmas period. Full price sales rose by just +0.4% from 26 October to 24 December. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a serious slowdown, as Next sales grew by 6% between July and September. And as Next is the first major European retailer to report Christmas trading figures, this may mean more trouble ahead... Next pinned much of the blame on the unusually warm weather this autumn. This is a classic excuse for British retailers, who can often point to the skies to explain away a poor performance. But to give Next credit, it also released a graph showing how sales did indeed shrink in weeks where the temperature was hotter than in 2014: And the weather isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only culprit. The firm also admits that its catalogue shopping arm, NEXT Directory\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, suffered poor stock availability from October onward. Spread-betting firm IG is predicting that European markets will bounce back when trading begins in a few minutes, clawing back some of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. IG is calling the main markets up around 1%: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a wild day in China, as Beijing tries to prevent a repeat of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout. Chinese authorities intervened in the markets today, buying up stocks to give investors confidence. And it appears to have worked. The Shanghai composite index has closed for the day, down just 0.28%, having shed 3% at one stage today. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rather better than Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 7% slump, which forced trading to be halted. That doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t address the underlying problems in China, such as the build-up of bad debts and its slowing economy. And it suggests Beijing isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t prepared to allow market forces to take their natural course.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s day two of the trading year, and investors around the globe will be hoping for a better performance than on day one. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a nervous air in the markets today, after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff wiped hundreds of billions of dollars off bourses worldwide. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 lost \u00c2\u00a338bn in a blink of an eye: But unlike vanishing candyfloss, market value can reappear. And European stock markets are expected to recover some ground today. But it could be another volatile session, with concerns over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy looming over markets. Also on the agenda today, we get the first estimate of eurozone inflation for December. Economists predict it will rise to an annual rate of 0.4%, from 0.2% in November. We also get the latest German unemployment data for December, and an estimate of how UK builders fared last month. 8.55am GMT: German unemployment report 9.30am GMT: UK construction PMI 10am: Eurozone inflation for December And high street retailer Next is reporting its financial results for the last quarter. That will give us an insight into how the crucial Christmas trading season went.....",

A hat-trick of underperforming services PMIs saw the Chinese, UK and US readings all fall short of market expectations today. With the UK and US heavily reliant on the services sector, the continued slide in services PMIs will no doubt be worrying, with certain negative implications for future growth in both countries.</p> <p>As we head towards the European close there is a distinct pattern taking shape, with selling dominating the morning session, followed by a rally within the crossover period between the US and European markets. Perhaps this is US optimism at work, yet there certainly appears to be substantially more negativity within Europe than in the US, despite the fact that the Fed is the only central bank to be raising rates.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-568d43a3e4b0ef602a241292\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-06T16:43:51.654Z\">4.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Following the news that the US added 10.1m barrels of gasoline to inventories last week, John Kilduff of Again Capital <strong><a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/01/05/oil-prices-edge-higher-after-dropping-to-near-11-year-lows.html\">told CNBC</a></strong>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the biggest increase in gasoline supply since 1993.

With businesses reducing inventory, imports fell to their lowest level in five years, with exports also declining but at a lower rate.</p> <p>So the trade gap fell by 5% to $42.4bn, while October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit was revised up to $44.6bn for $43.9bn. Rob Carnell at ING Bank said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The November US trade deficit narrowed by a little over $2bn to $42.374bn, which will help lift the fourth quarter 2015 GDP figures by about 0.1%/0.2% relative to what a flat reading would have delivered (assuming this is sustained). But this is not quite as good a data post as first glance shows.</p> <p>The deficit was not materially affected by petroleum flows or prices, with the ex-petroleum deficit actually narrowing even more than the headline figure.<br></p> <p>What appears to be dominating this result is a sharp (1.7% month on month) decline in imports, particularly on the goods side (service imports broadly unchanged). And this may reflect a much weaker level of underlying demand in the economy than some other recent data have suggested. Exports were a little softer too, but it is weak imports that dominated this result.<br></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-568d158ee4b02440900e1ce6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-06T13:26:02.142Z\">1.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Analysts are surprised by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jan/06/markets-weak-chinese-data-services-eurozone-business-live#block-568d138be4b0ef602a240083\">the unexpectedly strong US private sector jobs report</a>. </strong></p> <p>It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really match up to recent economic data, particularly from US manufacturing sector:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/monexeurope/statuses/684727029737107456\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">That&#39;s a rather large payrolls estimate from ADP...interesting to see if official figures can live up</p>&mdash; Ranko Berich (@monexeurope) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/monexeurope/status/684727029737107456\">January 6, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mhewson_CMC/statuses/684726907200516096\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">ADP says manufacturing added 2k jobs in Dec despite weak ISM and Chicago PMI?

                "bodyText":"Investors could see the FTSE 100 - currently at 6073 - slip below 6000 during the current market rout, according to Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct. He said: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been another difficult day for London equities with the FTSE-100 failing to find any meaningful support, in line with sentiment across the bulk of global stock markets. Once again miners are leading the rout, this time with suggestions that some of the big names could look to use a rights issue to build so-called war chests so they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re well placed to pick up distressed assets from smaller rivals when the inevitable fire sales come along. The fact oil prices have hit levels not seen in over a decade is also cause for concern, with traders taking the glass half empty approach here \u00e2\u20ac\u201c US crude inventories fell, but there was simultaneously a sharp build in the corresponding gasoline reading... Downside pressure may be with us for a while yet and the obvious next level to watch for is a break below 6,000 on the FTSE-100. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. It was another day of dramatic declines on global markets. It started badly with more poor Chinese data - this time from the service sector - which prompted renewed fears of a severe slowdown in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second largest economy. However there were also suggestions that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank might unveil new stimulus measures, as well as extending the ban on short selling which is due to expire at the end of this week. News that North Korea had claimed to have exploded a hydrogen bomb also unnerved investors, while the oil price continued to slide. Growing tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran make it unlikely the oil-rich countries will be able to agree on production cuts to cope with falling demand and oversupply. On top of that came new figures showing a 10.1m rise in gasoline inventories in the US last week. So markets fell sharply again, with commodity companies bearing the brunt of the selling, although they recovered from their worst levels towards the end of trading. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 63.86 points or 1.04% to 6073.38, having earlier fallen as low as 6018. Around 22 points of the decline came from mining and oil companies Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 0.93% to 10,214.02 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 1.26% at 4480.47 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB lost 2.67% to 20,422.39 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 1.48% at 9197.4 In Greece, the Athens market fell 0.57% to 617.59 In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 217 points or 1.26%. Brent crude is 5.1% lower at $34.56 a barrel, after earlier touching $34.26 - its worst level for around eleven and a half years. Back with the stock markets, and the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s events seemed to follow a familiar pattern according to Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG. He said: The 2016 meltdown has moved into its third day, with both European and US markets selling off heavily once more, spurred on by yet another leg lower in crude prices. A hat-trick of underperforming services PMIs saw the Chinese, UK and US readings all fall short of market expectations today. With the UK and US heavily reliant on the services sector, the continued slide in services PMIs will no doubt be worrying, with certain negative implications for future growth in both countries. As we head towards the European close there is a distinct pattern taking shape, with selling dominating the morning session, followed by a rally within the crossover period between the US and European markets. Perhaps this is US optimism at work, yet there certainly appears to be substantially more negativity within Europe than in the US, despite the fact that the Fed is the only central bank to be raising rates. Following the news that the US added 10.1m barrels of gasoline to inventories last week, John Kilduff of Again Capital told CNBC: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the biggest increase in gasoline supply since 1993. Gasoline prices are going to collapse. On the other hand US crude inventories dropped by 5.1m barrels last week, but this has done nothing to support the oil price. And now a new low for the day. Brent crude is down $2 a barrel or 5.7% at $34.30, in the wake of the US inventory figures. These have added to worries about oversupply and falling demand, at a time when tensions between Saudia Arabia and Iran make it less likely the major producers will be able to agree on production cuts. After staging a minor recovery, oil prices are falling again after US gasoline stocks rose by 10.6m last week, the biggest weekly rise since 1993, according to the US Energy Information Administration. So Brent crude is now down 4.75% at $34.69, back down towards the lows of the day. However: Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex said: Whilst not quite at bad their early afternoon nadirs, the global indices were still drunk off today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s toxic China/oil/North Korea cocktail, staggering to fresh lows like a troop of inebriated uncles at an uncomfortable family function. The Dow Jones, at its worst down by nearly 300 points, settled into a 200 point loss as the open receded into the background, lifted slightly by an absurdly strong ADP non-farm employment change figure and a shrinking trade balance number. Some of that goodwill was undone, however, by a huge month-on-month drop in factory orders (from 1.5% to -0.2%) and a pair of Markit and ISM services PMIs that, at 54.3 and 55.1 respectively, both worryingly underperformed expectations. And whilst the Dow may have climbed away from its lows, it remains both firmly below the 17000 mark and approaching 3 month lows. Over in Europe and things remained just as bad, the DAX, CAC and FTSE all haemorrhaging around 1-1.5% as the day dragged on. If anything it is admirable the UK index hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fallen even further given that Brent Crude truly lost its way this Wednesday, trading below $35 per barrel to hit new 11 year lows for most of the afternoon, at one point extending its losses to nearly 5%. Here are the bigget fallers on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a broad based decline, with only retailer Wal Mart bucking the downward trend: And US factory orders fell in November and inventories declined for the fifth straight month, according to the Commerce Department. New orders slipped 0.2% in November compared to a 1.3% rise in October, itself downgraded from an initial reading of 1.5%. Inventories fell 0.3% in November after a 0.5% decline the previous month. The ISM non-manufacturing report also suggests some weakness in the US economy. Its PMI came in at 55.3 in December, down from 55.9 in November and lower than the 56 that analysts had been expecting. This was the lowest reading since April 2014. But the new orders index rose from 57.5 in November to 58.2, while the business activity index improved from 58.2 to 58.7. The Markit survey suggests that US economic growth could be losing momentum. Its chief economist Chris Williamson said: The PMI surveys show the service sector losing momentum alongside a stalling of growth in the manufacturing sector, pushing the overall rate of economic expansion down to the weakest for a year. While the survey data indicate that the economy grew at a reasonably healthy 1.9% annualised clip in the fourth quarter, the weakness seen in the final month of the year raises concerns that growth is losing momentum, possibly quite markedly. The survey also signals robust employment growth, but likewise suggests the pace of hiring has slowed since earlier in the year as businesses have become more cautious in the face of worries such as the forthcoming elections, the strong dollar, global growth jitters and the outlook for interest rates. The December survey data are consistent with non-farm payrolls rising by around 175,000 compared to an average of 200,000 in the first eleven months of the year. Having hiked interest rates for the first time in almost a decade at the end of last year, the Fed will likely err on the side of caution and hold off with further policy tightening until the full extent of the slowdown becomes apparent. US services grew more strongly than expected in December, according to Markit, but were still at their lowest level since January last year. Its services PMI came in at 54.3 compared to expectations of 54 and an initial reading of 53.7. But it was weaker than the November figure of 56.1. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s composite PMI for December was 54, down from 55.9 in November and the lowest since December 2014. Markit said: December data highlighted that the U.S. service sector ended the year on a weaker growth footing, with business activity and incoming new work both expanding at slower rates than in November. Staffing numbers continued to rise at a solid pace, but the latest survey suggested a greater degree of caution about the business outlook. The ISM non-manufacturing survey is due shortly. As expected, US markets are joining in the global downturn, sparked by the latest poor Chinese data, this time from the service sector, and of course the reports of a hydrogen bomb test by North Korea. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 235 points or 1.4% in early trading. The S&amp;P 500 has fallen 1%, while Nasdaq is off 1.5% (not helped by weakness in Apple following reports of iPhone 6 production cutbacks.) Oil continues to fall, the latest lurch down coming after the strong ADP jobs report which has in turn strengthened the dollar on the basis of more possible US interest rate rises. Commodities are denominated in dollars, so any rise in the US currency makes them more expensive to hold. So Brent crude is now down 4.7% at $34.71 a barrel, having touched a low of $34.62. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a new low of more than 11 years (since July 2004). Here is our story on the oil price slide: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite a New Year hangover in the markets today. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff has sent European stocks down to a three-week low, knocking 1.7% off the Stoxx 600 index (which tracks listed companies across Europe). That pretty much wipes out the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Santa Rally\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that kicked off after the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates in mid December: Alastair McCaig, Market Analyst at IG, says weak Chinese data and tensions overseas have hurt stocks this week. Only three days into the new year and both the economic data and equity markets in China are giving investors plenty to worry about. The People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China has already suspended equity markets, closing them early for the day, injected 130 billion yuan into the markets and has now weakened the currency. What will the fourth day of the trading year bring? The escalation in rhetoric between Saudi Arabia and Iran has already heightened fears over the Middle East and now North Korea has decided this is the optimum time to carry out its latest nuclear bomb test. If 2016 is going to be a good one for equities, they are going to have to do it the hard way. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s damage, with just over two hours trading left in Europe: City firm Fathom Consulting is particularly pessimistic about China - it believes growth is way, way below the official reading of 7% (which is also Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official target) Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ADP report shows that the US labour market saved the best till last.... Is it too early to speculate about another US interest rate rise? Rob Carnell of ING thinks markets could start pricing in a fresh rise in borrowing costs in March, if Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Non-Farm Payroll matches today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decent ADP jobs report. Such a move would be backed by rising inflation, notwithstanding what is currently happening to oil prices - the base effects from last year dominate any current downward pressure on prices. Wages too will likely bolster the case for more tightening (only +0.2%mom needed to take wage inflation to 2.8% in December), and sooner than markets are expecting. There is still a long way to go until the March meeting, and we think that by the time we get there, the Fed will have managed to come up with an excuse for dragging its feet some more. But in the meantime, stronger labour data, rising inflation and wages are making a decent case for a more aggressive Fed, a stronger USD, and higher bond yields. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit narrowed in November, according to figures just released by the Commerce Department. With businesses reducing inventory, imports fell to their lowest level in five years, with exports also declining but at a lower rate. So the trade gap fell by 5% to $42.4bn, while October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit was revised up to $44.6bn for $43.9bn. Rob Carnell at ING Bank said: The November US trade deficit narrowed by a little over $2bn to $42.374bn, which will help lift the fourth quarter 2015 GDP figures by about 0.1%/0.2% relative to what a flat reading would have delivered (assuming this is sustained). But this is not quite as good a data post as first glance shows. The deficit was not materially affected by petroleum flows or prices, with the ex-petroleum deficit actually narrowing even more than the headline figure. What appears to be dominating this result is a sharp (1.7% month on month) decline in imports, particularly on the goods side (service imports broadly unchanged). And this may reflect a much weaker level of underlying demand in the economy than some other recent data have suggested. Exports were a little softer too, but it is weak imports that dominated this result. Analysts are surprised by the unexpectedly strong US private sector jobs report. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really match up to recent economic data, particularly from US manufacturing sector: Breaking: American companies hired more new staff than expected last month. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign that the US labour market remains robust, despite weakening economic growth in emerging markets such as China. The closely watched monthly survey conducted by the Automatic Data Processing (ADP) showed that 257,000 new private sector jobs were created last month. That beats estimates; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s around 62,000 more jobs than expected. It suggests Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Non-Farm Payroll report will not contain any shocks that might make the Federal Reserve regret raising interest rates last month. undefined Wall Street traders should take their tin hats into work. The futures market is predicting chunky falls across the three main share markets, CNBC flags up. Trading begins in 75 minutes, at 2.30pm GMT. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tech-heavy Nasdaq index is on track to shed 2% when trading begins, in an hour and half\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. That reflects concerns that Apple is reportedly cutting iPhone production, which may herald wider problems in the technology sector.... There was no relief to the commodity crunch this morning: Shares in tech giant Apple are on track to hit their lowest level since last August, when Wall Street opens. According to reports from China, Apple is cutting back on production of its iPhone 6 smartphone, in response to weaker than expected sales. Foxconn, a major iPhone assembler, has already cut staff levels according to the Wall Street Journal. The news has already hit the shares of the various tech firms whose components go into the iPhone. ARM, the UK chip firm, are down 3%. And Apple is on track to fall by 2.7% to around $99.98.... European markets are lurching lower -- the FTSE 100 is flirting with a triple-digit loss, as concern swirls over China and North Korea. The German, French and Italian markets are also deeper in the red: Mining firms are still the biggest fallers, as commodity prices are hit by concerns over the global economy. The fall in the crude price has hit producer Tullow Oil, which is down over 5%. In another sign of nervousness, the price of gold is rising: The Russian rouble is being hit by the weakening oil price, dropping 1% to 74 roubles to the US dollar. Oil is continuing to slide..... Today is definitely a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153risk-off\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd trading session, says Peter Rosenstreich, head of market strategy at online bank Swissquote Bank. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement of a hydrogen bomb test has done little to calm already jittery nerves. The announcement was supported by media outlets reporting a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153man-made\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd earthquake in the area that North Korea generally uses to test their nuclear capabilities. This concerning news follows directly on the heels of the escalations of tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Given the weak economic growth data emulating for emerging markets recently investors had little appetite to wait around. Spreadex\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Conner Campbell says markets are suffering a triple-whammy -- poor Chinese data, weakening oil, and North Korean worries. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The dismal start to 2016 appears to have only intensified this Wednesday, with disappointing Chinese services data (sending the yuan to a 5-year low against the dollar even if the Shanghai Composite managed some counter-intuitive growth), a fresh 11-year low for Brent Crude and reports of a fourth nuclear test from North Korea.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still 90 minutes to wait until dawn breaks over New York. But any early-rising Wall Street workers should brace for a lively day. The futures market is predicting the Dow Jones industrial average will shed almost 200 points, or 1.3%, at the open. A fresh dose of gloom has swept the oil market today, driving down crude prices to their lowest levels since the summer of 2004. Rising geopolitical tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran pushed prices down; good news for consumers, and countries who import their energy supplies, but another blow to producers. Brent crude, sourced from the North Sea, tumbled by 2% to just $35.52 per barrel, a new 11-year low. US crude dropped 1.5% to $35.38. This partly reflects concerns over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowing economy -- weaker growth equals less demand for energy. But oil traders are also watching the tensions between Tehran and Riyadh carefully. Over the weekend, Saudi Arabia cut diplomatic ties with Iran after protesters ransacked the Saudi embassy in Tehran, following Saudi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s execution of a senior Shia Muslim cleric. Middle Eastern tensions usually push the oil price up. But in this case, it dampens the prospect of producers working together and cutting the amount of crude hitting the market. RBC Capital Markets say: In particular, we would highlight the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to execute the prominent Shiite Cleric and political dissident Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr as a catalyst for increased sectarian tension both at home and throughout the region. At the time of writing, protests had broken out in the restive city of Qatif in the Kingdom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil-rich eastern province and angry demonstrators had set the Saudi Embassy in Tehran on fire. Returning to China... Ilya Spivak, currency strategist at DailyFX, says traders are alarmed that Beijing allowed the yuan to hit a five-year low today. The sentiment-sensitive Australian, Canadian and New Zealand Dollars dropped while the safety-linked Japanese Yen pushed higher as risk aversion gripped markets in Asian trade. The move followed China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move to set the daily reference rate for the onshore Yuan exchange rate at the lowest in five years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Newswires suggested the move reflected Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s determination that the economy needs additional stimulus, which implies a deteriorating growth outlook. Curiously, the prospect of additional policy support might have been expected to be supportive for sentiment considering a slowdown in China has been baked into consensus forecasts for some time. He also reckons traders should chill... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With this in mind, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move may prove to be a reflexive, knee-jerk response rather than a sober evaluation of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FX policy on its merits. The PBOC spooked investors when it began to rapidly revalue the Yuan in August, catching markets off-guard and sending asset prices scrambling. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response may reflect fears of a similar scenario, but the ingredients for a repeat appear to be absent. Growth across the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector dipped last month, suggesting the British economy isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t growing as fast as hoped. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK Services PMI dropped to 55.5 in December, from 55.9 in November. That still shows robust expansion, with firms taking on more business....but Markit sounds a little concerned about the situation. It says: Employment increased at a robust pace, albeit the weakest in five months.... Growth in recent months has been slower than in the first half of the year and when compared with the trend rates set in 2013-14. Reflecting this, outstanding business continued to grow only modestly in December, and firms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 longer-term expectations for business activity were the weakest since early-2013. Jeremy Cook of currency exchange firm World First wonders if the service sector may have peaked: Despite France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems, private sector growth across the euro area has hit its highest level since mid-2011. Data firm Markit reports that activity rose across Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Ireland last month, with many firms taking on more staff. Its composite PMI, which measures manufacturing and service sector growth across the eurozone, hit 54.3, up from 54.2 in November. That indicates that growth in the final three months of 2015 was the strongest since the eurozone debt crisis kicked off. Ireland posted the fastest growth, continuing a strong run. More surprisingly, Italy was the second-best performer, ahead of Germany. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, says the data is encouraging: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The eurozone economy starts 2016 on a solid footing and well placed to enjoy a year of robust expansion. Growth of business activity continued to edge higher at the end of 2015, with an upturn in the PMI rounding off the strongest quarter for four- and-a-half years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s particularly encouraging to see firms taking on staff in increased numbers, suggesting that businesses are preparing for stronger demand in the coming year by boosting capacity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd France is kicking off 2016 where it ended 2015, with more bad economic news. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s French service sector PMI, which measures activity across the sector, fell to 49.8 in December. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an 11-month low, and suggests a small contraction) (50 is the cutoff point). Firms reported that new business growth slowed to near-stagnation during the month which also suggests economic demand is weak. Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Markit, flags up that business expectations are also lacklustre, following November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s terrorist atrocities in Paris. Anecdotal evidence suggested that a number of businesses continued to be affected by cancellations following the recent terrorist attacks, exerting a drag on new business growth. Correspondingly, business expectations dipped to the lowest level for over a year. Service providers responded by cutting their charges to the greatest extent in six months, which they will be hoping may spur new work intakes to get the New Year off to a more positive start.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back in the UK, John Lewis has shrugged off a drop in shoppers at its high street outlets to report a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Christmas. My colleague Sean Farrell has the details: Group sales for the six weeks to 2 January rose 4.1% from a year earlier to \u00c2\u00a31.81bn as sales at its John Lewis department store business, including online, rose 6.9% to \u00c2\u00a3951.3m. At operations open a year or more, John Lewis sales rose 5.1% with performance spread between homeware, fashion and technology. Sales at John Lewis department stores fell 1.2%, reflecting fewer visits to high streets and shopping centres as online sales jumped 21.4%. Maybe that Man in the Moon advert charmed the shoppers again (despite cynical hacks wondering what terrible crime the old chap had committed to prompt his lunar exile). Personally I preferred Monty the Penguin. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s yuan is continuing to weaken -\u00e2\u20ac\u201c it just hit a record low of 6.7250 to the US dollar in London trading, according to Reuters. Stocks are weakening across Europe this morning. As this chart shows, the basic resources sector (miners and energy suppliers) are the worst hit, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pretty broad selloff: Mining shares are leading the selloff in London, with BHP Billiton down 4%, Rio Tinto and Antofagasta shedding 3.7% and Glencore down 2.9%. That highlights concerns that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy may be slowing faster than official figures show, which would dampen demand for commodities. UK fashion chain Burberry is also feeling the chill, dropping 2.3% at the open. It warned in October that Chinese demand for its pricy coats and handbags had weakened since last summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market turmoil. Down we go again..... Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets are dropping in early trading, hit by worries over China and anxiety over North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nuclear test. In London, the FTSE 100 has shed almost 1% at the open, with other markets close behind. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says investors have plenty to worry about: Geopolitical risk has moved up a gear thanks to North Korea testing a hydrogen bomb for supposed self defense which will only go to make for more tension with its neighbours, while China data disappointed with a pullback in PMI Services adding to Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness in Manufacturing, bolstering investor fears about the slowing economy. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets are defying today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff, and rallying on hopes that Beijing will be forced into more stimulus moves soon. The Shanghai Composite Index jumped 1.7% to close 61 points higher, at 3,539 points. That still leaves the index down 5% this year, after Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 7% slump forced trading to be suspended. Most Asian stock markets has fallen today, driven down by worries over China and the nuclear test claims from North Korea. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei fell 1%, while Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng index lost 0.8% to hit its lowest level since October. More here: In another sign of problems building in China, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency has hit a five-year low against the US dollar today. The People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China surprised investors by setting its daily yuan fix at the lowest level since April 2011, which triggered fresh selling overseas. CNBC has the details: The offshore yuan fell to 6.6915 against the greenback, the lowest rate of exchange since at least the last quarter of 2010 and a 2.1 percent discount to the onshore yuan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 6.5506 level. The People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China has been under growing pressure as nervous investors pull capital out of the country. A weaker yuan should help Chinese firms compete overseas, but may also fuel concern about currency wars. Nizam Idris, head of foreign-exchange and fixed-income strategy at Macquarie Bank in Singapore, has told Bloomberg that the drop in the yuan will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153confuse\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the markets. Economists are concerned to see that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector growth ground to a halt last month. Zhou Hao, an economist at Commerzbank AG in Singapore, warned: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This sentiment gauge clearly clouds the growth outlook for China,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Iris Pang, greater China economist at Natixis SA in Hong Kong, hopes for a recovery this month. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Services have felt the heat from the economic slowdown....Spending in the Chinese New Year may lead to a rebound\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This chart from Caixin shows how China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy took a dive in December, with service sector growth hitting a 17 month low and manufacturing actually shrinking (as we learned on Monday) Dr He Fan, their chief economist, says it shows Beijing needs to do more to stimulate its economy: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The headline Caixin China General Services PMI for December is 50.2, down 1 point from the reading for the previous month and reaching the lowest point in 17 months. The Caixin Composite Output Index came in at 49.4, below the 50-point neutral level and 1.1 points lower than November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record. In light of the setback to services sector growth, the government needs to gradually relax restrictions in the sector. This will release the potential of supply-side reform, improve the economic structure and help with the industrial transformation and upgrading.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. Worries over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy are in focus again this morning. Overnight, fresh data has shown that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector economy grew at its slowest rate in 17 months in December. The Caixin/Markit Purchasing Managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Index (PMI) fell to 50.2 last month, which implies that the sector basically stagnated last month. That follows Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak manufacturing data, and adds to concerns that its economy is softening, It also suggests Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move to a more consumer-driven economy isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going as well as hoped. Investors are also (understandably) alarmed that North Korea is claiming to have detonated a hydrogen bomb overnight (live coverage of that drama is here). That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weighing on Asia markets, which are mostly in the red today, and driving up the US dollar. We get service sector data from across Europe this morning, which is likely to show that the slow recovery in the eurozone continued in December (with Germany doing rather better than France). The eurozone data comes in dribs-and-drabs from 8.15am to 9am GMT, with the UK services PMI at 9.30am. We then get the US services data at 3pm, after the monthly ADP report shows how many new private sector jobs were created last month. That will tee up Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Non-Farm Payroll (the broad measure of the American labour market). And in the City, investors will be chewing through Christmas trading figures from retail bellwether John Lewis, and Topps Tiles. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

The volatility and chaos caused by disappointing Chinese data and the failed attempt to control the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market with circuit breakers had sent investors running for the hills this week. But a 2% rise in the Chinese market earlier on Friday, following the abandonment of the circuit breakers and some support from the authorities for the yuan, gave some hope that a better day was in prospect.</p> <p>Better than expected US jobs figures put an end to that, prompting talk of further US rate rises and pushing the dollar higher, and by extension the oil price lower. With all the other geopolitical problems - North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible hydrogen bomb, tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran - as well as Chinese inflation data this Saturday, traders decided to take their money off the table ahead of the weekend.</p> <p>Market analyst Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A degree of calm in Chinese markets overnight has done little to placate sentiment, whilst better than expected employment data out of the US is also adding to woes.

The final scores for the day showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 fell 41.64 points or 0.7% to 5912.44</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.31% to 9849.34</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 1.59% at 4333.76</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB lost 1.58% to 19,869.49</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 1.66% down 8909.2</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market is 0.81% lower at 585.98</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 62 points or 0.38%.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-568fddc9e4b0600201f49473\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-08T16:10:29.929Z\">4.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One of the reasons for the decline in markets since the initial enthusiasm for the US jobs data is the feeling that the strong figures make a rate rise more likely. The disappointing wages growth might mitigate against an early rise, but the general feeling seems to be that even dearer borrowing costs are now more likely. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Heading into the close, the FTSE 100 has given up all its gains for the day, finishing a tough week on a miserable note.</p> <p>After a passable performance overnight for the Chinese market, hopes were high that stock markets in Europe and the US could claw back some of their own losses. So far on this side of the pond, that has not been the case.</p> <p>Equity traders have been left bereft of reasons to be optimistic this week, and it looks like the China fears of the past few days will remain with us as we head into a new week. US job numbers kicked off 2016 in fine form, well ahead of estimates, but the lack of wage growth was the fly in the ointment. The fear now is that such good numbers, even with inflation worries, will encourage the Fed to continue with its planned four hikes this year, putting fresh pressure on equity markets.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-568fd732e4b0600201f49158\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/larryelliott\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-08T15:36:59.203Z\">3.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our economics editor Larry Elliott on the US jobs data:</p> <blockquote> <p>It seems just like the good old days. Almost <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/08/us-jobs-report-december-2015-economy-jobs\">300,000 jobs were added to payrolls in America in the last month of 2015</a>, continuing the upward trend of recent months. The US is once again living up to its reputation for being a gigantic jobs machine.</p> <p>Well, perhaps. Jobs are certainly being created at a good lick and the US has an unemployment rate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 5% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that the eurozone, at 10.5%, would die for. There are signs that people who had given up hope of finding work are being encouraged back into the labour market.</p> <p>Inevitably, this will lead to speculation that the Federal Reserve has left it too late to start raising interest rates and will now be forced to play catch up with a more rapid increase in the cost of borrowing than Wall Street is expecting. There is already talk of the Fed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/16/federal-reserve-us-interest-rate-rise-fed-funds-janet-yellen\">repeating December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate hike</a> in March.</p> <p>The markets may be getting ahead of themselves. Employment and unemployment are lagging indicators: they provide a guide to what has happened to an economy in the past rather than what is happening now or what will happen in the future. Some of the forward-looking indicators \u00e2\u20ac\u201c <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-idUSKBN0UI1GM20160104\">for manufacturing, for example</a> \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have been worryingly weak.</p> <p>The Fed will certainly be looking closely at the rate of job creation in the US, but it is equally interested in what is happening to wages. And the story here is that pay pressures are extremely muted. Average hourly earnings were flat in December and were up by just 2.5% over the year as a whole, a much weaker outcome than Wall Street had been anticipating. </p> </blockquote> <p>His full analysis is here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2016/jan/08/us-employment-up-wages-static\">US employment is up, wages are static.

Or perhaps investors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t willing to take too much risk into the weekend, especially with the prospect of another awful start to Monday on the cards.

Economist Nina Skero at the Centre for Economics and Business Research does expect a US rate rise, but perhaps not until the third quarter of the year:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Overall, the data add to the view that the US economic recovery steams ahead as wage gains and the unemployment rate approach long-run norms and as job creation figures, which admittedly can be rather volatile, remain high.</p> <p>In the aftermath of December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s historic Federal Open Market Committee decision and this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data releases perhaps the question on the minds of many is what is the future of US monetary policy? It is important to keep in mind that as one swallow does not a summer make, one rate hike does not a normalized monetary policy make. Even with the December rise interest rates in the US remain low and although the committee has restated its intention to maintain an accommodative monetary policy, it is reasonable to expect further hikes in 2016 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an expectation further strengthened by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong labour market data.</p> <p>However, this is not to say that sources of risk which could slow down the recovery do not exist, both domestically and globally. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour-market release shows a participation rate of 62.6% - well below pre-crisis levels. On the global front, equity markets turmoil and the slowdown in China are among the greatest concerns.</p> <p>The exact pace and extent of further interest rate hikes is difficult to predict given that the FOMC itself maintains that it is data-dependent and that it will continue to make interest rate decisions based on a series of indicators that it is monitoring rather than on a pre-set schedule.<br></p> <p>Keeping in mind that the US economy is expected to perform strongly in 2016, but also that December minutes show that the FOMC wants to observe the potentially delayed impact of the rate rise before making further hikes, Cebr expects interest rates to rise to 0.75% in the third quarter of 2016.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-568fcb71e4b0d22ca1a4bdb9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-08T14:48:50.060Z\">2.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s someone who thinks the Federal Reserve could raise US interest rates at its March meeting despite the uninspiring wage data</strong>. Harm Bandholz, chief US economist at UniCredit Research said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Average hourly earnings were only flat between November and December. But thanks to a positive basis effect, the year on year rate ticked up to 2.5% from 2.3%. But while the Fed has said at a number of recent occasions that it puts more emphasis on the actual development of inflation rates when determining the appropriate path for short-term interest rates, we think that the unambiguous display of strength in the labor market will continue to bolster the confidence of FOMC members that (a) consumer spending will continue to power the US economy ahead \u00e2\u20ac\u201c despite global headwinds, and (b) that faster wage gains will eventually lift domestic inflation rates. Accordingly, we continue to expect three rate hikes for 2016, with the next one coming at the March meeting.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the jobs numbers themselves he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To be sure, the labor market in the fourth quarter of 2015 most likely benefited from two special factors. First, there was a technical rebound in October, after the August and September numbers disappointed (in part due to seasonal adjustment issues). And in November and December, the unusually mild winter weather clearly supported employment in weather-sensitive areas, notably construction. </p> <p>There is, however, in our view no reason at all to question the underlying message of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and the previous couple of employment reports: The US labor market continues to be red-hot despite daily reports of global economic headwinds and financial market turmoil. The reason for this resilience \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as highlighted at several occasions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is that most of the value added and of the job creation in the US occurs in the services sector, which is barely affected by global developments. And this trend strengthened further in 2015. After in 2014 81% of jobs were created in services, this number rose to a whopping 94% in 2015; with another 10% coming from the construction sector!

The unemployment rate stood unchanged at 5.0%, still very low by any standards.</p> <p>One considerable disappointment in this survey, and perhaps a more important one as far as the pace of future fed hikes is concerned, is the wages figures. These grew at only a 2.5% year on year rise, and were flat over the month in December. Consensus had been looking for a modest 0.2% month on month increase, which would have taken wages into a range they had not inhabited since before the financial crisis. Instead, wages still seem to be struggling to rise. There was also no change in the average workweek, which tends to support the notion that wage pressures remain subdued, as increased hours frequently indicate a tight labour market and building wage pressures.</p> <p>Consequently, and even with the strong headline payrolls figure, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think these figures support a March rate hike, talk of which had been building over the past week following strong non-manufacturing ISM and ADP data.

But they may be over-estimating the extent to which politicians can choose how their economies grow. Since curbing growth in some sectors is usually easier than boosting it in others, the danger is that the attempt to re-orient the economy will result in overall weaker growth This is one reason, which seems to be widely acknowledged, why China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future growth could well fall short not only of recent rates but even of the Beijing authorities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 more conservative projections for the years to come.</p> </blockquote> <p>Then there are the demographic problems, which prompted the abolition of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One child per family\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rule:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>By 2050, those aged 65 or over could well stand at 38% of the labour force, slightly less favourable even than Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s present ratio. There could be ameliorating circumstances for China. There may be scope for more migration from the countryside to urban centres without loss of agricultural production, though much less than there used to be. There will very likely be support to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP growth from a shift in the urban workforce from low-productivity activities to higher-productivity occupations. Further, China would perhaps be less opposed on cultural grounds than Japan to immigrant labour, though there have been no moves in that direction yet. Indeed, the ruling Communist Party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highly developed sense of self-preservation might be expected to resist any disturbance of the status quo. At the same time, in the nearer term, China faces a unique problem, the result of the recent abandonment of the one-child policy in favour of a two-child policy. To the extent that this measure is effective in raising the birth rate, it will temporarily boost the dependency ratio, that is, the proportion that the non-working population, old and young, bears to those of working age. Those who are working will need to increase their output merely to meet the needs of a growing non-active population. There will likely be a reduced margin of savings to finance capital investment and thereby to support future growth.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25487dc61504e9542d3be231ab3c4fbf9e895357\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25487dc61504e9542d3be231ab3c4fbf9e895357/0_0_2442_1616/1000.jpg\" alt=\"(FILES) This file handout picture taken and released by the Japan Coast Guard on December 22, 2015 shows a Chinese Coast Guard ship near disputed islets, known as the Senkaku islands in Japan and Diaoyu islands in China, in the East China Sea.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A photo released by the Japan Coast Guard on December 22, 2015 shows a Chinese Coast Guard ship near disputed islets, known as the Senkaku islands in Japan and Diaoyu islands in China, in the East China Sea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Japan Coast Guard/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the geopolitics,...</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The region is also a potential war-zone in a way that neither North America nor even Europe appears to be at the moment. Reports this week that North Korea has tested a hydrogen bomb is a reminder of the severity of the threat. Beyond the North Korean danger, both the East China Sea and the South China Sea are possible flashpoints. In the former area, there was a stand-off between Japan and China over the Senkaku (Diaoyu) islands through most of last year. But on 20 December an armed Chinese coast-guard vessel entered territorial waters that Japan claims around the islands. In response to these and other regional tensions, the Japanese government has proposed for the fiscal 2016/17 year a 1.5% increase in military spending to a highest-ever level. This is significant in view of the pressure to achieve reductions in other spending programmes. The Japanese government had been allowed, under the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s post-war constitution, the right of self-defence, which would have covered operations around the Senkaku islands, but Mr Abe nevertheless pressed for, and in September secured, an amendment that would allow Japan to afford military help to allies. This strongly suggests that the Abe government foresees the possibility of Japan taking part in the resistance to what several nations in the region regard as Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aggressive strategy in the South China Sea.</p> <p>It seems a long time since the Spratly islands first hit the headlines. It was as long ago as 1999 that a Filipino naval ship deliberately ran aground on one of those islands to establish a claim to the archipelago. Last year, in a dramatic development, it became clear that China was determinedly seeking to enforce its own title to the area when it built an artificial island on the foundation of the Mischief Reef and went on to claim, in contravention of UN rules, territorial waters around that construction. The US Navy has since sought to enforce freedom of the seas by disregarding China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretensions, thereby precipitating low-level exchanges with China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ships.</p> <p>Vietnam also believes it has interests to defend in the South China Sea. In an ominous development, its government announced on 23 December that it would be taking delivery from Russia of two more Kilo-class submarines to supplement the four it already deploys. These vessels are reckoned to be especially effective in relatively shallow waters (the Iranian navy has three of them). Vietnam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s army has put troop concentrations in the northern province on the border with China under \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchigh combat readiness\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This appears to be a defensive move. But investors should note that Vietnam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defence doctrine is not based on attacking China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s naval forces head-on, a contest that Vietnam could hardly expect to win. Rather, in the event of hostilities, the aim of the strategists in Hanoi would be to use the submarines to prey on merchant shipping heading to and from Chinese ports through the South China Sea. Their calculation is that the resulting prohibitive cost of freight insurance, or indeed the unwillingness of insurers to provide cover at all, would cripple China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade and economic activity. It could also topple China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial system, an objective looking less fanciful in the light of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s evidence of fragility. Given Vietnam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record in getting the better of super-powers, this strategic view should perhaps be taken more seriously than investors seem prepared to do at the moment.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-568fa252e4b0d22ca1a4aa7d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-08T12:01:06.930Z\">12.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drama in the City -- high street retailer Sports Direct has issued a profits warning.</strong></p> <p>The company admitted that it could miss its target of \u00c2\u00a3420m profits by up to \u00c2\u00a340m, following weak sales since its last financial results on 10 December.</p> <p>It blamed:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153a deterioration of trading conditions on the high street and a continuation of the unseasonal weather over the key Christmas period\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> </blockquote> <p>Shares are down around 5%, making it the biggest faller in London.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f46ae97d21919efe05fc646cb26f2acbfb880860\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f46ae97d21919efe05fc646cb26f2acbfb880860/0_0_689_367/500.jpg\" alt=\"Sports Direct share price today\" width=\"500\" height=\"266\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sports Direct share price today</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomson Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Several other retailers have blamed the warm weather recently - including Next and Marks &amp; Spencer.

                "bodyText":"And in Europe the FTSEurofirst 300 fell 7% over the course of the week, marking its worst weekly performance since August 2011 amid the eurozone crisis. On that, gloomy, note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close the blog after what has been a tumultuous week. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back on Monday to cover all the week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial developments. To add to the New Year market gloom, the FTSE 100 has made its worst weekly start to the year since 2000. The Dow Jones Industrial had already recorded its worst ever 4-day opening at the start of the year and the modest rise so far on Friday is unlikely to improve things, unless there is a major revival before the close. A poor week for global stock markets finished in negative fashion despite earlier hopes of a recovery. The volatility and chaos caused by disappointing Chinese data and the failed attempt to control the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market with circuit breakers had sent investors running for the hills this week. But a 2% rise in the Chinese market earlier on Friday, following the abandonment of the circuit breakers and some support from the authorities for the yuan, gave some hope that a better day was in prospect. Better than expected US jobs figures put an end to that, prompting talk of further US rate rises and pushing the dollar higher, and by extension the oil price lower. With all the other geopolitical problems - North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible hydrogen bomb, tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran - as well as Chinese inflation data this Saturday, traders decided to take their money off the table ahead of the weekend. Market analyst Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said: A degree of calm in Chinese markets overnight has done little to placate sentiment, whilst better than expected employment data out of the US is also adding to woes. As global growth projections are trimmed whilst the Federal Reserve eyes the next interest rate hike, across the board it seems as if the economy will now face sustained headwinds. So Brent crude is currently down 1.6% at $33.18 a barrel, pushing commodity companies lower again. The FTSE 100 has lost nearly \u00c2\u00a385bn in value this week, recording its biggest weekly fall (5.28%) since August last year when the Chinese (yes, them again) sent ructions through global markets by devaluing the yuan. According to CNBC, the global market as measured by the S&amp;P Global Broad Market Index has lost more than $2trn this week. The final scores for the day showed: The FTSE 100 fell 41.64 points or 0.7% to 5912.44 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.31% to 9849.34 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 1.59% at 4333.76 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB lost 1.58% to 19,869.49 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 1.66% down 8909.2 In Greece, the Athens market is 0.81% lower at 585.98 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 62 points or 0.38%. One of the reasons for the decline in markets since the initial enthusiasm for the US jobs data is the feeling that the strong figures make a rate rise more likely. The disappointing wages growth might mitigate against an early rise, but the general feeling seems to be that even dearer borrowing costs are now more likely. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said: Heading into the close, the FTSE 100 has given up all its gains for the day, finishing a tough week on a miserable note. After a passable performance overnight for the Chinese market, hopes were high that stock markets in Europe and the US could claw back some of their own losses. So far on this side of the pond, that has not been the case. Equity traders have been left bereft of reasons to be optimistic this week, and it looks like the China fears of the past few days will remain with us as we head into a new week. US job numbers kicked off 2016 in fine form, well ahead of estimates, but the lack of wage growth was the fly in the ointment. The fear now is that such good numbers, even with inflation worries, will encourage the Fed to continue with its planned four hikes this year, putting fresh pressure on equity markets. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our economics editor Larry Elliott on the US jobs data: It seems just like the good old days. Almost 300,000 jobs were added to payrolls in America in the last month of 2015, continuing the upward trend of recent months. The US is once again living up to its reputation for being a gigantic jobs machine. Well, perhaps. Jobs are certainly being created at a good lick and the US has an unemployment rate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 5% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that the eurozone, at 10.5%, would die for. There are signs that people who had given up hope of finding work are being encouraged back into the labour market. Inevitably, this will lead to speculation that the Federal Reserve has left it too late to start raising interest rates and will now be forced to play catch up with a more rapid increase in the cost of borrowing than Wall Street is expecting. There is already talk of the Fed repeating December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate hike in March. The markets may be getting ahead of themselves. Employment and unemployment are lagging indicators: they provide a guide to what has happened to an economy in the past rather than what is happening now or what will happen in the future. Some of the forward-looking indicators \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for manufacturing, for example \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have been worryingly weak. The Fed will certainly be looking closely at the rate of job creation in the US, but it is equally interested in what is happening to wages. And the story here is that pay pressures are extremely muted. Average hourly earnings were flat in December and were up by just 2.5% over the year as a whole, a much weaker outcome than Wall Street had been anticipating. His full analysis is here: Markets are flagging after the initial burst of enthusiasm following the US jobs data. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now up 51 points, the FTSE 100 is just 2 points higher while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is down 42 points. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Initially buoyed by a bombastic non-farm figure the global indices couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sustain their surge, the US open ending up not being the white knight the European markets were looking for. Perhaps the superb non-farm figure (at 292,000 against the 203,000 expected and an upwards revised 252,000 last month) was tempered by falling wage growth (at 0.0% against the 0.2% forecast) and an unchanged unemployment rate. Or perhaps investors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t willing to take too much risk into the weekend, especially with the prospect of another awful start to Monday on the cards. Either way the Dow couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t manage to match the gains its futures were promising, at points flagging in the same way the European indices have done for much of the day. Chinese inflation figures are due over the weekend which could prompt further market ructions next week, given what has happened in the past few days. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something to put the latest US jobs figures in context: Back with China, and here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a graphic showing all the recent intervention in the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market: IG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Joshua Mahony is not surprised by the fluctuations in the dollar following the non-farm payroll report: But not everyone agrees. Economist Nina Skero at the Centre for Economics and Business Research does expect a US rate rise, but perhaps not until the third quarter of the year: Overall, the data add to the view that the US economic recovery steams ahead as wage gains and the unemployment rate approach long-run norms and as job creation figures, which admittedly can be rather volatile, remain high. In the aftermath of December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s historic Federal Open Market Committee decision and this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data releases perhaps the question on the minds of many is what is the future of US monetary policy? It is important to keep in mind that as one swallow does not a summer make, one rate hike does not a normalized monetary policy make. Even with the December rise interest rates in the US remain low and although the committee has restated its intention to maintain an accommodative monetary policy, it is reasonable to expect further hikes in 2016 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an expectation further strengthened by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong labour market data. However, this is not to say that sources of risk which could slow down the recovery do not exist, both domestically and globally. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour-market release shows a participation rate of 62.6% - well below pre-crisis levels. On the global front, equity markets turmoil and the slowdown in China are among the greatest concerns. The exact pace and extent of further interest rate hikes is difficult to predict given that the FOMC itself maintains that it is data-dependent and that it will continue to make interest rate decisions based on a series of indicators that it is monitoring rather than on a pre-set schedule. Keeping in mind that the US economy is expected to perform strongly in 2016, but also that December minutes show that the FOMC wants to observe the potentially delayed impact of the rate rise before making further hikes, Cebr expects interest rates to rise to 0.75% in the third quarter of 2016. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s someone who thinks the Federal Reserve could raise US interest rates at its March meeting despite the uninspiring wage data. Harm Bandholz, chief US economist at UniCredit Research said: Average hourly earnings were only flat between November and December. But thanks to a positive basis effect, the year on year rate ticked up to 2.5% from 2.3%. But while the Fed has said at a number of recent occasions that it puts more emphasis on the actual development of inflation rates when determining the appropriate path for short-term interest rates, we think that the unambiguous display of strength in the labor market will continue to bolster the confidence of FOMC members that (a) consumer spending will continue to power the US economy ahead \u00e2\u20ac\u201c despite global headwinds, and (b) that faster wage gains will eventually lift domestic inflation rates. Accordingly, we continue to expect three rate hikes for 2016, with the next one coming at the March meeting. On the jobs numbers themselves he said: To be sure, the labor market in the fourth quarter of 2015 most likely benefited from two special factors. First, there was a technical rebound in October, after the August and September numbers disappointed (in part due to seasonal adjustment issues). And in November and December, the unusually mild winter weather clearly supported employment in weather-sensitive areas, notably construction. There is, however, in our view no reason at all to question the underlying message of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and the previous couple of employment reports: The US labor market continues to be red-hot despite daily reports of global economic headwinds and financial market turmoil. The reason for this resilience \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as highlighted at several occasions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is that most of the value added and of the job creation in the US occurs in the services sector, which is barely affected by global developments. And this trend strengthened further in 2015. After in 2014 81% of jobs were created in services, this number rose to a whopping 94% in 2015; with another 10% coming from the construction sector! That leaves a very small share of the labor market exposed to the adverse impacts of global economic headwinds and low oil prices. As expected after the better than expected US jobs figures, Wall Street has moved ahead in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has added 110 points or 0.6% while the S&amp;P 500 is up 0.4% and the Nasdaq 0.7%. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story on the US non-farm payrolls: More detail on the US jobs: On the mining sector, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said: Employment in mining continued to decline in December (-8,000). After adding 41,000 jobs in 2014, mining lost 129,000 jobs in 2015, with most of the loss in support activities for mining. Further consideration of the wages data - and the implications for the Federal Reserve to hold fire on another rate rise - has seen the dollar lose some of its initial strength in the wake of the figures. Against the pound, the US currency is at $1.4572 compared to $1.4556 earlier. On the wages figures, Alex Lydall at Foenix Partners said: Not all components were positive in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s payroll print with Average Hourly Earnings being a particular concern falling 0.2% below forecasts. More jobs being created can only be seen as good news, but with hourly earnings lagging, labour cost inflation is still a slight concern to Janet Yellen. The strong payrolls number has vindicated the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to raise rates in December, said Rob Carnell at ING Bank, but the next increase may not come until June. He said: However, aside from this strong headline, there is not much else to get too excited about. The unemployment rate stood unchanged at 5.0%, still very low by any standards. One considerable disappointment in this survey, and perhaps a more important one as far as the pace of future fed hikes is concerned, is the wages figures. These grew at only a 2.5% year on year rise, and were flat over the month in December. Consensus had been looking for a modest 0.2% month on month increase, which would have taken wages into a range they had not inhabited since before the financial crisis. Instead, wages still seem to be struggling to rise. There was also no change in the average workweek, which tends to support the notion that wage pressures remain subdued, as increased hours frequently indicate a tight labour market and building wage pressures. Consequently, and even with the strong headline payrolls figure, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think these figures support a March rate hike, talk of which had been building over the past week following strong non-manufacturing ISM and ADP data. Our house forecast for the next hike in June is still, we think, a more likely outcome. Wages in the US were also on the rise, the figures show, but perhaps not enough for another interest rate hike at the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next meeting. The year on year gain was 2.5% in December compares to 2.3% in November, and is expected to pick up further as employment increases. However the average hourly earnings figure dropped a cent in December. The full US jobs report is here. Here are the charts showing the US job gains and unemployment rate: The jobs data may well have vindicated the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate decision, but there is no reason to be complacent, suggests Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com. He said: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s far too soon to know definitively if Fed Chair Janet Yellen and Co. made the right decision in raising interest rates last month. However, December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s well above expected non-farm payroll figures will confirm her assessment that the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest economy is in rude health. Despite the positive jobs figures, there are plenty of challenges on the horizon for Yellen to navigate, not least depressed oil prices and the Chinese economy playing havoc with exchanges the world over. Observers will be hoping that next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US retail sales figures show a bumper holiday trading period. The better than expected US jobs data could well prompt further rate rises this year, and this has pushed the dollar higher again. Sterling has hit the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s low of $1.4556 , down from $1.4590 beforehand, while the euro has fallen around 1%. Markets seem to like the news. The FTSE 100 is now up 47 points and is back over 6000, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has climbed 0.3% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has come off its lows, down 0.16%. US futures are now showing a 147 point opening on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The jobless rate however has come in line with forecasts at 5%. November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs figure has been revised up from 211,000 to 252,000 and October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s from 298,000 to 307,000. The non-farm payroll numbers for December showed a 292,000 rise compared to expectations of 200,000. That seems to back up the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to raise interest rates last month. Our Financial editor, Nils Pratley, has kicked the tires on Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit warning. His verdict - the City is changing its view of Mike Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s empire, fast. And can the weather really be blamed? Should a mild winter really upset trading at a sportswear chain? Sports Direct is not in the coats and jumpers business in the way that Marks &amp; Spencer and Next are. Warm temperatures, in theory, might even encourage better sales of trainers and tracksuits than freezing conditions. Doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Sports Direct have a strong online business to capture the switch to online shopping? And surely the weather hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t changed radically since management said four weeks ago it remained confident of achieving top-line profits of \u00c2\u00a3420m in the current financial year; now it says anything between \u00c2\u00a3380m and \u00c2\u00a3420m is possible. After this turbulent week, many in the City and on Wall Street just hope the US jobs report will be undramatic: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nearly time for the final major piece of economic data of the week -- the latest US jobs report for December. Economists expect around 200,000 new jobs were created last month: On a normal week, the Non-Farm Payroll is the main event. Today, it feels less important compared to the ructions over China. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also slightly less dramatic, given that the Federal Reserve took the plunge and raised interest rates last month. Of course, if Non-Farm is much weaker than expected, it could fuel concerns that the Fed hiked too early. Ransquawk have helpfully rounded up the Wall Street guesstimates: Wise heads in the City say that we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fixate on the exchange rate between the yuan and the US dollar. Instead, we should look at how the yuan is shaping up against a basket of other currencies (who will also have suffered from the stronger dollar too) And as these charts shows, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency has been more stable on this basis:: So, the time to panic might be when the trade-weighed yuan dives, as that would suggest Beijing was struggling to handle the situation. Senior City economist Stephen Lewis has issued a long note on China today, explaining why there is such anxiety about China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stability, and the consequences for the global economy if things turn very sour. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve cropped out some highlights below, as it provides some useful insight into the situation. Lewis points out that Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to rebalance its economy away from manufacturing and into consumption will inevitably hurt growth: It should be no surprise that a rapidly growing industrial economy such as China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is drifting into choppy financial waters. The advanced economies faced similar challenges at corresponding stages in their development. But, in coping with the consequences of financial turbulence, the advanced economies often suffered significant losses of output relative to potential. The Beijing authorities are professedly seeking to change China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic growth model from one which depends on exports and capital investment to one more firmly based on domestic consumption. But they may be over-estimating the extent to which politicians can choose how their economies grow. Since curbing growth in some sectors is usually easier than boosting it in others, the danger is that the attempt to re-orient the economy will result in overall weaker growth This is one reason, which seems to be widely acknowledged, why China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future growth could well fall short not only of recent rates but even of the Beijing authorities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 more conservative projections for the years to come. Then there are the demographic problems, which prompted the abolition of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One child per family\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rule: By 2050, those aged 65 or over could well stand at 38% of the labour force, slightly less favourable even than Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s present ratio. There could be ameliorating circumstances for China. There may be scope for more migration from the countryside to urban centres without loss of agricultural production, though much less than there used to be. There will very likely be support to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP growth from a shift in the urban workforce from low-productivity activities to higher-productivity occupations. Further, China would perhaps be less opposed on cultural grounds than Japan to immigrant labour, though there have been no moves in that direction yet. Indeed, the ruling Communist Party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highly developed sense of self-preservation might be expected to resist any disturbance of the status quo. At the same time, in the nearer term, China faces a unique problem, the result of the recent abandonment of the one-child policy in favour of a two-child policy. To the extent that this measure is effective in raising the birth rate, it will temporarily boost the dependency ratio, that is, the proportion that the non-working population, old and young, bears to those of working age. Those who are working will need to increase their output merely to meet the needs of a growing non-active population. There will likely be a reduced margin of savings to finance capital investment and thereby to support future growth. And then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the geopolitics,... The region is also a potential war-zone in a way that neither North America nor even Europe appears to be at the moment. Reports this week that North Korea has tested a hydrogen bomb is a reminder of the severity of the threat. Beyond the North Korean danger, both the East China Sea and the South China Sea are possible flashpoints. In the former area, there was a stand-off between Japan and China over the Senkaku (Diaoyu) islands through most of last year. But on 20 December an armed Chinese coast-guard vessel entered territorial waters that Japan claims around the islands. In response to these and other regional tensions, the Japanese government has proposed for the fiscal 2016/17 year a 1.5% increase in military spending to a highest-ever level. This is significant in view of the pressure to achieve reductions in other spending programmes. The Japanese government had been allowed, under the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s post-war constitution, the right of self-defence, which would have covered operations around the Senkaku islands, but Mr Abe nevertheless pressed for, and in September secured, an amendment that would allow Japan to afford military help to allies. This strongly suggests that the Abe government foresees the possibility of Japan taking part in the resistance to what several nations in the region regard as Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aggressive strategy in the South China Sea. It seems a long time since the Spratly islands first hit the headlines. It was as long ago as 1999 that a Filipino naval ship deliberately ran aground on one of those islands to establish a claim to the archipelago. Last year, in a dramatic development, it became clear that China was determinedly seeking to enforce its own title to the area when it built an artificial island on the foundation of the Mischief Reef and went on to claim, in contravention of UN rules, territorial waters around that construction. The US Navy has since sought to enforce freedom of the seas by disregarding China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretensions, thereby precipitating low-level exchanges with China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ships. Vietnam also believes it has interests to defend in the South China Sea. In an ominous development, its government announced on 23 December that it would be taking delivery from Russia of two more Kilo-class submarines to supplement the four it already deploys. These vessels are reckoned to be especially effective in relatively shallow waters (the Iranian navy has three of them). Vietnam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s army has put troop concentrations in the northern province on the border with China under \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchigh combat readiness\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This appears to be a defensive move. But investors should note that Vietnam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defence doctrine is not based on attacking China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s naval forces head-on, a contest that Vietnam could hardly expect to win. Rather, in the event of hostilities, the aim of the strategists in Hanoi would be to use the submarines to prey on merchant shipping heading to and from Chinese ports through the South China Sea. Their calculation is that the resulting prohibitive cost of freight insurance, or indeed the unwillingness of insurers to provide cover at all, would cripple China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade and economic activity. It could also topple China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial system, an objective looking less fanciful in the light of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s evidence of fragility. Given Vietnam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record in getting the better of super-powers, this strategic view should perhaps be taken more seriously than investors seem prepared to do at the moment. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drama in the City -- high street retailer Sports Direct has issued a profits warning. The company admitted that it could miss its target of \u00c2\u00a3420m profits by up to \u00c2\u00a340m, following weak sales since its last financial results on 10 December. It blamed: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a deterioration of trading conditions on the high street and a continuation of the unseasonal weather over the key Christmas period\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Shares are down around 5%, making it the biggest faller in London. Several other retailers have blamed the warm weather recently - including Next and Marks &amp; Spencer. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very plausible that demand for Sports Direct parka coats have fallen recently. But demand for other kit might have softened the blow? A month ago, The Guardian exposed working conditions at Sports Direct, where workers are chivvied by tannoy to work faster, and underwent searches after their shift was over. With trading conditions worsening, the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shareholders have a lot to ponder... The European stock market rally is petering out. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is now in the red today: Now this is interesting.. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s centraal bank has issued a statement, pledging to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153further liberalise\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd interest rates. Reuters has more details: The central bank also said it would make the yuan more international, keep the currency basically stable, further improve the currency formation mechanism and deepen reforms of the foreign exchange management system and financial institutions. The central bank will use medium-term loans, and pledged supplementary loans and credit policies to support key areas of the economy. The central bank also said it would maintain prudent monetary policy and flexibly use monetary policy tools to keep adequate liquidity in the banking system. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just tuning in, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what you need to know.... A sense of calm has returned to global stock markets today, following the worst start to a new year on record. But China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy remains a big fear, that could well dominate most of this year. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market has stabilised, closing 2% higher. Beijing authorities are thought to have been buying up shares, in an attempt to restore confidence. Traders were also encouraged that the yuan was fixed at a higher level today, easing fears of a currency war.But confidence in the Chinese authorities has been hit by this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drama: Christopher Balding, a professor of finance and economics at Peking University\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s HSBC business school, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Chinese investors want very similar things that international investors want: they want clarity, they want to understand what is going on, they want to know what the policies are, they want stability and [to know] what the rules are. The constant back-and-forth and changes just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t engender confidence that Beijing has really any idea what they are doing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: European stocks are all in the green today, ending a wild week on a stronger note. Jasper Lawler of CMC Market says: A rebound in Chinese shares and the price of oil provided some relief for shares in Europe on Friday after a brutal first week of the year. But despite the recovery, world markets have still suffered a remarkably poor start to the year. $4trn has been wiped off global shares, according to Bloomberg A handy reminder of how markets began 2016: When financial historians look back at this period, they will probably conclude that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ill-fated and short-lived circuit breaker was not the best idea ever created. It was meant to prevent mayhem, by briefly suspending trading when the market fell 5% and closing it off for the day if it lost another 2%. But as we saw on Monday, and Thursday, it actually sparked crashes as investors rushed to sell shares at the first sign that the market was going down. So, full credit to Beijing for culling it yesterday - a move that was immortalised by the FT: Alastair McCaig of IG says the abolishment of the circuit breaker helped Chinese shares to rise today. Human psychology has had a strong hand to play in the way Chinese markets have behaved. The removal of the system that suspends the market should it fall too much has, ironically, seen the fear of entrapment reduced with Asian investors. Britain could lose almost 1% of global economic output if China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy suffers a serious hard landing, according to analysis from Oxford Economics. And that would actually mean the UK gets off relatively lightly, compared to the pain which emerging markets would suffer. Over in Hong Kong, investors are catching their breath after the worst new year week since 2000. The Hang Seng index closed higher today, up 0.6%. But heavy losses earlier this week mean it lost 6.6% so far this year. Dr Nikos Paltalidis, lecturer in Finance at Durham University Business School, also reckons fears over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market are overblown. He points out that shares did soar by 50% last year - a clear sign of a speculative bubble that is now deflating. However, that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that the selloff won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cause serious consequences. Paltalidis says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The sudden wave of concern about China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s looming economic catastrophe is overblown. However, the burst of the stock market bubble, increases the concern about the knock on effect on the real-estate market. Chinese policymakers might need to respond with additional currency devaluation, and if things get worse, some form of quantitative easing, to avoid a collapse in asset prices. Despite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s small recovery, European stock markets are on track for their worst week since last August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout (which was also triggered by China). Richard Hunter, Head of Equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, says investors have adopted \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the brace position\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd this week:, wiping around 5% off the major indices. What should have been a perky start to 2016, with New Year optimism underpinned by portfolio positioning as investors buy stocks, has been eclipsed by ongoing concerns on global growth, the oil price and negative geopolitical developments. The general souring of sentiment had been exacerbated by the Chinese circuit breakers, along with Fed minutes which questioned the strength of belief in the December hike and sellers apparently pushing against an open door.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd One of Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top allies has called for calm over China. Speaking on Bloomberg TV a moment ago, Michael Fuchs argued that the panic over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets has been overdone. I do believe that China is getting back on track. It is still tracking a 7% growth rate - 7% growth is a decent number.... I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not so pessimistic that China is going to be in a deep crisis. But Fuchs also warned that German industry, such as car markets and chemicals producers, will suffer if China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy weakens. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sense of relief in the foreign exchange markets this morning, as emerging market currencies recover. Ilya Spivak, currency strategist at DailyFX, has the details: Investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 mood brightened after two days of aggressive selling after China suspended circuit-breakers that shut off stock market trade after just 14 minutes of activity yesterday and set the daily Yuan fix a bit higher. The risk-geared Australian, Canadian and New Zealand Dollars outperformed while the safety-linked Japanese Yen proved weakest on the session. In a few weeks Beijing will have a window of opportunity to take fresh steps to shore up its economy: After 30 minutes of trading, European markets are all showing small gains: This week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ructions have not improved Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation for economic competence. As Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services puts it: As we have argued before, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s authorities have clearly bitten far more than they can chew in their markets and economy reform efforts, with a clear sense that they are at best fumbling in the dark emerging. He also warns that the current calm in the markets is probably only \u00e2\u20ac\u0153transitory\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The oil price is rising this morning, in another signal that markets are a little calmer this morning. Brent crude has gained 1.5% to $34.26 per barrel, having hit fresh 11-year lows yesterday. Mining stocks are recovering some ground, with commodity trader Glencore up 2.3% and Rio Tinto up 1.5%. Again, a small move - as Accendo Markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Mike van Dulken points out: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets are open, and showing some small gains in early trading. The FTSE 100 has risen by 20 points, or 0.3%, to 5974, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX is 0.4% higher. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty small potatoes, given the Footsie lost 2% yesterday while the DAX shed 3%. How much market value has been destroyed in this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market rout? According to CNBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jacob Pramuk, we have lost.....(puts on Dr Evil voice) two trillion dollars! He explains: The S&amp;P Global Broad Market Index, which tracks global stock performance, has lost $2.23 trillion in market value this year. For perspective, the total trumps estimated U.S. student loan debt of more than $1 trillion and would represent roughly 12 percent of U.S. government debt. But that might not capture the full scale of the rout. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s widest measure of listed companies shows a four trillion dollar loss: The Financial Times also flags up that Beijing authorities appears to be buying shares today: By lunch time the indices were up, amid reports that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state-backed funds were once again buying up shares On Thursday the securities regulator said that its promulgation of permanent rules restricting stock sales by large shareholders did not indicate that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153national team\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is withdrawing from the market. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Its market stability function will not change,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the agency said. The statement marks a shift in tone from late August, when the regulator said that the national team would halt regular share purchases. More here: China markets motor higher in choppy trading Good morning from London, where City traders are arriving at their desks and looking nervously at developments in Asia overnight. And the latest news is that the Chinese market has just closed up for the day. The Shanghai composite index jumped 2%, or 61 points, to finish at 3,186 points, following the wild ride which Martin has been tracking through this blog. It does appear that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state-backed funds have been active in the market, buying up shares and giving retail investors a little confidence. Signs that Beijing has been intervening to support the yuan have helped shore up confidence too. Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to abandon China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new circuit-breaker rules has also paid off (they had been fuelling the crisis, as investors were rushing ditch shares before the market fell 7% and was shut for the day). But it really has been a turbulent start to the year. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has lost 10% of its value this week - the worst run since the Great Fall of China last summer. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for me to sign off from Sydney and pass you over seamlessly to Graeme Wearden in London for what should be an interesting day. Thanks for following us. While not a great start to the year for the Japanese market. This is how the European opening looks. Still a bit of a mixed bag. Associated Press has just put together a thought-provoking three reasons for concern about the Chinese economy. A tumbling currency which has unnerved world markets but which is probably up to 8% overvalued. Transition to an economy based less on cheap manufacturing and more on consumer spending and services. Mismanagement such as poor communication and bungled execution of policies such as the ill-fated \u00e2\u20ac\u0153circuit breaker\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd have aggravated an already worsening situation. Japan has just closed down at an estimated cost this week of $320bn in market capitalisation. Ouch. Better day so far in Shanghai and Shenzen as this chart on the CSI300. While this picture of the yuan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s devaluation tells us the story from a different angle. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153national team\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd appears to have steadied the economic ship after state intervention to prop up the yuan prompted a rally in Chinese stocks The bluechip CSI300 and the Shanghai Composite were up 3% in afternoon trade Elsewhere the Nikkei was down 0.45% and the Australian market finished 0.39% lower. Mixed picture from European futures trade ahead of the open Questions about sustainability of Chinese policy from Japanese finance minister Oil has risen off 12-year lows to $34.31 a barrel but key metals such as copper and nickel still suffering For a full story on the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s developments so far, my colleague Tom Phillips has just filed this report from Beijing: In another snippet from Tom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report, there are rumours that the head of the Chinese regulator, Xiao Gan, will be resigning tomorrow. IG analyst Angus Nicholson said in a note today that: Confidence in China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to manage their capital markets has only been further damaged after they announced the removal of their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153circuit breakers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after only being in place for four days (sending the market limit down 50% of the time) and rumours circulating that CSRC head Xiao Gang would be resigning tomorrow. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll try to find out more about that as the day goes on. In broader economic news, a strong jobs figure is expected from the US later today. The magnificently named non-farm payrolls are due on Friday lunchtime US time and are expected to show that employers likely maintained a fairly strong pace of hiring in December. Nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 200,000 jobs, just a slight step down from the 211,000 created in November, according to a Reuters survey of economists. That puts unemployment at around 5% and might further calm market nerves. Also to some extent justifies the Federal Reserve decision to tighten monetary policy last month. Back to the Beijing competence theme with the Wall Street Journal weighing in... The ASX/S&amp;P 200 index has closed below 5000 points after a sixth straight session in the red. The benchmark was 19.5 points, or 0.39%, lower at 4,990.8, while the broader All Ordinaries index was down 19.4 points, or 0.38 per cent, at 5,049.4, Australian Associated Press reports. My colleague in Beijing, Tom Phillips, says China has mustered the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153national team\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to fight to avoid the kind of stock market turmoil that left president Xi Jinping embarrassed last year. Tom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full report will be on the website soon but he quotes Christopher Balding, a professor of finance and economics at Peking University\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s HSBC Business School, saying that Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic flip-flopping and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wild swings in policymaking\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd had severely damaged confidence. Chinese investors want very similar things that international investors want: they want clarity, they want to understand what is going on, they want to know what the policies are, they want stability and [to know] what the rules are. The constant back-and-forth and changes just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t engender confidence that Beijing has really any idea what they are doing. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a European view: A couple of hours to go before trading opens in Europe and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a mixed picture about what is going to happen there. According to IG, the FTSE 100 will open up 13 points while the Dax in Geramy looks likely to open down 19 points. Some straighter business news out of China today shows that demand for electric cars is growing. BYD, a Chinese carmaker backed by Warren Buffett\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, raised its 2015 profit estimate to a five-year high, citing strong demand for its electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles, Reuters has reported. Government policy has helped boost demand, it said. Despite a slowing economy and volatile financial markets, Chinese automakers such as BYD and Geely Automobile Holdings have flagged bumper profits for 2015, boosted by favourable government policies and consumer preferences that stoked demand for their products. BYD said late on Thursday it expects net profit attributable to shareholders to climb between 518% and 557% for 2015, compared with an earlier forecast of a rise in the range of 435% to 481%. Nerves do seem to have been settled by the PBOC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s yuan intervention/fix policy. The steps today to fix the yuan firmer and then get state-owned banks to prop up the offshore yuan value look contradictory in the light of previous days\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 actions. But in the absence of the circuit breaker it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s done the trick for now. The CSI300 and Shanghai Comp have paused for lunch up 2.75% and 2.39% respectively. The Nikkei is up a smidgeon but the ASX is still trailing at 0.53% down But Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy still looks a bit cack-handed to some: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good day for charts. Expert opinion is quite divided about the state of play in China. Tian Weidong, analyst at Kaiyuan Securities in Shanghai put what might be described as the party line: The market is back to normal Investors can buy and sell as they wish. Under the circuit breaker mechanism, the market was suffocated. But other were a little more nuanced in their assessment of a day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading that hs seen the Chinese markets climb back into positive territory despite the lack of circuit breaker. Mohamed El-Erian, the chief economic adviser at Allianz, said China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to suspend a stock circuit breaker made sense, but the implementation and timing did not. China realized that it had very tight limits on the markets, he told Bloomberg, which did more harm than good. They realised this, which is good news. The bad news is they took it off at a very peculiar time and did so without a whole set of compensating measures. The mainland Chinese markets are coming up for their lunch break, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good time to check on the scoreboard. Asia Pacific markets are all up, except Australia. Nikkei up 0.39% (at lunch) CSI300 up 2.8% Shanghai Composite up 2.2% ASX/S&amp;P 200 down 0.43% Hang Seng up 2.2% Kospi up 0.08% Oil may have rallied a bit but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still a poor outlook for prices of other industrial commodities. London Copper has dropped 1% to $4,480 a tonne this afternoon, nearing 2009 lows. Nickel fell 2%, while lead and zinc eased nearly 1%. None of that is great for the Australian-Anglo mining behemoth BHP Billiton which is down again by 0.43% this afternoon on the Australian stock market. Rio Tinto, which is not exposed to oil prices in the same way, is up more than 1.5%. And Australian gold producers are doing well out of the chaos. The precious metal rose to a two-month high of $1,113.2, a gain of 4.9 percent so far this year. The Japanese finance minister Taro Aso has warned that the Chinese might find it hard to continue supporting the yuan given the decline in its foreign currency reserves revealed on Thursday. Aso said Tokyo that further declines could trigger further capital flight from China and potentially set off competitive currency devaluations in other countries. Foreign exchange reserves have already fallen this much due to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s purchases of yuan to support its own currency, so it could be difficult to continue. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign exchange reserves fell $512.66 billion in 2015 to $3.33 trillion, central bank data showed on Thursday. $107.9 billion was accounted for in December alone. Reuters quotes a trader at a European bank in Shanghai that state-owned banks were offering dollar liquidity at 6.59 yuan per dollar in an attempt to push it higher. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confused picture, not helped by the difference in the onshore and offshore value of the yuan. Reuters explains what happened after the PBOC set the yuan at 6.5636 today, with the currency moving towards that fix from an overnight close of 6.5929 backed by state-owned banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 intervention: The onshore yuan recovered to 6.5887 in morning trade, while the offshore yuan was about 1.4 percent weaker at 6.6798, narrowing a spread that reached around 2 percent a day earlier, making the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency management task more complicated. After its sharply lower fix on Thursday, the PBOC had later sown confusion by reportedly intervening heavily to defend the yuan in offshore trade, reversing a decline of more than 1 percent that took it to a record low of 6.7600 per dollar. That left dealers at a loss to know what the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aims were. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The sharp drop has led to speculation that China is letting go of the reins on the CNY (yuan), or perhaps targeting faster depreciation to reach an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcequilibrium\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 level,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd wrote analysts at Barclays, while conceding that no one was really sure. The Chinese central bank, the PBOC, is intervening to support the yuan, according to Reuters. The global oil benchmark, Brent crude, has rallied 2% today after China boosted the yuan. Brent had risen 56 cents to $34.31 a barrel as of 12.50 AEDT (0150 GMT), having hit $34.72 earlier. It settled down 48 cents at $33.75 in the previous session, after marking $32.16, a level last seen in April 2004. US crude was trading 63c higher at $33.90 a barrel. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not easy to keep track this morning but here are the main points. Asia Pacific has seen wild trading on the main stock markets amid continued uncertainty and doubts about Chinese policy The People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to fix the yuan firmer initially boosted equities after a nervous start But trading has been volatile: Shanghai Composite and CSI300 index both more than 1% higher after first lurching up, then down. Nikkei up 0.3%; ASX/S&amp;P 200 down 0.5%; Kospi up 0.16%; Hang Seng up 1.09% Oil rises off 12-year lows $34.31 a barrel Aussie dollar rises, while Japanese yen drops Australian retail sales met expectations with 0.4% growth in November It should be said at this point that the volatility of the Chinese markets is much more significant for what it tells us about policy-making in Beijing than the intrinsic importance of the numbers. Most people accept that the share prices in China are totally overvalued and must be allowed to fall. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the disorderly manner in which this is happening which makes it interesting. My colleague Nils Pratley wrote on Monday that Beijing risked making the same mistakes this week as they did in the northern summer by stopping prices finding their natural level. Read what Nils had to say here. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty much come to pass: Are you keeping up at the back? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a confused picture today and no mistake. The chart in this tweet is quite helpful though. Thanks to Patrick McGee of the FT. Traders were following China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead upwards. But the Chinese markets are all over the place. After an early rally, the Shanghai Composite index and the CSI300 index of leading shares are heading south again. How low will they go? Decent Australian retail sales for November helped boost the ASX. They were up 0.4% boosted by a 1% rise in the cafes and restaurants category, yet proof if any were needed that Australians just love to eat out. Household goods sales increased by 0.9%. Total retail spending was $24.77bn in November, up from $24.66bn in October, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said. Stock markets have rallied across Asia Pacific. The Nikkei is down just 0.24%, while the ASX/S&amp;P 200 in Australia is now into positive territory. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the first time the PBOC has fixed the yuan stronger in nine days. A lower number equals a stronger fix because it relates to what it takes to buy one US dollar. The People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China set the midpoint rate at 6.5636 per dollar prior to market open, firmer than the previous fix of 6.5646, and firmer than the previous day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s closing quote 6.5929. That is the first time the PBOC has firmed the midpoint against the dollar in 9 trading days, after it allowed the biggest fall in the yuan in five months on Thursday, pressuring regional currencies and sending global stock markets tumbling as investors feared it would trigger competitive devaluations. The Australian dollar is an immediate beneficiary of this stronger yuan fix. The Aussie has gained almost half a cent in the last 10 minutes and is now buying US70.60c. Equities following upwards. The yuan fix is a good deal more stabilising than previous ones this week. Last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close was 6.5929 to the US dollar which means the PBOC has opted for a more confidence-boosting currency level for now. Yuan fixed at 6.5636 Only a few minutes before the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China announces today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fix for the yuan. A weaker than expected fix has twice triggered market crashes this week so this is going to be a key moment. Yesterday China published figures for foreign reserves which showed it was burning through cash to prop up the yuan. So will they stick or twist today? Good morning and welcome to the live blog. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been another lively morning on the financial markets and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tense ahead of the opening of the Chinese mainland markets at 12.30 AEDT. The Chinese regulator has scrapped its controversial \u00e2\u20ac\u0153circuit-breaker\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd mechanism which has been triggered twice this week when losses hit 7%, forcing the markets to cease trading. Added to the continued devaluation of the yuan, traders around the world have drawn the conclusion that the Chinese authorities know something about the state of their economy that fairly rosy official figures are not showing. So will prices be allowed to fall to a fair value after six months of restrictions on sales? Or will the state instead intervene with mass buying of stocks? Perhaps they will try to moderate the yuan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent devaluation in order to boost confidence? Meanwhile, the market in Australia \u00e2\u20ac\u201c always the first major market to face the new ball, as it were \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has fallen more than 1%. More here:",

Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Looking ahead, the US quarterly earnings season gets underway with Alcoa reporting after the close tonight, whilst tomorrow morning UK manufacturing and industrial production data will be under scrutiny in the morning as traders optimistically look for some overdue good news from the domestic economy.

The only guide posts are that the ceiling is set by producer hedging while the floor is set by investor and consumer appetite to buy. As a result, non-fundamental factors, such as the US dollar were arguably more important price drivers in 2015. In fact, when we assess the more than 30% decline in oil since early November, much of it is attributable to the appreciation in the trade-weighted US dollar.... With the oil market likely to remain oversupplied throughout 2016, we see no reason for this trading paradigm to change.</p> <p>Given the continued US dollar appreciation, $20-25 oil price scenarios are possible simply due to currency....For every 1% move in the trade-weighted US dollar, we tend to see a 2-4% move in Brent. Therefore, a 3.2% increase in the US dollar, as implied by a 15% yuan devaluation, could push down oil 6-15% ($2-5 a barrel), which could put oil in the high $20s. If other currencies move as well, the move in the US dollar and oil could be even greater.

But as Magnus explains, authorities are more likely to keep weak borrowers afloat:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Even though government officials speak occasionally about the need to allow corporate defaults and restructuring, and recognise bad debts in the banking system, the political and institutional blockages to such outcomes are formidable. If they could be overcome, adjustment might be softened, for example, by significant tax cuts for households and spending transfers from the state to the private sector. But the political will is not there.</p> <p>Instead, all we are likely to see is more credit easing, in the wake of the six initiatives since late 2014 to cut interest rates and banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reserve requirements, albeit to no economic effect.

                "bodyText":"For a while it looked like European shares were going to shake off their worries about China, despite a 5% fall in that country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market after the weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation figures. But with oil continuing to plunge - down to a new 12 year low at one point - investors found themselves facing another tricky day. The FTSE 100 fell to a three year low, while other European markets also ended in the red. And ahead of the US reporting season, Wall Street seems to be struggling to find direction. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: Looking ahead, the US quarterly earnings season gets underway with Alcoa reporting after the close tonight, whilst tomorrow morning UK manufacturing and industrial production data will be under scrutiny in the morning as traders optimistically look for some overdue good news from the domestic economy. Attention will also be on Chinese equities, although a relative absence of high profile data from Beijing in the short term may help calm nerves here. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 40.61 points or 0.69% at 5871.83 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax was down 0.25% at 9825.07 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.49% lower at 4312.74 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.57% to 19,756.14 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 0.26% lower at 8886.1 In Greece, the Athens market lost 0.73% to 581.68 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 8 points lower. Brent crude, meanwhile, has slumped nearly 6% to $31.63 a barrel. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. The FTSE 100 has fallen to its lowest level since early December 2012, down 40.61 points to 5871.83. Given the weak oil price - and copper falling to its lowest level since 2009 on continuing concerns about the Chinese economy - markets are now edging lower. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down marginally, while the FTSE 100 is off 22 points and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac are both down around 15 points after a rather more positive start to the day. Oil continues to fall, and has taken the shine off any early stock market gains. Brent crude is 4% lower at $32.17 a barrel while US crude is down below $32 to i12 year lows. The general concerns about oversupply and lack of demand have been brought into focus by a Morgan Stanley report saying the oil price could fall to $20 a barrel, as mentioned earlier. The bank said crude could fall further due to devaluation of the Chinese currency: In an oversupplied market, there is no intrinsic value for crude oil. The only guide posts are that the ceiling is set by producer hedging while the floor is set by investor and consumer appetite to buy. As a result, non-fundamental factors, such as the US dollar were arguably more important price drivers in 2015. In fact, when we assess the more than 30% decline in oil since early November, much of it is attributable to the appreciation in the trade-weighted US dollar.... With the oil market likely to remain oversupplied throughout 2016, we see no reason for this trading paradigm to change. Given the continued US dollar appreciation, $20-25 oil price scenarios are possible simply due to currency....For every 1% move in the trade-weighted US dollar, we tend to see a 2-4% move in Brent. Therefore, a 3.2% increase in the US dollar, as implied by a 15% yuan devaluation, could push down oil 6-15% ($2-5 a barrel), which could put oil in the high $20s. If other currencies move as well, the move in the US dollar and oil could be even greater. Hence, we remain bearish, even after the notable downward move already. Back with UK stocks and Mike Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sports Direct International is the biggest faller in the FTSE 100 at the moment, down nearly 6% at 407.4p. The controversial company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares plunged 15% on Friday - wiping more nearly half a billion off its market value - after it warned annual profits would be \u00c2\u00a340m lower than expected. It blamed a fall in the number of shoppers visiting the high streets, and unseasonably warm weather in the run-up to Christmas. The profits warning came just a month after a Guardian investigation revealed that Sports Direct effectively pays thousands of temporary workers below the national minimum wage of \u00c2\u00a36.70 an hour and subjects warehouse staff to a regime of searches and surveillance. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall follows a number of analyst downgrades in the wake of the profit warning. Cantor Fitzgerald slashed its target price from 700p to 480p with a hold recommendation, with analyst Freddie George saying: At the interim results, we gave the company the benefit of the doubt even though retail sales were disappointing. In view of the lack of transparency on strategy and in view that the company is likely to be eliminated from the FTSE100 over the next quarter, we are now taking a more cautious view on valuation. We are thus reducing our target price to 480p from 700p, which on our revised pre-tax profit forecasts, downgraded by around 14%, broadly values the company at 14 times full year 2016 earnings. We are, however retaining our hold recommendation on the stock, which has declined by almost 40% since the interim results announcement. Liberum cut from buy to hold and said: At the interims in December we downgraded 2016-18 pretax profit by between 6% and 8%. Following the trading update on 8 January we downgrade again, by 8% in 2016 and 6% in 2018. While the latest update only related to weakness over the past month we see a lack of earnings momentum in the short to medium term, and a lack of European M&amp;A. Sports Direct has levers that it can pull, notably automating the distribution centre, but will not do so until the future shape of the business is clear. The US stock market is making a valiant attempt to put the problems in China behind it. The Wall Street opening bell has just been rung, and the Dow Jones industrial average has jumped by 102 points in the first few minutes. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a gain of 0.63%. The broader S&amp;P 500 index is up a similar amount, while the technology-focused Nasdaq index has gained 0.8%. A quick recap: 1) China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has suffered another day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heavy losses, losing 5%m to close at its lowest level since September. Investors remained anxious, despite Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to reassure them: XTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunug says: Fears have heightened over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ailing economy and with confusion towards the unexpected devaluations leaving market participants questioning Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overall policy intentions; global sentiment may remain heavily depressed. 2) European stock markets have shrugged off the latest selloff. The FTSE 100 is pretty flat today, while the German and French markets are leading other markets slightly higher: Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says markets are in a state of flux, fixated on China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems. The conditions are not that of a calm rising bull market or a raging bear market but a volatile sideways price range, still undecided which way to break. 3) Concerns over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowing economy pulled copper down to a seven-year low. Figures released over the weekend showed that manufacturers continued to slash prices, suggesting weak demand. 4) Oil has dropped towards 11-year lows today, with Brent crude shedding 2% to $32.91 per barrel - sparking fresh woe for the Russian ruble. Analysts at Morgan Stanley have predicted that oil could slump to $20/barrel, if the US dollar were to spike (which could happen if the global economy falters). 5) Analysts fear that if Beijing mishandles the crisis, it could trigger a wave of corporate defaults. 6) Luxury carmaker Rolls-Royce has already been hit by China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes, reporting that sales in the country shrank by 54% last year. Luxury carmaker Rolls-Royce has just reported a sharp decline in sales in China Sales to Chinese customers shrank by 54% in 2015, the company says; the latest indication that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has weakened in the last year. Rolls-Royce, which is part of Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BMW, warns that: In China, significant headwinds impacted negatively on the entire luxury sector and Rolls\u00e2\u20ac\u2018Royce was not immune to these developments. The slump took the shine off some otherwise decent results from Rolls-Royce. It delivered a total of 3,785 new cars globally during 2015, down from a record high of 4,063 in 2014. Rolls-Royce sales can give a good insight into which parts of the global economy are hot, or not. In 2015, it says it managed a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong performances in all global regions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, apart from China. That includes record sales were reported in Asia Pacific (up 13%), the Middle East (up 4%) and North America (up 6%). It also grew sales in these countries: Korea: up 73% Japan (up 7%), Qatar (up 21%), Russia (up 1%), UK (up 2%) South Africa (up 7%). And apparently it sold more \u00e2\u20ac\u0153super-luxury\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd cars (costing \u00e2\u201a\u00ac200,000 or more) than anyone else. But China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems ended a five-year run of rising sales. Torsten M\u00c3\u00bcller-\u00c3\u2013tv\u00c3\u00b6s, chief executive, says it was a tough 12 months: \u00e2\u20ac\u01532015 was a year of tremendous challenge for the entire luxury industry. I am very proud of our success which was achieved against a backdrop of considerable global uncertainty.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full statement released a few minutes ago. Three months ago, M\u00c3\u00bcller-\u00c3\u2013tv\u00c3\u00b6s admitted being surprised by the rapid developments in China, and cited Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anti-corruption drive as one factor. He told the BBC that: The whole anti-corruption campaign... is very much around investigating where your money is from, to whom you are related and so on and so forth. That of course scares people who are quite affluent, and no one wants to be visible currently in that kind of environment and people are shying away from... obvious luxury goods, and that is not only true of cars but for jewellery and for precious watches and so on.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top tax official, Lin Homer of HMRC, has surprised us by resigning today. As my colleague Sean Farrell points out, her tenure has been marked by criticism over the way HMRC tackled tax avoidance by large companies, among other issues: Homer, who was made a dame in the New Year honours list, has been the subject of political controversy during her tenure. She revealed in February that most UK clients of HSBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Swiss business who settled with the tax authorities did so under an extraordinarily lenient agreement. Homer also apologised in November that HMRC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s giant call centre had failed to answer a quarter of the 50m calls it received each year. More here: There are signs that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deteriorating economy is bottoming out. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to new monthly economic indicators published by the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) today, based on the latest economic data. But the Paris-based think-tank also sees signs that the UK recovery is faltering, while the eurozone continues to grow slowly and steadily. The financial markets could be on track for a rough year, having posted the worst start to a new year ever. Tim Edwards, senior director of Index Investment Strategy at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, has pulled together some charts showing how week 1 of the year often sets the tone. Major markets lost around 5% last week, so this chart really doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bode well. But at least the opening week isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as important as early September -- a time dominated by European elections, and investors returning to their desks after their holidays. Edwards explains: Historically speaking, years that have started badly have more frequently ended badly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and to a greater extent than might be supposed, given the expected impact of a single week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance. However, those who wish to divine the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s yearly performance from that of a single week might be better off waiting until September. One bad week doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make a recession, but this research from JP Morgan suggests the global economy has come off the boil in the last month or so: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s situation-as-normal in the commodities market this morning, with copper dropping to its lowest price since spring 2009. Copper had managed a brief rally at the turn of the year, but has been (predictably) hit by the latest turmoil in China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s markets. Any recovery could be a few weeks away, at least, according to analyst Daniel Hynes of ANZ in Sydney: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Expectations coming into 2016 were for a better macro environment, but the likelihood is that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not going to see any real rebound until well after the Chinese New Year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wall Street is expected to rise when trading begins in four hours time. Perhaps investors are becoming less skittish about China, and turning their attention to other issues. The next US earnings season begins this week, with major companies reporting how they fared in the last three months. That will show how the American economy is faring, as David Kelly, chief global strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management explains: These numbers will still be impacted by lower oil prices and a higher dollar. However, the year-over-year comparisons on these issues are easier than in the third quarter and should result in a return to positive year-over-year growth in operating earnings. Overall, the US economy isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t booming, profits aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t soaring and China isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t out of the woods. Interesting developments in Greece overnight - the country has a new opposition leader. And the new man, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, is a serious reformer with the ability to shake up the Greek economy should he take power one day. Our Athens correspondent, Helena Smith, explains why it matters: For Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shattered business and finance worlds, the election of the reform minded Harvard-educated Kyriakos Mitsotakis to the helm of the main opposition New Democracy is generating thinly disguised excitement this morning. Aides are talking of the centre-right party \u00e2\u20ac\u0153undergoing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a Tony Blair moment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c albeit 15 years late. At 47, Mitsotakis not only speaks the language of realpolitik, his innate cosmopolitanism and experience in banking are of natural appeal to the international creditors keeping the debt-stricken country afloat. The secret of Mitsotakis is that he will appeal to social democrats, pro-European liberals who now want Greece to change through reform. To date, the leftist prime minister Alexis Tsipras has been given a free reign because of the power vacuum that the weak opposition has presented. Mitsotakis sees himself in the tradition of European progressives: although fiercely pro-market his stance on issues from gay rights to greens is decidedly moderate and forward looking. By moving New Democracy to the centre, the newly installed leader will not only give Tsipras a run for his money but force him to implement the pro-market \u00e2\u201a\u00ac86bn bailout program if he wants to stay in power. That automatically increases the chances of early elections. In that sense Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote may well be a ground-breaking event of potentially seismic repercussions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a major challenge not only for Tsipras but New Democracy itself. With 75 % of the vote counted Mitsotakis had won 51.6 % against 48.4% for his challenger Vangelis Meimarakis widely identified with the old political establishment. Even if New Democracy collapses in disarray \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and as it is bitterly divided this is not ruled out \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Mitsotakis may well attract support from the centre left who see in him a viable alternative for reform. His surprise win over Meimarakis (despite his name conjuring old-school nepotism as the scion of a political dynasty) is a first step in that direction. In a week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time, high-flying members of the global elite (plus a bunch of journalists) will gather in Davos for the annual World Economic Forum (WEF). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chance to discuss the global situation, cut deals, and plot the way ahead - at a crucial time for the world economy. But this year, Angela Merkel won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be there. Instead, the German chancellor will stay at home to deal with an escalating domestic crisis over migration, following scores of assaults and robberies at Cologne on New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eve. The FT got the story last night, saying: With a lot on her plate, she [Merkel] had already decided well before the Cologne attacks not to make her regular trip to the Davos World Economic Forum, the global leaders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 gathering this month. Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s camp insist there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing unusual here: Merkel doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go to Davos every year - she skipped 2014 after suffering a skiing injury. But generally, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appeared to enjoy WEF - and I suspect she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be missed. But given the growing criticism at home over her refugee strategy, this probably isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the time to be rubbing shoulders with Davos Man (and Woman). The recent gyrations in the markets are is forcing City economists to rip up their oil price forecasts. Morgan Stanley has predicted that Brent crude could slide to as low at $20 per barrel this year, if the US dollar continues to strengthen [any commodity priced in dollars would fall if the US currency goes up in value] They told clients today that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Given the continued U.S. dollar appreciation, $20-$25 oil price scenarios are possible simply due to currency. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The U.S. dollar and non-fundamental factors continue to drive oil prices.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The fundamentals of oil aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t great either, given the risks from China. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why French bank SocGen has taken a knife to its predictions too. It now reckons Brent will average $42.50 per barrel this year, not almost $54.... There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drama in the international currency markets, where the Chinese currency has strengthened against the US dollar. The yuan has gained 1% in so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcoffshore trading\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, reaching a one-week high of 6.6170 yuan to the US dollar. That comes after Beijing fixed the on-shore yuan at a stronger level than last week, at 6.5807 yuan to $1. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a gain of around 0.2%, which could be taken as a signal that China isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t planning a major yuan devaluation. And that is helping to push shares higher in Europe - where the German DAX and French CAC are now around 0.8% higher. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ructions in the Asian markets: Experienced City economist and China-watcher George Magnus has written about the China crisis in the Financial Times. He points out that the big worry isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market, but the possibility of credit defaults. And there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of potential for problems here. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corporate and local government debt burden has swelled to around 250% of GDP, by some measures, up from \u00e2\u20ac\u02dconly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 100% in 2008. With the economy slowing, some defaults could be inevitable. But as Magnus explains, authorities are more likely to keep weak borrowers afloat: Even though government officials speak occasionally about the need to allow corporate defaults and restructuring, and recognise bad debts in the banking system, the political and institutional blockages to such outcomes are formidable. If they could be overcome, adjustment might be softened, for example, by significant tax cuts for households and spending transfers from the state to the private sector. But the political will is not there. Instead, all we are likely to see is more credit easing, in the wake of the six initiatives since late 2014 to cut interest rates and banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reserve requirements, albeit to no economic effect. The credit binge, then, will continue until it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. The oil price is heading towards new 11-year lows this morning, giving the Russian ruble another knock. Brent crude has shed 3%, or around one dollar per barrel to just $32.58, close to last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lows. That heralds more pain for oil producers in the Middle East, and also Russia. Its currency has hit a fresh low this morning, at 76 rubles to the dollar. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much panic in Europe about today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff in China, yet anyway. The French and Italian markets have crept higher at the opening, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX is only down 0.2%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another wet and gloomy morning in the City. And that matches the mood in the markets, where the FTSE 100 has dropped 21 points 0r 0.4% in early trading. Our old friends, the mining stocks, are leading the selloff. Anglo American, Antofagasta, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto are all down between 1.6% and 2%. They continue to be hit by fears that China could knock the global economy off course, meaning weaker demand for materials such as iron ore, copper, coal, nickel, zinc. City experts have spent the weekend fretting about China, reports Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top currency analyst Kit Juckes: If my inbox is anything to go by, the big market issue this weekend is whether the Chinese authorities can restore confidence in their ability to manage an orderly adjustment of the Yuan. So what happens next? Kit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best guess is that the Chinese economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbumpy landing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 continues, as Beijing struggles to rebalance its economy and embrace more free-market principles. Even if China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some way from the inconsistent quartet of free trade, free capital mobility, independent monetary policy and a fixed exchange rate, they have moved closer and will struggle to find consistent policies. Nervousness across Asian markets and fear of bigger capital outflows and a bigger FX move are going to go on haunting markets. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff means that the Chinese stock market has now lost 15% of its value this year - over just 6 trading days. The latest Chinese inflation figures are also fuelling worries over its economy this morning. Figures released over the weekend showed that factory-gate prices have now fallen for 46 months in a row. That suggests domestic demand is still weakening, forcing Chinese firms to charge less for their wares - which could ripple out across the global economy, driving prices lower worldwide. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer inflation rate inched up to 1.6%, from 1.5% in November. European stocks are expected to dip this morning: A late rush of selling in Shanghai has sent the Chinese stock market sliding to its lowest level in over three months. The CSI 300 index slumped by 5% to close at just 3,192 points, a drop of 169 points. Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that its financial system is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153largely stable and healthy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (see opening post) clearly wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough to stop the index hitting its lowest levels since the aftermath of the summer crisis: Overnight, Chinese authorities fixed the yuan at a level similar to Friday - resisting any temptation to weaken its currency again. But economists predict more scuffles in the currency wars, as Angus Nicholson of IG explains: Global markets are still in the grips of China fears, and it is uncertain whether the Chinese government can do enough to reassure global investors. The People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China (PBoC) fixed the CNY largely unchanged from its position on Friday. But this halt in the weakening of the currency appears to have done very little to investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations that there will be further depreciation of the currency in the near future. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Brace yourselves for another week dominated by fears over China, with a dash of stock market volatility and a weak oil price thrown in too. Equities have already posted their worst start to a New Year ever, and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no respite as investors worry about exactly how bad the Chinese situation is. Over the weekend, Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign exchange regulator declared that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial system is robust. It said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic fundamentals are strong. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Foreign exchange reserves are relatively abundant and the financial system is largely stable and healthy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But will that reassure global investors following recent heavy stock market losses, mounting pressure on the yuan, and concerns that more corporations could default on their debts? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

                "bodyText":"Thanks to China making strong efforts to support the yuan, European markets have moved higher, albeit off their best levels. The continuing slide in oil prices has tempered some of the earlier enthusiasm, while Chinese trade data early on Wednesday is likely to cause further volatility. Meanwhile the pound hit a five and a half year low against the dollar following disappointing manufacturing data which seemed to push a UK rate rise further into the distance. The closing scores for European markets showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 0.98% or 57.41 points at 5929.24 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax added 1.63% to 9985.43 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac climbed 1.53% to 4378.75 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB rose 1.08% to 19,970.10 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.33% at 8915.4 In Greece, the Athens market was 2.16% better at 594.26 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently virtually unchanged, up just 3 points while Brent crude is down 3% at $30.56. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Global oil demand is expected to grow more strongly than previously expected, according to the US Energy Information Administration. But so is US production. The EIA has raised its forecast for oil demand in 2016 by 20,000 barrels per day, and it expects 2017 world oil demand to reach 96.61m barrels, up 1.42m from the 2016 figure. It also expects US crude production to have risen by 720,000 barrels a day in 2015, from a previous forecast of 630,000. Brent crude is currently down just over 2% at $30.86 a barrel, while WTI has been close to falling below $30 a barrel. The US measure has fallen as low as $30.1 a barrel and is currently down 1% at $30.32. Despite the oil price volatility, stock markets are holding up. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: UK and European shares advanced...as global markets attempt to undo some of the damage wreaked by the tumultuous first week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading. A higher Chinese yuan was the main source of comfort behind the rise in stocks. The price of oil was less supportive as it jumped back and forth between gains and losses near 12-year lows after a series of investment banks lowered forecasts to as low as $10 per barrel. After staging a tentative recovery earlier, the oil price has fallen into negative territory again. Brent crude, which touched $32.38 a barrel at one point has drifted back to $31.01, a 1.7% decline on the day as the dollar continues to strengthen. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enough from Paris. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s get back to the UK, where Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first minister Nicola Sturgeon has commented on the news that BP is cutting one in five jobs in the North Sea. Our Scotland editor Severin Carrell has the story: The first minister said the BP cuts and falling oil price were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153difficult\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and admitted the price could yet fall further, as predicted by Morgan Stanley. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a very difficult time indeed for people working in the North Sea,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Nicola Sturgeon said. The Scottish government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s North Sea jobs task force, set up a year ago after the first wave of industry cuts, would offer support the workers affected, she said. But pressed on the scale of the latest job cuts by one of the North Sea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest operators, BP, and the plunging oil price \u00e2\u20ac\u201c now at a third of the $100 a barrel price forecast by her government in the Scottish independence reference, she refused to agree that the sector was in crisis. She said BP and Oil &amp; Gas UK, the industry body, had both stressed North Sea oil had a bright future and were planning continued investment. However, Sturgeon conceded that while lower oil prices helped consumers and the wider economy through cheaper fuel costs, the job losses and cuts in oil industry spending was having a direct, negative impact on economic output. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is undoubtedly the case that there will be a wider impact. We will look carefully at unemployment figures and at GDP figures. [Again] while I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m trying to underplay the significance of the North Sea but a lower oil price has other impacts on the wider economy in terms of lower fuel costs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery has not been been built on rising debt within the economy, Mark Carney insists. He acknowledges that household debt levels are still relatively high, but points out that the private sector has been reducing its borrowing. However, there are now signs that consumers are borrowing more. As Carney puts it, we have moved from a post-crisis risk aversion environment to a more normal one. The challenge for central bankers such as himself, and the others huddled in Paris today, is to spot when animal spirits are getting out of hand - as a hike in borrowing costs would still hurt reckless borrowers: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ugly rumour\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that global regulators are planning Basel 4 - a new set of regulations to keep banks in check - says Carney. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not true. Mark Carney is now speaking at the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Christian Noyer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd symposium in Paris. But the current Bank of England governor may not say much to move the markets - he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcin blackout\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ahead of Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate decision. Instead, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outlining how UK banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 profitability has fallen since the financial crisis: That is partly because they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re taking on less leverage, due to tougher regulation post-crisis, and partly because they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stumping up such hefty penalties to cover bad behaviour in the past. That misconduct charge should fall in the future, as banks clean up their game, Carney suggests, adding that retail banking is still very profitable in an environment of ultra-low interest rates. The UK thinktank NIESR has just issued its latest forecast for UK growth. And it predicts that the economy slightly picked up speed in the last three months of 2015, growing by 0.6%. That would be an increased on the 0.4% recorded between July and September. Is that too optimistic, given the weakness of the manufacturing sector? We get the official first estimate of GDP for the last quarter of 2015 in a couple of weeks, on the 28th of January. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chilly mood in the City this afternoon. No, not the weather (although it is a little brisk). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because Albert Edwards, the notoriously pessimistic analyst at Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale, is starting to deliver his annual assessment of the markets. You can probably set your dial to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgloom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Albert can certainly pull in the crowds.... Back in Paris, Sheila Bair - head of the Systemic Risk Council - is warning of potential trouble ahead. She points out that governments typically pay down debt during recoveries - this time, borrowing is going up and up. Wall Street clearly didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the memo to sell everything. Shares are up in early New York trading, following Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead. And the oil price has now turned positive today, up 2% at $32.16, on hopes that the situation in Chinese is calming down. The IMF have uploaded Christine Lagarde\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech here. It ends with a call to arms to help emerging economies: According to some estimates, a successful convergence process in the emerging world could triple the size of the global economy in the next 25 or 30 years. The global community cannot afford the costs of stalled convergence. The 85 percent matter! Lagarde concludes her speech by wishing Christian Noyer a happy retirement following his time at the Bank of France. She suggests he takes a tip from Mervyn King - who left the Bank of England vowing to learn to cook and dance. Good idea, but Noyer should avoid emulating Lord King\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other hobby -- supporting Aston Villa. Christine Lagarde is now explaining how the IMF is pushing for a new global approach to financial stability, to help emerging markets. She says we need two things: 1) a stronger financial safety net. 2) a better framework for safer capital flows. On the safety net, the IMF chief says the current situation is simply unfair. Emerging markets are locked out of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153swap lines\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd between central banks that provide essential support in times of crisis. This makes the global safety net stronger for advanced countries than it is for emerging economies. Yet emerging economies critically depend on advanced-country currencies in their trade and finance. The size of the current safety nets also need to be reviewed, she adds. And on capital flows, Lagarde says emerging markets suffer from the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153short-term nature and inherent volatility\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of global capital flows (as investors in advanced economies look for a decent rate of return). Maybe hot money is too hot, Lagarde suggests. More long-term, equity based, financial flows would help - meaning financial buffers could be smaller. You can watch Christine Lagarde\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech here. Over in Paris, Christine Lagarde is speaking at the symposium to mark the retirement of former French central bank chief Christian Noyer. The head of the International Monetary Fund starts by touching on China, saying its economic rebalancing is a positive long-term move, but one that brings short-term spillover effects. And she warns that commodity prices are unlikely to rally strongly anytime soon. She says last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US interest rate rise has been successful. It was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clearly communicated and priced in by markets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but the key point is how the future normalisation of monetary policy is handled by the Federal Reserve. And on emerging markets, Lagarde warns that the appreciation of the US dollar comes at a tricky time - with developing markets already facing slower growth and falling commodity prices. If emerging market growth falls by 1%, that knocks 0.2% off advanced economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s significant, she insists, given the current growth rates of advanced countries. Although shares are picking up today, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still plenty of nervousness about the future. And analysts at Royal Bank of Scotland have added to the nerves, by telling clients they should sell up before markets really hit trouble. Our markets reporter Nick Fletcher explains: Investors face a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cataclysmic year\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd where stock markets could fall by up to 20% and oil could slump to $16 (\u00c2\u00a311) a barrel, economists at the Royal Bank of Scotland have warned. In a note to its clients the bank said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sell everything except high quality bonds. This is about return of capital, not return on capital. In a crowded hall, exit doors are small.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It said the current situation was reminiscent of 2008, when the collapse of the Lehman Brothers investment bank led to the global financial crisis. This time China could be the crisis point. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: Over in the Telegraph, Ambrose Evans-Pritchard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mood has also darkened. He warns: The risk is that this market storm drags on long enough to hit investment, regardless of what the economic data should imply. At the end of the day, market psychology can itself become an economic \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fundamental\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Pessimists warn that unless there is a batch of irrefutably good data from China over the next two or three months, the sell-off could become self-fulfilling and quickly metamorphose into the next global crisis. Shares are rallying across Europe as investors shrug off their worries about China, and Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing malaise. They are taking heart from Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong stance on the yuan earlier today, when it aggressively supported its currency in the international markets. That is seen as a sign that China isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t planning to spark a full-blown currency war by allowing the yuan to devalue wildly. So, the German DAX has jumped by almost 2.5%, with other indices close behind. German manufacturers are leading the way, such as Volkswagen (+4%), BMW (+3.3%) and BASF (+2.9%). Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says some stability appears to have returned to the markets: There is a feeling that perhaps the selling pressure that has characterised stock markets last week may ease somewhat, as profit-taking among shorts and bargain hunting takes hold. However, with earnings season now underway, the selloff seen in 2016 so far could provide great buying opportunities for those expecting to see positive updates. The City is also cheered by this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial results, which saw retailers Morrisons and Debenhams both beat forecasts. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, points out that the fall in the pound should help UK manufacturers. But November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak performance may show the sector dragged the economy back at the end of 2015. Beck says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Industrial production fell by 0.7% between October and November, with all four of the sub-sectors seeing output decline. This was the largest monthly fall in output since January 2013. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The biggest cause for concern is the manufacturing sector, where output declined by 0.4% for a second successive month in November. This may have followed a very strong September, but the business surveys continue to point to \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at best \u00e2\u20ac\u201c stagnation. Although the recent fall in the pound should provide some support to exporters, it is difficult to find many other reasons for optimism around the manufacturing sector. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With manufacturing on course for only modest output growth in Q4 and the other components of industrial production likely to have contracted, the economy is going to be almost wholly reliant on services to drive growth once again. Our short-term model continues to point to GDP growth of 0.6% in Q4, up from 0.5% in Q3. But there is now a risk that the preliminary estimate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c due in just over two weeks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c shows another below-par outturn of 0.5%.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Looks like China will be in focus tomorrow too, when we discover how well (or badly) it traded with the rest of the world... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unions know who to blame for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing decline - finance minister George Osborne. The chancellor warned last week that a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccocktail of risks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 threaten the UK, including China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowing economy. But TUC general secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady reckons the blame lies closer to home: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cocktail of threats has been spiked with his own failures. Not least of these is manufacturing, which is still far behind its pre-crisis peak and has fallen by 1.2 per cent over the last year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the government had made the right choices with strong investment in skills, infrastructure and innovation, we could be in a much stronger position.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady also points out that UK steel production has shrunk by a third from its recent peak, as UK factories struggle to cope with falling prices and competition from abroad. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Steel production has seen its sharpest fall since the financial crisis. This is the inevitable result of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure to step in and give UK steel the support it needs. Unless the government puts in place a genuine industrial strategy, we risk further serious consequences for steel and many other manufacturers down the supply chain.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Thousands of oil workers at BP face the axe, as the company adjusts to the new era of cheaper oil. Reuters has the story: Oil major BP plans to cut at least 4,000 jobs globally in its oil production division this year to reduce costs amid a steep decline in oil prices. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We want to simplify structure and reduce costs without compromising safety. Globally, we expect the headcount in upstream to be below 20,000 by the end of the year,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a company spokesman said. He said BP was planning to reduce headcount by 600 people in the North Sea over the next two years with most cuts to happen in 2016. Back to oil.,.. and Nigeria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suggestion today that OPEC could hold an emergency meeting soon has been slapped down by the United Arab Emirates. UAE energy minister Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazroui argued that the cartel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current strategy (not cutting production) should be given more time. Mazroui said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not convinced OPEC alone can change or can solely unilaterally change this strategy just because we have seen a low in the market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd After November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak performance, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial production sector is still around 9% smaller than before the crisis. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure/inability (take your pick) to expand its manufacturing sector in the last 15 years has meant we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve run a persistent current account deficit, with imports consistently outpacing exports. But does it matter, when the services sector fills some (but not all) of the gap? An economist who blogs as Polemic Paine argues that Britain should embrace the fact that other countries can manufacturer goods much cheaper than us: The UK is the second largest exporter of services in the world and the US economy is currently 88% services. In a competitive world it is better to export high value goods rather than low value goods unless you can make those low value goods at such low prices that (price x volume) = big. Whilst there are countries with populations willing to accept lower wages than us for their day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work we have to sell goods they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. And that is now mostly services..... He concludes: Once upon a time the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agricultural industry accounted for 90% of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. It is now about 3%. Should we readjust back to that too for nostalgias sake? As long as we are exporting services that pay for the lower valued manufacturing stuff we buy in then that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine. Yet services are lost in the data. The historic way of measuring trade data demotes many services into the invisibles part of the equation leaving attention resting on the more obvious manufacturing figures.  Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full piece: Weak week. Waiting. I guess people would worry less if services was able to cover *all* the shortfall from the trade in goods: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also the worry that financial services can turn around and bite the economy when a crisis erupts (plus the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcimplicit subsidy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that taxpayers cough up to protect them from failure) JP Morgan reckons that first UK rate rise is now 10 months away. Economist Malcolm Barr explains: Recent disappointments in the pay data and the drop in oil prices had already put our call for the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to raise rates in May at risk. The weakness in this IP report is the straw that breaks the camel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s back. We hence push our forecast for the first hike back by 6 months to November 2016. The forecast shows rates rising by 25bp a quarter thereafter. In our minds, the MPC are very much in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153data dependent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd mode, rather than feeling at all constrained to adhere to any path suggested by their commentary. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s certainly little chance that the Bank of England will raise interest rates this week: Our best guess is that the MPC vote will remain at 8-1 at this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, although these data raise the risk that McCafferty will choose to withdraw his vote for higher rates for now. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 Sterling has fallen to its lowest level against the US dollar since early June 2010, following the disappointing UK industrial production data. The pound has shed half a cent, touching $1.4484, as traders calculate that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no prospect of interest rates rising soon. Jake Trask, currency analyst at UKForex, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Both industrial and manufacturing production have posted lower-than-expected readings for November. Combined with soft growth figures and Brexit fears, these results will likely dampen any expectations of a UK interest rate rise in the near future\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The FT points out that UK manufacturing has been weakening for several months: Just in: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial sector suffered its biggest fall in output in almost three years, as manufacturing shrank again. Industrial production shank by 0.7% month-on-month, according to the Office for National Statistics. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the biggest drop since January 2013, and much worse than expected. It says: There were decreases in all of the main sectors, with manufacturing, mining &amp; quarrying and electricity &amp; gas having the largest contributions to the decrease. This can partly be blamed on the unusually warm winter, which has meant less demand for energy to heat homes and businesses. But manufacturing struggled too; its output fell by 0.4% in November compared with October, and was 1.2% lower than a year ago. It suggests British business are suffering from weaker overseas demand, partly due to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic worries. It leaves the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vision of a rebalanced economy led by a revitalised factory sector looking as distant as ever. And it also highlights why demand for oil is weak, leading to supply gluts and sliding prices. Many US oil producers will suffer severe financial pain, and possibly go bust, unless the oil price recovers from its current lows, analysts fear. Marketwatch has the details: As many as a third of American oil-and-gas producers could tip toward bankruptcy and restructuring by mid-2017, according to Wolfe Research. Survival, for some, would be possible if oil rebounded to at least $50, according to analysts. The benchmark price of U.S. crude settled at $31.41 a barrel, setting a 12-year low. More than 30 small companies that collectively owe in excess of $13 billion have already filed for bankruptcy protection so far during this downturn, according to law firm Haynes &amp; Boone. More here: Plunging prices could force a third of U.S. oil firms into bankruptcy Retail magnate turned football chairman Mike Ashley could suffer a double relegation this year. Shares in his Sports Direct chain have fallen by almost 4% this morning, as the aftermath of last Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit warning continues to reverberate. Yesterday they tumbled by 7%, as analysts scramble to reassess their view of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prospects. Sports Direct is currently valued at \u00c2\u00a32.4bn, which is not enough to maintain a place in the FTSE 100 index. And with Newcastle United 18th (two from bottom) in the Premier League, it could be a year to forget for the club\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s owner. This chart shows how Beijing drove up the interest rate on offshore yuan deposits overnight, in a bid to strengthen the currency. This was designed to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcencourage\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 traders to hold renminbi and inflict losses on speculators who were betting against it. The latest slump in the oil price isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t causing alarm in the European stock markets. Instead, shares are rallying as traders applaud China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aggressive moves to prop up the yuan overnight. The German DAX has gained 1%, bringing some relief to Frankfurt where investors have been worrying about a global downturn. In London, the FTSE 100 gained half a percent. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been so much volatility this year that markets may not stay higher for long..... Debenhams has also beaten festive expectations, posting a 1.9% jump in like-for-like sales over Christmas. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rather better than its main rival, Marks &amp; Spencer, which posted a 5.8% decline in general merchandise sales. M&amp;S blamed unusually warm weather, but clearly some retailers coped better than others ... 2015 was a rough year for UK supermarket chain Morrisons, as it struggled to cope with falling sales and profits. But this year has begun better, with the company beating forecasts over the crucial Christmas period. My colleague Sean Farrell explains: Morrisons achieved a surprise increase in sales over Christmas as customers returned to the supermarket chain. Sales at stores open a year or more, excluding fuel, rose 0.2% in the nine weeks to 3 January, Morrisons said in a trading statement. City analysts had expected like-for-like sales, which exclude new stores, to fall 2%. Morrisons said customers were starting to return to its stores with like-for-like transactions up 1.3% in its core supermarkets during the period. The chain has been badly hit by competition from the German discounters Aldi and Lidl and has cut prices to compete. And the City likes the news - sending its shares soaring 12% in early trading. Other supermarkets are benefitting too - Tesco shares are up 5.5%, and Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has gained 2.8%. Perhaps Christmas wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as bad as feared.... There is relief in Shanghai as the China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market closes up today. The Shanghai composite ended the day 0.7% higher at 3,215 points, meaning it is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dconly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 down 13.8% so far this year. Investors welcomed the news that Beijing had stepped up its support for the yuan today. As mentioned in the introduction, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank intervened aggressively in the offshore currency markets today, boosting the renminbi and sparking a record surge in the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s money-market rates. That might scare off speculators who had been been betting against the yuan. OPEC members who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like the look of $30 per barrel oil should take a deep breath -- analysts at Standard Chartered think prices could hit $10(!) a barrel. The bank argue that the strength of the US dollar, and pessimism in the stock market, could send oil down to levels not seen since 1999. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Given that no fundamental relationship is currently driving the oil market towards any equilibrium, prices are being moved almost entirely by financial flows caused by fluctuations in other asset prices, including the US dollar and equity markets. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We think prices could fall as low as $10/bbl before most of the money managers in the market conceded that matters had gone too far.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The slump in the oil price could prompt the OPEC cartel into an emergency meeting, according to Nigeria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy minister. Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu, Nigeria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minister of state for petroleum resources, told reporters at a conference in Abu Dhabi that a couple of OPEC members have already suggested a meeting. This would give an opportunity for OPEC members to cut production rates, something they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve declined to do at their scheduled meetings. OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy appeared to be keen to flood the market with crude, drive prices down, put rival suppliers such as shale out of business, and pick up the pieces later. The speed of the slump in prices over the last 18 months may prompt a rethink, though.. Oil is coming under renewed pressure today, as traders speculate about just how low the crude price will fall. Crude prices tumbled by another 3% today, hitting fresh 12 year lows. It is being driven down by concerns over the world economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness which is fuelling the oversupply glut. Brent, sourced from the North Sea, hit a low of $30.43 per barrel in early trading, before struggling back to $30.80 As we warned yesterday, Morgan Stanley analysts believe oil could hit $20 this year -- and at this rate, it might happen sooner than crude producers would like. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It looks like another day dominated by two familiar themes - China, and oil. Overnight, Beijing has managed to strengthen the yuan, seemingly throwing the monetary kitchen sink at its currency to prevent another devaluation. As we explain here: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The market suspects that the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China is possibly using major state banks to directly drain yuan liquidity in offshore markets,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said a dealer at an European bank in Shanghai. The dealer described the strength of the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions as being of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nuclear-weapon\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd level strength. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Its actions are comparable to steps taken by other central banks when they previously fought against international speculators, such as George Soros,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. That means European markets are likely to be calm this morning: On the UK front, we find out how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial sector fared in December, at 9.30am GMT. And Bank of England governor Mark Carney is giving a speech in Paris this afternoon , at 2.15pm GMT. Hopefully he might touch on the turmoil that has gripped the world markets this year. And there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flood of UK company news, particularly on the retail front. Struggling supermarket group Morrisons, high street chain Debenhams, and pasty-purveyer Greggs are all updating the City. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

A mix of strong Chinese trade data overnight, and an indication that Russian crude output could be cut in the coming months, managed to provide a lift with US crude prices rising relatively calmly and consistently.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>However, much like a house of cards, something that took the whole day to build has been blown down in the space of five minutes. The fact that a lower than expected US crude inventories figure would typically be supportive for oil prices goes to show that for now the oil market is finding buyers hard to come by in the face of such intense selling.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56967411e4b0f2d1f22cfc96\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-13T16:02:05.160Z\">4.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The US figures also show that weekly gasoline stocks have jumped 8.4m barrels to 240.43m, compared to forecasts of a 2.7m increase.

                "bodyText":"Better than expected Chinese trade data gave stock markets an early lift, but they came off their best levels thanks to a slide in oil prices after US figures showed a rise in crude inventories. Brent is now down 1.3% at $30.46 a barrel having earlier climbed to $31.92. Most European markets managed to end the day higher, but Germany was an exception and finished slightly lower, while Wall Street has now turned negative. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 rose 31.73 points or 0.54% to 5960.97 after earlier climbing as high as 6011 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.25% to 9960.96 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 0.3% at 4391.94 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB added 0.85% to 20,139.87 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 0.21% higher at 8934.5 In Greece, the Athens market edged 0.83% lower to 589.35 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down 135 points or 0.84%. On that note, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow for the Bank of England interest rate decision, a host of trading statements and all the other major financial developments. Ahead of Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of England interest rate announcement - when no change is pretty much nailed on - sterling dropped to a new five and a half year low of $1.4380 before recovering to $1.4455. Recent week data has suggested that an interest rate rise is now not likely until towards the end of the year, in contrast to the US Federal Reserve which has already made its first increase. Sterling has now lost around 6% in just a month, on concerns about the strength of the UK economy. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: In yet another reflection of the fragility of financial markets, what was expected to be a rare green day for the FTSE is becoming increasingly likely to turn red once more, as oil prices tumble in the wake of the US crude inventory number. A mix of strong Chinese trade data overnight, and an indication that Russian crude output could be cut in the coming months, managed to provide a lift with US crude prices rising relatively calmly and consistently. However, much like a house of cards, something that took the whole day to build has been blown down in the space of five minutes. The fact that a lower than expected US crude inventories figure would typically be supportive for oil prices goes to show that for now the oil market is finding buyers hard to come by in the face of such intense selling. The US figures also show that weekly gasoline stocks have jumped 8.4m barrels to 240.43m, compared to forecasts of a 2.7m increase. This is reportedly the biggest two week rise on record, and points to continuing weak demand. Another reason for the fall in crude prices once the figures were released. The EIA said: Total motor gasoline inventories increased by 8.4 million barrels last week, and are above the upper limit of the average range. Brent crude, which had earlier jumped as high as $31.92, has now slipped back 0.8% to $30.60 a barrel. US oil has dipped to as low as $30.31. Oil prices have slipped back after US crude stocks showed a weekly rise to levels not seen at this time of year for 80 years. The increase of 0.2m barrels was less than the forecast rise of 2.5m barrels but the Energy Information Administration figures contrast with those of the American Petroleum Institute, which said on Tuesday that crude stocks had unexpectedly fallen. In its report the EIA said: U.S. commercial crude oil inventories (excluding those in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve) increased by 0.2 million barrels from the previous week. At 482.6 million barrels, U.S. crude oil inventories remain near levels not seen for this time of year in at least the last 80 years. The US has followed other global markets by recording an opening rise, although it is not a particularly convincing one. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up around 53 points or 0.3%, while the S&amp;P 500 has climbed by a similar amount. Meanwhile former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers has told Bloomberg TV that he would be surprised if the world economy could comfortably withstand four hikes. He said: And I think that basically markets agree with me. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why despite the statements that are being made, markets aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expecting four hikes. If you ask if there are risk that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to find ourselves in a situation within the next two years where policy is going to have to reverse, yes. I think that is a significant risk. Rosengren also said (as reported by Reuters) that US central bankers faced challenges by hiking rates when other central banks were still easing (eg the ECB). He said this divergence of policy could make foreign exchange trading \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more volatile.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Following December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate rise by the US Federal Reserve, attention turned almost immediately to when the next one would be, and how many there could be in 2016 in total. The Fed indicated when it sanctioned dearer borrowing costs that there could be four quarter-point rises over the course of 2016. But since its December meeting things have changed somewhat, especially in China, and worries about a slowdown in global growth have increased. So Eric Rosengren, Boston Federal Reserve president, is now saying there may be a more gradual path for rate rises than is currently expected. The market rout in China and the falling oil price have added to concerns that global growth has slowed significantly, he told the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce. He said the Fed may now have to slow the rate of rate rises: I hope the economy continues to improve, so that further normalization is appropriate. It is important, however, to carefully manage risks to the economy, including those emanating from abroad. Further increases in rates are in my view likely to be gradual. While monetary policy should not overreact to short-term temporary fluctuations in financial markets, policy makers should take seriously the potential downside risk to their economic forecasts and manage those risks as we think about the appropriate path... Further tightening will require data continuing to be strong enough that growth will be at or above potential, so that Federal Reserve policymakers can be confident that inflation will reach our 2% target. On Monday Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart said he did not think there would be enough new data to be able to decide on another rate hike until at least April. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chart from Bloomberg showing the best and worst stock markets so far this year (yes, all 13 days of it): We had figures earlier showing that Greek inflation was rising faster than the eurozone average, and now Barclays had reduced its eurozone forecasts: City experts have been falling over themselves to predict how fall the oil price will fall, with Standard Chartered\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $10 a barrel the outlier at the moment. But the latest odds from Ladbrokes suggest that may be a step too far. The bookie is offering 4/1 on a fall below $25, 20/1 on below $20 and 100/1 on below $10. Ladbrokes Alex Donohue said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bearish oil speculators can cash in at an attractive fixed-odds price if the index plummets below $10 this year. The betting markets suggest such a fall is highly unlikely to happen however, with the odds favouring stability or even a rise from current prices.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More scepticism over the Chinese trade data. Sanjiv Shah, chief investment officer at Sun Global Investments, said: The higher export data may in part reflect past false transactions designed to overcome restrictions on transfers of currency outside the country. Recent data has shown sharp declines in foreign exchange reserves and independent estimates indicate a sharp increase in capital outflows in October and November. This means the level of exports in October and November may have been understated and the increase in exports in December is more apparent than real. However, if there has been a true and sustainable recovery in exports, this may relieve some of the pressure on yuan to weaken. It is too early to say that the decline in the yuan has led to a sustainable increase in China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s competitiveness and therefore a healthier path for Chinese exports. But given current weak trends on global growth and demand, there are still many grounds for scepticism on this point. Over to Greece, and the European Central Bank will only start buying the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt as part of its asset purchase scheme if Greece shows a strong commitment to its bailout programme. That comes from ECB president Mario Draghi ahead of a first review of the Greek programme due to start later this month. Reuters reports: Draghi added that even if the ECB waived the minimum credit rating requirement for Greek debt, the timing of possible asset purchases also depended on a set of additional factors linked to the program reviews and would be subject to various purchase limits. The Greek central bank earlier said that reinstating the waiver was on the agenda, raising hopes that Greece could soon be included in the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quantitative easing program. But sources close to the bank earlier said that the waiver is unlikely until it becomes clear that the first review, due to start later this month, is heading for success. The better than expected Chinese trade data has lifted European markets, with commodity companies leading the way. Oil has moved higher after briefly falling below $30 a barrel on Tuesday, with Brent crude now up nearly 2% at $31.46. Copper rose from a six and a half month low, up almost 1% after the Chinese figures, giving some respite to beleaguered mining company shares. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long deflationary spiral is over. Greek consumer prices rose by 0.4% annually in December (on a harmonised basis) which is the first upward move since February 2013. As this chart shows, Greek inflation (light grey) is rising faster than the eurozone average (dark blue). Thousands of jobs are being axed across Europe by General Electric, including in Germany, the UK and France. The US engineering giant is cutting staff following its acquisition of French firm Alstom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy division. The cuts include 765 positions in France and 1,700 in Germany, according to GE spokesman Renaud Petitjean. However, the French workforce should be protected by GE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to create one thousands extra jobs (a promise it made during the takeover). Petitjean told Bloomberg that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Any potential job that will be impacted in France will have to be replaced at the end of the period. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These positions, if we cancel them, will have to be recreated in addition to the 1,000 we promised to create.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That guarantee doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stretch to Britain, though, where Sky News says 660 jobs will go. Oh dear. Eurozone factories suffered falling output last November, according to the latest data from the region. Industrial output contracted by 0.7% during the month, reversing a recovery in October. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly due to weaker demand for energy, but manufacturers also reported that they made less heavy-duty machinery and long-lasting consumer products. Stats body Eurostat explains: Production of energy fell by 4.3%, capital goods by 1.9% and durable consumer goods by 1.0%, while production of non-durable consumer goods rose by 0.1% and intermediate goods by 0.7%. Fictional cat Mog should be lapping up a saucer of gold top milk this morning, after helping Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s beat City forecasts over Christmas. The clueless charming feline fronted up Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s festive adverts, and the move appears to have paid off. Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s posted total sales growth of 0.8% in the last 15 weeks. If you strip out new stores, like-for-like sales dipped by 0.4% - better than the 2% which had been expected. Good news for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second largest supermarket chain, as it tries to pull off a merger with Home Retail. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a boost for Save The Children, as my colleague Sean Farrell explains: The advert was viewed almost 37m times online and sales of a book and soft toy raised more than \u00c2\u00a31.5m for Save the Children, Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s said. Commodities are rallying this morning, pushing up the price of oil, copper, platinum and copper. Only gold is lagging, having benefitted from recent anxiety. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s China trade data should reassure some nervous investors, says Tom Rafferty of the Economist Intelligence Unit, despite question marks over their accuracy. The data is in line with other indicators that suggest China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is stabilising on the back of sustained stimulus measures, some of which have been targeted at the external sector. There will be some qualms expressed about the reliability of the data, given the weaker performance in December of other major Asian exporters. However, China has consistently outperformed the region in what was a difficult year for global trade. Rafferty also reckons China will avoid economic meltdown this year: Although cautious about trade prospects for 2016, but we expect a modest pick-up in global demand and a weaker renminbi to help lift China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s export value growth to 2%, folllowing the contraction last year. We forecast import value growth of 4% as domestic demand stabilises and distortions caused by the oil price fall in late 2014 drop out of the base comparison. Now this is important..... investors are anticipating that oil will remain low for several years. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s via Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil expert, Javier Blas: Troubled mining company Anglo American is the top riser in London, as the Footsie clambers back over the 6,000 point mark for the first time this week. Anglo is benefitting from China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s improved trade figures, which might suggest improved demand for commodities this year. Last year, its share price plunged by around 80% as the price of iron ore, copper and coal weakened. Other natural resource companies are also leading the rally, followed by oil giants BP and Royal Dutch Shell. They are getting a lift from this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rising oil price (see here) Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the FTSE 100 top risers this morning. The surprise 2.4% jump in Chinese exports last month suggests that the manufacturers are benefitting from a cheaper currency. And that might lead Beijing to conclude that they shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry about the yuan weakening: Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency strategist Kit Juckes says: I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help wondering if the positive response to a bounce in yuan-denominated export growth that is a reward for the Yuan depreciation strategy, won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just encourage more of the same. If a weaker currency pays dividends for China, as it did for others, then chances are, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see more competitive devaluation in the months ahead across Asia. Oil is staging a recovery this morning too, having hit 12-year lows yesterday. US crude oil has gained almost 2% to $30.97 per barrel, having plunged below the thirty dollar mark last night. Brent crude is hovering around $31.35 per barrel. European stock markets are rallying in early trading, as relief over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade figures ripples through the City. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 64 points, or 1%, to 5992. Mining companies are among the risers. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says the Chinese data, and a rally on Wall Street overnight, are boosting confidence, if only temporarily. This gives hope to the bulls that a bottom has been found and a short-term reversal is on the cards. Cynical City types often question whether China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic data can really be trusted, given the sheer challenge of assessing its economy (and the fear that officials could massage the figures to avoid causing ructions). And today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade report does include one curious element - a 10% surge in exports to Hong Kong. That means Hong Kong imported more from mainland China than the United States (!), and make the total exports data look much better. Some of this trade will certainly be genuine, with goods moving on from Hong Kong through the global economy. But this may also show that some companies have been fiddling the figures, and disguising speculative capital flows as routine trade. That would be bad for two reasons. a) Chinese trade would be less healthy, b) capital flight could be a bigger problem. Bloomberg has more details: Economists said the surprise gains may harken back to past instances of phony invoicing and other rules skirted to escape currency rules. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government said in 2013 said some data on trade with Hong Kong were inflated by arbitrage transactions intended to avoid rules, an acknowledgment that export and import figures were overstated. The increase in exports to Hong Kong and China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s imports from the city probably indicate \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fake invoicing,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Iris Pang, a senior economist for Greater China at Natixis SA in Hong Kong. Invoicing of China trade should be larger in December because of the wider gap between the onshore yuan and the offshore yuan traded in Hong Kong, she said. Surging China Trade With Hong Kong Raises Doubts Over Recovery Other Asian markets have performed well today, with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei jumping by almost 3%. It does appear that investors are a little less anxious about the state of the world economy today, after such a rough start to 2016. The Chinese stock market has suffered fresh losses today, despite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecast-beating trade figures. After an encouraging start, the Shanghai stock market suffered one of its traditional late selloffs. This wiped another 2.4% off the benchmark index, taking its losses in 2016 to a chunky 16.6%. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re now close to the depths plumped in last summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. While Europe was sleeping, China has wrong-footed analysts by reporting better-than-expected trade figures. There was a lot of anticipation that December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade figures would be an absolute shocker. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true that there are signs of weakness, with imports dropping by 4% year-on-year..... ....But exports surprisingly rose, by 2.3% in yuan-denominated terms. It may be a sign that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is coping better than feared. But Beijing remains cautious about the prospects for 2016: Customs spokesman Huang Songping warned at a news conference that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade faced \u00e2\u20ac\u0153many challenges\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in 2016 due to weak external demand, Reuters reported. One of the main reasons for China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lower exports in 2015 was weak external demand, he added. The 5% fall in the value of the yuan since last August had helped support exports but the impact would begin to fade, he said. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: China sees \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmany challenges\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in 2016 as trade slumps on weak external demand That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pushed shares up across Asia, and is expected to put Europe on the front-foot: Whether this is enough to prevent another day of turmoil in the commodity markets, though, remains to be seen. Oil is bobbing above the $30 per barrel mark this morning. Also coming up today, supermarket chain Sainsbury is updating the City on its financial results over Christmas. At first glance, they show that like-for-like sales fell 0.4% - better than analysts had feared. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

Oil recovered some ground after falling below $30 a barrel, with Brent crude currently 2% higher at $30.94, but investors are clearly still worried about the weakness in commodities and the outlook for China.</p> <p>More worries for the car industry, with Renault being raided, added to the downbeat mood and helped push the Dax and Cac - which have a number of listed carmakers - lower.</p> <p>Meanwhile US shares, after a weak start, recovered some of their recent losses, helped by dovish comments from Federal Reserve member James Bullard. Bullard had been pushing for rate rises and finally got his way in December, but a cautious speech in the wake of the oil price fall and the current market rout suggested he might be moderating his views on when further rate rises could be sanctioned.</p> <p>So the final scores in Europe showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 finished 42.74 points or 0.72% lower at 5918.23, having earlier touched a new five month low</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.67% to 9794.20</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 1.8% at 4312.89</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 1.67% to 19,803.41</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 1.64% lower at 8787.7</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market lost 2.62% to 573.92</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 191 points or 1.1% better.</p> <p>On Friday there are a number of economic figures which could add to the volatile mood. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got UK construction statistics due for release in the morning and these will be closely followed as they may offer some respite from the swathe of downbeat economic prints we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen of late. Also, US retail sales and consumer confidence numbers will be under scrutiny as the market looks for clues of any impact from the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate hike.

Just as US markets yesterday torpedoed a nascent rally, today our American cousins are doing their best to stymie any further bearish momentum. Car makers dominate the news today, with Fiat Chrysler, Peugeot and Renault all hit hard, with the latter two due to an emissions investigation that doubtless has its roots in the VW scandal of 2015. As with banks, investors are learning that scandals do not tend to stop at one firm, and with car firms so prominent on the French and German exchanges, it is no surprise that the CAC and DAX remain firmly in the red.</p> <p>Oil prices are enjoying a rare pause in their downward slide, but it still looks to be only a matter of time before they continue their exploration of the $20 zone. The combination of bearish factors remains the key driver, with no hint of real production cuts coming from the key producers</p> <p>Further helping sentiment was a decent set of figures from JPMorgan, which rose 2%, with strict cost control helping and return on equity holding at a steady 9%.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5697c694e4b01b84906dcd9c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-14T16:03:06.066Z\">4.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A rebound in oil prices is helping markets recover some of their early losses.

                "bodyText":"A rally on Wall Street after Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump helped European shares come off their worst levels, but they still ended the day in the red. Oil recovered some ground after falling below $30 a barrel, with Brent crude currently 2% higher at $30.94, but investors are clearly still worried about the weakness in commodities and the outlook for China. More worries for the car industry, with Renault being raided, added to the downbeat mood and helped push the Dax and Cac - which have a number of listed carmakers - lower. Meanwhile US shares, after a weak start, recovered some of their recent losses, helped by dovish comments from Federal Reserve member James Bullard. Bullard had been pushing for rate rises and finally got his way in December, but a cautious speech in the wake of the oil price fall and the current market rout suggested he might be moderating his views on when further rate rises could be sanctioned. So the final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished 42.74 points or 0.72% lower at 5918.23, having earlier touched a new five month low Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.67% to 9794.20 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 1.8% at 4312.89 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 1.67% to 19,803.41 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 1.64% lower at 8787.7 In Greece, the Athens market lost 2.62% to 573.92 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 191 points or 1.1% better. On Friday there are a number of economic figures which could add to the volatile mood. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said; We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got UK construction statistics due for release in the morning and these will be closely followed as they may offer some respite from the swathe of downbeat economic prints we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen of late. Also, US retail sales and consumer confidence numbers will be under scrutiny as the market looks for clues of any impact from the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate hike. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a rollercoaster session, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s certainly good to be finishing with losses that are so limited. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. With the US rally helping to pull European shares away from their worst levels, Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said: Markets remain stuck in a closely-fought contest between the optimists and pessimists, and while in Europe the latter still appear to be in charge, on Wall Street the buyers are back. Just as US markets yesterday torpedoed a nascent rally, today our American cousins are doing their best to stymie any further bearish momentum. Car makers dominate the news today, with Fiat Chrysler, Peugeot and Renault all hit hard, with the latter two due to an emissions investigation that doubtless has its roots in the VW scandal of 2015. As with banks, investors are learning that scandals do not tend to stop at one firm, and with car firms so prominent on the French and German exchanges, it is no surprise that the CAC and DAX remain firmly in the red. Oil prices are enjoying a rare pause in their downward slide, but it still looks to be only a matter of time before they continue their exploration of the $20 zone. The combination of bearish factors remains the key driver, with no hint of real production cuts coming from the key producers Further helping sentiment was a decent set of figures from JPMorgan, which rose 2%, with strict cost control helping and return on equity holding at a steady 9%. A rebound in oil prices is helping markets recover some of their early losses. Brent crude is now up 2% at $31 a barrel. Did we mention volatile? The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now 161 points higher, helping pull European markets off their worst levels. The European Central Bank could cut its deposit rate further after last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reduction, according to the minutes of the December meeting, with inflation in danger of missing its targets. They said: A cut in the deposit facility rate of 10 basis points was seen as unlikely to trigger material negative side effects and was also seen as having the advantage of leaving some room for further downward adjustments. Economist Timo del Carpio at RBC Capital Markets said: The ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest Meeting Account reveals something of a rift within the Governing Council. However, while we already knew that support for action was not unanimous, the debate itself was not as\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbinary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as some might have assumed. In particular, at least some of those who argued against the proposed measures still favoured providing further stimulus of some kind. Thus, while we continue to judge that monetary policy settings will remain on hold at the forthcoming meeting, the actual policy debate looks set to remain as lively as ever, not least in the context of the renewed downside risks to inflation. After a brief attempt at a rally as Wall Street opened, US markets are following the rest of the world lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 59 points or 0.3% lower despite the oil market stablising. So the volatile pattern of recent days is continuing, with sentiment not helped by JP Morgan chief executive Jamie Dimon saying that the US economy could worsen after its recent growth. James Bullard, one of the members of the US Federal Reserve, has been keen to raise interest rates and got his way in December. But with many analysts believing the current market rout and worries about the Chinese economy should delay any further rises from the Fed, even Bullard is sounding more cautious. Reuters reports: The continued rout in global oil markets may have caused a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153worrisome\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd drop in U.S. inflation expectations that will make it harder for the Federal Reserve to reach one of its key policy targets, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said on Thursday. Since the dramatic fall in oil began in 2014 Fed officials have insisted the impact on U.S. price levels would be temporary, bottoming out at some point and allowing inflation to rise to the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2 percent target. Bullard said that in general he still feels that is the case, with low oil prices an overall \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bullish factor for the U.S.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that is supporting consumer spending and record levels of auto sales. But he said both market-based and long-term measures of inflation expectations have been declining, and their continued fall \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is becoming worrisome.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Household and business expectations about inflation are considered a key component determining actual price increases, and, if they become unmoored to the downside, could pull the rate of inflation lower in a way that is difficult to change. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Low inflation expectations may keep actual inflation lower, all else equal, making it more difficult for the Fed to return inflation to target,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bullard said. Over in the US, and the number of Americans claiming unemployment benefit rose unexpectedly last week. Initial jobless claims climbed by 7,000 to 284,000, compared with forecasts of a fall to 275,000. But this is the 45th week that claims have been below 300,000, confirming the view that the US jobs market is currently fairly robust. This follows the December non-farm payroll figures which showed a surge in job numbers. Meanwhile US import prices fell 1.2% in December, the sixth monthly decline as the effects of the collapse in oil prices continues to be felt. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, also reckons the BoE won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t raise rates in the next few months: He argues that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s simply not a strong reason to hike borrowing costs, given inflation is almost zero and wage growth just 2%. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The outcome of January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting points firmly away from a majority of the MPC favouring a rate rise anytime soon. Notably, none of the three criteria for considering a rate rise as set out by the Governor in a speech in July last year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c quarterly GDP growth in excess of 0.6%, a convincing pick-up in core inflation and a sustained rise in wage growth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are currently present. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Therefore, we stick with our view that the first hike is most likely to come towards the end of the year. If anything the recent global financial turmoil emphasises that the risks are skewed towards a longer period of inaction. So if not today, when might UK interest rates rise? Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management, reckons the Bank of England will sit tight until the EU referendum has been held - perhaps in June, or September. The recent decline in the oil price will have played a part in the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thinking, not so much because they see it as a signal of poor global growth prospects, but because it will keep inflation lower in 2016 than they would have expected a few months ago. On top of this, there have been some signs of weakness in the average earnings figures, which is an indicator on their key watch list. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Looking ahead, lower sterling should lead to rising import cost inflation, while the bulk of the labour market data is still relatively strong. There will be no interest rate hike ahead of the Brexit referendum however, given the uncertainties which the vote is already creating.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about the Renault raids that have given the markets a shunt: The UK government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to hold a referendum on EU membership may have helped weaken the pound this year, the Bank of England says. This is the key section from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minutes: The sterling effective exchange rate index (ERI) had fallen by around 3% since the fifteen-day average starting point used in the November Inflation Report projections. This appeared in part to be a reaction to the ECB policy decision on 3 December 2015. Since the start of 2016, however, some market contacts had additionally cited the forthcoming UK referendum regarding EU membership as a possible explanation for the depreciation of sterling. Option-implied sterling volatilities had risen and there had been an increase in the price of protection against the risk of sterling depreciation compared with the price of protection against an appreciation. The Bank of England also flags up that UK workers aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t getting large pay rises, with wage growth slowing to 2% last month. Despite continued reductions in the rate of unemployment, pay growth remains restrained and appears to have dipped slightly in the most recent data. Another reason not to dust off the rate-hike button today. The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minutes are online here. The Bank of England admits its latest inflation forecasts now look too optimistic, thanks to the tumbling oil price. In the minutes from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, it says: Twelve-month CPI inflation rose to 0.1% in November and is likely to rise modestly further in the coming months as some of the large falls in energy and food prices a year earlier drop out of the annual comparison. But the 40% decline in dollar oil prices means that the increase in inflation is now expected to be slightly more gradual in the near term than forecast in the Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s November Inflation Report projections. It also points to the turmoil in the markets: Recent volatility in financial markets has underlined the downside risks to global growth, primarily emanating from emerging markets. Breaking: UK interest rates have been left unchanged at 0.5%, extending a run dating back to March 2009. But it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t unanimous. The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate-setting committee was split 8-1, with Ian McCafferty continuing to push for higher borrowing costs. The prospect of a new chapter in the car emissions scandal has gone down very badly in Europe. The German DAX and French CAC are now both down at least 3%: Renault is leading the rout, with shares plunging by a fifth. Peugeot are down almost 7%. And in Frankfurt, Daimler are down 5.5%, BMW are off 4.5% and Volkswagen are down 4.6%. Shares in other European automakers are taking a tumble too: The Renault raids suggest that the emissions scandal which began at Volkswagen last year is spreading. French unions officials have confirmed that police visited Renault\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offices last week, and seized several computers. AFP has the details French anti-fraud detectives have raided several production sites of automaker Renault, unions said Thursday, possibly to investigate emissions foul play. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Agents from the (anti-fraud unit) DGCCRF intervened in various Renault sites last Thursday,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the CGT Renault union said in a tract. The probe targeted the sites\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 engine control units which suggests, the union said, that the raids \u00e2\u20ac\u0153are linked to the consequences of the Volkswagen rigged-engines affair\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They took the personal computers of several directors,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the union said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We yesterday (Wednesday) questioned management about this but received no reply,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Franck Daout, a representative of the CFDT union, told AFP. The CFDT said it had been alerted to the raids by some of its shop floor members. Contacted by AFP, neither the anti-fraud unit nor Renault\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s management had any comment. In the wake of the Volkswagen emissions scandal, Renault said last month that it would invest 50 million euros ($55 million) to bring the real emissions of its cars into line with those measured in official test conditions.  Renault is declining to comment on those reports of a fraud raid, Reuters says. Shares in French carmaker Renault just plunged 15%. The newswires are citing reports that the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offices were raided by police last week. Sterling has hit its lowest level against the euro in a year, as traders continue to anticipate that UK interest rates aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t being hiked anytime soon. One pound is now worth \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.3147, a level last seen in mid-January 2015. That means one euro is worth 76p. A weakening currency puts more pressure on the Bank of England to consider a rate hike, as it would push up the cost of imported goods. But it will be welcomed by British exporters for the same reason. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Caroline Hyde has blogged about this today, pointing out that fashion chain Burberry cited the weaker euro as a threat to its business this morning. She adds: So there we have it Mr Carney...get the pound to plummet. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what would make the business world happier. But of course central banks don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t target exchange rates now, do they...? Perish the thought.... Next week is Davos time, when politicians, policymakers, business leaders and other members of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcglobal elite\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 gather for their annual meeting in Switzerland. And climate change will be high on the agenda. The World Economic Forum has surveyed 750 experts, and found that the threat of global warming is even more serious than other dangers - such as weapons of mass destruction, water crises, mass involuntary migration and a severe energy price shock. Our economics editor Larry Elliott reports: The report, prepared by the WEF in collaboration with risk specialists Marsh &amp; McLennan and Zurich Insurance Group, comes a month after the deal signed in Paris to reduce carbon emissions. The WEF said evidence was mounting that inter-connections between risks were becoming stronger. It cited links between climate change and involuntary migration or international security, noting that these often had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153major and unpredictable impacts\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Cecilia Reyes, Zurich\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief risk officer, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Climate change is exacerbating more risks than ever before in terms of water crises, food shortages, constrained economic growth, weaker societal cohesion and increased security risks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Meanwhile, geopolitical instability is exposing businesses to cancelled projects, revoked licences, interrupted production, damaged assets and restricted movement of funds across borders. These political conflicts are in turn making the challenge of climate change all the more insurmountable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c reducing the potential for political cooperation, as well as diverting resource, innovation and time away from climate change resilience and prevention.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd New York\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market may stabilise today after Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout wiped 364 points (-2.2%) off the Dow Jones industrial average. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what the futures market is predicting when trading begins in four hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time: S&amp;P 500: 2 points higher at 1,892 Dow Jones: 32 points higher at 16,183 Nasdaq 100: 6 points higher at 4,189 There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plenty of time for this to change, though.... In around 90 minutes time, investors and economists will be poring over the minutes of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of England meeting. And while everyone expect interest rates to remain unchanged at 0.5% at noon, the question is now whether the BoE hikes this year. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says borrowing costs will remain unchanged for some time: In the current climate of tumbling oil prices, crashing stock markets and a likely next leg lower for inflation expectations, it is clear the UK rate hike forecasts continue to push further back day by day. In recent months, the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate-setting committee has been split 8-1, with Ian McCafferty a lone voice calling for rates to rise to 0.75%. But he might change his mind, given recent events. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency firm World First, predicts McCafferty will return to the fold today. Since the last meeting, oil markets have slumped \u00e2\u20ac\u201c crude oil traded below $30 a barrel for the first time in 12 years overnight \u00e2\u20ac\u201c global growth has slowed, equity markets have dipped and fears, rightly or wrongly, of a recession have increased..... This time last year, following a slump in oil prices, Ian McCafferty decided to stop voting for a rate increase having done so since the autumn. This is probably the key development in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. McCafferty has shown that he is willing to change his mind when the data changes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c something of which there is a woeful lack of in central banking \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and a unanimous vote for a hold at 0.5% will solidify pound at these low levels. Although Brent crude is clinging on above $30 this morning, its earlier tumble to $29.73 per barrel continues to pull markets down. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turning into a bad morning for the City (unless you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve shorted the market, of course): A strong Christmas performance from Tesco has not been enough to counter a wave of fear striking the FTSE 100 as oil prices slumped and travel stocks were sold off following terrorist attacks in Jakarta. Adding to concerns, the offshore Chinese yuan fell despite the PBOC setting a higher fix for the onshore rate as traders bet on future depreciation. There had been signs that the recovery was petering out in the past day or so but equities finally succumbed when Brent crude prices hit a 12-year low early Thursday. Glad to see my typos are causing amusement.... The attacks in Jakarta today (liveblog here) may also be weighing on shares today, although worries over the global economy appear to be the main driver. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, says: Investors have once again realised that nothing has changed and a bounce wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really warranted. A depressed oil price remains hindered by global oversupply and the prospect of it getting worse as Iran returns to market, while China jitters continue to shake everything from commodities to financials. Attacks such as those overnight in Jakarta are also becoming much too frequent even if markets have developed thicker skin.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff has pushed the FTSE 100 down to a five-month intraday low. The blue-chip index hit 5836 this morning, a level not seen since the Great Fall of China last summer. And it trading finished now, the Footsie would be at its lowest closing point since November 2012. Merlin, the theme park group, is leading the selloff after being downgraded by JP Morgan: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has recorded its fastest growth since the early days of the eurozoen eurozone debt crisis. New official figures show that GDP rose by 1.7% during 2015, the best result in four years. ING economist Carsten Brzeski says Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s solid recovery continues: It was yet another year in which the German economy defied earlier swan songs and, despite many headwinds like the Greek crisis, the slowdown in emerging markets and China and increased geopolitical uncertainties, continued the recovery. But this could be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as good as it gets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he adds. Without any new structural reforms and investments it is hard to see any sharp acceleration of the economy any time soon. Separate figures have shown that Germany also posted a budget surplus in 2015. I suspect will reassure many Germans, but irk commentators who believe Germany should be spending more to help the European economy pick up. The FTSE 100 is flirting with is now sporting a triple-digit point loss. The blue-chip index is down 110 points right now at 5849, a loss of almost 1.9%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a broad-based selloff, only defied by retailers such as Tesco who posted surprisingly good results this morning. The turbulent market conditions don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear to be going anywhere fast, warns analyst Tony Cross of Trustnet. Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s modest gains on the FTSE-100 have already been eclipsed as investors become increasingly nervous over the outlook for crude oil. Wall Street sold off heavily into the close last night and this is very much setting the pace, leaving the vast majority of London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue chip equities trading squarely in the red. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s markets are bathed in electronic red ink this morning, with major indices all losing at least 1%. Several UK retailers are defying the selloff. Tesco jumped almost 7% to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard after surprising the City with a jump in Christmas sales. Burberry are close behind, up 3%, after announcing sales growth in China again. And among smaller companies, JD Sports are up 5.3% after it said profits would beat expectations this year. Even Home Retail are up, gaining 3.6% despite warning that Argos sales were weak. Traders may be betting there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more chance that the company will succumb to a new takeover offer from Sainsbury..... And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re off! European market are falling sharply at the start of trading. In London, the FTSE 100 has slid by 73 points, or 1.2%, to 5887, following the losses in Asia earlier today and on Wall Street last night. Other European indices are down around 1.3%, hit by worries over the global economy and China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowdown. The FTSE 100 has now lost 5.5% of its value this month - a rough start to the year. Joe Brent of City firm Liberum explains why: In 2016, UK indices have suffered their worst start since 2008. There is plenty to worry about globally; China, emerging markets, commodity prices, monetary tightening, negative earnings momentum, high valuations and a tired looking bull market. Over in the City, the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policymakers are gathering to set monetary policy. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no chance of a rate rise, given the recent market turbulence and weaker economic data that has sent the pound to its lowest level against the US dollar since 2010. FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga says: Investor sentiment towards the Sterling continues to weaken ahead of the anticipated Bank of England (BoE) rate decision today, in which markets broadly expect rates to be left unchanged at the record 0.5% low. Since the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s December meeting, the overall outlook for the UK economy has dimmed considerably with a downwards revision of Q3 GDP and a decline in industrial productions renewing concerns around the potential slowdown in economic momentum in the United Kingdom. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mixed news from fashion chain Burberry this morning. On the upside, its sales in mainland China are growing again after a worrying slide last year. That helped send retail revenue up 1% in the last three months on 2015. On the downside, turnover in Hong Kong and Macau took a hit in the last quarter. CEO Chris Bailey says it was tougher than expected, as market upheaval hits demand for expensive coats and handbags. While Burberry was impacted by the ongoing challenges facing the luxury sector, headwinds in Hong Kong and Macau masked an otherwise stronger performance in many markets. Home Retail has warned that poor sales at its Argos chain would hit group profits. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s significant, as the company only recently rebuffed a takeover bid from Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. My colleague Julia Kollewe has the details: Argos posted a 2.2% fall in like-for-like sales in the 18 weeks to 2 January, worse than analysts had expected. Walk-in sales slumped 13% in December, with shopping centre and high street stores badly hit, which was only partly offset by 10% growth in digital sales. Home Retail\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other chain Homebase enjoyed 5% growth, boosted by kitchen and bathroom products. The company confirmed that is in advanced discussions to sell the DIY chain to Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wesfarmers for \u00c2\u00a3340m. City analysts are impressed with Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Christmas performance: On a busy morning for retail news, Tesco is grabbing the headlines. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest supermarket has defied its critics by reporting a 1.3% rise in sales over the Christmas period. It suggests CEO Dave Lewis is making good progress in his labours to turn the company around. My colleague Fiona Walsh explains: Tesco cheered the City with news of a much stronger than expected performance over Christmas, pushing sales in its core UK supermarkets business up by 1.3%. Most analysts had been expecting sales to fall. Chief executive Dave Lewis said the group, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest retailer, had benefitted from lower prices on what he called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an outstanding range of products.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brent crude is bobbing around $30.50/barrel this morning, after hitting $29.73 last night. That means motorists should be able to look forward to cheaper fuel costs, given that crude has lost a third of its value since December. Industry body RAC insists that fuel prices should follow suit. Spokesman Simon Williams said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With no apparent end in sight to the free-falling price of oil, motorists can expect some really low fuel prices in 2016. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Breaking through the pound a litre price point for both petrol and diesel was clearly a welcome landmark, but it looks as though there is more to come. In fact we may get to a bizarre time when a litre of fuel is cheaper than a litre of some bottled waters.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Angus Nicholson of IG has warned that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a negative feedback loop of self-perpetuating fear seems to have gripped global markets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as shares dive across Asia. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff is also being driven by renewed fears over the situation in China, and the possibility that Beijing will devalue the yuan sharply. Angus explains: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor communication of FX (foreign exchange) policy and concomitant selloff in its equities appear to have lit a fire of negativity beneath global market sentiment. The threat of a dramatic devaluation by the Chinese government to ease its deflationary and debt-related pressures hangs heavy on markets like a Sword of Damocles. Despite China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s successful efforts this week to regain control over the offshore renminbi, the possibility of a major one-off devaluation in the currency is probably far higher than a black swan tail risk event. The fact that it is reportedly even being discussed by People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China (PBoC) advisors likely assigns it a probability as high as 20%. Pessimism has swept through Asia today, sending markets down to a three-year low. The sight of Brent crude oil below $30/barrel prompted big losses across the major indices. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei tumbled by 4% at one state, and finished the day down 474 points (down 2.7%) at 17,240. The Australian market shed 1.5%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Tin hats on, chaps. It could be a rough day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading in the stock markets, after the latest slide in the oil price hits confidence. Last night, Brent crude oil fell through $30 per barrel for the first time since 2004, after new inventory figures showed that US gasoline stockpiles had hit a record high. That sent Wall Street traders into a selling frenzy last night, as my colleague Rupert Neate explains: US stocks fell heavily on Wednesday, with the Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 500 falling 2.5% to take the index below 1,900 points for the first time since September, due to growing concerns about the falling oil price, which dipped below $30 a barrel for the first time in nearly 12 years. The S&amp;P 500, which closed at 1,890 points, suffered its worst day since September and has fallen by 10% since its November peak taking it into \u00e2\u20ac\u0153correction\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd territory, something that has not happened since August 2014. Asian markets have already taken a bath, and Europe is expected to follow suit. Spread-betters are calling the FTSE 100 down over 1%: And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big day for corporate news, with a flurry of retailers reporting Christmas trading. That includes Tesco, Home Retail, Burberry, JD Sports, ASOS, Associated British Foods (which owns Primark), Mothercare, Moss Bros and SuperGroup. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll do our best to cover them all.",

                "bodyText":"The fragility of the global economy will take centre-stage this week with the International Monetary Fund poised to warn of growing economic risks as business leaders and policymakers gather for the annual World Economic Forum in Davos. The IMF will update its forecasts for global growth on Tuesday and is widely expected to paint a bleaker picture for the year ahead amid the deepening Chinese downturn, a commodities rout and turmoil on global stock markets. Investors are also awaiting the first speech of the new year from the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, and hoping for assurances that interest rates will stay at their record low for many months given the shaky global backdrop, a slowdown in the UK economy and low inflation. The official theme of this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Davos meeting is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the fourth industrial revolution\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, or the looming impact of robots and artificial intelligence. But central bankers, ministers and business bosses meeting in the Swiss ski resort will doubtless be distracted by the torrid start to the year on financial markets that has so far seen almost $4tn (\u00c2\u00a32.81tn) wiped off global shares in the worst opening weeks on record. Even before the global rout, IMF head Christine Lagarde had warned that the slowdown in China, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-biggest economy, and the prospect of rising interest rates in the US were feeding uncertainty and denting growth prospects for 2016. The IMF is expected to use Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s update to its World Economic Outlook to underscore that message and cut its global GDP forecasts. China will add to the global gloom with GDP figures on Tuesday expected to show the weakest full-year growth for quarter of a century, at 6.9%. Further confirmation of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowdown will heighten worries over the futility of a series of moves by Beijing to shore up growth and investor confidence. China-related fears have battered stock markets from the US to Asia while in the UK, the FTSE 100 has lost 7% since the start of 2016. Globally, stock markets have shed $3.83tn in value since the start of the year, according to S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. In the UK, a raft of economic figures are likely to underline the uncertain outlook, including fresh confirmation that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay recovery has stalled. Earnings growth, excluding bonuses, is expected to dip to 1.8% in the three months to November compared with 2% in the three months to October, according to a Reuters poll of economists. After years of pay undershooting inflation and so falling in real terms, British wages rebounded last year. But pay rises have faltered in recent months and workers should brace for pay growth to remain weak, warns the think tank the Resolution Foundation. Leaving interest rates at the record low of 0.5% last week, the Bank noted signs that wage growth had dipped. Policymakers also said the latest sharp fall in oil prices, which hit fresh 12-year lows last week, would probably keep inflation lower than they had been expecting. Economists forecast official figures on Tuesday will show inflation edged up to 0.2% in December from zero the month before. Inflation has been below the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target for almost two years and is expected to stay low thanks to a supermarket price war and low oil prices. Brent crude prices fell below $30 a barrel last week. The growth outlook for the UK has also been clouded by news of a recession in the manufacturing sector and uncertainty over the outcome of a referendum on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU membership, promised before the end of 2017 but expected to take place this year. In recent weeks, financial markets and economists have pushed back their expectations for an interest rate rise to the second half of this year at the earliest. Last July, Carney had appeared to warn households to prepare for a rate rise in early 2016 when he said the decision on when to increase borrowing costs would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153likely come into sharper relief around the turn of this year\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Mortgage holders and investors will be hoping for a fresh update from Carney in Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech although the Bank governor may want to avoid providing any clear hints having been forced to row back on such guidance in the past.",

Six months ago, in a speech in Lincoln, he said the decision on whether to increase the cost of borrowing would <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/16/uk-interest-rate-rise-new-year\">come into sharper relief around the turn of the year</a>. That was seen as an indication that a tightening of policy would be announced sooner rather than later.</p> <p>Well, the turn of the year has arrived, Carney has decided that the time is not yet ripe for a rate rise. Marching the markets up to the top of the interest rate hill only to march them down again has become a bit of a habit.</p> <p>For all that, the governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s caution is justified. Carney said a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153powerful set of forces\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - some domestic, some global, some long-lasting, some cyclical - had combined to keep interest rates at their record low rates since the Great Recession ended in 2009.</p> </blockquote> <p>Read the full analysis here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2016/jan/19/interest-rates-mark-carney-is-right-to-remain-cautious\">Interest rates: Mark Carney is right to remain cautious</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-569e4244e4b06544a9da9194\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-19T14:03:59.545Z\">2.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/HowardArcherUK/statuses/689446329660022789\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Markets?src=hash\">#Markets</a> have given their view of dovish <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Carney?src=hash\">#Carney</a> speech - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/pound?src=hash\">#pound</a> hits 7-year low against <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/USdollar?src=hash\">#USdollar</a> and tests 1-year low against <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/euro?src=hash\">#euro</a></p>&mdash; Howard Archer (@HowardArcherUK) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HowardArcherUK/status/689446329660022789\">January 19, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-569e3a53e4b06544a9da9180\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-19T13:31:47.849Z\">1.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>On the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline today, David Lamb, head of dealing at the forex group Fexco, said:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The prospect of a UK interest rate rise hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been kicked into the long grass.

Meanwhile the core rate of inflation (excluding food and fuel) rose 1.4% year on year versus a consensus forecast of 1.2%. This was also the highest inflation rate since January last year.</p> <p>The details show air fares contributed positively (up 26.8% year on year! Sea fares were up 20.3%) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c note that the transportation component was the only one of 12 CPI sub components to actually increase. It showed transport prices swinging from -2.1% year on year to -0.2%. However, food prices saw intensifying deflation, as did clothing, furniture, recreation and culture. Therefore, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pick-up in inflation (particularly core) can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really be viewed as suggesting the story regarding inflation has changed much. After all, transportation prices will fall back again next month given what has happened to fuel costs.<br></p> <p>Given that inflation remains so soft and with tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK labour report set to show a further slowing in the pace of wage growth, the Bank of England is under no pressure to respond. Moreover, the Brexit uncertainty poses clear risks for growth, particularly through the investment and hiring channels, which will more than offset concerns about inflation risks from sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent falls. As such we see little prospect of BoE action ahead of the EU referendum, which seems set for June/July. We continue to have November as the probable start point for UK rate hikes, assuming the UK votes to remain an EU member state.<br></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-569e0841e4b03e04102e173d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-19T09:57:57.006Z\">9.57am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bbf656ba8ba91f2cfe7b7818b541ca1f2e852f89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbf656ba8ba91f2cfe7b7818b541ca1f2e852f89/0_0_746_527/500.jpg\" alt=\"UK inflation contribution\" width=\"500\" height=\"353\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">UK inflation contribution</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Office for National Statistics</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-569e0788e4b06544a9da911f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-19T09:55:06.043Z\">9.55am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The pound has moved to its day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highs against the dollar and euro, as the UK inflation figures came in higher than expected.</p> <p>Sterling touched $1.4340, up from $1.4320 before the data, while against the euro it strengthened from 76p to 75.82p.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-569e06ffe4b0cdd2b1e0ce2f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-19T09:53:00.115Z\">9.53am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FOREXcom/statuses/689380128820838400\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Other measures of UK inflation were also stronger than expected with RPI rising 1.2% vs. 1.0% expected and HPI +7.7% vs. 7.3% y/y <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FX?src=hash\">#FX</a> ^FR</p>&mdash;

While direct links between the UK and China are relatively small, the spill-over effects from China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic slowdown, alongside continued volatility in financial markets, amplify the downside risks to growth in the UK.</p> <p>Nevertheless, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important not to be too downbeat about China or emerging markets more generally. With household incomes up by 7%, and online retails sales growing by 33% last year, China represents a lucrative market for British business.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile James Sinclair at corporate finance house Clearwater International said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Much will be made of the fact that this is China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakest growth in a quarter of a century: Intense volatility in the stock market and the cycle of industrial overcapacity and sluggish external demand have had policymakers looking over their shoulder for a good while.</p> <p>But we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see this as the toppling of an economic giant. Instead, there is a rapidly different business environment forming in China. The overall trend for consumer spending is far from grim, and the surging middle class is at the heart of this consumption boom. While consumers are boosting demand for imported goods, there are Chinese companies working in the opposite direction, and redefining what Chinese exporters look like.</p> <p>With the growth of entrepreneurism and innovation in the country, we can expect to see many other Chinese companies both threaten existing industry structures and open up new spaces. By the end of the decade, we still expect China to be one of the leading cross-border investors, and given the patterns we have seen, this is a trend we see no sign of stopping.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-569dfbdde4b03e04102e172c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-19T09:04:39.119Z\">9.04am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More on UK inflation. lya Spivak, currency strategist at DailyFX, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The core year-on-year inflation rate is expected to register at 1.2% in December, unchanged from the prior month.

While these numbers are slightly disappointing they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t point to a sharp slowdown, however it does raise the question as to what further steps to stimulate the economy policymakers will take in the coming weeks. </p> </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere in the run up to Davos, the International Monetary Fund releases its latest growth forecasts.

                "bodyText":"PS: If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to learn more about Mark Pollock, please start here: And that is all from us for tonight. Back in the morning. GW Davos isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just about greedy bankers and scheming politicians. Tonight, the press pack are hearing from Mark Pollock, who became the first blind man to reach the South Pole in 2009. The next year, he fell from a second floor window, broke his back, and is paralysed. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently explaining how he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been working with pioneering doctors who are working on spinal cord injuries and seeking a cure for paralysis. Impossible? Not if you listen to Pollock, whose resolve and optimism is quite, quite gripping. He believes a cure is possible, saying: The next big step for mankind is to take the first step after paralysis. And he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shown us videos of how he has worked with scientists to get his own body working again (we just saw him bend his left leg, thanks to an array of wiring). Pollock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s message is that, in the 4th industrial revolution, biotechnology and genetic engineering could help a new wave of pioneers to redefine what it means to be human (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m paraphrasing him). Google him, please, and find out more about what he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doing. It sounds pretty important. An intriguing theme has emerged around this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Davos - the Falklands Islands. Argentina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new president, Mauricio Macri, has declared that he wants to rebuild his country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relationship with the UK, more than thirty years after the Falklands War. Macri is going to meet with David Cameron at Davos; we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be poised for that. The awards ceremony is over, and delegates are fanning out across the Congress Centre, and beyond, ready for tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s action. DiCaprio announces that his foundation is making a new \u00c2\u00a315m donation to help protect fragile ecosystems. This includes rainforests in Sumatro, and protecting other rainforsts from the palm oil industry. And finally, Leonardo DiCaprio is picking up a Crystal Award for his work on environmental issues and climate change. The Hollywood actor tells delegates at Davos thatworld leaders took an important first step in Paris with their agreement to reduce carbon emissions. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much more to do. The Paris agreement was a call to action, but it falls to all of us to help fight against the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153irreversible damage\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that climate change will cause. We simply cannot afford the greed of the oil industry to determine the future of humanity. Enough is enough, you know better, the world knows better. History will put the blame for this devastation firmly at their feet. And DiCaprio insists that fossil fuel reserves must be left where they are. Climate change cannot be stopped unless fossil fuels are left in the ground. The next Crystal award goes to Chinese actor Yao Chen. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s known as the Queen of Weibo, with 78 million followers on the social media site (there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an audible gasp in the audience). Chen is being recognised for her work raising awareness of the refugee crisis, visiting migrant communities in countries such as Philippines, Thailand, Ethiopia, Lebanon and Pakistan. Chen thanks aid organisations, the UN, and her husband for his support, and talks about how helping other people is important; it helps to meet the needs of the helper too. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poorest communities could be changed forever if they could spawn the next technology giant, will.i.am continues. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the long-term goal of his foundation. Hilde Schwab, who co-founded WEF with her husband Klaus, has the floor in Davos. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcing the winners of the Crystal Awards - WEF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual prizes for people who have gone the extra mile to make the world better (no, they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give them to Wall Street bankers) This year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s winners are actors Yao Chen and Leonardo DiCaprio, artist Olafur Eliasson, and musician and entrepreneur will.i.am. Hilde explains that Eliasson has helped create and strengthen communities by building large-scale installations and designs. Next comes Will.i.am (of the Black Eyed Peas, younger readers) is being recognised for his work bringing educational opportunist to the underpriviliged. His I am Angel foundation has helped keep young people in education and out of Will.i.am is now on stage, joking that he grew up near gangs in the ghettos of America but he was more scared of his mother than the gangs so he kept out. But turning serious, he says he wants kids to aspire to be the next Steve Jobs, the next Bill Gates, and fix the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems rather than waiting for governments to do it for them. One of Davos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s many curious traditions is a habit of ringing cowbells when a keynote session is about to start. And that ding-ding noise in the distance means the opening ceremony is getting underway. Back at the cancer moonshot talk, Joe Biden has called on the public to do their bit to help tackle the illness. It won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be easy, or cheap. As well as warning about the impact of automation, Axel Weber, chairman of UBS, is discussing today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest downgrade of global growth forecasts by the IMF. It was like groundhog day, he say, as the IMF had downgraded its forecasts nine times. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign we have moved to a lower growth economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Weber adds that the problem isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so much cyclical as structural. The low growth, low inflation and low interest environment was likely to remain, he said. UBS chairman Axel Weber says politicians need to address the rising inequality that the robot revolution will cause: Jill is tweeting the details: While Biden was demanding more progress on cancer, Swiss bank UBS has been presenting a new report into the fourth industrial revolution. And you may be unsurprised to hear that UBS reckons the richest will benefit most from new technologies such as robots, AI, 3D printing, and all those cutting-edge systems. Why? Because firms will be able to use robots to squeeze out low-paid workers, boosting their profit margins at the expense of the poorest. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the story, by Jill Treanor: Joe Biden is now challenging the experts on the panel, who includes top cancer researchers from the US and beyond, to share their data better. Big data, he insists, is the key to this moonshot. What would happen if I asked all of you who have data..... to get together in one room. Could that make sense, to talk to each other?... No-one dares to object. Well, in that case I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to do it, Biden grins. Not for the cameras, but for my own knowledge, and to make faster progress. Some reaction to Joe Biden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s words: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another photo from the cancer moonshot talk: Data is absolutely crucial to Joe Biden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cancer moonshot: When Joe Biden talks about a cancer moonshot, he is harking back to the Apollo landings, and John F Kennedy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s declaration that America would put a man on the moon before the end of the 1960s. This battle is different, though, partly because Biden doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the Federal government can do all the work. Part of our role is to get out of the way, so the real experts can make the progress we need, the vice-president tells his audience at Davos. But we will also do everything we can at the federal level to help. Cancer has touched nearly all of us in some way, Joe Biden points out - few families have avoided experiencing it. And every year, 14 billion people are diagnosed with cancer, 8 million die from it. That total, of course, includes Beau Biden, the vice-president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s son who died of brain cancer last year. Hello from Davos, where this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s World Economic Forum is getting underway. Not without a few hitches, though. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bumper-to-bumper traffic out there, as business leaders, politicians, policy advocates and the media make the annual trek to WEF. And even the vice-president of the United States, Joe Biden, got caught in the jam; it made him around 30 minutes late for a meeting with top scientists to push for a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmoonshot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to find a cure for cancer. The vice-president apologises profusely and charmingly - but he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to; everyone here knows how Davos is a logistical nightmare this time of year. And his mission is so important that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s well worth waiting a few minutes.....\u00ef\u0153\ufffd And then it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down to business, with Biden explaining why he believes the world can make huge progress in the next few years. President Obama and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want small change, he insists - we want a Quantum Leap. Biden says: We are at an inflection point - a lot has been achieved in the last decade or less. We have seen amazing advances in science, immunology. Genomics is being leveraged in ways that weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t possible even six years ago. VP Biden adds that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vital to ensure that researchers have access to all the data available, as every cancer centre keeps a record of its own data. Tapping this treasure trove is vital to speeding the process towards finding a cure for cancer. The session is being streamed here. On a busy day and ahead of the start of the Davos conference, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a quick recap of events: Chinese GDP shows a slowdown.... ...but markets move higher on hopes for further central bank stimulus UK inflation hits an 11 month high ... but Bank of England governor Mark Carney rules out early rate rise ....which sends the pound sharply lower Meanwhile the IMF cuts its global growth forecasts The oil market could drown in oversupply says the International Energy Agency On that note, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll close for the moment. But Graeme Wearden will be back later with the first reports from this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Davos gathering. US markets have followed the example of Europe, and are moving sharply higher in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 148 points or 0.9% higher, while the S&amp;P 500 has climbed around 1%. Chinese GDP figures prompted talk of further stimulus measures to support the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second largest economy, while positive results from Bank of America and Morgan Stanley added to the upbeat mood. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a horrifying thought. There could be more plastic in the sea than fish in just over three decades. Ahead of Davos, Graeme Wearden reports: As a record-breaking yachtswoman, Dame Ellen MacArthur has seen more of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oceans than almost anyone else. Now she is warning that there will be more waste plastic in the sea than fish by 2050, unless the plastics industry cleans up its act. According to a new report issued by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation at the World Economic Forum on Tuesday, new plastics will consume 20% of all oil production within 35 years, up from an estimated 5% today. Plastics production has increased by twentytimes since 1964, reaching 311m tonnes in 2014, the equivalent of more than 900 Empire State Buildings, the report says, and it is expected to double again in the next 20 years, and almost quadruple by 2050. Despite this growing demand, just 5% of plastic goods are actually recycled effectively, while 40% end up in landfill and a third leak into fragile ecosystems such as the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oceans. The full story is here: Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s caution on interest rates is justified, says our economics editor Larry Elliott: Mark Carney is half way through his five-year term as governor of the Bank of England. Judging by his latest remarks on the state of the economy he could go back to Canada in the summer of 2018 and still not have raised interest rates. The governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech was notable for its dovish tone. Six months ago, in a speech in Lincoln, he said the decision on whether to increase the cost of borrowing would come into sharper relief around the turn of the year. That was seen as an indication that a tightening of policy would be announced sooner rather than later. Well, the turn of the year has arrived, Carney has decided that the time is not yet ripe for a rate rise. Marching the markets up to the top of the interest rate hill only to march them down again has become a bit of a habit. For all that, the governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s caution is justified. Carney said a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153powerful set of forces\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - some domestic, some global, some long-lasting, some cyclical - had combined to keep interest rates at their record low rates since the Great Recession ended in 2009. Read the full analysis here: On the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline today, David Lamb, head of dealing at the forex group Fexco, said: The prospect of a UK interest rate rise hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been kicked into the long grass. The Governor hoofed it right out of the park. Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prediction - made last summer - that we would have greater clarity on interest rates at the start of 2016 has been completely overtaken by events. Six months on, the prospects for UK interest rates remain as clear as mud. Even though UK inflation crept up a notch to a paltry 0.2% in December, tumbling oil prices will continue to drag down prices. Against a backdrop of extreme Chinese volatility and slipping rates of both growth and wages in the UK, none of the stars are aligned for a rate rise any time soon. With a UK rate hike now receding into the distance once again, monetary policy in London and Washington will continue to move in opposite directions. As a result the pound has tumbled against the dollar, and it is even slumping against the euro too. The combination of skittish equity markets and the vanishing prospect of a rate hike means investor appetite for sterling is eroding - and as a result the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gradual slide is likely to continue. And the pound is still falling: Answering questions, Carney said the Bank was picking up uncertainty around political events, but investment intentions remained robust. He also indicated that rates could rise before the consumer price index hit 2%: Spot in this chart of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s movement of the pound against the dollar when Carney started speaking and suggesting now is not the time to raise rates: The governor of the Bank of England has warned that the UK faces \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a powerful set of forces\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd preventing policymakers from raising interest rates and the date of the first rise is still uncertain, writes Phillip Inman. Mark Carney said the plunge in oil prices had dragged down inflation and postponed the date of a rise from the current 0.5%, though he refused to indicate when the central bank would make its first move. Carney said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Monetary policy will continue to depend on economic prospects and not the calender.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But his gloomy outlook, which also highlighted the rapid slowdown in China and the recent turmoil in global markets, is likely to be seen as delaying the first increase in rates since 2008 until at least the end of this year or possibly 2017. This will force many of the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investment banks to tear up their own forecasts, which have pencilled in a rise in the summer or Autumn. Bank of England governor Mark Carney wants to see faster growth and stronger inflation before raising interest rates, with no set timetable for an increase. In a speech at the Queen Mary University of London, he said global and domestic growth had proved weaker than he expected in the middle of last year, when he predicted a decision on rates would come into sharper relief by early 2016. He said: Well the year has turned, and, in my view, the decision proved straightforward: now is not yet the time to raise interest rates. This wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a surprise to market participants or the wider public. They observed the renewed collapse in oil prices, the volatility in China, and the moderation in growth and wages here at home since the summer and rightly concluded that not enough cumulative progress had been made to warrant tightening monetary policy. You can follow his speech live here. And now oil is back over $30 a barrel, despite the International Energy Agency warning of continuing oversupply. Brent crude has jumped 5.7% to $30.18, helped by strong oil demand from China. There is also the hope of more stimulus from the Chinese authorities following the latest GDP figures, which showed a slowdown in growth. Stock markets continue to move higher following the Chinese GDP data, and despite higher than expected UK inflation and the IMF cutting its global growth forecasts. The FTSE 100 is currently up nearly 1.9%, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is 2% higher and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 2.3%. In the US the futures are showing a 250 rise on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. As a reminder the US markets were closed on Monday, and fell sharply in the previous session on the tumbling oil price. Crude is now up 4.7% at $29.9 a barrel. And here are the IMF comments on markets and China, courtesy of Reuters: Global financial markets seem to be overreacting to falling oil prices and China, the chief economist of the International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday. Maurice Obstfeld also said it was critical that China is clear about its overall policy strategy, including its currency. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a stretch to suggest that (markets) may be reacting very strongly to rather small bits of evidence in an environment of volatility and risk aversion,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Obstfeld said in a news conference held after the IMF cut its global growth forecasts for the third time in less than a year. The IMF has commented on the prospect of Britain leaving the EU: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the UK Treasury welcoming the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation figures: The IMF is giving more details of its global outlook. Its chief economist Maurice Obstfeld said there were clearly deflationary pressures in the eurozone, and he expected the European Central Bank to ease further as further data comes in. He added that the US recovery appeared to be weaker than the Federal Reserve was expected when it raised interest rates in December. And he played down the recent market turmoil: He said the IMF did not see some of the extreme negative scenarios that the markets seemed to be anticipating. He added that a falling oil price would help consumers, so it was not an unmitigated negative. UK house prices are at a 10 month high, according to the Office for National Statistics: Meanwhile the ZEW confidence index showed a downbeat mood among German analysts and investors in the wake of the recent market turmoil. With any slowdown in China likely to knock the German export market, the ZEW think tank said economic sentiment fell from 16.1 in December to 10.2 in January. But this was higher than a Reuters estimate of 8.2. In the eurozone, inflation has come in at 0.2% year on year in December, in line with expectations. The month on month figure was flat. November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s year on year figure was revised down from 0.2% to 0.1%. That is a long was short of the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target despite the stimulus package the central bank has instituted. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation figures suggest that ECB President Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s renewed stimulus plan isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet having the desired effect, and the two per cent target is still a long way off. Record low oil prices, alongside volatility in China and elsewhere, have taken their toll on major economies the world over and the Eurozone is no different. With a stimulus programme in effect and no real room to manoeuvre interest rates further, Draghi is running out of options. Draghi must hope that any extra cash in the pockets of consumers due to low oil prices goes straight back into the economy to spur growth. Back with UK inflation, and Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight expects a UK rate rise in August: With consumer price inflation still only 0.2% in December, there is certainly little immediate pressure on the Bank of England to start raising interest rates. We believe it is pretty unlikely that the Bank of England will raise interest rates (from 0.50% to 0.75%) until at least August \u00e2\u20ac\u201c given the increased probability that inflation will stay lower for longer and a current more uncertain growth outlook. Indeed, there is a very real chance that the Bank of England could delay raising interest rates until the fourth quarter of 2016. Our current belief that the Bank of England will most likely edge interest rates up from 0.50% to 0.75% in August is based on the assumption that economic growth will be reasonable over the first half of 2016, earnings growth sees some renewed pick-up amid a tightening labour market and consumer price inflation trends gradually up. Even if the Bank of England does delay interest rates beyond August, we doubt it will delay acting until 2017 - barring a major slowdown in UK growth. The International Monetary Fund has reduced its growth forecasts in its latest update on the global economy. Our economics editor Larry Elliott reports: [The IMF] has added to concerns about the health of the global economy by cutting its growth forecasts for the next two years and warning that recovery from the financial crisis could be derailed altogether if key challenges are mishandled. The Washington-based body said world output would be 0.2 points lower in 2016 and 2017 compared with forecasts made just three months ago \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and that the risks to its predictions were to the downside. In an update to its World Economic Outlook, the IMF said growth was put at 3.4% this year and 3.6% in 2017. It said central banks should continue to boost growth and that finance ministries should bolster investment spending where possible. It also warned that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tide of refugees\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was putting the EU under strain and that action was needed to ensure that migrants could find jobs. Full story here: The inflation figures, along higher than expected, should not put pressure on the Bank of England to raise rates, said James Knightley at ING Bank: December UK headline consumer price inflation has come in at 0.2% year on year, up from 0.1% in November and is the fastest rate of price increase since January 2015. Meanwhile the core rate of inflation (excluding food and fuel) rose 1.4% year on year versus a consensus forecast of 1.2%. This was also the highest inflation rate since January last year. The details show air fares contributed positively (up 26.8% year on year! Sea fares were up 20.3%) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c note that the transportation component was the only one of 12 CPI sub components to actually increase. It showed transport prices swinging from -2.1% year on year to -0.2%. However, food prices saw intensifying deflation, as did clothing, furniture, recreation and culture. Therefore, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pick-up in inflation (particularly core) can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really be viewed as suggesting the story regarding inflation has changed much. After all, transportation prices will fall back again next month given what has happened to fuel costs. Given that inflation remains so soft and with tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK labour report set to show a further slowing in the pace of wage growth, the Bank of England is under no pressure to respond. Moreover, the Brexit uncertainty poses clear risks for growth, particularly through the investment and hiring channels, which will more than offset concerns about inflation risks from sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent falls. As such we see little prospect of BoE action ahead of the EU referendum, which seems set for June/July. We continue to have November as the probable start point for UK rate hikes, assuming the UK votes to remain an EU member state. The pound has moved to its day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highs against the dollar and euro, as the UK inflation figures came in higher than expected. Sterling touched $1.4340, up from $1.4320 before the data, while against the euro it strengthened from 76p to 75.82p. Our report on inflation, from Patrick Collinson: There was a surprise rise in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate to 0.2% in December, the first month since January 2015 in which the rate has exceeded 0.1% according to the Office for National Statistics. Transport costs, particularly air fares, and to a lesser extent motor fuels, were the main contributors to the rise, said the ONS. These were partly offset by downward pressure on prices for alcohol and tobacco along with food and non-alcoholic beverages partially offset the rise. Monthly inflation has been between -0.1% and 0.1% for the past eleven months, helped by plunging commodity prices. More here: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the trend for CPI: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a breakdown of the inflation data: This is also the first time the rate has exceeded 0.1% since January 2015, according to the Office for National Statistics. It said: Movements in transport costs, particularly air fares and to a lesser extent motor fuels, were the main contributors to the rise in the rate. Downward pressures from prices for alcohol and tobacco along with food and non-alcoholic beverages partially offset the rise. The UK consumer price index has risen 0.1% in December on a month on month basis, in line with forecasts. But the year on year figure of 0.2% is the highest since January 2015, and higher than expectations of a 0.1% rise. The crude oil market will continue to be oversupplied until at least late 2016, according to the International Energy Agency. It said the market \u00e2\u20ac\u0153could drown in oversupply.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd With unseasonably warm weather and rising supply - not least from Iran now sanctions have been lifted - will continue to put pressure on crude prices. The IEA said global oil demand fell to a one year low of 1m barrels a day in the fourth quarter of 2015, down from 2.1m in the previous three months. In its latest monthly report the IEA left its estimate of global demand growth for 2016 at 1.2m barrels a day. The IEA said (quote courtesy Reuters): We conclude that the oil market faces the prospect of a third successive year when supply will exceed demand by 1m barrels a day and there will be enormous strain o the ability of the oil system to absorb it efficiently. Brent crude, which was earlier up 3%, is now 2.5% higher at $29.29 a barrel. A couple of positive comments on the Chinese GDP figures. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI director of economics, said: These figures paint a picture of a Chinese economy which is slowing and rebalancing, but still making a huge contribution to the global economy. In recent weeks, financial markets have struggled to digest this situation, alongside further weakness in oil prices. While direct links between the UK and China are relatively small, the spill-over effects from China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic slowdown, alongside continued volatility in financial markets, amplify the downside risks to growth in the UK. Nevertheless, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important not to be too downbeat about China or emerging markets more generally. With household incomes up by 7%, and online retails sales growing by 33% last year, China represents a lucrative market for British business. Meanwhile James Sinclair at corporate finance house Clearwater International said: Much will be made of the fact that this is China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakest growth in a quarter of a century: Intense volatility in the stock market and the cycle of industrial overcapacity and sluggish external demand have had policymakers looking over their shoulder for a good while. But we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see this as the toppling of an economic giant. Instead, there is a rapidly different business environment forming in China. The overall trend for consumer spending is far from grim, and the surging middle class is at the heart of this consumption boom. While consumers are boosting demand for imported goods, there are Chinese companies working in the opposite direction, and redefining what Chinese exporters look like. With the growth of entrepreneurism and innovation in the country, we can expect to see many other Chinese companies both threaten existing industry structures and open up new spaces. By the end of the decade, we still expect China to be one of the leading cross-border investors, and given the patterns we have seen, this is a trend we see no sign of stopping. More on UK inflation. lya Spivak, currency strategist at DailyFX, said: The core year-on-year inflation rate is expected to register at 1.2% in December, unchanged from the prior month. Leading survey data hints downward price pressures may have waned however, opening the door for an upside surprise. Such an outcome may breathe a big of life into rate hike speculation, offering a lift to the British pound. Follow-on comments from Bank of England governor Mark Carney represent a bit of wild card and may either amplify or undermine the initial post-CPI response, depending on the central bank chief\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tone. Despite Bank of England governor Mark Carney saying in the middle of last year that it should be clearer by now when UK interest rates should be increased, that is not at all the case. Recent weak data and the current market turmoil that many analysts do not expect any move until much later this year, if at all. Bank of England policymaker Gertjan Vlieghe seemed to concur on Monday, saying ultra low rates could be here to stay for some years. So Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech later at the University of London will be closely watched for any hints as to the timing of any rate rise. Still on the corporate front, one of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest gainers in the UK market so far is Ocado. The online grocer is up 11% following a revival of talk that Amazon could be interested in a takeover to boost its own fledgling food business. Unilever, which makes everything from Dove soap to Pot Noodle, is expecting trading condtions to be tougher and more volatile this year. The company beat analysts forecasts with full year sales up 4.1%, despite negligible growth in developmed markets and weakness in emerging markets. Full story here: As the markets hold onto their early gains, analyst Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said: A shortfall in Chinese GDP data for 2015 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and accompanying hopes that this will be the catalyst for further stimulus measures from Beijing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is the key driver here, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the natural resources stocks that are leading the charge. Whilst some upside is probably warranted \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not least given the protracted falls we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve accrued of late \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the question as always is just how sustainable these gains will prove to be. The news of weak growth has obviously done nothing to lend support to oil prices, but bargain hunting and a mounting belief that Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s over supply of the market will now reign in higher cost production is also helping crude edge higher. A break back above $30/barrel here could prove instrumental in cementing a degree of confidence in the wider market. David Morrison at Spreadco said it will be key to see if markets can maintain their earlyi momentum: How this now plays out could be very instructive. If equities can hold on to early gains then we could finally build some upside momentum and reverse last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. But if this rally fades, as did all the attempts last week, then that could signal that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re entering a fully blown bear market. Ahead of the latest EU inflation number and the ZEW confidence figures, Germany has reported a 0.2% year on year rise in its consumer price index. Following a move below $28 a barrel on Monday in the wake of Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promise to increase exports now sanctions have been lifted, crude prices have regained some ground. Brent is now up 3% at $29.44 a barrel, following strong oil data from China where demand in 2015 was at a record 10.32m barrels a day, up 2.5% from the previous year. Following on from Asia, European stock markets have moved higher in early trading. The FTSE 100 has jumped 1.7% or 102 points to 5881.92 while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is up 2.1%, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac 1.9% and Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex 1.7%. The Chinese data is behind the moves. With the GDP figure was just shy of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s targets, investors are betting on more stimulus from the central bank to give the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second largest economy a lift. So mining shares are among the leading risers, with Glencore and Anglo American both up around 8%. Ahead of the World Economic Forum\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual conference which begins this evening, my colleague Graeme Wearden has looked at the eight key themes, ranging from the rise of the robots to market turmoil and medicine: For UK inflation, most analysts expect the CPI figure to come in at 0.1% but RBC Capital Markets goes a little higher: RBC forecasts CPI inflation at 0.3% year on year in December 2015, up from 0.1% year on year in November. However, as last time, we acknowledge that the risk to the forecast is to the downside as the continued decline in the petrol price has reduced the base effects that were due to kick in on the back of oil price declines at the end of 2014. For RPI inflation, we look for the annual rate to hold at 1.1% year on year. Beyond the monthly print, the message remains that even if inflation does get near 1% year on year soon, there are limited prospects in 2016 for it taking another leg up from there and moving towards the 2% target. As well as China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets moving higher, the Nikkei and Hang Seng are also in positive territory, up 0.5% and 1.75% respectively. So Europe is expected to follow suit: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. On a busy day for economic news, China has kicked things off with news of the slowest GDP growth in 25 years. The figure of 6.9% growth for the year was not far from the government target but prompted talk of new stimulus measures, and gave some support to the Chinese stock market. The CSI300 index rose 2.95% while the Shanghai composite was 3.2% higher. Here is our report on the Chinese GDP numbers: Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest Chinese economic data hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really shed any new light on an economy that we know is slowing down. The latest fourth quarter GDP data came in at 6.8%, the slowest pace in 25 years and slightly below consensus expectations, while December industrial production slid back to 5.9% from 6.2% in November, no real surprise given recent weak PMI readings. Retail sales were slightly disappointing coming in at 11.1%, slipping back from 11.2% and breaking a sequence of consecutive monthly improvements since last March. While these numbers are slightly disappointing they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t point to a sharp slowdown, however it does raise the question as to what further steps to stimulate the economy policymakers will take in the coming weeks. Elsewhere in the run up to Davos, the International Monetary Fund releases its latest growth forecasts. There are also UK and EU inflation figures, as well as a speech from Bank of England governor Mark Carney. Here are the timings: 9.30 GMT UK inflation 10.00 GMT Eurozone inflation 10.00 GMT ZEW consumer confidence index 10.00 GMT IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s World Economic Outlook 12.00 GMT Mark Carney speech",

                "bodyText":"And finally, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drama: And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for tonight. Back tomorrow. GW Phew! Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market rout is over, with Wall Street posting chunky losses - but not as bad as it looked earlier. The Dow Jones closed 245 points, or 1.5%, in the red - bad, but better than the 500+ slump that had Davos attendees gasping earlier today. As if today wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t dramatic enough - Deutsche Bank has issued a profit warning: In another significant move, Joe Biden has used his trip to Davos to urge executives to fight for the right of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. Reuters has got the story: The issue is on the official agenda for the first time at the World Economic Forum, where political leaders from countries that discriminate against gay people, such as Nigeria and Russia, schmooze business leaders and billionaire investors. Biden told U.S. executives including Nathan Blecharczyk, co-founder of apartment-sharing firm Airbnb, Muhtar Kent, chairman and CEO of The Coca Cola Company, and Anthony Scaramucci, founder of hedge fund SkyBridge Capital, to push for change. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You can change the terms of debate,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You actually put governments on notice.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He said he and President Barack Obama privately raise the issue of repression of the LGBT community when they meet political leaders. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have had some run-ins with at least four heads of state already on this,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Biden More here: Biden urges U.S. business in Davos to lean on anti-gay states Joe Biden is giving quite a progressive speech tonight at Davos. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s telling the heads of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest businesses that they need to ensure basic protection for workers are the world economy embraces the 4th industrial revolution. Joe Biden also cited one of the statistics of the week - the continued concentration of wealth among the very richest. Joe Biden, the vice-president of the United States, has given the final keynote speech of the day. He started by joking with Christine Lagarde in the audience, saying that he might need some money. Not for a bailout deal (things aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that bad today!), but for his own purposes: Whenever I see you, Christine, you say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I know, Greece. I know, Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But this time I need a personal loan. But then he turns to the issue of the 4th industrial revolution. It is creating new jobs, and even creating new industries. But will it actually transform the global economy? And will it be for better, or worse? Those who think we must get used to the new normal of slower growth are mistaken, Biden says. Technology is improving productivity, and it can create employment - he cites ride-sharing companies are taking on more staff. And \u00e2\u20ac\u0153astounding\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd breakthroughs in science will save lives. But there are dangers, and we must be pro-active. Biden says: How will the warehouse worker who used to ship your order, or the salesman who used to take it, make a living when they are no longer needed? And he goes on to warn that the old relationship between work and wages has been broken, and employees aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t getting a fair deal: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Dow Jones industrial average is down over 500 points\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, whispers one Davos attendee. And they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re right. The Dow has shed 536 points, or 3.3%, right now to leave it at 15,475 points. Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister, just whisked through the Davos conference room with a hall entourage. He wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t taking press questions, alas, but did share a quick, friendly handshake with Finland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, Alex Stubb. I guess relations are warmer than last year, during the months of debt negotiations. Tsipras is meeting with several top officials during his visit, including Christine Lagarde of the IMF. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hoping to make persuade them that Athens is making progress, and should be given some leeway on austerity and debt relief. But there is concern that the IMF will take a tough line on pension reform, threatening to reignite the debt crisis again.... US oil prices crashed below $27 for the first time since 2003 after the International Energy Agency warned on Tuesday that the oil market could \u00e2\u20ac\u0153drown in oversupply\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Venezuela requested an emergency Opec meeting to discuss steps to shore up oil prices, but other delegates dismissed the idea. New York light crude tumbled 5.5% to $26.89 a barrel on Wednesday, while Brent crude, the global benchmark, lost 4.2% to $27.56. Plunging oil prices piled further pressure on global stock markets. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading index, the FTSE 100, slid 203.22 points, or 3.5%, to 5673.58. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax tumbled 272.57 points, or 2.8%, to 9391.64 and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC lost 147.31 points, or 3.5%, to 4124.95. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones has plunged more than 400 points to 15,62.42, a 2.6% drop. The Nasdaq shed 115 points to 4361.53, also a 2.6% fall. Back to Davos, and the Pope has sent a message to politicians and business leaders attending WEF - don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget the poorest in society. Pope Francis warned that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153soulless machines\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd should not be allowed to muscle humans out of work, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To all of you I appeal once more: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcDo not forget the poor!\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 He continued: Weeping for other people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pain does not only mean sharing in their sufferings, but also and above all realising that our own actions are a cause of injustice and inequality. Once we realise this, we become more fully human, since responsibility for our brothers and sisters is an essential part of our common humanity. Do not be afraid to open your minds and hearts to the poor. In this way, you will give free rein to your economic and technical talents, and discover the happiness of a full life, which consumerism of itself cannot provide.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, has summed up the action on financial markets: FTSE bears have been enjoying themselves today, as the index touches levels not seen since late 2012. The UK market has not been alone, as Europe and now the US join in with the panic of January 2016. Bond yields are heading lower too as investors shun risky assets and stash their money in any safe place going. The main driver of the falls continues to be oil, which has pushed onwards to fresh lows, taking oil stocks with it. A fresh downgrade to IMF growth forecasts underlines what stock markets are telling investors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that things are looking gloomy across the board.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd While we were quizzing Ken Rogoff, Adam Posen, et al, Iranian officials have been taking a pop at Saudi Arabia. Foreign minister Javad Zarif argued that the Saudi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s are to blame for the crisis in the Middle East. The Telegraph has the details. Zarif claimed that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Saudi Arabia has tried to keep the old staus quo in our region because they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think change is in their interest. They unnecessarily panicked and created a lot of mess in our region. And Mohammad Agha Nahavandian, the chief of staff to Iranian prime minister Rouhani, has apparently said Iran will \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccertainly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 raise oil exports to the levels before sanctions were imposed (they were lifted last week, of course). That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely to further inflame tensions within Opec, and keep pressure on the oil price. The sell-off in global market is gathering pace. The Dow Jones is now down more than 400 points, or 2.6%, at 15,593.72. The FTSE 100 index in London has tumbled nearly 230 points, or 3.9%, to 5649.55. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has lost 335 points, or 3.5%, falling to 9329.09, while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC is down nearly 180 points to 4087.42, a 4.2% fall. Spot US crude oil futures have dropped below $27 a barrel, the lowest since September 2003, following a warning from the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy watchdog that the oil market could \u00e2\u20ac\u0153drown in oversupply\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Adam Posen, the Peterson Institute director who used to set UK interest rates, has also discussed the crisis with us. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not desperately alarmed: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think we are on the edge of another financial crisis. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even think we are on the edge of another crash. The idea that things are as over-valued as they were last time is false.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Posen said governments should be taking advantage of low interest rates to improve public infrastructure, called on China to boost the economy by creating a social safety net and said central banks should avoid making mistakes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At the margin I am not sure the Federal Reserve did the right thing by raising rates last month but I am not sure it was a big mistake. But if the Bank of England or the ECB raised rates, that would be a big mistake.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve now grabbed some time with Ken Rogoff, former IMF chief economist and now economics professor at Harvard, to discuss the market turmoil, and the global economy. Rogoff reckons the problems were concentrated in emerging markets. Asked whether the world was on the edge of another crisis, Rogoff said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It feels to me that there is a panic in the markets that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily translate into the real economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rogoff said that emerging markets would suffer in 2016, but that the US and Europe were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153solid\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If China goes from 7% growth to minus 2% growth then everybody will be in recession. If it goes to 3-4% growth it will probably not be enough to cause a recession in the developed world. But it is definitely a very precarious situation for emerging markets.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rogoff said it would help if Chinese policy makers won back the credibility they had lost by their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153foolish\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd attempts trying to control the stock market and the exchange rate. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like trying to control the weather. They should let the exchange rate and the stock market find their own level. This is the third leg of the debt super-cycle. First is was the US, then it was Europe, now it is China.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bob Diamond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns about liquidity (see earlier post) have also been echoed by a top IMF official earlier today: Speaking on a panel, deputy director Min Zhu said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The key issue is that liquidity could drop dramatically, and that scares everyone.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If everybody is moving together we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any liquidity at all. We have to be ready to act very fast.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hat-tip to AEP... Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has urged Davos attendees to invest more in his country, in one of his first appearances on the international stage since winning power. Trudeau jokes that while Davos is lovely, business leaders should really check out Whistler (the Canadian ski resort). And on the big issue of WEF, the rise of the robots, Trudeau warns that technology needs to serve the cause of human progress, and growth only succeeds if everyone benefits from it. He also argues that Canada can ride out the oil price slump: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also collared Dennis Nally, chairman of PricewaterhouseCoopers, to talk about the turmoil in the markets. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know whether we are heading for another crash but unquestionably the environment is clearly having an effect on markets, on everything that is going on here and on the attitudes that exist here in Davos. Confidence levels are down, the volatility we are seeing, There are more threats today than ever. How bad could it get? Who knows. Some people are speculating oil could reach $10 a barrel. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think any of us know. All of this uncertainty has a direct impact on confidence levels\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. What should be done? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There needs to be more dialogue about how [bring] to stability back into the system. I believe there is a disconnect between government, regulators and business\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Bob Diamond, the banker who was forced out of Barclays during the Libor rigging crisis, says there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no comparison between the situation today and in 2008. Diamond, who has now founded a banking operation called Altas Mara which is expanding across Africa, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It Is a correction, a heathy correction. A lot of people are trying to compare it to 2008, but during the last quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 we probably had the deepest economic correction I have seen. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see us going into that position. The US economy is still strong, Europe is doing surprising well - the easier monetary policy led by governor [of the European Central Bank Mario] Draghi has sown some positives. There is a correction in China.. If china slows down to 6 or 7% (growth) is that a success? That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He also suggests that new regulations brought in since 2008 aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helping to calm the markets: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A lot of people are taking about where is the liquidity, where are the buyers? Basel three, Volcker rule, ring fenced banks, buffer upon buffer of capital. Are we surprised there is less liquidity from the banks?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one jot of good news, Nouriel Roubini, Davos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own doctor doom and the economist who predicted the last crash doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it is going to be that bad this time. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is not going to be like 2008-09. There is not the excessive leverage in the financial system that there was last time.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But 2016 is going to be a bumpy year until central banks respond, Roubini warns. \u00e2\u20ac\ufffdThe big thing that should happen is China should stop kicking the can down the road and get on with some serious structural reforms\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Roubini is also concerned about the impact of smarter technology: To no one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great surprise, the US markets have followed the rest of the world and moved sharply lower in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 271 points or 1.7% while the S&amp;P 500 has fallen more than 1% and Nasdaq has lost 1.5%. Sir Roger Carr, chairman of BAE Systems, said: I think we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re witnessing a collision of events which has provoked an immediate sense of crisis. Whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commodities, China, oil prices, terrorism, geopolitical turbulence, all have landed particularly in the month of January and there is an immediate impact which is reflected in the stock market. At the moment what is being discounted are some of the positives that come out of low oil prices in economic terms. It is only being looked at in the lens of bad news. It is too early to say whether this is a crisis of lasting proportion but I think we should certainly continue to focus on addressing the challenges that are there for all. China may have slowed down but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not stopped. Europe is fragile but is focused on improvement and with the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s engagement in encouraging a more competitive Europe. America still has the fundamentals of an entrepreneurial spirit, self sufficiency in energy. When you look to the positive, while things are far from perfect, we are not at the point of absolute crisis. Back in Davos and Gavin Patterson, chief executive of BT, was asked if we were on the brink of another crisis. He replied: On the balance of probabilities no, but it is very finely balanced. It is an unstable environment. In terms of doing business, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just been at a lunch and most of the CEOs there say most of the underlying businesses are pretty good. If there is contagion in financial markets into the business markets that is going to affect confidence and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s when we could see a slow down. How bad? We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got to be used to a period of time when the world is just more volatile and we have to be able to live and manage through those sort of conditions. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to go away. There could be quite significant swings but the underlying number when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s evened out will be fine. What can be done? We need the financial markets to settle down and hope that confidence remains strong and that it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t affect people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s underlying desire to do business. What is really going in China is a big [concern], elections and referendum around the world is an issue and the state of things in the Middle East which have a knock on effect. The US inflation figures suggest there may only be one Federal Reserve rate rise this year, says Rob Carnell of ING Bank: US CPI for December fell 0.1% month on month versus a consensus 0.0% month on month expectation. Energy prices were down 2.4% month on month, and food prices also fell for a second consecutive month. But it is the weakness in the service sector inflation component that probably caught the consensus out the most. At only +0.1% month on month, this was down on the trend 0.2-0.3% growth in service sector prices over recent months, and may reflect a slightly weaker growth profile in residential rents, though it has to be said that the weakness in services was not confined to rentals, and was reflected also in areas such as recreation and education. Goods (commodities prices) were as ever, very weak (down 0.1% month on month excluding food and energy, down 2.1% year on year). At this stage, with the market looking for no further Fed rate hikes until the second half of 2016, and only one rate hike in total this year, it is our own forecasts with two further rate hikes, one in June, and another in the fourth quarter of 2016, that look more in need of amendment than the market view. The Fed dot diagram suggestion for four further hikes this year looks utterly out of touch with reality, if anyone was still paying any attention to this. In the US, the consumer price index fell 0.1% month on month in December after being unchanged the previous month. Analysts had been expected the index to also remain flat in December, but the falling oil price helped push it lower. But the year on year figure rose 0.7%, following a 0.5% gain in November. The core CPI, which strips out energy and food costs, rose 0.1% month on month after rising 0.2% for the previous three months, and 2.1% year on year. Meanwhile US housing starts fell 2.5% in December, adding to worries about the strength of the US economy. Goldman Sachs has reported a drop in profits for the fourth straight quarter, hit by a $5bn settlement related to sales of mortgage bonds during the financial crisis. The bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fourth quarter earnings fell 71.8% to $574m, with its results also affected by the plunge in oil prices, the slowdown in the Chinese economy and US rate rises. The slump in oil prices has sent the rouble to a new record low. The Russian currency fell to 80.92 to the dollar before recovering to 80.85, still down 2.8% on the day. The fall comes amid fears that the commodity-dependent Russian economy could be further hit by the continuing slide in crude prices. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading index has fallen into bear market territory, defined as 20% below its recent peak. The FTSE 100 has fallen to 5688, down more than 3% as the oil price continues to slide amid concerns about oversupply and lack of demand. Worries about the outlook for China have rattled global markets, not helped by gloomy comments from the World Economic Forum in Davos. The leading index has now fallen more than 20% from its intra-day peak of 7122, reached in April last year. Meanwhile Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is down 2.9% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has fallen 3.4%. Brent crude is currently 2.7% lower at $27.98 a barrel. Just grabbed a word with Philip J. Jennings, general secretary of UNI Global Union, about the turmoil in the markets. Are we heading into a crash? Yes, we are heading for a crash, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m worried about it. Emerging markets were meant to pull us through this crisis. but China is slowing, and the impact will ripple out across the developing economy. And the jobs situation across the global economy will not improve How bad could it get? We are worried abut the economic climate - how deep the crash will be. Those RBS analysts [who said to sell everything] may be right - \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cataclysm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd could be the right word to use. What should be done? We need leadership. The G20 needs to fulfil the promise they made at the last financial crisis, to not just save the banking sector but to also put the economy back on track. The private sector need to understand that lack of investment isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helping, and we need to push wages higher. The G20 needs to put demand back in the economy. Some customers at Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Monte dei Paschi bank have started withdrawing their savings, according to its chief executive. The bank is struggling with its bad loans and has seen its stock market value have this year. Reuters reports: Chief executive Fabrizio Viola did not say how much money savers had withdrawn, or when the outflow began, though he said the fall in deposits was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153limited\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that the bank could cope with it as he sought to reassure customers and investors. Italian bank shares have lost 20% so far this year as investors, already rattled about global economic growth, have sold out of a sector with low profitability and about 200 billion euros ($218 billion) of loans that are unlikely to be repaid. Monte Paschi - Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third-biggest bank - has lost the most ground as it is perceived to be the most vulnerable; it has the highest level of bad loans as a proportion of assets and was the worst performer in a health check of eurozone lenders in 2014. The Tuscan-based bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock, which had plunged 15% on Monday and 14.4% on Tuesday, was suspended from trading several times after falling 18.2% on Wednesday. The plunge helped dragged down all other Italian banking stocks, with Carige shedding 12.7% and Banco Popolare falling more than 6%. Viola said the plunge in Monte Paschi shares was not a reflection of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fundamentals, which he said had improved in the last quarter of 2015. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Of course clients turning to our local branches are worried about what they read,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Viola said in a statement. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At present the size of the funding lost due to clients who decided to move part of their savings elsewhere is limited and anyway below levels seen during the previous crisis the bank faced in February 2013 which was overcome brilliantly.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The 2013 crisis he was referring to was when the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest bank, already badly weakened by the euro zone debt crisis, was hit by a scandal about loss-making derivatives trades... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Over the past few days many have been wondering about the pace at which people closed their accounts and sold bank bonds,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Giuseppe Sersale, a fund manager at Anthilia Capital Partners. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t call it a bank run but there are definitely outflows,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he added. Meanwhile, there are reports of Italian government meetings to discuss the problems in the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking sector: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some words of comfort amid the gloom. European economics commissioner Pierre Moscovici does not believe there will be a repeat of the financial crisis, nor does he think the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth outlook will be changed in the next EC forecasts. And he says central banks still have actions they can take to tackle any further slowdown, even if interest rates are at record lows and plenty of stimulus measures have already been taken. Reuters reports from an interview with Moscovici: Central banks still have more firepower they can use to counter a slowdown in global growth, which does not change the outlook for recovery in the eurozone, European Economics Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said on Wednesday. In an interview with Reuters Television at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Moscovici said he did not believe there would be any return to an international financial crisis, despite turmoil in world markets during the first few weeks of 2016 triggered by China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowdown and low oil prices. Asked whether the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main central banks had run out of ammunition to revive the global economy after years of record low interest rates and quantitative easing, he said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They have got guns and they can act.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Moscovici said he did not expect any major change in the euro zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth outlook when the European Commission issues an updated forecast in early February, despite the sharp slowdown in China and tumbling stock and commodity markets. The EU executive last forecast in November that the euro zone would grow by 1.8 percent this year and 1.9 percent in 2017 after an estimated 1.6 percent last year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As I see it today I see no change, no major change in our forecast... for Europe. But of course we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got to take into account those downside risks. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to change our policy stance but to reinforce it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. On global market turbulence and falling commodity prices, Moscovici said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel that the financial crisis is coming back. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel that we are facing the risk of a breakdown in world growth, but there are downsides that we need to address. The IMF has also weighed in on migration, saying it can be positive. A new report predicts a short-term boot to GDP in countries who take refugees in, and long-term benefits if migrants are integrated well. IMF chief Christine Lagarde has also tried to crush worries that migrants will drive wages down: More on capital flows. The amount of money flowing out of emerging markets, especially China, was much worse than expected last year, according to a report from the Institute of International Finance. In October the finance industry group forecast net outflows from emerging markets of $540bn. Now it says the figure was $735bn, with $676bn from China, as investors pulled out of emerging markets and Chinese companies hurried to pay off overseas loans as the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency depreciated. The institute said: Net capital outflows from emerging markets in 2015 were even larger than we previously thought. We now estimate total net capital outflows (including unrecorded flows captured by net errors and omissions) at $735 billion, up from outflows of $111 billion in 2014. The bulk of these outflows relate to China, driven in part by repayment of corporate foreign currency liabilities in the face of concerns about a weakening currency. We estimate total capital outflows from China amounted to $676 billion in 2015\u00e2\u20ac\u201dincluding $216 billion in unrecorded outflows in errors and omissions. Other emerging markets also experienced net capital outflows, as non-resident inflows slumped on broader concerns about emerging market growth performance and corporate indebtedness. For 2016, we expect continued net capital outflows albeit at a somewhat more moderate pace. The impact of the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shift to a tightening cycle may be limited as long as it is gradual, but flows to emerging markets will continue to face headwinds from growth and debt concerns. HSBC CEO Stuart Gulliver spoke to reporters after he had finished talking about climate change. Asked about the financial market turmoil, he said that part of the movement was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153self fulfilling\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as investors liquidated positions to make margin calls on positions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You always get an overshoot in times of significant sell offs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He also warned there could be more sell-offs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think we will see further adjustments before we hit equilibrium. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see a little more sell offs before we see equilibrium but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re closer equilibrium than we were a couple of weeks ago, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re towards the end of this sort of sell off\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He indicated that growth in China was strong and that yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures were 30% of the entire Chinese economy in 2005. The bank is currently deciding whether to keep its headquarters in the UK. Gullliver said an update would be made by the time of the results of February 22. Nariman Behravesh, chief economist of IHS, has some interesting thoughts on China, where he thinks policy makers in Beijing will respond to pressure on the yuan by quietly bringing back capital controls. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There has been a massive amount of capital flight - around $1 trillion since last summer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Behravesh said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That puts huge downward pressure on the exchange rate. The question is what happens next.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The first thing that policy makers could do is to let the currency go. That would result in a devaluation of 15-20%. That would have horrible consequences. It could trigger a global currency war and a global recession.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The second thing they could do is keep using foreign currency reserves, but there are limits to that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Finally, either explicitly or implicitly, they could bring back capital controls\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Behravesh said the third approach would run counter to the reform agenda of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leaders, who have expressed a desire for greater financial liberalisation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But there are no good options. The least bad option would be capital controls.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Behravesh said there were already signs that China was making it harder for people to take money out of the country. He said the credibility of the Chinese leadership had been undermined by their handling of the financial turbulence since last summer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The scary thing has been the ineptitude of Chinese policy makers, who panicked when the stock market fell last August and panicked again at the beginning of this year. They want reform but they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really trust markets.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Joachim Gauck, the president of Germany, is addressing the Davos Congress Hall now. He begins by touching on the migration crisis, which is a growing domestic issue in Germany after chancellor Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liberal refugee policy. Almost 60 million are trying to escape war and conflict, and it is presenting the European Union with its biggest ever test, he says. Migration isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a new problem, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been around for decades as people try to escape from peril, find a better life. He then quotes JK Galbraith, who said that migration was the oldest action against poverty. A look at the list of American Nobel laureates and Oscar price winners shows just how much a country can benefit from migrants\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 creativity, Gauck says. Migration, and integration, must be thought of in tandem, he says. But it is our \u00e2\u20ac\u0153humanitarian responsibility\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to take in people who are fleeing the refugee crisis. He also explains that Germany feels a moral obligation to help, having \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfallen so low\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the past (a reference to the second world war). This may not calm the rebellion within her own party, from those who believe Germany needs to cut the number of migrants entering the country: Update: Gauck goes on to warn that limits may need to be set. Associated Press has a good take: The president of Germany says that limiting the number of refugees entering Europe is necessary and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153morally acceptable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if the continent is to continue to provide help to those in need. While stressing the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153humanitarian responsibility\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of taking in victims of persecution, Joachim Gauck told a conference in Davos, Switzerland, that Germany and European countries must limit the numbers of people who want to come in to avoid being overwhelmed. My colleague Jill Treanor has spoken to HSBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO Stuart Gulliver - he has admitted that the bank may not have a decision on whether it is moving its bank out of the UK by next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial results. Al Gore, former US vice-president, says last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Paris agreement showed that the world is prepared to do what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s needed to tackle climate change. 195 nations said yes, we will change. The direction of travel has been established....and that message has been received by the World Economic Forum. In Paris, countries committed to keeping global warming down to 1.5 degrees celsius. But there is also disappointment that even more wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t achieved. Christiana Figueres, UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, says the Paris talks did not end with an agreement on the carbon price because of the lack of unanimity. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Paris agreement had to be unanimous, if there was one country that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree with the carbon price in 2015 had that been rammed down the throat we would not have had a Paris agreement.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A fixed carbon price would encourage investment in solar and other alternative energy sources, she explains. The stock market sell off is getting worse. The FTSE 100 is now down 170 points or 2.8% at 5706 - only around 20 points off a bear market (20% off its peak). Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is down more than 3% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has fallen 3.3%. The US is unlikely to be much help. Ahead of results from Goldman Sachs and the latest US inflation figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are showing a 329 point decline. Sir Martin Sorrell, chairman of advertising giant WPP, has added his voice to those warning that the world faces slowing growth. The new normal is a low-growth world. Inflation is under too much control, we could do with a bit more of it. That scenario will continue. The system couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sustain pre-Lehman growth rates because it blew up in September 2008. Ken Rogoff, former IMF chief economist and Harvard professor, blamed China for the recent market turbulence. It wasnt due to the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmicroscopic increase\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in interest rates. He also sees trouble ahead in the developing world: For the next year there is going to be a lot of risk in China and the emerging markets, but not such elevated risks for Europe and the US. Climate change is a big theme at Davos, especially after Leonardo DiCaprio attacked the greed of the energy industry last night. Stuart Gulliver, boss of HBSC, has told one panel that the bank sets tougher lending criteria for coal-fired power stations in emerging markets than those in developed economies. He is also optimistic, he said, about funding alternative energy despite the low oil price. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 The public wants to do this,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said, when asked about funding alternative energy and while the cost of financing for such companies currently high he expected it to fall. He also had a warning about suddenly withdrawing all financing for fossil fuels. There would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unintended consequences\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said as these companies were major employers and paid tax used by governments to pay for health care etc. Gulliver admitted that HSBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual meeting faced protesters from activists trying to end any investment in fossil fuels. Christiana Figueres, UN expert on climate, insisted she was not one of the activities calling for all carbon fuels to be left in the ground. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, former Nigerian finance minister, has backed the ebola agreement between Gavi and Merck announced today. There was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shared terror\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Africa last year, she says, during the ebola outbreak in which more than 11,000 people died. Amira Yahyaoui, the Tunisian journalist who is co-chairing this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, says the rise of smarter machines (the 4th industrial revolution), should spur humans to understand what makes them human. Speaking on a panel, she says humans are no longer in a monopoly on planet Earth. We are in competition with things that might be better than we are. We are the ones destroying the planet, we are the ones killing humans. So this 4th industrial revolution should maybe be a revolution of values. Yahyaoui also challenged WEF for not achieving gender parity at the forum (although there are three male and three female co-chairs this year, including General Motors boss Mary Barra and International Trade Union chief Sharan Burrow). Eighteen percent of this forum are women, 18 is nothing. I come from a country supposed to be very anti-woman and we are more than 33% women in parliament and we have parity in every election. [WEF has made some efforts on this issue, and offers an extra place to businesses who send at least one female delegate] She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also concerned that the percentage of people under 30 here is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153way less than 18%\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Every generation has been driven by youth, and this one will be too, Yahyaoui continues. Unfortunately, older people love progress, but they hate change, and revolutions are all about change, she concludes. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not by improving the candle that we created electricity, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to create electricity. Geraint Johnes, professor of economics at Lancaster University, said: All regions except London experienced a fall in the unemployment rate, suggesting that the recovery is now well and truly being felt nationwide. The construction industry has continued to play a leading part in the recovery - the number of jobs in this sector has increased by some 77000. Administrative and business support functions have also seen considerable growth - of 50000 jobs - over the latest period. The role played by construction is accentuated further by the continuing high rates of pay increase in that sector. Compared with a year earlier, pay in this sector in November amounted to some 5.6% higher. Taking the economy overall, pay growth remains comparatively muted, at 2.0% - though with negligible price inflation, workers are now experiencing noticeable increases in their real wages. So long as productivity gains can be restored, there is no reason to believe that the increase we are now seeing in pay levels should become inflationary. We should not therefore be expecting an interest rate hike any time soon. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chancellor George Osborne on the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data: On the jobs data, James Knightley at ING Bank said: The UK labour data looks pretty decent with employment growth in the three months to November rising 267,000 and the unemployment rate falling to 5.1%, both are better than the 235,000 and 5.2% consensus predictions. However, wage growth did slow close to expectations (ex bonus the three month average is now 1.9% year on year although the single month reading did rise to 2.1% from 1.6%). Consequently, it is an encouraging report that should keep consumer confidence and spending running at healthy levels. However, with Bank of England Governor Mark Carney suggesting there is little appetite for a rate hike any time soon and with the prospect of a Brexit vote set to weigh on activity it looks as though November remains the earliest possible opportunity for a rate rise. Still, sterling has come off its lows following the figures. After hitting a seven year low of $1.4125 it has recovered to $1.4162. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s are the average earnings: The government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to cut back the public sector show through in the jobs data. For September 2015, 17.1% of people in employment worked in the public sector, the lowest proportion since comparable records began in 1999. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Reuters take on the UK data: Wage growth in Britain in the three months to November was its slowest since February, official data showed on Wednesday, the latest sign the Bank of England will take its time before raising interest rates. The slowing in wage growth came even as Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to 5.1 percent, its lowest since early 2006, from 5.2 percent in the three months to October. The BoE is keeping a close eye on wage growth as it considers when to raise interest rates at a time when inflation has hovered near zero for months and weakness in the global economy is hurting British output. The unemployment rate of 5.1% was below forecasts of a 5.2% figure. Total weekly earnings rose 2%, compared to expectations of 2.1%. This is also the weakest growth since February. On the wages front, average weekly earnings excluding bonuses rose 1.9% in the three months to November, compared to expectations of a 1.8% rise. This was the weakest growth since February last year. The November figure was 2.1% year on year. For September to November 2015, 74% of people aged from 16 to 64 were in work, the highest employment rate since comparable records began in 1971, according to the Office for National Statistics. The UK December claimant count has fallen 4,300 compared to expectations of a 2,500 rise. The jobless numbers fell 99,000 to 1.675m in the three months to November, meaning the unemployment rate is 5.1%, its lowest since the three months to January 2006. Employment rose by 267,000, the third biggest increase on record. With crude still tumbling - Brent is now down 2.8% at $27.88 a barrel - Shell has spelled out the damage the slump in oil prices is doing to its business. Our energy editor Terry Macalister reports: Shell has warned that its fourth-quarter profits may be 50% lower than last time with full year write-offs as high as $7bn (\u00c2\u00a35bn), underlining the damage being wreaked on the industry by low crude prices. In the first preliminary results to be reported this year by any of the large oil companies, Shell said it expected earnings to come in at between $1.6bn and $1.9bn and full-year numbers as low as $10.4bn. Further losses will be taken in the last three months of the year, bringing the total amount of writedowns on the sale of assets and other one-off losses to as high as $7bn. The dismal figures ramp up the pressure on Shell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, Ben van Beurden, who is trying to justify the \u00c2\u00a335bn takeover of rival BG which must be agreed by more than 50% of Shell shareholders next week. The full story is here: Gavi, the vaccine group, is announcing a new deal with drugs company Merck to get access to its ebola vaccine. Under the scheme, Merck will make 300,000 doses of the vaccine available in the next few months, for clinical trials and in case there is another outbreak. The vaccine not been fully licenced yet, but testing last year found it was 100% effective in providing protection against ebola. Seth Berkley, the head of Gavi, says there was initially a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153complete market failure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with ebola, as there was no commercial demand for a vaccine. But the outbreak in 2015, in which more than 11,000 people died, has helped force a rethink. Merck\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s product, called VSV-ZEBOV live attenuated Ebola Zaire vaccine, is the most promising available, Berkley says. The suffering caused by the Ebola crisis was a wake-up call to many in the global health industry,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Berkley told an audience at Davos. This agreement means we will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ahead of the curve\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd next time. The deal will also help Merck to get the vaccine win approval from the World Health Organisation, he added. Gavi is providing $5m to help Merck submit the drug for licensing by the end of 2017. Julie Gerberding, vice-president for public health at Merck, says her company is committed to getting their ebole vaccine fully licenced. She says: The scale and speed of the firestorm in Africa reminded us that mother nature is the best terrorist. It showed that we need to prepare in advance, and also respond quickly when a crisis occurs. And when we have a licenced ebola vaccine, we will make it available at the lowest possible not-for-profit price, Gerberding pledges. Anand Mahindra, director of Indian company Mahinda and Mahindra, is one of the speakers on a panel about the transformation of tomorrow. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I was scared\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said when having dinner in New York and the young girls sitting next to him didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t talk to each other for 15 minutes while they used their phones. His daughter told him that they would be posting imagines on instagram. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was some kind of ghost world,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook is sitting alongside him, making the point that tomorrow won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be transformed while men keep ruling the world. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Men still run the world and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going that well\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She conducted a poll of audience - how many women had been told they were too aggressive at work and asked if they should be working. Hands went up. She talked about Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s civil courage initiative to try to end hate on he social network. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is no place for hate and intolerance on our platform,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO, Sheryl Sandburg, is discussing the future of technology now: In the wake of falls on Asian markets, investors in Europe are seeing heavy losses at the start of trading. The FTSE 100 is down 110 points or 1.8% 5766, its lowest level since November 2012 and less than 100 points off a bear market (down 20% from its all time high last April). Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is down 2.3% while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has fallen 2.4% and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB is down 2.6%. The head of Swiss banking giant UBS, Axel Weber, has added to the angst in Davos by warning that we are stuck in an era of low growth. He pointed out that the International Monetary Fund has consistently been downgrading its short-term growth forecasts, as hopes for a strong recovery have consistently been dashed. Weber says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Last year the forecast of the IMF for that year was 2% lower than the forecast three years out. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a sign of the fact we are and have moved to a lower growth environment, where the rebound of growth rates we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen in the past we are unlikely to see again soon. We are coming out of biggest global crisis in many decades and it will take time to heal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Weber also argues that something fundamental has changed - this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just a cyclical phenomenon. And that has left central bankers struggling: As he put it: One of the reasons why growth cannot be reignited is the central banks also have a difficulty to reignite inflation rates. Most of the central banks tell you (their target) is to have inflation rate of around 2%, quantitative easing and massively expanding the balance sheet does not lead to an uptick of inflation close to target at least on the time horizon of one to two years out\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are seeing a low growth, low interest rate environment with low interest rates. We will have to get used to the lower growth environment and low interest rate environment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market rally has proved shortlived, with Asian markets down sharply and Europe forecast to follow suit. After rising on talk of growing Chinese demand for oil and hopes of more central bank stimulus to boost the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second largest economy, crude is falling back once more. That appears to be a belated reaction to the International Energy Agency saying the market could \u00e2\u20ac\u0153drown in oversupply.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brent crude is now down nearly 2% at $28.19 a barrel, while WTI is down 3.3% at $27.52. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said the respite from recent negative sentiment has gained little traction: The inability of US markets to hold onto most of its gains was the first clue as oil prices slipped back off their highs once again. Furthermore it is this inability to sustain rebounds for any length of time that continues to gnaw away at investor sentiment in the short term, and keep the pressure on the downside. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story on the falling Asian markets, with Japan now technically in a bear market: Business leaders in Davos are rather gloomier this year, according to a new report from PricewaterhouseCoopers last night. Terrorism, oil, and China, mean bosses are more worried than at any time in the last 5 years: Good morning from Davos, Switzerland, where the 2016 Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum is getting underway. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit of snow in the air this morning, and more than a bit of anxiety as global leaders, business chiefs, campaigners, celebrities and the media converge on the small ski resort. This year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s WEF is racked with fears. For example: Will robots devour millions of jobs? How bad is the Chinese economy really? When will the rout in the stock markets end, and does it herald a wave of defaults? Is oil going to hit $20 per barrel, or even $10, and what will that means for petr-exporters? Can the turmoil in the Middle East be tamed? Will Europe sink under the pressure of the refugee crisis? Delegates have a lot on their plates this year, whether they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re mingling in the congress centre or holding top-level meetings behind closed doors. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot happening today, but here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a few key events we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll try to cover: 9am Davos time (8am GMT): Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sheryl Sandberg and Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Satya Nadella debate the 4th industrial revolution 9.30am: Vaccine group GAVI and Merck announce an ebola vaccine deal 10.30: A session on preventing future shocks in the financial markets, 11.20am: German president Joachim Gauck discusses the migration crisis 3.20pm: Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new PM Justin Trudeau 3.45pm: A session on the refugee crisis, including Queen Rania of Jordan, Peter Maurer of the Red Cross, and Hamdi Ulukaya of Chobani 5.45pm: US vice-president Joe Biden discusses geopolitical security. The full programme is online here. We also get the latest UK unemployment report this morning (9.30am GMT) and US inflation data this afternoon. And while all that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on, the stock markets are expected to suffer another bad day. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already been a heavy selloff in Asia, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expecting the FTSE 100 to tumble at the open. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the opening calls: UK FTSE: 5767 -110 points German DAX: 9438 -221 French CAC: 4176 -96 Spanish IBEX: 8401 -154 Angus Nicholson of IG says that concerns over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowing economy are building. The somewhat mystifying 3%+ rally in Mainland equities yesterday has proved short-lived and this is likely to punish commodities on European and US exchanges. Some more of the Chinese GDP data has filtered out today and concerns about Chinese economic growth seeing a very weak Q1 in 2016 are growing. So it could be a dramatic day....",

To him, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153being serious\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd includes spending time evaluating one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance and trying to determine how to improve. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you are not looking at your practice and you are not in the mindset of continuous improvement, you aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to make it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <h2>Coaching is still rare on Wall Street</h2> <p>Coaching, especially at hedge funds and other financial firms, is still not common. It is, however, a market that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s developing fast, says Pilichowski. Shull estimates that about one in five firms has worked with a performance coach.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153A lot of firms don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get that there is a psychology to trading and working with it and using it as strategy can be a real benefit,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd explains Shull, who gets hired by individuals as well as firms. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Just as often I get individuals at firms who say they want to work with a psychology coach but they are afraid to bring it to the firm or their [chief investment officer].\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Probably the most well known example of a performance coach working with a hedge fund is Ari Kiev, a psychiatrist who spent more than a decade working with traders at SAC Capital Advisors. A couple of years after Kiev\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death, Shull <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/denise-shull-what-i-learned-at-sac-2012-11\">interviewed with SAC</a> to replace him as the executive coach but did not get the job.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b52a86169c8fd497b9c48deacec4d3a908587168\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b52a86169c8fd497b9c48deacec4d3a908587168/0_18_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Damian Lewis as Bobby \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Axe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Axelrod and Paul Giamatti as Chuck Rhoades in Billions (Season 1, Episode 1). - Photo: JoJo Whilden/SHOWTIME - Photo ID: Billions_101_5107.R\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Damian Lewis as hedge fund owner Bobby \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAxe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Axelrod and Paul Giamatti as district attorney Chuck Rhoades in Billions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: JoJo Whilden/Showtime</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many have speculated that Giamatti\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s character on Billions is modeled after US attorney Preet Bharara, and chief Axe man Bobby Axelrod (Damina Lewis) is the fiction version of Steve Cohen, founder of SAC. Andrew Ross Sorkin, the New York Times reporter and co-creator and co-producer of the show, <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/01/billions-showtime-andrew-ross-sorkin-brings-wall-street-drama-to-tv\">denies </a>that the characters have been modeled after Bharara and Cohen. But the Kiev-angle is only likely to increase speculation.</p> <p>Cohen hired Kiev in 1992. Just months before he died, in January 2009, Kiev announced that he was going to launch a consulting practice. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This consulting practice effectively allows me to broaden my reach and offer customized services to an increasing number of fund managers who are recognizing the importance of a psychological perspective in managing investments,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/psychiatrist-and-trading-coach-ari-kiev-launches-kiev-consulting-60790217.html\">he said at the time</a>.</p> <p>Pilichowsky, a former trader, says he works with a small team of hand-selected coaches. Their jobs is not to judge their clients, but rather to work with them and help them improve. Often time this means working with clients on handling stress and raising awareness of how they behave in certain situations.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s psychological, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t put people on the sofa,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Pilichowski.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153When you come to a competitive market, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all about the emotions because there is nothing that the other guy doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have.

To him, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153being serious\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd includes spending time evaluating one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance and trying to determine how to improve. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you are not looking at your practice and you are not in the mindset of continuous improvement, you aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to make it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Coaching is still rare on Wall Street Coaching, especially at hedge funds and other financial firms, is still not common. It is, however, a market that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s developing fast, says Pilichowski. Shull estimates that about one in five firms has worked with a performance coach. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A lot of firms don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get that there is a psychology to trading and working with it and using it as strategy can be a real benefit,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd explains Shull, who gets hired by individuals as well as firms. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Just as often I get individuals at firms who say they want to work with a psychology coach but they are afraid to bring it to the firm or their [chief investment officer].\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Probably the most well known example of a performance coach working with a hedge fund is Ari Kiev, a psychiatrist who spent more than a decade working with traders at SAC Capital Advisors. A couple of years after Kiev\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death, Shull interviewed with SAC to replace him as the executive coach but did not get the job. Many have speculated that Giamatti\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s character on Billions is modeled after US attorney Preet Bharara, and chief Axe man Bobby Axelrod (Damina Lewis) is the fiction version of Steve Cohen, founder of SAC. Andrew Ross Sorkin, the New York Times reporter and co-creator and co-producer of the show, denies that the characters have been modeled after Bharara and Cohen. But the Kiev-angle is only likely to increase speculation. Cohen hired Kiev in 1992. Just months before he died, in January 2009, Kiev announced that he was going to launch a consulting practice. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This consulting practice effectively allows me to broaden my reach and offer customized services to an increasing number of fund managers who are recognizing the importance of a psychological perspective in managing investments,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said at the time. Pilichowsky, a former trader, says he works with a small team of hand-selected coaches. Their jobs is not to judge their clients, but rather to work with them and help them improve. Often time this means working with clients on handling stress and raising awareness of how they behave in certain situations. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s psychological, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t put people on the sofa,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Pilichowski. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When you come to a competitive market, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all about the emotions because there is nothing that the other guy doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have. If everyone has the same information, everyone has the same power of calculation, everyone has the same spreadsheet, the difference between me and that guy is going to be about the way we manage it emotionally. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t panic. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go too fast. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be jealous.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The most common emotion experienced by traders is the fear of missing out, says Shull. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People are afraid to just cut their losses because they are afraid the trade will come back. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s usually not even about the money. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIf I get out now and the trade comes back, I will look like an idiot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As a former trader, Shull says she knows how it feels when traders are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153afraid to get out of the loser\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the same problem that Mick Danzig, Nathan Darrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s character on Billions, struggled with. Shull, who had seen the pilot at the time of the interview, said that she looks forward to watching the first season of the show. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I like Damian Lewis. Obviously, I like the fact that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a coach on the show. The dominatrix piece of that coach is, you know, kind of interesting,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shull laughs, referring to Wendy Rhoades\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 evening hobby. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think it will be entertaining.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd",

Oil was on the slide, falling back below $30 a barrel on continuing fears of a supply glut at a time when demand is weakening.</p> <p>So European markets began with falls of nearly 2%. But a revival in the crude price came amid talk that Opec could be prepared to cut production if rival producers followed suit. That, along with some decent financial results from the likes of Procter &amp; Gamble, set Wall Street off to a positive start and gave a lift to markets elsewhere. Ahead of Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest figures later and the US Federal Reserve interest rate decision on Wednesday, the final scores in Europe showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 finished up 34.46 points or 0.59% at 5911.46, having fallen as low as 5771.

The transfer of income from producers to consumers, who are more likely to spend on other goods and services, should boost global demand. At worst, the impact might be expected to be neutral, with the winners offsetting the losers. In practice, though, the net impact of the recent slump in oil prices appears to have been negative, or at least perceived as such in financial markets.</p> <p>There are a number of factors at play here. First, the speed and extent of the slump has itself added to the uncertainty about the global economy. Rightly or (more probably) wrongly, the fall has been interpreted as evidence of a collapse in demand and fuelled fears about a hard landing in China in particular.</p> <p>Second, the costs to producers have been proportionately much larger (relative to their incomes) than the benefits to consumers. This concentration of losses relative to the more diffuse benefits is one reason why producers appear to have cut their spending more quickly and by a larger amount than consumers have increased theirs.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4dd0af88d165ae6bdaaa473eace73706eedbc96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4dd0af88d165ae6bdaaa473eace73706eedbc96/0_0_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oil fields in Kazakhstan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oil fields in Kazakhstan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shamil Zhumatov/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>This asymmetry has compounded the negative impacts on financial markets. Energy companies may now only account, for example, for a small share of the US junk bond market, but the fear is that there will be widespread defaults throughout this sector, rippling through the financial system as a whole. Similarly, the impact on the 20% or so of the UK FTSE 100 accounted for by commodity producers is far more visible than the potential benefits to the remaining 80% who are not.</p> <p>Pressure on oil producers to sell assets accumulated in Sovereign Wealth Funds has also soured the mood, even though this selling might actually boost the global economy if the proceeds are used to support local spending.</p> <p>The additional downward pressure on headline inflation from lower energy costs has revived fears that vulnerable economies may slip into a more damaging period of deflation.</p> <p>However, this analysis does also allow us to draw some more positive conclusions. Stabilisation in oil prices \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even at a low level \u00e2\u20ac\u201c should at least ease some of the associated uncertainty about the health of the global economy. The downward pressure on headline inflation should unwind too. Many of the negatives are also about timing. Producers have generally been quicker to adjust their spending, but eventually this should be outweighed by increases in spending by consumers on other goods and services.</p> <p>On balance, then we continue to expect an extended period of lower oil prices to boost global growth over the next few years, even if this process may take longer than we had anticipated.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56a79880e4b085519d006727\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-26T16:06:36.100Z\">4.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The recovery in the oil price has given a boost to stock markets and follows hopes that Opec would be willing to cut production if non-member countries - notably Russia - also agree to reduce supply.</strong></p> <p>Iraqui oil minister Adel Abdel Mahdi said he saw some flexibility for a deal with rival producers, and as a consequence, Brent crude is now up 2.9% at $31.38. But given the recent volatility, the gains may not last long. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at online trading group IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As oil goes, so goes the rest of the market. Yesterday a rapid decline in crude paved the way for stock markets to give up their gains, but today the price of black gold is on the up again, with the reliable market rumour of production cuts providing the foundation for both Brent and WTI to move back above $31 a barrel.</p> <p>At this point, a decision between Opec and non-Opec members to cut production is not the important element; the key point is such talk allows the price to move upwards to a position where bears can hit the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 button once again.</p> <p>Rallies in oil in recent months have only lasted a few days, and once talk of a deal dries up, the way will be clear for the downtrend to resume.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56a792ece4b085519d0066c0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/helenasmith\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-26T16:00:39.607Z\">4.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>More protests in Greece.</strong> Helena Smith reports:</p> <blockquote> <p>Unionists representing Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 35,000-strong nurses\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 federation have been protesting outside the finance ministry in the latest display of fury over the leftist-led government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s draft proposals overhauling the pension system.

                "bodyText":"Volatile days are becoming the norm but even by those standards, the swings during the course of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading were pretty notable. A 6% slump in Chinese markets - partly driven by poor rail freight figures casting new doubt on the strength of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy - got things off to a bad start. Oil was on the slide, falling back below $30 a barrel on continuing fears of a supply glut at a time when demand is weakening. So European markets began with falls of nearly 2%. But a revival in the crude price came amid talk that Opec could be prepared to cut production if rival producers followed suit. That, along with some decent financial results from the likes of Procter &amp; Gamble, set Wall Street off to a positive start and gave a lift to markets elsewhere. Ahead of Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest figures later and the US Federal Reserve interest rate decision on Wednesday, the final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 34.46 points or 0.59% at 5911.46, having fallen as low as 5771. Commodity companies led the rebound. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax added 0.89% to 9822.75 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 1.05% higher at 4356.81 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB rose 1.51% to 18,923.83 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 1.46% better at 8692.5 In Greece, the Athens market added 2.15% to 546.22 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 285 points or 1.78% higher. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close up. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back again tomorrow. The slump in the oil price should theoretically be good for the global economy but stock markets at least do not seem to be taking that on board. Julian Jessop at Capital Economics says: In principle, a lower oil price should be positive for the world economy. The transfer of income from producers to consumers, who are more likely to spend on other goods and services, should boost global demand. At worst, the impact might be expected to be neutral, with the winners offsetting the losers. In practice, though, the net impact of the recent slump in oil prices appears to have been negative, or at least perceived as such in financial markets. There are a number of factors at play here. First, the speed and extent of the slump has itself added to the uncertainty about the global economy. Rightly or (more probably) wrongly, the fall has been interpreted as evidence of a collapse in demand and fuelled fears about a hard landing in China in particular. Second, the costs to producers have been proportionately much larger (relative to their incomes) than the benefits to consumers. This concentration of losses relative to the more diffuse benefits is one reason why producers appear to have cut their spending more quickly and by a larger amount than consumers have increased theirs. This asymmetry has compounded the negative impacts on financial markets. Energy companies may now only account, for example, for a small share of the US junk bond market, but the fear is that there will be widespread defaults throughout this sector, rippling through the financial system as a whole. Similarly, the impact on the 20% or so of the UK FTSE 100 accounted for by commodity producers is far more visible than the potential benefits to the remaining 80% who are not. Pressure on oil producers to sell assets accumulated in Sovereign Wealth Funds has also soured the mood, even though this selling might actually boost the global economy if the proceeds are used to support local spending. The additional downward pressure on headline inflation from lower energy costs has revived fears that vulnerable economies may slip into a more damaging period of deflation. However, this analysis does also allow us to draw some more positive conclusions. Stabilisation in oil prices \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even at a low level \u00e2\u20ac\u201c should at least ease some of the associated uncertainty about the health of the global economy. The downward pressure on headline inflation should unwind too. Many of the negatives are also about timing. Producers have generally been quicker to adjust their spending, but eventually this should be outweighed by increases in spending by consumers on other goods and services. On balance, then we continue to expect an extended period of lower oil prices to boost global growth over the next few years, even if this process may take longer than we had anticipated. The recovery in the oil price has given a boost to stock markets and follows hopes that Opec would be willing to cut production if non-member countries - notably Russia - also agree to reduce supply. Iraqui oil minister Adel Abdel Mahdi said he saw some flexibility for a deal with rival producers, and as a consequence, Brent crude is now up 2.9% at $31.38. But given the recent volatility, the gains may not last long. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at online trading group IG, said: As oil goes, so goes the rest of the market. Yesterday a rapid decline in crude paved the way for stock markets to give up their gains, but today the price of black gold is on the up again, with the reliable market rumour of production cuts providing the foundation for both Brent and WTI to move back above $31 a barrel. At this point, a decision between Opec and non-Opec members to cut production is not the important element; the key point is such talk allows the price to move upwards to a position where bears can hit the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 button once again. Rallies in oil in recent months have only lasted a few days, and once talk of a deal dries up, the way will be clear for the downtrend to resume. More protests in Greece. Helena Smith reports: Unionists representing Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 35,000-strong nurses\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 federation have been protesting outside the finance ministry in the latest display of fury over the leftist-led government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s draft proposals overhauling the pension system. Nurses, who have been hard hit by austerity, starting with relentless rounds of wage cuts, have become increasingly vociferous in recent months. Many turned up in surgery outfits. The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s union of civil servants (ADEDY) will stage a much bigger protest rally and march this evening to coincide with an extraordinary debate in parliament over the proposed measures. It will be the first time that prime minister Alexis Tsipras clashes in the 300-seat House with Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the newly-elected leader of New Democracy, the centre right main opposition party. The Harvard-educated erswhile banker, among the biggest champions of reform in Greece, has recently been leading polls. Odysseus Trivalas, who heads ADEDY, told me: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Without any prospect of growth or reduction in unemployment the proposed pension reforms are unsustainable. The government keeps saying without these measures the system will collapse but we argue that with contributions so low and unemployment so high it will collapse anyway if the government does not provide extra funding through the budget.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The funds should have been strengthened with all that money that was initially earmarked for the recapitalisation of banks. They didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t listen to us and now they will pay the price because these protests are not going to end soon.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Forecasts that Greek banks would need as much as \u00e2\u201a\u00ac25bn to withstand possible shocks proved to be vastly over-inflated when it was estimated in November that recapitalisation needs would not exceed more than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5.7bn. Farmers, who have also taken to the streets, are expected to expand tractor roadblocks nationwide during a rowdy meeting of union heads currently taking place in Thessaloniki. They have signalled they would be likely to vote to cut off road links and customs terminals with Bulgaria and Turkey to the north and east - causing yet more financial havoc for Greece. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is going to be very difficult for them to roll back without concrete promises by the government,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Travalas added. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are all one group now, determined to stop this legislation going through.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More US data, and this time it is more positive for the Federal Reserve. January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer confidence index came in at 98.1, better than the 96.5 expected and the 96.3 level in December. Dennis de Jong at UFX.com said: Despite global economic volatility, that US consumer confidence levels are higher than expected will be music to the ears of Fed Chair Janet Yellen. The US job market has surely contributed to the feel good vibe, with unemployment at a seven year low, in addition to sinking prices at the pumps providing consumer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wallets with a much needed fillip. There are still dangers on the road ahead for Yellen and Co as global growth expectations have been downgraded and a strong dollar is starting to hurt US exports. However, considering the outlook for other major economies, Yellen has every right to be pleased with the start to the calendar year. The World Bank has cut its forecast for crude oil prices for 2016 by $14 a barrel to $37, and also reduced its predictions for 37 out of 46 commodities. Phillip Inman reports: The World Bank has slashed its forecast for oil prices this year, saying the cost of a barrel of crude will stay near its current lows for the rest of 2016. The Washington-based institution said a glut of oil that sent prices crashing by almost half last year and another 27% this month will continue to dominate the market for the next year. It added that warm winter weather in Europe and weaker than expected growth in China and other emerging economies will depress demand and keep the average price at $37 a barrel, down from a projection of $51 last October. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Low prices for oil and commodities are likely to be with us for some time,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said John Baffes, senior economist and lead author of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commodities markets outlook. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While we see some prospect for commodity prices to rise slightly over the next two years, significant downside risks remain.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brent crude is currently up 1.1% at $30.85 a barrel. Here is our full story: More weak data for the US Federal Reserve to consider as it gathers for its first meeting since raising interest rates in December, a move many believe may have been a mistake. The US services sector has seen its slowest growth since December 2014. The Markit initial reading for the purchasing managers business activity index came in at 53.7 in January. This is down from 54.3 the previous month and just below the expected 53.9. Markit said: U.S. service providers started the year with another slowdown in business activity growth...Although still indicative of a solid increase in business activity, the headline index has now signalled weaker overall growth in four of the past five months. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit said a drop in business confidence suggested things could get worse: The survey data paint an inauspicious start to the year for the US economy. A struggling manufacturing economy is being accompanied by a services sector where growth showed further signs of losing momentum in January even before the bad weather hit. The data are by no means disastrous, signalling a 1.5% annualised rate of economic growth at the start of the year, but the drop in business confidence to one of its lowest levels for over five years suggests that firms are bracing themselves for worse to come. Worries about financial market volatility, the impact of slower growth overseas, a downturn in the energy sector and uncertainty about higher interest rates all took their toll and set the scene for further weakness in coming months. On what has been a volatile day for markets so far, Wall Street has started off on the front foot ahead of results from Apple and as the Federal Reserve begins its latest two day meeting. With oil recovering from its early falls - Brent crude is now up 1.6% at $30.99 a barrel having fallen as low as $29.27 - the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 133 points or 0.8% in early trading. In Europe the FTSE 100 is 0.15% higher while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac and Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex have edged into positive territory despite the earlier 6% slump on the Chinese market. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy continues to grow pretty steadily, according to the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist Andy Haldane, and a Chinese slowdown is unlikely to push the world economy into negative growth. Haldane said in an interview with Wolverhampton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Express and Star newspaper: We would have to fall a long way, or something very untoward would have to happen for that to fall into negative territory,. I think that is a reasonably unlikely event. Now are there things that could happen that could slow that rate of growth? Yes there are. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true to say there are some concerns about how rapidly the Chinese economy is growing. These days China is of such a size and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sufficiently well integrated into the world economy that when it sneezes there is a sense at which the world economy is at risk of catching a cold. Does that mean there is a chance that world growth could slow from current levels? Yes, there is a chance of that. Do I think there is a big risk of us being tipped into negative growth in the world economy? That strikes me as quite unlikely as things sit today. Meanwhile, as Carney was speaking, the World Economic Forum has announced the Bank of England governor as one of eight \u00e2\u20ac\u0153senior decision makers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd joining a taskforce to discuss the future of the global financial system. The group was formed at the request of Carney and WEF founder professor Klaus Schwab and it will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153work to identify, analyse and propose recommendations in response to major transformative forces influencing the future of global finance and economics.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A recent WEF document identified five areas which the taskforce could discuss in its first meeting: emerging markets, technologyi, regulatory and monetary policies, loss of trust in financial services and financial inclusion. Apart from Carney the other members of the taskforce are Citgroup chief executive Michael Corbat; Blackrock chairman Laurence Fink; HSBC chairman Douglas Flint; Bank of America chairman Brian Moynihan; Raghuram Rajan, governor of the Reserve Bank of India; Min Zhu, deputy managing director of the IMF; and Liu Mingkang, economics and finance fellow at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Why is governor Mark Carney worrying about the current account deficit anyway? The current account is significant, as it shows the balance between the goods, services and financial transactions into, and out of, the UK. Britain has been running a persistent deficit for some time -- dubbed the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinvisible deficit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, as the financial markets have been relaxed about it. But historically, countries with large current account deficits have often been hit with currency crises, as investors eventually lose faith and stop buying your assets. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what Mark Carney means when he mentions the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153kindness of strangers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. A currency depreciation can actually help fix a current account deficit, as it makes imports unpleasantly expensive while helping exporters compete. But as our economics editor Larry Elliot has argued, Britain doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the manufacturing base to really profit from a Sterling crisis. So if international investors decide not to buy UK assets, or hold the pound, if Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU membership is in doubt, there could be a problem..... A quick recap of the main points from the Governor of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appearance at parliament: 1) Mark Carney warned that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current account deficit is still a risk to financial stability, due to the current market instability and the looming referendum on EU membership. He warned that: First, the general global environment has been much more febrile, much more volatile. Relying on the kindness of strangers is not optimal in that type of environment, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what is the case when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re running a 4%, 4.5% current account deficit. And secondly, the possibility of a risk premium being attached to UK assets because of certain developments exists. And that plays into the riskiness of the situation. Carney also agreed that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153material decisions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd can have an impact on financial stability, when questioned about Brexit. 2) Carney gave a clear hint that he might stay at the Bank of England for longer than planned. The governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s five-year term expires in July 2018, and he will decide this year whether to plump for a full eight-year term. I guess this is a new form of forward guidance.... If he does, Carney would return to the jobs market just as the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top job comes up. #MediaSpeculation 3) Carney said the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate hike last month has added to the turbulence in the market. He said that domestic inflation pressure justified the hike, but cautioned that policymakers need to be aware that safe-haven currencies, and riskier ones, could both be buffeted as commodity prices tumble. 4) Carney said there is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no concern\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at present, about direct or indirect stresses on UK banks. He argues that new capital rules, designed to bail in investors, should protect the system. 5) Carney also pointed out that OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to influence the oil prices isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t what it was (as the plunge in the Brent crude oil price shows us) 6) Carney has also talked himself into a trip to the cinema. Hopefully The Big Short won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give him any flashbacks Stock markets have recovered some of their early losses. The FTSE 100 is now down just 28 points, or 0.5%, having been down almost 100 points earlier. On a lighter note, Wes Streeting then asks Mark Carney if he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seen The Big Short, the new film of Michael Lewis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s excellent book about the US sub-prime crash that almost brought down Wall Street. I feel like I lived it, Carney replies [he was running the Bank of Canada at the time] I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen it, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure I will. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m happy to go. The question was prompted by Paul Waugh of the Huffington Post: A bottle of wine for any reader who spots the Carneys at their local Odeon. Q: Has the MPC or FPC gathered any information on how negative interest rates might affect the UK economy? We have thought more carefully about where the zero lower bound is, Carney replies. [ie, could they cut rates below the current record low of 0.5%?] But the actual question of negative interest rates, and the impact on the financial system, has not arisen, as we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that is the prospect. Labour MP Wes Streeting asks Carney whether the Treasury has ever leant on him over banking regulations. No, and it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make a difference if it tried, Carney replies. Q: And is the bank worried about recent elections in Spain and Portugal, given the relative instability of the governments which arose? Carney says the latest financial stability report concluded that the biggest risk had moved from advanced economies to emerging economies. He still thinks that is still the case. Rachel Reeves MP asks Carney about Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current account deficit, and the implications on UK trade if it leaves the EU. Q: Is the UK current account a growing risk, a declining risk, or a stable risk? And do you think Brexit would make it more or less of a risk? Carney says the current account deficit has gone down somewhat, and the improvement in the European economy should mean our net foreign income improves (as Britain exports more across the Channel). But he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say that the riskiness has not gone down, for two reasons: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153First, the general global environment has been much more febrile, much more volatile. Relying on the kindness of strangers is not optimal in that type of environment, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what is the case when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re running a 4%, 4.5% current account deficit. And secondly, the possibility of a risk premium being attached to UK assets because of certain developments exists. And that plays into the riskiness of the situation. Carney didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t define \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccertain developments\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty clear what he meant. Credit Suisse, the Swiss bank, warned yesterday that investors would probably demand a considerably higher risk premium to hold UK assets if the public voted to leave the EU. John Mann MP demands to know whether Carney had any role in the decision to abandon Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s review of banking culture. This decision was taken entirely by the FCA, Carney replies. We have nothing to apologise for regarding our handling of UK bank culture, Carney continues, adding that the BoE isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet satisfied with bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s responses to questions about their conduct. Mark Carney is asked whether Britain would face financial instability if it votes to leave the EU. The governor says the Bank will reveal its precautionary measures \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcafter the fact\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Speaking carefully (to avoid saying anything too controversial) he adds that material decisions can have an impact on financial stability, but doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give a particular view on Brexit. Carney also denies that central bankers hope the oil price goes up, to push inflation higher. Q: Can OPEC survive the slump in the oil price? Mark Carney says that OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to influence the global supply has been diminished, given technical developments and increased supply sources (eg US shale gas). But the competitive position of the major opec suppliers, especially Saudi Arabia, is unrivalled as they can produce oil cheaper than many others. So one scenario is that OPEC has some influence, but at a lower price point. Back in the committee room, Mark Carney has been fielding questions about market turbulence, and the oil price. We are in an environment of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153heightened risk aversion\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which could continue for some time, says the BoE governor. And that will effect currencies that are seen as safe (the US dollar, the Swiss franc), and those that are riskier (emerging market currencies). Authorities need to bear this in mind. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a piece of idle speculation..... If Mark Carney does change his mind and serve a full eight years at the Bank of England, he would leave the BoE at the end of June 2021. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also the summer when the managing directorship of the International Monetary Fund becomes vacant. Christine Lagarde appears to be nailed-on to do a second five-year term, starting in July 2016. When he arrived in London, the talk was that Carney fancied a move into Canadian politics. The prime minister-ship is now in Justin Trudeau\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s youthful hands, and could stay there for some time. Having run two central banks (UK and Canada), and also chaired the Financial Stability Board, Carney would be well-qualified to run the International Monetary Fund. It would also break the European hold on the top job at the IMF, without giving it to an American. Looking away from the select committee.... Tesco has been ordered to improve the way it deals with suppliers. An official inquiry into the 2014 scandal around Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial results found that the supermarket has delayed payments to suppliers, to support its profits. Christine Tacon, the Grocery Code Adjudicator, was damning about Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s behaviour, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I was troubled to see Tesco at times prioritising its own finances over treating suppliers fairly.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction: Now the Treasury Committee has moved onto the new rules to handle failed banks, which will see bond-holders \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbailed in\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to cover the costs of a rescue. Q: When will the system be ready, and will it work? Carney says several things need to happen. 1) Banks need to refinance debt, so that their \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbail-in-able debt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is in the right place within the organisation, to cover the cost of failure. 2) The holders of the debt need to know that they can be bailed in - he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want retail bond investors to be surprised that they are now shareholders. 3) That knowledge will creates an incentive on bond-holders to ensure that banks hold enough equity to handle problems. The aim is to be ready by 2019, says Carney, so that the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcring-fenced\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, systemically important banks are protected and can keep running after a collapse, if needed. This process will cost billions, and it will push up funding costs. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the price of avoiding another huge taxpayer-funded bailout. Q: But could the markets freeze up, leaving banks unable to protect themselves? Carney says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s met with many bank chiefs recently (including, I suspect, at Davos), and confirmed they are on track with building up the capital buffers they need. He argues that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very little chance of one bank failure causing a systemic failure. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more likely to be triggered by a general shock to the economy. Right now, he insists, there are no concerns about direct or indirect stresses on major banks. Q: Carney is then asked who, if anyone, he consulted before giving a speech last week saying that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not time to raise interest rates? I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t clear a speech with anyone before giving my personal view, Carney replies. Q: But did you discuss it with anyone on the MPC (monetary policy committee)? All draft speeches by MPC members are circulated in advance, as a courtesy, says Carney. And he denies that he said rates would definitely stay on hold for some time (as some papers reported) Q: So was the speech also shared with members of the FPC? (financial policy committee)? It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t - MPC speeches aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t typically shared with the FPC beforehand. Q: Was the Federal Reserve right to raise interest rates in December? Carney gives a long answer, arguing there is solid growth at the core of advanced economies. And domestic inflation pressures merited the change in monetary policy, he argues. Q: But did the rate hike cause the turmoil in the financial markets in recent weeks? The governor says that it was not the fundamental cause, but it did contribute to it. Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury Committee, then asks Mark Carney if he is reconsidering his decision to only serve five years at the Bank of England. Could he now decide to serve the full eight years? Carney smiles, then replies that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s certainly not planning to leave and follow Andrew Bailey to the FCA. We are making progress at the Bank of England, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more work to do, the governor says. And if I were to request a longer term, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d probably have to do so by the end of this. Carney is half-way through his five-year term. Tyrie says it would be valuable to know as soon as possible whether Carney might change his mind, and seek a longer stint at the Bank of England. The session begins with Mark Carney paying tribute to Andrew Bailey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s career at the Bank of England. It will probably take three to six months to appoint a new deputy governor to replace Bailey. There is no designated successor, Carney adds. So get your application ready, readers Heads-up: Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, is about to start taking questions from the Treasury Committee. The session is being streamed live here. Looking back at the markets quickly... the FTSE 100 is still deep in the red, down 64 points or 1% at 5812. Oil is recovering some of its early losses, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still down around 2% at $29.91 per barrel. George Osborne has really surprised the City by announcing Andrew Bailey as the new head of the FCA. Bank of England governor Mark Carney says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fine choice (although would he really say anything else?....) Andrew is an extraordinary public servant who has devoted his entire professional life to serving the people of the United Kingdom. During his career, he has worked across all of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy areas, combining leadership and innovation to deliver consistently the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy objectives. His work in helping to manage the crisis and then to develop the post-crisis regulatory framework has been exemplary. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some instant reaction: Newsflash: Britain has a new City regulator. Andrew Bailey, the deputy governor of the Bank of England, has just been named as the new chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority. He replaces Martin Wheatley, who was ousted by chancellor George Osborne last July. Bailey has been in charge of prudential regulation at the Bank of England - trying to sure that banks stick to the rules, and avoid the damaging risks that caused the 2008 financial crisis. Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to sent Wheatley packing last year has been seen as a sign that the British government was taking a friendlier approach to the City. Here are a couple of photos from China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brokerage houses, as investors watched the market tumble by 6%. Analysts are divided over the severity of the Chinese slowdown. Yogi Dewan, founder of Hassium Asset Management (a wealth management firm) told Bloomberg TV that China is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153slowing, not melting down\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He argues that Beijing are taking some \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very positive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd steps, including devaluing the yuan and building close financial links with Europe. But Joseph Oughourlian of Amber Capital Investment Management is less optimistic. He is steering clear of companies who benefitted from China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investment boom over the last 15 years. FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga says investors are worried that capital will continue to ooze out of China, as people try to escape its slowing economy: A re-established wave of risk aversion gripped Asian equities sending most into red territory, while elevated fears that China capital outflows may accelerate as the economy decelerates has sent the Shanghai Composite Index diving -6.3% lower, to levels not seen in 13 months. With days like today continuing to come back to haunt the Shanghai Composite Index, the Chinese New Year period and the trading break couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come soon enough. Shares in easyJet have dropped by 2%, after the company reported that recent terror attacks have weakened demand. The budget airline said revenue suffered after November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Paris terror attack, and the bombing of a plane flying form Egypt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sharm el-Sheikh. The recent market turmoil has also been a mixed blessing for the airline. The fall in the oil price will save it \u00c2\u00a3180m on fuel costs, however currency moves will wipe out \u00c2\u00a350m. In other words, easyJet needs fewer dollars to pay for fuel, but it needs to stump up more pounds to buy the dollars first.... Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff comes nearly a week after global markets slumped into bear market territory, triggering alarm around the world: Simon Smith, chief economist at currency trading firm FXPro, fears that more market turbulence is coming. He writes: Chinese indices are 6% lower overnight, Japanese over 2% in the red and oil is back below 30 bucks a barrel. Volatility has been rising throughout the year so far but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still someway off the big spike in the Vix (volatility index or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfear gauge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122) last August and so there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s potential for moves in markets to get even more dramatic. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff has been triggered by the slide in the oil price, as well as the Chinese market mayhem. Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct explains: Crude is sliding on renewed oversupply fears and even the building narrative we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing from Opec that they are ready to strike a deal with other producer nations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c possibly centred around Russia \u00e2\u20ac\u201c doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really appear to be lending any support to the equation, at least not yet. The gold price has jumped by 1%, as money pours out of shares and into safe-haven assets. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s usually a sign that investors are worried. Other European markets are also falling, with France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC down 1.6% and the German DAX shedding 1.3%: The FTSE 100 index of major UK companies has fallen by 87 points at the start of trading, or 1.4%, to 5789 Almost every share is falling, as traders face another day of volatile trading dominated by fears over the global economy. BP and Royal Dutch Shell are both down around 3%, mirroring today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sliding oil price. Mining companies are also suffering, reflecting worries about China. Commodity trader Glencore has shed 3.5%, and Anglo American (which produces iron ore, copper, nickel etc) is down 3.2% Almost every share on the Chinese stock market was hit by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout, with only four gaining ground. A late wave of selling has gripped the Shanghai stock market, sending shares slumping and triggering new angst in financial markets worldwide. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s benchmark index, the CSI 300, shed 188 points or 6.02% to finish the day at 2940. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its lowest level since December 2014. Scores of shares were suspended after falling 10%, the maximum allowed under Chinese stock market regulations. The Shanghai market tumbled by 6.4%, the biggest daily loss since the first week of 2015. The selloff, which helped to drive oil down, came after new economic data showed that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rail freight volume dropped by 11.9% last year, compared to 2014. That fuelled fears that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is slowing faster than official figures show. The crude oil price has lurched back through $30 per barrel. Brent crude has slumped by 3% this morning, and is changing hands at $29.61 per barrel. The selloff is partly being driven by oversupply fears, with OPEC members sticking to their guns and keeping pumping in an apparent attempt to drive other suppliers out of business. Kit Juckes of French bank Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale says the weak oil price will add to the gloomy mood in the markets: The fall in oil prices will make most of the headlines and drive most of the movement in markets today, unless it is reversed for no particularly good reason. The latest driver is the news that Iraqi oil output is strong. US production remains the key swing on supply and is what will eventually trigger a turn. But it will take hard news about declining US output to shift the market mood. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It looks like being another \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcchallenging\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 day in the markets. Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two-day rally has hit the wall, with most markets falling. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei just closed down 2.4%, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expecting European stock markets to fall at the open (8an GMT). The surge of optimism which pushed shares higher at the end of last week has dissolved, in the face of worries about deflation and economic slowdown. In the corporate sector, budget airline easyJet and high street tech chain Dixons Carphone are releasing results. Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, is testifying to MPs this morning about the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stability report, from 10am GMT. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have an eye on Greece, where unions are expected to hold a protest rally in Athens today against pension cuts. That comes as We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",
