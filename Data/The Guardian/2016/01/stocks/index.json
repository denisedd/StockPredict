                "bodyText":"A further slowdown in China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vast manufacturing sector has intensified worries about the year ahead for the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second largest economy. The latest in a string of downbeat reports from showed that activity at China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factor ies cooled in December for the fifth month running, as overseas demand for Chinese goods continued to fall. Against the backdrop of a faltering global economy, turmoil in the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets and overcapacity in factories, Chinese economic growth has slowed markedly. The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank expects growth in 2015 to be the slowest for a quarter of a century. After growing 7.3% in 2014, the economy is thought to have expanded by 6.9% in 2015 and the central bank has forecast that it may slow further in 2016 to 6.8%. A series of interventions by policymakers, including interest rate cuts, have done little to revive growth and in some cases served only to heighten concern about China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s challenges. Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures showed that the manufacturing sector limped to the end of 2015. The official purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index (PMI) of manufacturing activity edged up to 49.7 in December from 49.6 in November. The December reading matched the forecast in a Reuters poll of economists and marked the fifth consecutive month that the index was below 50, the point that separates expansion from contraction. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Although the PMI slightly rebounded this month, it still lies below the critical point and is lower than historic levels over the same period,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Zhao Qinghe, a senior statistician at the national bureau of statistics, said in a online statement. Analysts said the latest manufacturing PMI pointed to falling activity, but that some hope could be taken from the improvement on November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s three-year low. The small rise \u00e2\u20ac\u0153suggests that growth momentum is stabilising somewhat \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 however, the sector is still facing strong headwinds,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Zhou Hao, the China economist at Commerzbank in Singapore. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In order to facilitate the destocking and deleveraging process, monetary policy will remain accommodative and the fiscal policy will be more proactive.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The report showed that total new orders at Chinese manufacturers, a measure that combines domestic and export orders, edged up in December from 49.8 to 50.2. Export orders, however, fell for the 15th month running. A separate survey of the smaller services sector showed that activity gained pace in December. The official non-manufacturing PMI rose to 54.4 from November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 53.6, according to the statistics bureau. There was also upbeat news from the housing market, with signs that prices were boosted in December by six interest rate cuts in the year up to November, and by government moves to ease restrictions on homebuying. Prices for new homes rose 4.15% on an annual basis in China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 100 biggest cities last month, according to the China Index Academy. Despite the more positive news from the services sector and housing market, economists have focused on the manufacturing sector. They worry that a weak series of PMI survey readings, from the national statistics offices and polls carried out by the private sector, point to GDP growth that is slower than official estimates suggest. Economists expect more stimulus measures in 2016 as Beijing seeks to boost demand in the economy and shore up confidence among Chinese and foreign investors.

Its economy is slowing as it transitions from investment and manufacturing to consumption and services. But the global spillovers from China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reduced rate of growth, through its diminished imports and lower demand for commodities, have been much larger than we would have anticipated. Serious challenges to restructuring remain in terms of state-owned enterprise balance sheet weaknesses, the financial markets, and the general flexibility and rationality of resource allocation. Growth below the authorities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 official targets could again spook global financial markets\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut then again, time-honored methods of enforcing growth targets could simply extend economic imbalances, spelling possible trouble down the road. </p> </blockquote> <p>On how 2015 turned out:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There was good news and bad news. The U.S. economy continued its solid growth and job creation, while Europe generally picked up speed and Japan remained a question mark. But with some exceptions (such as India), emerging and developing countries continued to slow in the face of falling commodity prices and tighter financial conditions, and synchronized and sustainable global growth remained elusive.</p> </blockquote> <p>The comments follow a prediction from IMF head Christine Lagarde last week that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/30/imf-chief-christine-lagarde-disappointing-global-growth-economy-2016\">global growth will be disappointing this year</a> as the prospect of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/16/federal-reserve-us-interest-rate-rise-fed-funds-janet-yellen\">rising interest rates in the US</a> and a further <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/19/slowing-growth-china-commodities-global-economy\">slowdown in China</a> feed into uncertainty around the world.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-568a8d2ce4b03b24c8fe0ee2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-04T15:28:57.672Z\">3.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Separate date from the <strong>US construction sector</strong> also strikes a downbeat tone.</p> <p>The Commerce Department said construction spending fell for the first time in nearly 1-1/2 years in November.

This marks a disappointing end for what was a difficult year for the manufacturing sector given external growth concerns and sterling strength. Looking at the details, Markit said that input prices continued to fall sharply in December, which they attribute to lower commodity prices (principally oil). Furthermore, export orders continued to grow, albeit at a slower pace.</p> <p>All in all, this suggests that the manufacturing sector contributed very little to fourth quarter GDP growth (released at the end of this month), although it is worth noting that manufacturing only forms around 10% of the UK economy (versus 30% in the late 1970s). The service sector, which makes up over three quarters, is performing better and we should get a further indication of this on Wednesday when the services PMI is released.</p> <p>Overall, the economy remains strong and the case for a rate hike in 2016 looks very compelling. Although we continue to forecast a hike in the second quarter, the risks surrounding the EU referendum are beginning to build and the probability that the Bank of England will leave rates lower for a longer period of time is increasing.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-568a40cde4b03051a013845e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-04T09:54:53.793Z\">9.54am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Despite the disappointing UK manufacturing figures, Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said there could be a pickup in GDP growth in the fourth quarter:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Despite December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dip, the purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 survey does show overall improvement in the fourth quarter of 2015; and it does look possible that the manufacturing sector managed to eke out a modicum of growth in the fourth quarter after contracting in both the third (by 0.4% quarter-on-quarter) and second quarters (by 0.6%). In fact the manufacturing PMI averaged 53.3 in the fourth quarter, which was markedly above the third quarter average of 51.8 and clearly above the 50.0 level indicates flat activity. Meanwhile, although latest hard data show that manufacturing output dipped 0.4% month-on-month in October this followed increases in both September (0.9%) and August (0.3%) so it was actually up 0.4% on a three-month/three-month basis.</p> <p>If the manufacturing sector did manage to eke out some growth in the fourth quarter, it would boost the chances that the economy managed to achieve some pick-up in GDP growth after it dipped to 0.4% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter. We have pencilled in GDP growth of 0.6% quarter-on quarter in the fourth quarter of 2015. </p> <p>Even if the manufacturing sector did manage to eke out some growth in the fourth quarter, 2015 was undoubtedly a torrid year for manufacturers. </p> <p>Furthermore, the pretty lacklustre December PMI suggest that 2016 is also likely to be challenging for manufacturers.

In addition, a weak euro is boosting Eurozone manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 competitiveness in international markets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so they will be hoping that the euro does not rise any further after firming to be currently trade close to $1.09 from a seven-month low of $1.055 earlier in December. Meanwhile, the fundamentals look reasonably solid for consumer spending in the eurozone which should be supportive to demand for durable manufactured goods. Consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 purchasing power is getting a serious boost from very low inflation/deflation across all countries while labour markets have generally improved. Indeed, it is notable that the European Commission reported that consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 perception of whether it is a good time to make major purchases now and during the next 12 months in November were only just below September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s respective strongest levels since September 2001 and February 2008.</p> <p>Nevertheless, there are still appreciable challenges facing Eurozone manufacturers. Foreign orders are being hampered by mediocre global growth, most notably the slowdown in China and emerging markets.

                "bodyText":"So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a not-so-happy new year start on stock markets. Any investors hoping 2016 would bring some fresh market forces will have been spooked by a very familiar pattern today, as weak manufacturing data from China again provided much of the (downward) momentum. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a closing summary of the first trading day of 2016. The FTSE 100 lost 2.4%, its worst opening day to a new year since 2000 and the second-worst on record The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 lost 2.8% and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax lost 4.3%, its weakest start to a trading year in the history of the index On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average has sold off sharply (down 2.4% at the time of the London close) and could end up setting its own multi-decade record: if the losses stay this deep, it will be the worst start to a year since 1932 Brent crude has lost earlier gains made on the back of tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Having rallied more than 4%, it is now down 0.9% at $36.9 per barrel In China, shares were suspended after a drop of 7% activated \u00e2\u20ac\u0153circuit breakers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on their very first day. The Chinese sell-off came as a closely watched survey of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vast manufacturing sector showed it shrank for a tenth month running US manufacturing reports were weaker and construction spending data pointed to a muted finish to 2015 for the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest economy Manufacturing surveys from the eurozone were more upbeat The latest UK manufacturing PMI showed Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories grew at a slower pace in December while consumers continued to prop up the recovery with debt-fuelled spending as figures showed the fastest growth in net lending since 2006 The IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new chief economist, Maury Obstfeld, said he was putting China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s transitioning economy high on his watchlist for 2016 Sweden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank moved a step closer to intervening in currency markets to weaken the crown That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Thanks for reading and the comments, we will be back early tomorrow with more rolling coverage from global markets. Time for a round-up of European stock markets at the close and on many exchanges it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clearly been the worst start to the year for many years. The FTSE 100 has lost almost 2.4% on the first day of trading in 2016, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a drop of 149 points to 6093. The bluechip index is now at its lowest since 22 December and today marked the biggest one-day drop since a 2.5% fall on 28 September 2015. It is also the second worst opening day on record, says RBS. Here is how markets stand around Europe: France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC 40 down 3% FTSE Eurofirst 300 down 2.8% Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax down 4.5% FTSE 100 down 2.4% Those falls follows a plunge in Chinese shares - the worst ever start to a year for the Shanghai Composite index - which saw trading there halted. Over on Wall Street, things are not looking much better and the Dow Jones industrial average is down 2.4% while the S&amp;P 500 is down 2.3%. Just when you thought it might be safe to bet on a rising oil price, Brent crude has turned negative. It had rallied to a session high of $38.99 a barrel earlier on the back of predictions supply could be hit by tensions between Iran and Saudia Arabia. But the price fell back on worries about slower demand after news of a further factory slowdown in China and releases from the US showing its construction and manufacturing sectors had lost steam. Brent crude is currently down 0.9% or 31 cents at $36.97 a barrel. Meanwhile, former Bank of England policymaker David Blanchflower has been scouring the skies for omens.... Sweden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has come a step closer to intervening in currency markets to weaken the crown, which it worries is keeping inflation from rising back to more normal levels. Against the backdrop of negative interest rates, a quantitative easing programme and a Swedish inflation rate in negative territory at -0.1%, the Riksbank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governor Stefan Ingves said last week the central bank was ready to start currency interventions to stop the crown from strengthening. Today the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy-setting board said in a statement it has voted to give the governor the power to intervene immediately in the currency market. The decision at an extraordinary meeting of the six-member board means the central bank will be able to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153instantly intervene on the foreign exchange market if necessary, as a complementary monetary policy measure, to safeguard the rise in inflation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The statement adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Since the last monetary policy meeting in mid-December, the Swedish krona has appreciated against most other currencies. If this development were to continue, it could jeopardise the ongoing upturn in inflation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The crown weakened against the euro and the dollar after the announcement. With global downturn fears prompting such a rocky start to the new year for global markets, what perfect timing for the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new economist to share his predictions for 2016. Maury Obstfeld has put China and its slowing economy high on his watchlist for 2016. He also highlights \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the crisis of refugees fleeing Iraq and Syria\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, climate change and international trade\u00e2\u20ac\u201d \u00e2\u20ac\u0153which has had setbacks in recent years\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Obstfeld says, citing the effective end of the Doha trade round. Obstfeld, former chair of the economics department at University of California at Berkeley, joined the International Monetary Fund in September to succeed Olivier Blanchard. Shortly before the start of the new year, IMF Survey magazine interviewed Obstfeld and has just published the chief economist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s views online. Here are some extracts: On key issues to watch in 2016: China will remain high on the list. Its economy is slowing as it transitions from investment and manufacturing to consumption and services. But the global spillovers from China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reduced rate of growth, through its diminished imports and lower demand for commodities, have been much larger than we would have anticipated. Serious challenges to restructuring remain in terms of state-owned enterprise balance sheet weaknesses, the financial markets, and the general flexibility and rationality of resource allocation. Growth below the authorities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 official targets could again spook global financial markets\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut then again, time-honored methods of enforcing growth targets could simply extend economic imbalances, spelling possible trouble down the road. On how 2015 turned out: There was good news and bad news. The U.S. economy continued its solid growth and job creation, while Europe generally picked up speed and Japan remained a question mark. But with some exceptions (such as India), emerging and developing countries continued to slow in the face of falling commodity prices and tighter financial conditions, and synchronized and sustainable global growth remained elusive. The comments follow a prediction from IMF head Christine Lagarde last week that global growth will be disappointing this year as the prospect of rising interest rates in the US and a further slowdown in China feed into uncertainty around the world. Separate date from the US construction sector also strikes a downbeat tone. The Commerce Department said construction spending fell for the first time in nearly 1-1/2 years in November. Spending fell 0.4% after a downwardly revised 0.3% rise in October. As Reuters reports, the government revised construction data from January 2005 through October 2015 because of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153processing error in the tabulation of data\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The revisions, which showed construction spending was not as strong as previously reported for much of 2015, could prompt economists to lower their fourth-quarter gross domestic product estimates. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending rising 0.6% in November after a previously reported 1.0% increase in October. Unsurprisingly, this trio of disappointing releases is prompting questions over why the US Federal Reserve thought December was the right time to raise interest rates - the first increase for almost a decade. Meanwhile, US stock markets have sold off further, with the Dow Jones industrial average down more than 2.3% at one point in its biggest one-day fall for more than four months. The Dow Jones is now down 2%, the S&amp;P 500 is down 2.1% and the Nasdaq is down 2.7%. Hot on the heels of that weaker Markit PMI report on US manufacturers comes the separate Institute for Supply Management report and it makes even gloomier reading, suggesting the sector shrank again in December. The main activity index fell to 48.2 in December from 48.6 in November, confounding forecasts for a pick-up to 49.0 in a Reuters poll of economists. As with Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI reports, a reading above 50 signals expansion, a reading below suggest contraction. The new orders index in the ISM report edged up to 49.2 from 48.9 in November, but was still below the all-important 50-mark. More details on that weaker Markit U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Index: The authors note the latest reading (51.2 in December) was much weaker than the survey average (54.2) and pointed to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153only a marginal upturn in operating conditions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The report also shows output slowed in December and that input costs declined again. On new orders (which expanded at the weakest pace since September 2009), Markit said there was anecdotal evidence of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153softer underlying demand conditions, intense competition for new work and subdued business confidence among clients\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, while export sales were also close to stagnation in December, with manufacturers noting that the strong dollar continued to act as a drag on demand from abroad. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The manufacturing sector saw a disappointing end to 2015, and its plight looks set to continue into the New Year as headwinds show no sign of abating any time soon. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Order book growth has stalled as producers report some of the toughest trading conditions since the end of the global financial crisis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The strong dollar is hurting exporters as well as hitting domestic sales as firms compete against inflows of cheap imports. Low oil prices are meanwhile hitting demand for goods and machinery from the energy sector. There are signs that consumers are becoming more cautious in relation to spending as interest rates lift off their historic lows, and overseas demand remains in the doldrums. All of these factors look set to continue to hurt manufacturers, and even intensify, in coming months. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, with the Fed stressing that the trajectory of interest rates will be data dependent, any extended period of weakness at least suggests that the rate hiking process will be very gradual.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The US manufacturing sector grew at a slower pace in December, expanding at the weakest pace for more than three years, according to the latest PMI report from the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest economy. The survey by data company Markit also pointed to a slowdown in orders, with the weakest reading since during the financial crisis in September 2009. The headline index for manufacturing came in at 51.2 for December, down from an inital estimate of 51.3 and from 52.8 in November. That was above the 50-mark that separates expansion from contraction but the weakest reading since October 2012. The report follows a flurry of manufacturing surveys from around the world. The picture was particularly weak in China, where the factory sector shrank for a 10th month running. Reports from Europe were slightly brighter with eurozone manufacturing activity picking up in December while in the UK, manufacturing continued to grow but at a slower pace. Ahead of the latest US manufacturing data, American markets have joined in the global rout prompted by weak Chinese figures earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has slumped 350 points or 2% in early trading, while Nasdaq is 2.2% lower and the S&amp;P 500 is off 1.2%. With the FTSE 100 down 2.3%, here are the major movers. With commodity prices falling on renewed fears of a Chinese slowdown, it is no surprise that mining shares are among the biggest fallers. Standard Chartered is also down due to its exposure to emerging markets, and commodity company lending. An exception to the mining slide is Randgold Resources, lifted by a rise in the gold price as investors seek a haven for their cash: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax, now down 4.1%, has seen a broad based fall with the best performers being companies recording, not an increase, but the smallest declines: Danny Blanchflower, former member of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee: German inflation figures are one positive in a flurry of negative news, according to Carsten Brzeski at ING Bank: With these December data, the year 2015 marks the lowest average annual inflation rate in Germany since the start of the monetary union. Looking at the available components at the regional levels shows that the drop in headline inflation was not only driven by lower energy prices but also some tentative second-round effects on consumer goods and probably first discounts in the Christmas sale season. Looking ahead, it should take at least until the second half of the year before German headline inflation at least crosses the 1%-threshold again. With the continued slump in energy prices, further second-round effects on other goods and only little pricing power from retailers and producer, it is hard to see a strong acceleration of German inflation any time soon. Even the strong labour market and latest wage increases have done little to push up \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at least \u00e2\u20ac\u201c core inflation. All of this means that German consumers are currently enjoying the best of both worlds: a strong labour market with decent wage increases and low inflation. The perfect combination for an improvement of German consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 purchasing power and hence private consumption. Looking at other deja-vus at the start of the New Year, like new tensions in the Middle-East, tumbling Chinese stock markets and new problems with structural reforms in Greece, at least German inflation data provide one comforting and positive signal for 2016 today. German inflation figures have come in slightly weaker than expected in December: The harmonised figures have been brought in line with other European countries. Apart from the weak data, there is another reason for the slump in Chinese shares, according to Mark Dampier, head of investment research at Hargreaves Lansdown: Contrary to reports, the fall in the Chinese stock market has little to do with the December PMI data coming in at 49.7 against a consensus of 49.8. It has far more to do with worries that major shareholders will reduce their positions after the ban of share sales and short selling which came in at the end of trading on Friday. The slide in global markets is getting worse. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax, now down 4.3% is heading for its biggest daily fall since August last year following the global market rout in the wake of renewed worries about the Chinese economy. Germany of course is a major exporter and likely to be hard hit by any slowdown. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac is 2.8% lower while in London, the FTSE 100 has now dropped 162 points or 2.6%, on course for its worst daily performance since September. It looks like the global share sell-off which has followed the weak Chinese data will extend to US markets: Daniel Vernazza, lead UK economist at UniCredit Research, said: With economic growth slowing and consumer credit growth rising fast, the risk to our forecast for the first Bank of England hike to come in May this year is that they delay further and try to use macroprudential policy as the first line of defence against risks to financial stability. The weakness in UK manufacturing activity is explained by a number of headwinds facing UK manufacturers. First, sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s past appreciation is still weighing on the competitiveness of UK manufacturers. Second, external demand remains subdued, particularly in emerging markets. Earlier today, Caixin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s China manufacturing PMI surprisingly fell back to 48.2 in December from 48.6 in the prior month; and the new export orders sub-component fell sharply from 51.6 to 47.8, suggesting weak external demand. On the UK manufacturing data, economist Malcolm Barr at JP Morgan said: The December manufacturing PMI release was a modest disappointment, with the headline index nudging down to 51.9 (J.P. Morgan 52.5) from a revised 52.5 in November (previously reported as 52.7). Having stepped down in late 2014 the PMI has been in a range between 51.5 (the survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long run average) and 54 for nearly all of 2015. The data increasingly make the move up in activity in to 55.2 in October look like it was a blip. The pound has hit a nine month low against the dollar, as weakness in the economy cast doubt over an imminent UK rate rise and worries grew over the impact of any departure from the European Union. Sterling was down to $1.4684, its lowest since April, and is currently at $1.4795. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a nice graphic showing how China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CS! 300 suffered major falls last year. And the new year is already on the way to a similar performance. The grim start to the new year means some \u00c2\u00a334bn has been wiped off the value of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top one hundred companies with the FTSE 100 down 133 points. Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, said: Anyone hitting the trading floor expecting a calm and quiet start to 2016 was given a rude surprise as Asian chaos affected European markets. Worries over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to keep up its pace of economic growth have been hit with an early warning sign as the Caixin PMI data came in weaker than expected, and stretched the contraction in China to ten months. This swift return to the 2015 template of worrying about China looks to have been the trigger for the selloff in Chinese equities. It is the first time Chinese regulators have activated the suspension in trading as a circuit breaker safety measure. Starting the year off by suspending trading an hour and a half early on the back of a 7% fall has set an ugly precedent for the year ahead. Tensions in the Middle East have escalated again as the relationship between Saudi Arabia and Iran is being stretched to breaking point. Considering the prominence both nations take as far as global oil supply is concerned, the subsequent spike in oil prices is, if anything, a little on the mild side. An interest rate rise is still on the cards this year, even though the manufacturing sector has come in weaker than expected, according to ING Bank. However any increase in borrowing costs may now come later than forecasters currently believe, said ING\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s James Smith: The UK manufacturing PMI fell unexpectedly to 51.9 in December, from 52.7 previously (consensus 52.8), consistent with levels seen through most of 2015 before the surprise uplift in October. This marks a disappointing end for what was a difficult year for the manufacturing sector given external growth concerns and sterling strength. Looking at the details, Markit said that input prices continued to fall sharply in December, which they attribute to lower commodity prices (principally oil). Furthermore, export orders continued to grow, albeit at a slower pace. All in all, this suggests that the manufacturing sector contributed very little to fourth quarter GDP growth (released at the end of this month), although it is worth noting that manufacturing only forms around 10% of the UK economy (versus 30% in the late 1970s). The service sector, which makes up over three quarters, is performing better and we should get a further indication of this on Wednesday when the services PMI is released. Overall, the economy remains strong and the case for a rate hike in 2016 looks very compelling. Although we continue to forecast a hike in the second quarter, the risks surrounding the EU referendum are beginning to build and the probability that the Bank of England will leave rates lower for a longer period of time is increasing. Despite the disappointing UK manufacturing figures, Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said there could be a pickup in GDP growth in the fourth quarter: Despite December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dip, the purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 survey does show overall improvement in the fourth quarter of 2015; and it does look possible that the manufacturing sector managed to eke out a modicum of growth in the fourth quarter after contracting in both the third (by 0.4% quarter-on-quarter) and second quarters (by 0.6%). In fact the manufacturing PMI averaged 53.3 in the fourth quarter, which was markedly above the third quarter average of 51.8 and clearly above the 50.0 level indicates flat activity. Meanwhile, although latest hard data show that manufacturing output dipped 0.4% month-on-month in October this followed increases in both September (0.9%) and August (0.3%) so it was actually up 0.4% on a three-month/three-month basis. If the manufacturing sector did manage to eke out some growth in the fourth quarter, it would boost the chances that the economy managed to achieve some pick-up in GDP growth after it dipped to 0.4% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter. We have pencilled in GDP growth of 0.6% quarter-on quarter in the fourth quarter of 2015. Even if the manufacturing sector did manage to eke out some growth in the fourth quarter, 2015 was undoubtedly a torrid year for manufacturers. Furthermore, the pretty lacklustre December PMI suggest that 2016 is also likely to be challenging for manufacturers. Indeed, the breakdown of the December purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 survey shows new orders growth matching July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lowest level for 2015, with export orders only inching up. Furthermore, backlogs of work contracted markedly. Meanwhile, more signs of a buoyant UK housing market and confident consumers, with higher than expected lending figures. Reuters reports: British lending to consumers expanded at the fastest annual rate in almost a decade in November and banks approved more mortgages than forecast, showing a buoyant mood among households towards the end of 2015. The Bank of England said net lending to consumers in November was up 8.3 percent compared with a year earlier, the biggest such increase since February 2006 and a growth rate that may raise concern at the Bank about lending standards. Lenders also granted more home loans than expected, with 70,410 mortgages for house purchase approved, the highest number in three months. The figures add to signs that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing market is accelerating after a dip in mid-2014 when tighter rules on mortgage lending took effect, requiring banks and building societies to make more rigorous checks on whether borrowers can afford their loans. Here are the key charts for the disappointing UK manufacturing data: The manufacturing data is more bad news for chancellor George Osborne, and his chances of hitting his Autumn Statement targets. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit said: The UK manufacturing sector ended 2015 on a disappointing note, with its rate of growth slowing further from October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent high back down towards the stagnation mark. This suggests that industry will make, at best, only a marginal positive contribution to broader economic growth in the final quarter of the year. Although this would be an improvement on the second and third quarters, it does also suggest that manufacturing output over 2015 as a whole may be below the level achieved in 2014. With the latest revisions to official data also suggesting that GDP growth earlier in the year was softer than previously thought, the emphasis has really shifted to other sectors of the economy if the rate of expansion for the year as a whole is to come in close to the OBR forecast as outlined in the Autumn Statement. And after the positive eurozone figures, the UK purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index has come in below expectations, recording its slowest growth in three months. The index fell from 52.5 in November to 51.9 last month, below expectations of a figure of 52.7. New orders came in at their slowest pace for five years, according to the Markit survey. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story on the rising oil price: Economist Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight said: The improved Eurozone manufacturing survey for December supports hopes that Eurozone growth picked up to at least 0.4% quarter-on-quarter in the in the fourth quarter of 2014 after dipping to 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter from 0.4% in the second and a peak of 0.5% in the first quarter. Eurozone manufacturers are currently getting appreciable help from very low oil and commodity prices which is boosting their ability to price competitively to win business. In addition, a weak euro is boosting Eurozone manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 competitiveness in international markets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so they will be hoping that the euro does not rise any further after firming to be currently trade close to $1.09 from a seven-month low of $1.055 earlier in December. Meanwhile, the fundamentals look reasonably solid for consumer spending in the eurozone which should be supportive to demand for durable manufactured goods. Consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 purchasing power is getting a serious boost from very low inflation/deflation across all countries while labour markets have generally improved. Indeed, it is notable that the European Commission reported that consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 perception of whether it is a good time to make major purchases now and during the next 12 months in November were only just below September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s respective strongest levels since September 2001 and February 2008. Nevertheless, there are still appreciable challenges facing Eurozone manufacturers. Foreign orders are being hampered by mediocre global growth, most notably the slowdown in China and emerging markets. Eurozone manufacturers will also be wary that the current uncertain global growth outlook could lead to increased business caution over investment and the purchase of capital goods. Commenting on the eurozone PMI figure, Markit said: The eurozone manufacturing sector continued to make solid progress at the end of 2015, as rates of growth in production, new orders and new export business all improved. Although input costs and output charges fell again, trends in both provided further evidence of deflationary pressures easing. With the Greek PMI edging back above 50.0, December saw PMI readings in all of the nations covered at levels signalling expansion for the first time since April 2014. Italy remained the fastest- growing, with its rate of expansion improving to a 57- month record. \u00ef\u201a\u00a7 So the overall picture for eurozone manufacturing has shown an improvement. The purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index for the eurozone came in at 53.2 in December, according to Markit. This compares to the 53.1 initial estimate, and the 52.8 recorded in November. And Greek manufacturing has also shown an improvement: Markit said: Greek manufacturers reported a slight improvement in operating conditions in December, ending a sequence of deterioration which began in September 2014. The upturn in manufacturing was driven by higher production, which returned to expansionary territory for the first time in 12 months. Encouragingly, a slight increase in staff numbers was also reported. The German manufacturing sector has recorded its best performance for four months, according to the PMI survey. The Markit index rose from 52.9 in November to 53.2 last month, and economist Oliver Kolodseike said: Reflective of the trend observed throughout 2015, the Germany Manufacturing PMI posted above the no- change mark of 50.0 in December, thereby signalling sustained growth in the sector. New order intakes continued to grow at a healthy rate, with demand for consumer goods particularly strong and exports showing the largest monthly rise since February 2014. However, the strong rise in new business resulted in capacity problems at some plants, with business outstanding rising at the sharpest rate for nearly two years. It is therefore likely that employment and output will continue to increase in coming months. Downward pressure on inflation meanwhile persisted at the year end, as the recent falls in energy and oil prices led to a further sharp drop in manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 input costs. Meanwhile in France the purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index hit a 21 month high, according to Markit. The index climbed to 51.4 in December from 50.6 the previous month, its highest level since March 2014. A strong performance in December meant Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector ended 2015 by growing at the fastest rate since early 2011. The Markit PMI index came in at 55.6 in December, up from 54.9 the previous month and the best reading since March 2011. There was a sharp and accelerated increase in production levels at manufacturers. Markit economist Phil Smith said: The headline PMI maintained its recent ascent in December, moving to its highest level since March 2011. This completes what is a drastic turnaround from the situation just one year ago when the index was languishing below the 50.0 mark as the economy contracted. Since then, a weak euro, recovering domestic demand and falling global commodity prices have provided the necessary tailwinds to get things moving. The goods-producing sector has solid momentum heading into the New Year, with new order growth accelerating and companies taking on new staff to cope with rising production requirements. The weak Chinese data has, inevitably, hit metal prices on concerns about a slowdown in demand. And that in turn has meant shares in mining companies are among the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest fallers so far, with Anglo American down 5%, Glencore 4% lower and Antofagasta off 3%. Spanish manufacturing activity was virtually unchanged in December, but both output and new orders rose at sharper rates than in November. The Markit purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index came in at 53 last month, down from 53.1 in November and slightly below forecasts. Markit senior economist Andrew Harker said: The latest Spanish manufacturing PMI data signalled a solid end to 2015 for the sector as growth rates for output and new orders continued to accelerate following a brief slowdown around the end of the third quarter. The rate of job creation remained weak, however, with companies perhaps cautious about making decisions on hiring and investment ahead of the election on December 20 (the data were all collected prior to the election) and subsequent results. With the FTSE 100 now down around 2%, market analyst Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct said: It might be a new year as far as the calendar is concerned, but the market seems unwilling to be taking a fresh view. Disappointing manufacturing data out of China overnight resulted in such a marked fall for domestic stocks that trading was suspended in Shanghai for the remainder of the session, so there can be no surprise that many of the mining stocks in London have once again been left wearing more than their fair share of losses in early trade in what is by all accounts a sea of red numbers. One notable exception here is Randgold Resources \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the equity slump in China is driving gold prices sharply higher, leaving the stock as the only winner a few minutes into the day. A degree of volatility was probably to be expected this morning as normal trading conditions resume, but it appears that the big sell-off is being driven largely by the overnight news out of Asia, rather than any New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hangover of the so-called Santa rally we saw start less than two weeks ago. With further tensions in the Middle East, notably between Saudi Arabia and Iran after the execution of the Saudi Shia cleric Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, crude prices have edged higher. Brent crude is currently up 0.7% at $37.57 a barrel, and would probably have been higher if not for the weak Chinese data. In the wake of the Chinese data disappointment, European markets have opened sharply lower. The FTSE 100 has fallen 87 points or 1.4%, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has dropped 2.8% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac is down 1.2% and Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex has lost 1.3%. But bear in mind that while the FTSE 100 lost 4.9% in 2015, both the Dax and the Cac moved higher, up 9.8% and 8.5% respectively, putting these latest moves in context. More on Chinese manufacturing: Ahead of the UK PMI figures, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a preview from Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight: The manufacturing purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 survey (out on Monday) is likely to show modest overall expansion in December, although it is unclear to what extent activity may have been affected by the flooding. Specifically, we expect the manufacturing purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index (PMI) to have edged back further to 52.5 in December after dipping to 52.7 in November from 55.2 in October (which had been the best performance since June 2014 and a sharp improvement from 51.7 in September). Even so, this would result in the PMI averaging 53.5 in the fourth quarter, which would be markedly above the third quarter average of 51.8 and clearly above the 50.0 level indicates flat activity. UK mortgage approvals and consumer credit figures are also due to be released. The weak Chinese data and the subsequent plunge on the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets is likely to have a negative impact on European shares: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good day for data junkies, with snapshots of December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing figures from the UK, US and Europe. But as traders return to their desks for the first full week after the festive period, things have got off to a bad start. After weak manufacturing figures last week from China, a private survey on Monday showed factory activity contracting for the tenth month in a row. The Caixin/Markit PMI fell to 48.2 in December, down from November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading of 48.6 and below expectations of a figure of 49. Anything below 50 signals contraction. The disappointment led to weakness in the yuan, and prompted a 7% fall in the blue chip CSI300 index, before circuit breakers kicked in to halt stock market trading. This was the first time they had been used to curb market volatility. The poor manufacturing data could well lead Chinese authorities to bring in further stimulus measures to help boost the flagging economy. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest PMI data implies more stimulus may be required in 2016. The surprise monthly drop in the Caixin report comes off the back of the official manufacturing PMI that saw factory activity shrink for the fifth month in December with a reading of 49.7, up slightly from November. A big swing factor for this coming year will be whether Beijing makes better use of its ability to stabilise the Chinese economy. The government has been walking a tightrope of growth stabilisation and economic reform. The way Chinese authorities lean in 2016 could determine whether market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s have a good year or not. The agenda for the rest of the economic data shows: 8.45 GMT Italian manufacturing PMI 8.50 GMT French manufacturing PMI 8.55 GMT German manufacturing PMI 9.00 GMT Eurozone manufacturing PMI 9.30 GMT UK manufacturing PMI 13.00 GMT German inflation 14.45 GMT US Markit manufacturing PMI 15.00 GMT US ISM manufacturing",

                "bodyText":"The FTSE 100 index had \u00c2\u00a338bn wiped off its value as global stock markets started the year with a rout sparked by fresh fears over the Chinese economy. Investors returning after the Christmas break were greeted by turmoil on stock exchanges, with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share index posting its worst start to a new year on record and London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 putting in its second-worst start. As European markets closed, Wall Street looked set for the sharpest new year losses since the 1930s. The sell-off rippled out from China, where news of weakness in the vast factory sector and a faltering yuan sent Chinese shares on the CSI300 index tumbling 7%, forcing trading to be halted. There was further pressure on the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market as investors anticipated the end of a ban on share sales by big stakeholders this week. The deep losses and the share suspension \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which came on the first day that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153circuit breakers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd came into effect \u00e2\u20ac\u201c helped send the FTSE 100 down 2.4%, or 149 points, to 6,093. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax was down more than 4% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac 40 fell 2.5%. Oil prices were also volatile as tension between Saudi Arabia and Iran sent Brent crude soaring in early trade only for prices to fall later on. In the US, the Dow Jones industrial average had lost 2.4% by the time London markets closed. It ended the day 1.6% down, its worst opening to a new year since 2008. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Anyone hitting the trading floor expecting a calm and quiet start to 2016 was given a rude surprise as Asian chaos affected European markets,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Alastair McCaig, market analyst at online trading company IG. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This swift return to the 2015 template of worrying about China looks to have been the trigger for the sell-off in Chinese equities. It is the first time Chinese regulators have activated the suspension in trading as a circuit breaker safety measure. Starting the year off by suspending trading an hour and a half early on the back of a 7% fall has set an ugly precedent for the year ahead.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The drop in Chinese stocks followed a business survey that suggested manufacturing activity in China contracted for the 10th successive month in December and at a faster pace than the previous month. An official survey of the factory sector last week pointed to a further slowdown in December, adding to worries that, despite a series of interventions by authorities, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second largest economy will slow further in 2016 and put further pressure on global growth. Traders said Chinese stock markets were also weighed down by investors selling shares ahead of the imminent ending of a share sales ban on listed companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 major shareholders, which was brought in during the market crash last summer. The oil price had a volatile session, as the signals from China, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest energy consumer, offset traders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 predictions that tensions between Saudia Arabia and Iran could upset supply. Brent crude turned negative in afternoon trading, down 0.4% at $37.14, having earlier added more than a dollar to $38.99 a barrel. Analysts at the consultancy Capital Economics said the tensions in the Middle East were unlikely to provide a lasting boost to oil prices. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ample global stocks of crude and higher production elsewhere mean that geopolitical risks from the Middle East are not as great as they once were,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd they wrote in a note. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We suspect a sustained recovery in oil prices will have to depend on production cuts outside OPEC and on signs of stronger global demand. These, rather than fresh disruption to supply from the Middle East, are the key factors behind our end-2016 forecast of $55 for a barrel of Brent.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In the UK, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s waning growth has weighed on confidence among exporters. There were further signs of weakness for British factories on Monday, with a survey appearing to confirm 2015 was slower than 2014. The year closed on a sluggish note, defying City expectations of a small bounce-back in December. As British manufacturers fret about the effects of a strong pound and softer overseas demand, new orders came in at the slowest pace for five months, according to the latest Markit/Cips purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index (PMI). The report\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main activity index slipped to 51.9 in December from 52.5 in November. It was above the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction but undershot forecasts of a 52.7 reading in a Reuters poll of economists. The business survey painted a slightly brighter picture than official figures, which showed manufacturing was in recession last year. Surveys from manufacturing in the eurozone showed business picked up in December offering some glimmers of hope for UK factories exporting to the single currency bloc.",

Brent crude is currently 2% lower at $36.47 a barrel.</p> <p>More Chinese news due overnight could set the tone for Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s markets. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is more PMI data [for the service sector] out of China overnight that could again unsettle sentiment, whilst the US ADP payroll number tomorrow will start to offer some clues ahead of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non farm payrolls.

                "bodyText":"It was not as turbulent a day as Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout, but stock markets still suffered another volatile session. Weak Chinese data and a halt in share trading sent investors running for cover on the first trading day of the year, and while a subsequent attempt by the Chinese central bank to stablise shares did manage to calm things for a while, the mood was still skittish. Commodity companies - hit hard on Monday by concerns about slowing growth in China - recovered some ground and gave support to markets, the FTSE 100 in particular. But an uncertain opening on Wall Street took off some of the shine. Oil prices were weak again, as fears of falling demand outweighed supply concerns in the wake of growing Middle East tensions. Brent crude is currently 2% lower at $36.47 a barrel. More Chinese news due overnight could set the tone for Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s markets. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct said: There is more PMI data [for the service sector] out of China overnight that could again unsettle sentiment, whilst the US ADP payroll number tomorrow will start to offer some clues ahead of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non farm payrolls. Although the US has made that first step up the interest rate ladder, the question now is the pace of change and again anything that looks too hasty could see the bears back in play. Overall the final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 43.81 points or 0.72% at 6137.24, having risen as high as 6166 and fallen as low as 6079. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax edged up 0.26% to 10,310.10 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 0.34% to 4537.63 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB added 1.2% to 20,983.24 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.24% at 9335.2 But in Greece, the Athens market lost 0.57% to 617.59 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 89 points or 0.5%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow for the latest services PMI data and other financial developments. Sterling fell to a nine month low against the dollar, down half a percent as the US currency continued to gain ground. But the pound edged up a similar amount against the euro following eurozone inflation figures which suggested no rush for the European Central Bank to sanction further stimulus measures. Strong UK construction figures vied with the uncertainty of a possible Brexit from Europe to influence the direction of the pound during the day. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something from Bloomberg showing that - despite this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s falls - the Chinese market is still expensive: Given the backdrop of disappointing Chinese data and growing tensions in the Middle East, this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US main economic events - the minutes of the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate-rising meeting and Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm payroll figures - will be closely watched. Christopher Vecchio, currency analyst at DailyFX, said: Weak economic data from across the globe - particularly China and the Euro-Zone - has the US dollar on stronger footing ahead of key event risk this week. Despite some alarming signs coming from the US economy (soft consumption figures, mixed housing data, and recession-level industrial production), investors and traders alike remain focused on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe big picture\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: how fast will the Federal Reserve tighten policy this year? With the December Federal Open Market Committee minutes due on Wednesday and the December US non-farm payrolls report due on Friday, market participants - short- or long-term in nature alike - will have a fresh look at where the Fed stands... Parsing the FOMC minutes and reviewing the details of the December labor reports should help provide enough clarity for judgement to be made on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153who is wrong\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: either the market, currently pricing in two rates hikes for this year (via Fed funds futures); or the Fed, currently suggesting it will hike rates four times this year. In the event that the FOMC meeting and the US non-farm payrolls prove to be supportive of the US dollar, it will likely come at the detriment of higher yielding currencies and risk-correlated assets. Any signs that the Fed could tighten policy faster than currently expected, against a backdrop of rising tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia as well as Chinese/emerging market growth concerns, would seem like a caustic mix of influences for the commodity currency bloc in particular. Wall Street has followed other global markets in attempting to stage a rebound after Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s China-induced rout. But as in Europe, the rally is rather tentative. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 42 points or 0.2% in early trading, while the S&amp;P 500 has opened 0.16% better and Nasdaq is 0.3% higher. In Europe, the FTSE 100 is currently up 0.79% while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has added 0.33% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.48%. Oil prices remain under pressure, on fears of falling demand in the wake of the poor Chinese data seen over the past few days. A stronger US dollar is not helping matters, since it makes holding dollar-denominated commodities more expensive. These factors are outweighing the growing tensions in the Middle East - especially between Saudi Arabia and Iran - which could hinder supply. So Brent crude is currently down 1.2% at $36.77 a barrel, while WTI is nearly 1% lower at $36.40. Accountancy group ICAEW reckons that British businesses are actually more worried about the domestic situation, rather than problems in China. A survey of its members found that the the UK economy is the number one concern for 2016. However, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re less concerned about the eurozone economy, geopolitics, or the looming referendum on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s membership of the European Union. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the details: 41% of businesses feel that the growing uncertainty around the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position in the EU could have a negative impact, compared with 50% a year ago Businesses are less concerned about the negative impact of low economic growth in the Eurozone than they were two years ago (44% v 56% in 2014). Although exporters are displaying the same concern than they did last year, with 60% expecting a negative impact. Low UK inflation is expected to have a positive impact on over a third of companies (36%) but over half (52%) would be negatively impacted by any interest rate rise in 2016 Instability in the Middle East and Ukraine is much less of a concern to business with 29% of respondents expecting a negative impact (down from 41%). Time for a quick recap. European stock markets remain fragile today, after an early attempt to rally back from Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump floundered. The main bourses are mixed as traders snatch lunch in the City. The German and French markets are down around 0.5%, while Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is managing a slight recovery, up 18 point, having been 70 points higher in early trading. Investors are bruised following yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump, which was the worst start to a trading year since the dot-com crash. China remains a big worry today. Overnight, Chinese authorities intervened to prevent another slump on the Shanghai market. State-backed authorities bought up shares, in a bid to prop up values. This helped the Chinese market to end the day roughly where it started. However, the intervention may also shows that Beijing is worried about future problems, given its slowing economy and the build-up of bad debts since the financial crisis began. Chris Beauchamp of IG sums up the morning: Early optimism on the London market has faded as investors continue to fret about the situation in Chinese markets. As in August, state-directed buying of stocks is competing with individual selling of equities, but China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest attempt to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbuck the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is likely to end as well as its efforts last year. The butterfly effect has been felt in Europe again this morning, with an initial bounce giving way to more selling, while in London the FTSE is fighting hard to hold on to small gains. While Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets warns: ...the prospect of another Summer-style Chinese rout (the one which made the Fed hold off from hiking) remains a real possibility. There is disappointment that eurozone inflation remains at just 0.2%, despite the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus measures. And there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also drama in the City. with Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threatening to pounce on Home Retail, the firm behind Argos and Homebase.... ....while the unusually warm weather has hurt sales at high street chain Next: If Sainsbury takes over Home Retail, it will reunite the company with the homes-and-gardens chain Homebase after a 15-year break. Big news in the City..... supermarket chain Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has revealed that it made a takeover approach to Home Retail (which owns Argos and Homebase). The offer was made, and rejected, in November, Sainsbury says. It is now considering its position, and has until February 2 to make a new bid. Rumours have been swirling for weeks that Home Retail could be a takeover target. Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to out itself as a possible bidder has send Home Retail shares soaring, up 30%. More here: William Hobbs, head of investment strategy at Barclays Plc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wealth-management unit in London, sums up the situation well -- it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153really messy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the markets right now. He told Bloomberg that investors around the globe are on edge today, and fearing trouble ahead. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Not much is expected of the world in terms of growth, risk appetite is biased to the downside and weak data from China to the U.S. hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helped at all. Plenty of people out there believe that the next global recession is imminent.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd US stock markets are expected to post fresh losses today, when they open in three hours time. The Dow Jones industrial average is tipped to fall by around 100 points, adding to Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 276 point slide. The euro has lost ground against the US dollar since December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation figures came out. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down over half a cent at $1.076. Although eurozone inflation is clearly weak, it may not be bad enough to force more stimulus out of the European Central Bank, argues Teunis Brosens of ING. While headline inflation was stuck at 0.2%, core inflation (stripping out energy and food) was also unchanged at 0.9% in December. Brosens says: Hawks may argue that weak core inflation is unsurprising given the still high unemployment in many Eurozone countries. Moreover, despite this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakening of core inflation, the presence of second-round effects is not yet convincing. We think that the ECB will hold its fire for now: it will take more convincing evidence of second round effects or other really disappointing economic news to stir the ECB into further action. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why shares have fallen back this morning: So much for the bounce-back. European stock markets couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even stay in the green until London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pubs opened for the day. The weak eurozone inflation reading has helped to pull the major indices into the red for the second day running. The German Dax has shed another 1%, on top of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 4% slump. The Paris CAC is down another 0.8%, and London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is off eight points. Ipek Ozkardeskaya of City firm London Capital Group says China is still worrying investors, even though Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank, the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China, stepped in overnight to prop up its stock market. She writes that market sentiment is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very much fragile\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: The apocalyptic Chinese story keeps the headlines busy. The intervention from the PBoC eased tensions at the heart of the storm, yet the chaotic start to 2016 warned of a challenging year ahead of us. The first trading day of the year has clearly wiped away some of the optimism and the risk-off flows dominate. Shanghai\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Composite opened the day 3.1% lower yet managed to recover later in the session. State-controlled funds bought equities to halt the $590bn worth of sell-off suffered on Monday, and a selling ban for investors would extend beyond a week according to several sources. The European Central Bank will be concerned that inflation remained so low last month, says Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight: Good news for Eurozone consumers but a headache for the ECB as consumer price inflation remained down at 0.2% in December, thereby defying expectations of a small uptick. The failure of Eurozone inflation to pick up in December is good news for consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 purchasing power; but it will maintain ECB concern that prolonged very low inflation could lead to a renewed weakening in inflation expectations thereby making it harder still to get Eurozone consumer price inflation up to its target rate of close to 2%. December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unexpectedly weak inflation report is hurting the euro. The single currency has hit its lowest level against the yen since April 2015. One euro is now worth \u00c2\u00a5128.03, down from \u00c2\u00a5129.33 earlier. Breaking: inflation across the eurozone remained uncomfortably weak last month. Prices across the single currency region rose by just 0.2% annually in December, Eurostat has just reported. That matches November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading, and dashes hopes of a rise to 0.3% or 0.4%. Cheaper energy costs are partly to blame..... but food and service price inflation did also slow last month: Eurostat says: Food, alcohol &amp; tobacco is expected to have the highest annual rate in December (1.2%, compared with 1.5% in November), followed by services (1.1%, compared with 1.2% in November), non-energy industrial goods (0.5%, stable compared with November) and energy (-5.9%, compared with -7.3% in November). The European Central Bank is meant to maintain inflation close to, but below, 2% -- but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a long way from that despite the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quantitative easing stimulus measures.... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s builders didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get much rest over Christmas, judging by the latest healthcheck from the sector. Data firm Markit reports that output jumped last month, pushing its PMI index up to 57.8 in December, up from a seven-month low of 55.3. That suggests the sector grew at a faster pace last month. Markit cited \u00e2\u20ac\u0153favourable demand conditions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with builders reporting that clients were more willing to commit to new projects. Commercial construction had a particularly good month, with growth hitting its fastest rate since October 2014. The unusually warm weather in December may also be a factor, as Britain didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t suffer the kind of heavy snowfalls that can scupper construction work this time of year. Firms who can build flood defences could be busy in 2016 too, as communities across the country try to shore themselves up. This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally is looking a little fragile, after less than 90 minutes. European stock markets have shed much of their early gains, and are now broadly flat. Invesotrs Here comes the latest measure of German unemployment..... and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better than expected. The number of people out of work across Germany fell by 14,000 last month, on a seasonally-adjusted basis. That smashes expectations of a 6,000 drop, and shows Germany is still outperforming many neighbours. This leaves its unemployment rate unchanged at 6.3%, compared to a eurozone average of 10.7%. Spain has also reported that its jobless total shrank by 8% last year: Mining stocks are leading this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally in London. Commodity giant Glencore is up over 4%, as fears over China ease a little (for the moment....) Tony Cross of Trustnext Direct says traders are taking their cue from Asia: London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE-100 has recovered some of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses at the open, thanks in no small part to the fact that Asian equity markets appear to have stabilised overnight \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at least for now. The vast majority of blue chips are trading in positive territory although the handful of losing stocks are being dominated by clothing retailers with that trading update from Next this morning providing little reason to get excited about the sector. High street chain Debenhams\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 shares have fallen by 2% in early trading. That reflects concerns that Next\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak sales over Christmas could be mirrored across the sector. Marks &amp; Spencer are down 0.5%. Shares in Next are out of fashion this morning. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re down by 3% at the start of trading, leading the FTSE fallers, as the City digests this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing Christmas trading. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction: Shares are rallying across Europe at the start of trading, as investors recover their nerve after Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heavy selloff. In London, the FTSE 100 has jumped by 72 points, or 1.2%, to 6165 points. That claws back almost half of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout, when the blue-chip index shed 148 points. The French CAC, German DAX, Spanish IBEX and Italian FTSE MIB are all up around 1.1%. Yesterday, the DAX slumped by over 4%, so today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally is only a partial recovery. Traders are encouraged by the news that Chinese authorities took action overnight to prevent their stock market tumbling again. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, explains: In the aftermath of a global sell-off over China growth fears, UK and European stock index futures are taking their cues from the Chinese stock market on Tuesday. After an initial wobble, shares in Shanghai and Shenzhen turned positive on Tuesday thanks to an injection of liquidity from the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China. High street retailer Next has sent a shiver through the sector this morning, after posting weaker than expected results for the crucial Christmas period. Full price sales rose by just +0.4% from 26 October to 24 December. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a serious slowdown, as Next sales grew by 6% between July and September. And as Next is the first major European retailer to report Christmas trading figures, this may mean more trouble ahead... Next pinned much of the blame on the unusually warm weather this autumn. This is a classic excuse for British retailers, who can often point to the skies to explain away a poor performance. But to give Next credit, it also released a graph showing how sales did indeed shrink in weeks where the temperature was hotter than in 2014: And the weather isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only culprit. The firm also admits that its catalogue shopping arm, NEXT Directory\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, suffered poor stock availability from October onward. Spread-betting firm IG is predicting that European markets will bounce back when trading begins in a few minutes, clawing back some of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. IG is calling the main markets up around 1%: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a wild day in China, as Beijing tries to prevent a repeat of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout. Chinese authorities intervened in the markets today, buying up stocks to give investors confidence. And it appears to have worked. The Shanghai composite index has closed for the day, down just 0.28%, having shed 3% at one stage today. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rather better than Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 7% slump, which forced trading to be halted. That doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t address the underlying problems in China, such as the build-up of bad debts and its slowing economy. And it suggests Beijing isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t prepared to allow market forces to take their natural course.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s day two of the trading year, and investors around the globe will be hoping for a better performance than on day one. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a nervous air in the markets today, after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff wiped hundreds of billions of dollars off bourses worldwide. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 lost \u00c2\u00a338bn in a blink of an eye: But unlike vanishing candyfloss, market value can reappear. And European stock markets are expected to recover some ground today. But it could be another volatile session, with concerns over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy looming over markets. Also on the agenda today, we get the first estimate of eurozone inflation for December. Economists predict it will rise to an annual rate of 0.4%, from 0.2% in November. We also get the latest German unemployment data for December, and an estimate of how UK builders fared last month. 8.55am GMT: German unemployment report 9.30am GMT: UK construction PMI 10am: Eurozone inflation for December And high street retailer Next is reporting its financial results for the last quarter. That will give us an insight into how the crucial Christmas trading season went.....",

It was North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fourth nuclear test. Despite falls elsewhere in the region, Chinese stocks edged up on Wednesday on hopes that regulators would extend a ban on share sales by major stakeholders as Beijing scrambled to avert a potential repeat of last summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market crash. The CSI300 index of leading companies was up 1.5% in late afternoon trading. State media reported the ban on some share sales, which had been due to expire on Friday, would remain in place until new rules to manage the process are promulgated. The market was also helped by statements from at least 30 companies saying their controlling shareholders or senior executives would not sell shares on the secondary market within the next six or 12 months to help stabilise the stock market. The reports were the latest damage-control measures announced after China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major benchmark indexes plunged 7% on Monday, forcing the first-ever nationwide trading halt and roiling global markets. Many traders largely attributed Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off to fears that the expiry of the share sale ban, imposed during the height of the market rout last year, could see an estimated 1.24 trillion yuan ($190.23bn) of shares dumped onto the market. However, some say further restricting share sales by major shareholders was not justified, and would do little to help the market. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Extending the restrictions would only prolong the problem, rather than cure it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Shen Weizheng, fund manager at Shanghai-based Ivy Capital. Companies can extend the ban for six months, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153but what about six months later? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like the sword of the Damocles overshadowing the market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The latest worrying news on China came in a private survey which showed activity in China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services sector expanded at its slowest rate in 17 months in December, bucking robust findings in an official survey and a further indication that the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-largest economy has lost momentum. Policymakers and economists have been hoping that growth in services would offset persistent weakness in Chinese manufacturing and keep the economy from cooling too sharply. As the move to safe haven assets such as the yen and the US dollar continued on Wednesday, markets were also rocked after the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China set the yuan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s midpoint rate at its weakest level in 4-1/2 years. China has guided the yuan lower since a surprise devaluation of the currency last summer, rattling traders who fear it could eventually set off a round of competitive devaluations which will put further pressure on other emerging economies. Some see the tactic as a desperate attempt by China to shore up growth, prompting concerns that the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-biggest economy could be even weaker than imagined, though others say further yuan weakness is inevitable in the face of the strong US dollar. The US dollar touched a near three-month low of 118.35 yen and the euro slid to a nine-month trough of 127.465 yen . The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield fell by about three basis points to 2.22%. Bond yields move down when the price moves up. Kathy Lien, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management in Tokyo, said that the US and Japanese currencies were being bought because \u00e2\u20ac\u0153China is in trouble, U.S. data has been disappointing, Japan refuses to increase stimulus and oil prices continue to fall, but everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s greatest fear is that stocks have finally peaked\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In commodities, crude oil prices struggled near 11-year lows and added to the pessimistic mood with the market giving more attention to the stronger dollar and swelling US inventories rather than growing tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Brent crude was up slightly at to $36.45 a barrel, still in reach of the 11-year trough of $35.98 hit late last month.",

It started badly with more poor Chinese data - this time from the service sector - which prompted renewed fears of a severe slowdown in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second largest economy. However there were also suggestions that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank might unveil new stimulus measures, as well as extending the ban on short selling which is due to expire at the end of this week.</p> <p>News that North Korea had claimed to have exploded a hydrogen bomb also unnerved investors, while the oil price continued to slide. Growing tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran make it unlikely the oil-rich countries will be able to agree on production cuts to cope with falling demand and oversupply. On top of that came new figures showing a 10.1m rise in gasoline inventories in the US last week.</p> <p>So markets fell sharply again, with commodity companies bearing the brunt of the selling, although they recovered from their worst levels towards the end of trading.

A hat-trick of underperforming services PMIs saw the Chinese, UK and US readings all fall short of market expectations today. With the UK and US heavily reliant on the services sector, the continued slide in services PMIs will no doubt be worrying, with certain negative implications for future growth in both countries.</p> <p>As we head towards the European close there is a distinct pattern taking shape, with selling dominating the morning session, followed by a rally within the crossover period between the US and European markets. Perhaps this is US optimism at work, yet there certainly appears to be substantially more negativity within Europe than in the US, despite the fact that the Fed is the only central bank to be raising rates.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-568d43a3e4b0ef602a241292\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-06T16:43:51.654Z\">4.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Following the news that the US added 10.1m barrels of gasoline to inventories last week, John Kilduff of Again Capital <strong><a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/01/05/oil-prices-edge-higher-after-dropping-to-near-11-year-lows.html\">told CNBC</a></strong>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the biggest increase in gasoline supply since 1993.

With businesses reducing inventory, imports fell to their lowest level in five years, with exports also declining but at a lower rate.</p> <p>So the trade gap fell by 5% to $42.4bn, while October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit was revised up to $44.6bn for $43.9bn. Rob Carnell at ING Bank said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The November US trade deficit narrowed by a little over $2bn to $42.374bn, which will help lift the fourth quarter 2015 GDP figures by about 0.1%/0.2% relative to what a flat reading would have delivered (assuming this is sustained). But this is not quite as good a data post as first glance shows.</p> <p>The deficit was not materially affected by petroleum flows or prices, with the ex-petroleum deficit actually narrowing even more than the headline figure.<br></p> <p>What appears to be dominating this result is a sharp (1.7% month on month) decline in imports, particularly on the goods side (service imports broadly unchanged). And this may reflect a much weaker level of underlying demand in the economy than some other recent data have suggested. Exports were a little softer too, but it is weak imports that dominated this result.<br></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-568d158ee4b02440900e1ce6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-06T13:26:02.142Z\">1.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Analysts are surprised by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jan/06/markets-weak-chinese-data-services-eurozone-business-live#block-568d138be4b0ef602a240083\">the unexpectedly strong US private sector jobs report</a>. </strong></p> <p>It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really match up to recent economic data, particularly from US manufacturing sector:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/monexeurope/statuses/684727029737107456\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">That&#39;s a rather large payrolls estimate from ADP...interesting to see if official figures can live up</p>&mdash; Ranko Berich (@monexeurope) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/monexeurope/status/684727029737107456\">January 6, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mhewson_CMC/statuses/684726907200516096\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">ADP says manufacturing added 2k jobs in Dec despite weak ISM and Chicago PMI?

                "bodyText":"Investors could see the FTSE 100 - currently at 6073 - slip below 6000 during the current market rout, according to Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct. He said: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been another difficult day for London equities with the FTSE-100 failing to find any meaningful support, in line with sentiment across the bulk of global stock markets. Once again miners are leading the rout, this time with suggestions that some of the big names could look to use a rights issue to build so-called war chests so they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re well placed to pick up distressed assets from smaller rivals when the inevitable fire sales come along. The fact oil prices have hit levels not seen in over a decade is also cause for concern, with traders taking the glass half empty approach here \u00e2\u20ac\u201c US crude inventories fell, but there was simultaneously a sharp build in the corresponding gasoline reading... Downside pressure may be with us for a while yet and the obvious next level to watch for is a break below 6,000 on the FTSE-100. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. It was another day of dramatic declines on global markets. It started badly with more poor Chinese data - this time from the service sector - which prompted renewed fears of a severe slowdown in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second largest economy. However there were also suggestions that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank might unveil new stimulus measures, as well as extending the ban on short selling which is due to expire at the end of this week. News that North Korea had claimed to have exploded a hydrogen bomb also unnerved investors, while the oil price continued to slide. Growing tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran make it unlikely the oil-rich countries will be able to agree on production cuts to cope with falling demand and oversupply. On top of that came new figures showing a 10.1m rise in gasoline inventories in the US last week. So markets fell sharply again, with commodity companies bearing the brunt of the selling, although they recovered from their worst levels towards the end of trading. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 63.86 points or 1.04% to 6073.38, having earlier fallen as low as 6018. Around 22 points of the decline came from mining and oil companies Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 0.93% to 10,214.02 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 1.26% at 4480.47 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB lost 2.67% to 20,422.39 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 1.48% at 9197.4 In Greece, the Athens market fell 0.57% to 617.59 In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 217 points or 1.26%. Brent crude is 5.1% lower at $34.56 a barrel, after earlier touching $34.26 - its worst level for around eleven and a half years. Back with the stock markets, and the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s events seemed to follow a familiar pattern according to Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG. He said: The 2016 meltdown has moved into its third day, with both European and US markets selling off heavily once more, spurred on by yet another leg lower in crude prices. A hat-trick of underperforming services PMIs saw the Chinese, UK and US readings all fall short of market expectations today. With the UK and US heavily reliant on the services sector, the continued slide in services PMIs will no doubt be worrying, with certain negative implications for future growth in both countries. As we head towards the European close there is a distinct pattern taking shape, with selling dominating the morning session, followed by a rally within the crossover period between the US and European markets. Perhaps this is US optimism at work, yet there certainly appears to be substantially more negativity within Europe than in the US, despite the fact that the Fed is the only central bank to be raising rates. Following the news that the US added 10.1m barrels of gasoline to inventories last week, John Kilduff of Again Capital told CNBC: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the biggest increase in gasoline supply since 1993. Gasoline prices are going to collapse. On the other hand US crude inventories dropped by 5.1m barrels last week, but this has done nothing to support the oil price. And now a new low for the day. Brent crude is down $2 a barrel or 5.7% at $34.30, in the wake of the US inventory figures. These have added to worries about oversupply and falling demand, at a time when tensions between Saudia Arabia and Iran make it less likely the major producers will be able to agree on production cuts. After staging a minor recovery, oil prices are falling again after US gasoline stocks rose by 10.6m last week, the biggest weekly rise since 1993, according to the US Energy Information Administration. So Brent crude is now down 4.75% at $34.69, back down towards the lows of the day. However: Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex said: Whilst not quite at bad their early afternoon nadirs, the global indices were still drunk off today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s toxic China/oil/North Korea cocktail, staggering to fresh lows like a troop of inebriated uncles at an uncomfortable family function. The Dow Jones, at its worst down by nearly 300 points, settled into a 200 point loss as the open receded into the background, lifted slightly by an absurdly strong ADP non-farm employment change figure and a shrinking trade balance number. Some of that goodwill was undone, however, by a huge month-on-month drop in factory orders (from 1.5% to -0.2%) and a pair of Markit and ISM services PMIs that, at 54.3 and 55.1 respectively, both worryingly underperformed expectations. And whilst the Dow may have climbed away from its lows, it remains both firmly below the 17000 mark and approaching 3 month lows. Over in Europe and things remained just as bad, the DAX, CAC and FTSE all haemorrhaging around 1-1.5% as the day dragged on. If anything it is admirable the UK index hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fallen even further given that Brent Crude truly lost its way this Wednesday, trading below $35 per barrel to hit new 11 year lows for most of the afternoon, at one point extending its losses to nearly 5%. Here are the bigget fallers on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a broad based decline, with only retailer Wal Mart bucking the downward trend: And US factory orders fell in November and inventories declined for the fifth straight month, according to the Commerce Department. New orders slipped 0.2% in November compared to a 1.3% rise in October, itself downgraded from an initial reading of 1.5%. Inventories fell 0.3% in November after a 0.5% decline the previous month. The ISM non-manufacturing report also suggests some weakness in the US economy. Its PMI came in at 55.3 in December, down from 55.9 in November and lower than the 56 that analysts had been expecting. This was the lowest reading since April 2014. But the new orders index rose from 57.5 in November to 58.2, while the business activity index improved from 58.2 to 58.7. The Markit survey suggests that US economic growth could be losing momentum. Its chief economist Chris Williamson said: The PMI surveys show the service sector losing momentum alongside a stalling of growth in the manufacturing sector, pushing the overall rate of economic expansion down to the weakest for a year. While the survey data indicate that the economy grew at a reasonably healthy 1.9% annualised clip in the fourth quarter, the weakness seen in the final month of the year raises concerns that growth is losing momentum, possibly quite markedly. The survey also signals robust employment growth, but likewise suggests the pace of hiring has slowed since earlier in the year as businesses have become more cautious in the face of worries such as the forthcoming elections, the strong dollar, global growth jitters and the outlook for interest rates. The December survey data are consistent with non-farm payrolls rising by around 175,000 compared to an average of 200,000 in the first eleven months of the year. Having hiked interest rates for the first time in almost a decade at the end of last year, the Fed will likely err on the side of caution and hold off with further policy tightening until the full extent of the slowdown becomes apparent. US services grew more strongly than expected in December, according to Markit, but were still at their lowest level since January last year. Its services PMI came in at 54.3 compared to expectations of 54 and an initial reading of 53.7. But it was weaker than the November figure of 56.1. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s composite PMI for December was 54, down from 55.9 in November and the lowest since December 2014. Markit said: December data highlighted that the U.S. service sector ended the year on a weaker growth footing, with business activity and incoming new work both expanding at slower rates than in November. Staffing numbers continued to rise at a solid pace, but the latest survey suggested a greater degree of caution about the business outlook. The ISM non-manufacturing survey is due shortly. As expected, US markets are joining in the global downturn, sparked by the latest poor Chinese data, this time from the service sector, and of course the reports of a hydrogen bomb test by North Korea. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 235 points or 1.4% in early trading. The S&amp;P 500 has fallen 1%, while Nasdaq is off 1.5% (not helped by weakness in Apple following reports of iPhone 6 production cutbacks.) Oil continues to fall, the latest lurch down coming after the strong ADP jobs report which has in turn strengthened the dollar on the basis of more possible US interest rate rises. Commodities are denominated in dollars, so any rise in the US currency makes them more expensive to hold. So Brent crude is now down 4.7% at $34.71 a barrel, having touched a low of $34.62. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a new low of more than 11 years (since July 2004). Here is our story on the oil price slide: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite a New Year hangover in the markets today. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff has sent European stocks down to a three-week low, knocking 1.7% off the Stoxx 600 index (which tracks listed companies across Europe). That pretty much wipes out the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Santa Rally\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that kicked off after the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates in mid December: Alastair McCaig, Market Analyst at IG, says weak Chinese data and tensions overseas have hurt stocks this week. Only three days into the new year and both the economic data and equity markets in China are giving investors plenty to worry about. The People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China has already suspended equity markets, closing them early for the day, injected 130 billion yuan into the markets and has now weakened the currency. What will the fourth day of the trading year bring? The escalation in rhetoric between Saudi Arabia and Iran has already heightened fears over the Middle East and now North Korea has decided this is the optimum time to carry out its latest nuclear bomb test. If 2016 is going to be a good one for equities, they are going to have to do it the hard way. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s damage, with just over two hours trading left in Europe: City firm Fathom Consulting is particularly pessimistic about China - it believes growth is way, way below the official reading of 7% (which is also Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official target) Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ADP report shows that the US labour market saved the best till last.... Is it too early to speculate about another US interest rate rise? Rob Carnell of ING thinks markets could start pricing in a fresh rise in borrowing costs in March, if Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Non-Farm Payroll matches today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decent ADP jobs report. Such a move would be backed by rising inflation, notwithstanding what is currently happening to oil prices - the base effects from last year dominate any current downward pressure on prices. Wages too will likely bolster the case for more tightening (only +0.2%mom needed to take wage inflation to 2.8% in December), and sooner than markets are expecting. There is still a long way to go until the March meeting, and we think that by the time we get there, the Fed will have managed to come up with an excuse for dragging its feet some more. But in the meantime, stronger labour data, rising inflation and wages are making a decent case for a more aggressive Fed, a stronger USD, and higher bond yields. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit narrowed in November, according to figures just released by the Commerce Department. With businesses reducing inventory, imports fell to their lowest level in five years, with exports also declining but at a lower rate. So the trade gap fell by 5% to $42.4bn, while October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit was revised up to $44.6bn for $43.9bn. Rob Carnell at ING Bank said: The November US trade deficit narrowed by a little over $2bn to $42.374bn, which will help lift the fourth quarter 2015 GDP figures by about 0.1%/0.2% relative to what a flat reading would have delivered (assuming this is sustained). But this is not quite as good a data post as first glance shows. The deficit was not materially affected by petroleum flows or prices, with the ex-petroleum deficit actually narrowing even more than the headline figure. What appears to be dominating this result is a sharp (1.7% month on month) decline in imports, particularly on the goods side (service imports broadly unchanged). And this may reflect a much weaker level of underlying demand in the economy than some other recent data have suggested. Exports were a little softer too, but it is weak imports that dominated this result. Analysts are surprised by the unexpectedly strong US private sector jobs report. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really match up to recent economic data, particularly from US manufacturing sector: Breaking: American companies hired more new staff than expected last month. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign that the US labour market remains robust, despite weakening economic growth in emerging markets such as China. The closely watched monthly survey conducted by the Automatic Data Processing (ADP) showed that 257,000 new private sector jobs were created last month. That beats estimates; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s around 62,000 more jobs than expected. It suggests Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Non-Farm Payroll report will not contain any shocks that might make the Federal Reserve regret raising interest rates last month. undefined Wall Street traders should take their tin hats into work. The futures market is predicting chunky falls across the three main share markets, CNBC flags up. Trading begins in 75 minutes, at 2.30pm GMT. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tech-heavy Nasdaq index is on track to shed 2% when trading begins, in an hour and half\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. That reflects concerns that Apple is reportedly cutting iPhone production, which may herald wider problems in the technology sector.... There was no relief to the commodity crunch this morning: Shares in tech giant Apple are on track to hit their lowest level since last August, when Wall Street opens. According to reports from China, Apple is cutting back on production of its iPhone 6 smartphone, in response to weaker than expected sales. Foxconn, a major iPhone assembler, has already cut staff levels according to the Wall Street Journal. The news has already hit the shares of the various tech firms whose components go into the iPhone. ARM, the UK chip firm, are down 3%. And Apple is on track to fall by 2.7% to around $99.98.... European markets are lurching lower -- the FTSE 100 is flirting with a triple-digit loss, as concern swirls over China and North Korea. The German, French and Italian markets are also deeper in the red: Mining firms are still the biggest fallers, as commodity prices are hit by concerns over the global economy. The fall in the crude price has hit producer Tullow Oil, which is down over 5%. In another sign of nervousness, the price of gold is rising: The Russian rouble is being hit by the weakening oil price, dropping 1% to 74 roubles to the US dollar. Oil is continuing to slide..... Today is definitely a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153risk-off\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd trading session, says Peter Rosenstreich, head of market strategy at online bank Swissquote Bank. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement of a hydrogen bomb test has done little to calm already jittery nerves. The announcement was supported by media outlets reporting a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153man-made\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd earthquake in the area that North Korea generally uses to test their nuclear capabilities. This concerning news follows directly on the heels of the escalations of tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Given the weak economic growth data emulating for emerging markets recently investors had little appetite to wait around. Spreadex\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Conner Campbell says markets are suffering a triple-whammy -- poor Chinese data, weakening oil, and North Korean worries. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The dismal start to 2016 appears to have only intensified this Wednesday, with disappointing Chinese services data (sending the yuan to a 5-year low against the dollar even if the Shanghai Composite managed some counter-intuitive growth), a fresh 11-year low for Brent Crude and reports of a fourth nuclear test from North Korea.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still 90 minutes to wait until dawn breaks over New York. But any early-rising Wall Street workers should brace for a lively day. The futures market is predicting the Dow Jones industrial average will shed almost 200 points, or 1.3%, at the open. A fresh dose of gloom has swept the oil market today, driving down crude prices to their lowest levels since the summer of 2004. Rising geopolitical tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran pushed prices down; good news for consumers, and countries who import their energy supplies, but another blow to producers. Brent crude, sourced from the North Sea, tumbled by 2% to just $35.52 per barrel, a new 11-year low. US crude dropped 1.5% to $35.38. This partly reflects concerns over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowing economy -- weaker growth equals less demand for energy. But oil traders are also watching the tensions between Tehran and Riyadh carefully. Over the weekend, Saudi Arabia cut diplomatic ties with Iran after protesters ransacked the Saudi embassy in Tehran, following Saudi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s execution of a senior Shia Muslim cleric. Middle Eastern tensions usually push the oil price up. But in this case, it dampens the prospect of producers working together and cutting the amount of crude hitting the market. RBC Capital Markets say: In particular, we would highlight the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to execute the prominent Shiite Cleric and political dissident Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr as a catalyst for increased sectarian tension both at home and throughout the region. At the time of writing, protests had broken out in the restive city of Qatif in the Kingdom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil-rich eastern province and angry demonstrators had set the Saudi Embassy in Tehran on fire. Returning to China... Ilya Spivak, currency strategist at DailyFX, says traders are alarmed that Beijing allowed the yuan to hit a five-year low today. The sentiment-sensitive Australian, Canadian and New Zealand Dollars dropped while the safety-linked Japanese Yen pushed higher as risk aversion gripped markets in Asian trade. The move followed China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move to set the daily reference rate for the onshore Yuan exchange rate at the lowest in five years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Newswires suggested the move reflected Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s determination that the economy needs additional stimulus, which implies a deteriorating growth outlook. Curiously, the prospect of additional policy support might have been expected to be supportive for sentiment considering a slowdown in China has been baked into consensus forecasts for some time. He also reckons traders should chill... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With this in mind, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move may prove to be a reflexive, knee-jerk response rather than a sober evaluation of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FX policy on its merits. The PBOC spooked investors when it began to rapidly revalue the Yuan in August, catching markets off-guard and sending asset prices scrambling. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response may reflect fears of a similar scenario, but the ingredients for a repeat appear to be absent. Growth across the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector dipped last month, suggesting the British economy isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t growing as fast as hoped. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK Services PMI dropped to 55.5 in December, from 55.9 in November. That still shows robust expansion, with firms taking on more business....but Markit sounds a little concerned about the situation. It says: Employment increased at a robust pace, albeit the weakest in five months.... Growth in recent months has been slower than in the first half of the year and when compared with the trend rates set in 2013-14. Reflecting this, outstanding business continued to grow only modestly in December, and firms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 longer-term expectations for business activity were the weakest since early-2013. Jeremy Cook of currency exchange firm World First wonders if the service sector may have peaked: Despite France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems, private sector growth across the euro area has hit its highest level since mid-2011. Data firm Markit reports that activity rose across Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Ireland last month, with many firms taking on more staff. Its composite PMI, which measures manufacturing and service sector growth across the eurozone, hit 54.3, up from 54.2 in November. That indicates that growth in the final three months of 2015 was the strongest since the eurozone debt crisis kicked off. Ireland posted the fastest growth, continuing a strong run. More surprisingly, Italy was the second-best performer, ahead of Germany. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, says the data is encouraging: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The eurozone economy starts 2016 on a solid footing and well placed to enjoy a year of robust expansion. Growth of business activity continued to edge higher at the end of 2015, with an upturn in the PMI rounding off the strongest quarter for four- and-a-half years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s particularly encouraging to see firms taking on staff in increased numbers, suggesting that businesses are preparing for stronger demand in the coming year by boosting capacity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd France is kicking off 2016 where it ended 2015, with more bad economic news. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s French service sector PMI, which measures activity across the sector, fell to 49.8 in December. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an 11-month low, and suggests a small contraction) (50 is the cutoff point). Firms reported that new business growth slowed to near-stagnation during the month which also suggests economic demand is weak. Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Markit, flags up that business expectations are also lacklustre, following November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s terrorist atrocities in Paris. Anecdotal evidence suggested that a number of businesses continued to be affected by cancellations following the recent terrorist attacks, exerting a drag on new business growth. Correspondingly, business expectations dipped to the lowest level for over a year. Service providers responded by cutting their charges to the greatest extent in six months, which they will be hoping may spur new work intakes to get the New Year off to a more positive start.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back in the UK, John Lewis has shrugged off a drop in shoppers at its high street outlets to report a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Christmas. My colleague Sean Farrell has the details: Group sales for the six weeks to 2 January rose 4.1% from a year earlier to \u00c2\u00a31.81bn as sales at its John Lewis department store business, including online, rose 6.9% to \u00c2\u00a3951.3m. At operations open a year or more, John Lewis sales rose 5.1% with performance spread between homeware, fashion and technology. Sales at John Lewis department stores fell 1.2%, reflecting fewer visits to high streets and shopping centres as online sales jumped 21.4%. Maybe that Man in the Moon advert charmed the shoppers again (despite cynical hacks wondering what terrible crime the old chap had committed to prompt his lunar exile). Personally I preferred Monty the Penguin. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s yuan is continuing to weaken -\u00e2\u20ac\u201c it just hit a record low of 6.7250 to the US dollar in London trading, according to Reuters. Stocks are weakening across Europe this morning. As this chart shows, the basic resources sector (miners and energy suppliers) are the worst hit, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pretty broad selloff: Mining shares are leading the selloff in London, with BHP Billiton down 4%, Rio Tinto and Antofagasta shedding 3.7% and Glencore down 2.9%. That highlights concerns that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy may be slowing faster than official figures show, which would dampen demand for commodities. UK fashion chain Burberry is also feeling the chill, dropping 2.3% at the open. It warned in October that Chinese demand for its pricy coats and handbags had weakened since last summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market turmoil. Down we go again..... Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets are dropping in early trading, hit by worries over China and anxiety over North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nuclear test. In London, the FTSE 100 has shed almost 1% at the open, with other markets close behind. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says investors have plenty to worry about: Geopolitical risk has moved up a gear thanks to North Korea testing a hydrogen bomb for supposed self defense which will only go to make for more tension with its neighbours, while China data disappointed with a pullback in PMI Services adding to Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness in Manufacturing, bolstering investor fears about the slowing economy. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets are defying today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff, and rallying on hopes that Beijing will be forced into more stimulus moves soon. The Shanghai Composite Index jumped 1.7% to close 61 points higher, at 3,539 points. That still leaves the index down 5% this year, after Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 7% slump forced trading to be suspended. Most Asian stock markets has fallen today, driven down by worries over China and the nuclear test claims from North Korea. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei fell 1%, while Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng index lost 0.8% to hit its lowest level since October. More here: In another sign of problems building in China, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency has hit a five-year low against the US dollar today. The People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China surprised investors by setting its daily yuan fix at the lowest level since April 2011, which triggered fresh selling overseas. CNBC has the details: The offshore yuan fell to 6.6915 against the greenback, the lowest rate of exchange since at least the last quarter of 2010 and a 2.1 percent discount to the onshore yuan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 6.5506 level. The People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China has been under growing pressure as nervous investors pull capital out of the country. A weaker yuan should help Chinese firms compete overseas, but may also fuel concern about currency wars. Nizam Idris, head of foreign-exchange and fixed-income strategy at Macquarie Bank in Singapore, has told Bloomberg that the drop in the yuan will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153confuse\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the markets. Economists are concerned to see that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector growth ground to a halt last month. Zhou Hao, an economist at Commerzbank AG in Singapore, warned: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This sentiment gauge clearly clouds the growth outlook for China,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Iris Pang, greater China economist at Natixis SA in Hong Kong, hopes for a recovery this month. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Services have felt the heat from the economic slowdown....Spending in the Chinese New Year may lead to a rebound\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This chart from Caixin shows how China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy took a dive in December, with service sector growth hitting a 17 month low and manufacturing actually shrinking (as we learned on Monday) Dr He Fan, their chief economist, says it shows Beijing needs to do more to stimulate its economy: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The headline Caixin China General Services PMI for December is 50.2, down 1 point from the reading for the previous month and reaching the lowest point in 17 months. The Caixin Composite Output Index came in at 49.4, below the 50-point neutral level and 1.1 points lower than November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record. In light of the setback to services sector growth, the government needs to gradually relax restrictions in the sector. This will release the potential of supply-side reform, improve the economic structure and help with the industrial transformation and upgrading.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. Worries over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy are in focus again this morning. Overnight, fresh data has shown that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector economy grew at its slowest rate in 17 months in December. The Caixin/Markit Purchasing Managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Index (PMI) fell to 50.2 last month, which implies that the sector basically stagnated last month. That follows Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak manufacturing data, and adds to concerns that its economy is softening, It also suggests Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move to a more consumer-driven economy isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going as well as hoped. Investors are also (understandably) alarmed that North Korea is claiming to have detonated a hydrogen bomb overnight (live coverage of that drama is here). That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weighing on Asia markets, which are mostly in the red today, and driving up the US dollar. We get service sector data from across Europe this morning, which is likely to show that the slow recovery in the eurozone continued in December (with Germany doing rather better than France). The eurozone data comes in dribs-and-drabs from 8.15am to 9am GMT, with the UK services PMI at 9.30am. We then get the US services data at 3pm, after the monthly ADP report shows how many new private sector jobs were created last month. That will tee up Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Non-Farm Payroll (the broad measure of the American labour market). And in the City, investors will be chewing through Christmas trading figures from retail bellwether John Lewis, and Topps Tiles. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

In a move that motoring organisations said would trigger further cuts in petrol prices, the cost of Brent crude dropped by 5% during trading in London to stand at $34.60 (\u00c2\u00a323.66) a barrel. Share prices were also down, with London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 closing 64 points lower at 6,073 and New York\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dow Jones industrial average dropping below the 17,000 level in early trading. Oil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide began in east Asia, where Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to allow its currency, the yuan, to weaken prompted concerns in financial markets that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is performing much less strongly than suggested by official statistics.

Well, yes, but the NHS is also obliged to buy mental health services from outside when it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cope with demand itself. There would seem to be a real risk that the NHS ends up outsourcing to a highly concentrated market where it lacks pricing power. No wonder Acadia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, Joey Jacobs, likes the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153favourable industry dynamics\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the UK.</p> <p>If the opposition can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see the potential problem, the Competition and Markets Authority should.

The deal, unveiled earlier this week, is worth \u00c2\u00a31.28bn plus shares worth \u00c2\u00a3230m and looks very good point of the view of the seller, private equity group Advent International. But it raises competition issues \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and public policy questions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that are being ignored. Acadia already owns Partnerships in Care in the UK, a rival to Priory, which it bought for almost \u00c2\u00a3400m in June 2014. After the latest acquisition, Acadia will control about 50% of the independent \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or non-NHS \u00e2\u20ac\u201c market for psychiatric care in the UK. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the problem, it might be argued, won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the NHS still dominate the market? Well, yes, but the NHS is also obliged to buy mental health services from outside when it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cope with demand itself. There would seem to be a real risk that the NHS ends up outsourcing to a highly concentrated market where it lacks pricing power. No wonder Acadia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, Joey Jacobs, likes the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153favourable industry dynamics\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the UK. If the opposition can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see the potential problem, the Competition and Markets Authority should. Indeed, one hopes alarm bells are already ringing at the competition regulator.",

The market turmoil and the yuan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s depreciation have fanned fears that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowdown will be more pronounced than policymakers have warned. The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has said it expects growth in 2015 to be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/25/chinese-premier-7-percent-growth-target\">the slowest for a quarter of a century</a>.</p> <p>In the UK, the prospect of tougher export markets exacerbated worries about the economic outlook and traders pushed back their forecasts for an interest hike from the Bank of England this year. That helped knock the pound to its lowest level against the dollar since 2010, at $1.4530.</p> <p>There is a growing view that the Bank will hold off until at least late this year to start raising interest rates from the record low of 0.5%, where they have been since the financial crisis in 2009.</p> <p>One factor allowing Bank policymakers time to sit on their hands is low inflation, which has been close to zero for months, helped by a dramatic fall in global oil prices.

                "bodyText":"Chinese authorities sought to bring an end to new year stock market turmoil with a dramatic U-turn on a new mechanism that Beijing had hoped would prevent sharp selloffs. On Thursday, in a tacit admission that the new circuit breakers introduced only this week were having the opposite effect to that intended, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main stock exchanges said they were suspending the mechanism. The move came after the breaker was tripped for the second time in a week as the market fell 7% within half an hour of opening. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plunging share prices and the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s moves to guide its yuan currency lower sent shockwaves around already jittery global markets and, in a dramatic day of trading, \u00c2\u00a330bn was wiped off the FTSE 100 and oil prices hit fresh multiyear lows. As the UK chancellor, George Osborne, warned against complacency over the recovery, the pound tumbled to a five and a half year low against the dollar. Stock markets and Brent crude clawed back some ground after China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s circuit breaker announcement, but investors said the mood remained cautious after a torrid start to 2016 that has seen the FTSE 100 fall almost 5% this week and the Dow Jones industrial average in the US shed about 4%. The FTSE closed down almost 2% at 5,954 on Thursday. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at the Spreadex spread-betting firm, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While still pretty dire, the global indices appear to have been briefly calmed ... by news that China will be suspending the stock market circuit breaker rule that has wreaked such havoc this week,. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It seems that investors, for now at least, are taking the news as a positive, the move ostensibly preventing the panic-pause-more panic pattern that appeared in the Chinese markets on Monday and Thursday from repeating itself. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the theory, at least; we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll just have to see how it works in practice.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The circuit breaker announcement followed a string of ill-fated moves by China to curb volatility on its stock markets and shore up faltering economic growth. Interest-rate cuts, currency interventions and stock market reforms over the past year have failed to restore international confidence in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-largest economy. A spokesman for the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The circuit breaker mechanism was not the main reason for the market slump. It just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work as anticipated based on actual situations. The negative effect of the mechanism outweighed its positive effect.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In a sign of rising concern over flagging exports, China allowed its yuan currency to depreciate further and currencies in neighbouring markets also weakened. While stock market moves have little impact on the strength of the real economy, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency moves were more concerning, analysts said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Talk of China exporting deflation has returned, together with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153they must have seen something bad in the economic data\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, said Ian Kernohan, an economist at Royal London Asset Management. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With the economic data likely to be more difficult to read during the first quarter, thanks to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s New Year holiday, greater clarity on currency policy will be needed to calm markets.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chinese stock markets have been hit this week by a mix of weaker economic data and the prospect of a ban on share sales by major stakeholders being lifted. The market turmoil and the yuan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s depreciation have fanned fears that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowdown will be more pronounced than policymakers have warned. The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has said it expects growth in 2015 to be the slowest for a quarter of a century. In the UK, the prospect of tougher export markets exacerbated worries about the economic outlook and traders pushed back their forecasts for an interest hike from the Bank of England this year. That helped knock the pound to its lowest level against the dollar since 2010, at $1.4530. There is a growing view that the Bank will hold off until at least late this year to start raising interest rates from the record low of 0.5%, where they have been since the financial crisis in 2009. One factor allowing Bank policymakers time to sit on their hands is low inflation, which has been close to zero for months, helped by a dramatic fall in global oil prices. On Thursday, US figures showing oil production had risen added to worries about a supply glut and Brent crude fell to its lowest for almost 12 years. It hit $32.16 per barrel at one point, before recovering in later trading to around $34. Before a sombre speech on the economic outlook, Osborne said the UK should be ready for higher borrowing costs, which he described as a sign of a strong economy, as cited by the US Federal Reserve when it hiked rates in America last month. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got to be ready. But ultimately, if and when interest rates go up, that will be a sign of a stronger economy that is normalising after the extraordinary crisis of seven or eight years ago,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told BBC radio. Osborne used his speech in Cardiff to warn of the risks to the UK from the shaky global economy, saying 2016 has opened with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dangerous cocktail of new threats\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, pointed to the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153failed economic policies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a cocktail of his own mixture\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.",

                "bodyText":"And finally, here are a few photos from Wall Street as traders digest the news that this has been the worst start to a new year in the Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history. Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brendan Mcdermid has really captured the mood: And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good time to wrap up. My colleagues in Asia will be at their desks in a couple of hours, ready to track the latest twists in this saga. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow morning too. Thanks, and goodnight. GW Confirmation that this has been a historically bad start to the year: The stock market turmoil makes the front page of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Times, and City AM: Investors on both sides of the Atlantic will head to bed tonight, wondering what drama will occur in China while they sleep. Bill Gross, the bond-trading expert (ex-Pimco, now Janus Capital), predicts another day of losses on the Shanghai market: Speaking on Bloomberg TV, Gross pointed to exchange traded funds (securities which track stock market indices): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Based upon the ETF in the United States, China is predicted to be down 5 percent or 6 percent\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6But China is an artificial market. All global markets are artificially based. And to the extent that we have a catharsis, I think, depends upon central banks basically giving up in terms of what they do. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to happen.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The VIX \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfear index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, which tracks volatility in the market, is up by a fifth today! That shows US investors are pretty worried right now. The Canadian stock market has also suffered a dose of the China blues. Toronto is now 20% below its record high in September 2014, dragged down by weakening natural resource stocks as emerging markets have hit trouble. Hello again. Wall Street has just closed for the night, and like Europe, the losses are pretty dramatic. The S&amp;P 500 - the broader measure of American stocks - shed over 2.3% by the end of trading. The Dow Jones industrial average suffered a similar decline, shedding 393 points to 16514. And the tech-focused Nasdaq is down 3%. That puts the Nasdaq in correction territory, ie: more than 10% below its recent high. CNBC reckons this is the worst start to the year for the Dow, ever! Finally, Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets have closed after a volatile day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading dominated by China. Despite a late recovery, the FTSE 100 has finished the day down 119 points, or 1.96%, at 5954. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a three-week low, which wipes around \u00c2\u00a330bn off the blue-chip index. Mining giants were the biggest casualties -- Anglo American lost 11% to a new record low, Glencore shed 8% and Antofagasta lost 5%. They tumbled at the start of trading, after London traders heard that the Chinese stock market had been suspended after 30 minutes, and remained in the red all day. The London stock market has now suffered its second-worst start to a new year since 1988 (only beaten by the end of the dot-com boom). Other European markets also posted heavy losses, although Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ditching of its stock market circuit breaker did bring some relief. The German DAX was the worst performer, as manufacturing firms were hit by fears that the global economy might be dragged down by China (bad for exports!). Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct says that the UK chancellor added to the gloom with a warning about the global economy. Suspension of trading in Chinese stocks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the second time in a week - is once again being eyed as the key driver behind the downside pressures after more Yuan devaluation hit local equities hard, although overtures from George Osborne that we should be bracing ourselves for interest rate hikes here in the UK are adding an extra layer of gloom to the equation. In London, mining stocks are once again suffering the most with what looks like an imminent hard landing for the economy in China \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and one that arguably can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be avoided with government intervention \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whilst Aberdeen Asset Management (-7.7%) is also struggling against the fact assets under management will we suffering in the wake of this Chinese downturn. And Wall Street remains in the red too -- the Dow is down 200 points, or 1.1%, right now. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good moment to pause the blog, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll update later with the Wall Street close (or if anything dramatic happens) The Economist have a corker of a story - Saudi Arabia is considering floating its state oil firm, Aramco. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the kingdom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy crown prince, Muhammad bin Salman, who also spoke about his plans to shake up its economy. A \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Thatcherite revolution\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, no less. A decision will be taken on whether to sell a slice of the company within months, and Prince Muhammad is keen, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I believe it is in the interest of the Saudi market, and it is in the interest of Aramco.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd If that happens, Aramco could become the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest listed company in the world - potentially worth trillions of dollars. Prince Muhammad also argued that Saudi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to break of diplomatic relations with Iran was designed to prevent tensions between the two countries escalating, and even touched on issues of human rights and gender equality (although progress remains glacial). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full transcript. Away from the turmoil in the global economy, there is bad news for workers at a long-standing Scottish knitwear company. The firm, Hawick Knitwear, has gone into administration with the loss of more than 120 jobs. Administrators are urging anyone interested in taking on the company to get in touch. Press Association has more details: Hawick Knitwear has a manufacturing heritage dating back to 1874 and administrators say they hope a buyer can be found. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finances have suffered from increasing production costs and reducing margins, while attempts to secure new investment have been unsuccessful. Recent mild winters have also led to a reduced demand for heavier winter garments. The firm employed 179 staff, of whom 123 have been made redundant. Local MSP John Lamont, who represents the area in the Scottish Assembly,called it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153devastating news\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is a massive shock to lose such a well-respected and big name as Hawick Knitwear.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Spreadex\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Connor Campbell confirms that Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s u-turn has brought some relief to the City. However, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet know how investors in China will react.... Whilst still pretty dire, the global indices appear to have been (briefly) calmed this afternoon by news that China will be suspending the stock market circuit breaker rule that has wreaked such havoc this week. It seems that investors, for now at least, are taking the news as a positive, the move ostensibly preventing the panic-pause-more panic pattern that appeared in the Chinese markets on Monday and Thursday from repeating itself. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the theory, at least; we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll just have to see how it works in practice tomorrow morning, as whilst the exacerbating nature of the circuit breaker rule may have been removed, the fear-inspiring issues currently scaring the bejesus out of investors remain unsolved. Four members of the FTSE 100 have now scrambled into positive territory, as the London market recovers some of its earlier losses: (hat-tip to the Telegraph\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tara Cunningham) In another surprise twist, Denmark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank just raised interest rates - at least for commercial banks. The move means that Danish commercial banks will only face a negative rate of -0.65% on money left at the central bank, up from -0.75%. It won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t affect individuals; the benchmark interest rate is still virtually zero (0.05%). China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to suspend its ill-fated circuit breaker system has been welcomed by the markets. In London, the FTSE 100 is clawing back some losses. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now down \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 121 points, or 2%, at 5957. That still wipes out \u00c2\u00a330bn of value, and puts the FTSE 100 at a three-week low. Wall Street is also relieved -- the Dow is now down 1.2%. Investors had been worried that the Chinese market might suffer another truncated session overnight, if investors raced to sell shares before the index hit the daily limit-down point. More reaction: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reminder of how the Chinese circuit breaker kicked into action today, triggering the shortest trading session ever (just 29 minutes!) Breaking news from China... the stock market regulator has apparently announced that it WILL suspend its stock market breaker rule. A sensible decision, as the rule has been tested and found wanting this week. Ouch. The Dow Jones industrial average has shed almost 300 points, or 1.7%. Every share is in the red: Hold onto your tin hats, folks. The New York opening bell is ringing, and shares are tumbling sharply. The Dow Jones industrial average has lost 1.25%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped over 2%. It will take a few minutes for Wall Street to calm down. But the news that the Chinese stock market was suspended after just 30 minutes earlier today is clearly alarming investors. Commodity prices are hitting new five-year lows, thanks to economic growth fears and the stronger dollar. Palladium is down 5% at $482 per ounce, its lowest level since August 2010. Zinc has hit a six-year low, and copper is also down. Could Beijing authorities ditch their circuit-breaker rule, following this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turmoil? Something certainly needs to be done. We saw today that the prospect of an immediate daily suspension if the market drops too much actually triggered a swift selloff (as investors dashed to get out while they can). The 5% trigger was hit after just 14 minute, followed by the 7% time-out once trading resumed. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a recipe for calm, rational trading. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is currently down 2.5%, or 152 points -- on track to hit a three-week low. If it falls much further, it would threaten the lows of last August, the last time China triggered a stock market rout: The US stock market is on track to hit a new three-month low, when trading begins in 40 minutes time: The China crisis is partly caused by Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy of pegging its currency against the US dollar, argues economist Sean Richards. A deeper analysis of the Chinese situation shows us that its own financial instabilities have been exacerbated by the strong US Dollar. This has been made worse by its decision to set its exchange-rate against it. Thus rather than drifting lower like virtually everyone else instead the pressure builds up, which it has tried to resist, but even with its sizeable currency reserves it has to give way every now and then. This then adds to the pressure as everybody concentrates on the decline in the reserves rather than the large amount left. Also I suspect that those in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153know\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd have been trying to get out of the Yuan before it falls further which only makes things worse. Got it in one... China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s international competitors will fear that Beijing is triggering a currency war, by allowing the yuan to hit a five-year low against the US dollar today. Andy Yu, senior economist at MNI Indicators, says other emerging market currencies will probably also weaken in response (reminder, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already weakened this year). \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A weaker yuan is a concern for emerging markets that compete directly with China in exports. The immediate upshot is that currencies in countries including South Korea, Thailand, the Philippines and Taiwan will continue to adjust downwards in response to yuan moves. That would push up debt repayments for countries who have borrowed in US dollars. But encouragingly, Yu reckons emerging markets have the firepower to ride out the crisis: On current evidence the risk of a full blown emerging markets crisis looks less likely with emerging economies having built up larger foreign exchange reserves and put in place far better external debt management. Still the situation bears close scrutiny and alongside continued Fed tightening this year will put pressure on emerging markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 currencies over 2016.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bad day for stock market bulls..... The Economist reckons China could trigger a repeat of the 1998 Asian crisis, rather than the 2008 vintage which George Soros fears. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its logic: If China devalues, then other Asian nations will come under pressure to follow suit, for fear of losing competitive position. That will trigger worries about those Asian companies that have borrowed in dollars. there could be banking issues in Asia. This is a potentially worrying scenario. Whether 2008 is the right parallel is another matter. If the bearish case does come true, then it sounds more like 1998 when a round of Asian devaluations was triggered by the realisation that growth had been fuelled by speculation. Western economies did manage to overcome that crisis. The real worry is that emerging countries are a lot more important for the global economy than they were back then. More here: Is this really 2008 all over again? Investor-turned-philanthropist George Soros has contributed to the gloom today, by claiming that we could face a repeat of the turmoil we experienced in 2008. Soros, who famously beat the Bank of England on Black Wednesday, told an audience in Sri Lanka that the current situation reminded him of the financial crisis seven years ago. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153China has a major adjustment problem. I would say it amounts to a crisis. When I look at the financial markets there is a serious challenge which reminds me of the crisis we had in 2008.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Alarming stuff. However, before you sell everything, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth remembering that Soros has previous form here. In 2011, he declared that the eurozone debt crisis was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more serious\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd than the 08 crash. European policymakers managed to avoid a Lehman Brothers-style moment, although obviously Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fixed. So Soros\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s words are worth taking seriously... Some Chinese companies could be forced into default if Beijing continues to devalue the yuan. So argues Danae Kyriakopoulou, senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research. She warns: Many Chinese corporates have taken on a lot of debt, some of it dollar-denominated. This exposure creates an important risk as the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China PBOC continues to allow the yuan to weaken. It is not far-fetched at this stage to draw comparisons with the Asian currency crises of 1998 that occurred as economies with high levels of dollar-denominated debts were forced to devalue. This, together with the commitment by the Chinese leadership to give market forces a greater say may mean that we will see many more corporate defaults in China this year. As covered earlier, Beijing has already spent half a trillion dollars propping up the yuan this year. It still has more than $3trn left to help engineer an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcorderly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 devaluation.... What. A. Morning. Nearly four hours after trading began, the FTSE 100 is still deep in the red as the latest crash in China spooks markets around the globe. The blue-chip index is currently down 2.65% or 160 points at 5912, its lowest level since mid December. That, by my calculations, wipes more than \u00c2\u00a340bn off the value of the 100 companies on the Footsie. A blow that will be shared by City traders, pension funds and small investors alike. Mining companies continue to suffer, on fears that the crisis in China will cause serious harm to the global economy. Anglo American, which produces iron ore, copper, nickel and coal, has slumped to another record low. Fund manager Aberdeen Asset Management is also being hit hard; it manages tens of billions of assets in emerging markets and in Asia. The news that the yuan hit a five-year low today - effectively a devaluation by Beijing - is also worrying investors. Jasper Lawler, analyst at CMC Markets, says: UK and European stocks are extending declines in one of the worst opening weeks for the year for stock markets in recent memory. China is at the top of a dizzying list of concerns for markets. And with oil hitting a fresh 11-year low, and the pound at its weakest since 2010, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plenty for investors to fret about. Connor Campbell of Spreadex sums up the mood: There have been painfully few chinks of light this morning, the markets covered in an almost impenetrable cloud of bearish fog. There are anxious faces on the Frankfurt stock market, as traders watched shares slide. The DAX index fell by over 3% this morning, dropping through the 10,000 point mark for the first time since October. German exporters such as BMW, Daimler, Volkswagen and ThyssenKrupp led the selloff, all falling by around 4%. They are all vulnerable to a sharp slowdown in the Chinese economy. Wall Street is expected to join the selloff when trading begins in three and a half-hours. The futures market suggest the Dow Jones industrial average will tumble by 2.5%, while the Nasdaq is heading for a 3.3% plunge. The pound appears to be suffering from the uncertainty over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s membership of the EU. Andy Scott, economist at currency firm HiFX, reckons Brexit risks are compounding the impact of the China crisis on the UK currency. He explains: Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline against a rising US Dollar has been accelerated by the risk-off mode this week that has investors seeking refuge in safe haven currencies including the US Dollar, Japanese Yen and the Swiss Franc. That can almost entirely be attributed to the Chinese central bank allowing its currency to weaken to its lowest level against the dollar in almost five years, fuelling speculation that the economy is slowing faster than official figures suggest. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Concerns over a Brexit and reduced bets that the Bank of England will hike rates any time soon have also weighed on Sterling. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Bank of England and the Chancellor have been quite vocal about risks facing the UK economy this year and the early signs are that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is weakening further, putting a bigger question mark over global growth And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why the pound is at a five and a half-year low of $1.456 today, as this chart shows: Veteran analyst David Buik, who has seen a few crashes in his time, says there is an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153acrid stench of fear\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the City and Canary Wharf. He adds: The start to the year has been metaphorical carnage as far as equities are concerned. China has set the agenda with two gargantuan falls this year, aided and abetted by oil falling to its lowest level in 12 years (-4% today) suggesting that investors are not happy campers! Panda bear market, anyone? We have a glimmer of good news - Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment crisis has eased a little. The eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobless rate dipped to 10.5% in November 2011, according to eurostat, which is the lowest since October 2011. That still leaves 16.924 million people out of work in the euro area, and 22.159 million in the wider European Union. So, still too high - and at risk of rising again if the global economy hits serious problems again.... China isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only developing economy to make a bad start to 2016. A swath of emerging market currencies have weakened since the start of the year, as investors fear that their economies will falter. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is sharing the pain: City traders may have now dried off after the early morning deluge, but their mood isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any sunnier. Brenda Kelly of London Capital Markets says: Not unlike the weather in London today, it never rains but it pours. While it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s said that the darkest hour is often before the dawn, nobody appears brave enough to involve themselves in risk assets this morning. She explains how the Chinese market suspension, the slump in crude oil, and the big drop in China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign exchange reserves are all causing alarm: The drop in oil prices and China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shanghai Composite once again triggering circuit breakers sees major European indexes under pressure while government bonds strengthen across the board. Trading in China stopped after 29 minutes amid the Shanghai\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Composite tumbled by 7.04%. Forex reserves in China are also lower than what were expected. At the end of December they stood at $3.33 trillion and given that the IMF has recently said that $2.6T is required to maintain the yuan fix, this worse than expected depletion is only bolstering negativity towards the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second biggest economy. A reminder of what triggered today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout: As if there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t already enough to worry about, China has revealed a record drop in its foreign exchange reserves. New data from the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China show that its FX reserves shrank by $107bn in December - the biggest monthly drop on record. It suggests that China was forced to use more firepower supporting the yuan last month, as capital flows out of the Chinese economy: Sterling has just hit its lowest level against the US dollar since the middle of 2010. The pound has lost half a cent against the greenback today, hitting $1.4561. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a five and a half-year low, taking us back to the uncertain times after the 2010 general election. Worried traders are piling money into the relative safety of the dollar. As this chart shows, the pound looks stronger against a basket of currencies: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccircuit breaker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is meant to avoid market volatility. It clearly doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. As it stands, if the market falls 5% then trading is suspended for everyone to calm down. It then reopens, allowing investors to recover their nerve. But as we saw today, a second wave of selling can quickly push the market down by 7% - which is the signal to end trading for the day. Mark Dampier, head of investment Research at Hargreaves Lansdown, says authorities need to accept that shares are simply overvalued: Some amazing events on the Chinese stock markets overnight with trading halted for the second time in a week, the second time this year after just 870 seconds of trading..... Clearly the circuit breaker is having the opposite affect to what is intended and is making things worse. It also stops the market having any chance of bouncing. Had it been introduced during 2015, it would have been triggered 20 times. The system doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work and until it is withdrawn or modified we can expect to see further use and perhaps shorter trading periods than we saw last night. The interference by the authorities is simply delaying the inevitable. The market needs to find its own level so we will see more volatility in global markets until it does. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff is causing a lot of angst in the City, and sending investors running for cover. Terry Torrison, managing director at Monaco-based McLaren Securities, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The extent of the slowdown in China is certainly a worry. Investor sentiment is very fragile at the moment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Andreas Clenow, hedge fund manager and chief investment officer at ACIES Asset Management, is equally alarmed: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s looking pretty ugly. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been scaling down equity positions. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to take a step back to re-evaluate the situation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (via Reuters) The Financial Times has a rather smuttier take on Marc Bolland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time at Marks &amp; Spencer: Good point, boss. Marks and Spencer is defying the global rout! Its shares are up 1.5%, making it the only riser on the FTSE 100. The City appears to be applauding the news that Marc Bolland is retiring. Joshua Raymond Chief Marketing Officer at XTB.com explains why: Bolland has been under intense pressure from major shareholders for his failure to grow the business. And when you look at their recent results, its easy to understand why Bolland had to go and the tough job his replacement, Mr Rowe now finds himself in. Somewhat paradoxically, I expect shareholders to react well to the news that Bolland will now depart after months of speculation. A drop of 5.8% in general merchandise is simply awful and at the bottom of market expectations. Whilst the firm did enjoy what it claimed was its best ever Christmas week for food sales, like for like food sales over the Q3 period grew 0.4%, which is disappointing though shows M&amp;S fared better than some of its competitors. Overall like for like UK sales fell 2.5%. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on Bolland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit: The Stoxx 600, which tracks the largest 600 companies across Europe, has fallen by 2.2% this morning. By my reckoning, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a three-month low: European markets are also being hit hard, as fears over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy ripple through global bourses. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX is leading the selloff, tumbling by 2.75% or 281 points to 9,932. Every share in Frankfurt is down, as investors fear that the powerhouse Eurozone economy will suffer if China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy hits serious trouble. The French CAC is close behind, down 2.2%. The FTSE 100 has tumbled by over 100 points at the start of trading, shedding almost 2% of its value. The blue-chip index is being dragged down by mining stocks, but every single share is in the red. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down 114 points, or 1.9%, right now. The slump in China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is one obvious factor - but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the only one. FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga says investors face a serious of concerns: Equity markets are continuing their steep losses as we enter the final part of the trading week with investor sentiment being pressured by various different factors. This includes the resumption of fears over global growth following weak data from China in the beginning of the year, while increased geo-political tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran and an unexpected nuclear test from North Korea have also encouraged investors to dodge away from riskier assets like stocks. Another threat to investor sentiment is the persistent and continued weakness in the commodity markets, which only today saw the price of oil falling to a fresh 11 year lows of $32.70 for the first time since 2004. Ding ding..... the European stock markets are open. Brace yourselves for a wave of selling..... If you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sell shares, you may as well crack on with the knitting..... Crude oil prices are taking another kicking, tumbling over 5% in early trading. Brent crude has plunged below $33/barrel for the first time since 2004. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently changing hands at just $32.25 per barrel, a new 11-year low. And US crude oil has also slumped by 5%, to $32.10 per barrel. The Chinese stock market really did suffer a precipitous decline today, triggering the circuit breaker that brought trading to a very early close: City traders are bracing for a grim start to trading - once they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve dried themselves (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wet today) Asian stock markets are a deep and grimy sea of red today, as fears over China rattle investors across the region. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei fell over 2%, shedding 423 points to close at 17,767 points. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now down 6.65% since the start of the year. The Hong Kong Hang Seng index is currently down 2.8%, Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s S&amp;P/ASX is down 2.2% , India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sensex has lost 1.9%. Chinese regulators held an emergency meeting today to discuss the crisis -- but they haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t taken any decision on new action, Bloomberg reports. From Beijing, my colleague Tom Phillips sums up the dramatic action in China today: China halted the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading within 30 minutes of opening on Thursday morning as shares plunged by more than 7% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c triggering an automatic \u00e2\u20ac\u0153circuit breaker\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and authorities accelerated the devaluation of the Chinese yuan. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recently installed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153circuit breaker\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd mechanism paused trading for 15 minutes after the CSI300 index fell 5% in the first 13 minutes of trading. On resumption of trading it fell further, triggering the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s halt. The CSI300 index finished down 7.2%, the SSE composite index fell 7.3% and Shenzhen dropped by 8.3%. Experts believe that the Chinese authorities may have to take fresh steps to prevent the rout deepening, Tom explains: Christopher Balding, a professor of finance and economics at Peking University\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s HSBC business school, said he expected more government action to halt the stock market drops, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153whether it is changing the circuit breakers, whether it is again intervening in the market, whether it is extending the ban on large selling by institutions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be surprised if they let this continue going down. By almost any measure, the Chinese stock market is pretty over valued and so you would be looking at a pretty significant fall to get back to a reasonable valuation. I would be surprised if they allowed it to move back to more appropriate levels.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u01532016 in China is getting off on the wrong foot.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full story: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no escape from the China crisis. Trading in Shanghai has been suspended for the second time this week, after its stock market plunged at the start of trading. Automatic circuit-breakers kicked in, leaving nervous investors cooling their heels, after shares in Chinese companies slumped by 7% at the start of trading. The selloff came as the yuan weakened further against the US dollar, fuelling concerns over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic situation. From Melbourne, analyst Angus Nicholson of trading firm IG explains: The great concern for global markets is that the dramatic pace of the currency devaluation seems to indicate a far greater weakness in the Chinese economy than is easily perceivable in its publicly released statistics. A lot of people in the market are speculating that this is primarily about boosting exports and stimulating the slowing economy. While this no doubt will help, the primary concern for the government is deflation. Asian markets tumbled following the developments in China, and European stocks are expected to fall heavily at the open too. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is expected to suffer a triple-digit loss: All in all, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great day for UK chancellor George Osborne is due to give a speech warning that Britain is vulnerable to problems in the global economy. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also be digesting financial results from UK retailers Marks &amp; Spencer and Poundland. The big news at 7am is that M&amp;S\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO Marc Bolland is stepping down, after six tricky years at the helm (statement here). Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look great, frankly, with sales of general merchandise down 5% over the crucial Christmas period....",

                "bodyText":"Stock markets in Asia Pacific have experienced a day of wild trading after Beijing allowed its currency to strengthen and mustered \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the national team\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of central and state-owned banks to avoid sharp selloffs. Chinese stocks initially jumped by more than 2% after markets opened on Friday morning but then swung back down by as much as 4% before rebounding. By the lunchtime trading break the Shenzhen Composite Index was up 1.65% at 1,990.34 and the Shanghai Composite Index was up 2.39% at 3,199.57.99. Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng was up 1.22% at 20,580.43, according to the South China Morning Post. Angus Nicholson, a markets analyst from IG, said the rebound appeared to be the result of government intervention to prevent a repeat of Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turbulence when trading was halted after less than 30 minutes when stocks plunged by more than 7%. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The big thing [is] that we have seen the Chinese government rallying the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnational team forces\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in both the currency market and the equities market,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said, as traders reported the state-owned banks intervening to prop up the yuan. However, other markets continued to suffer. The Nikkei average in Japan was down 0.46% while the Australian market closed down 0.39% to end a sixth straight day in the red. The latest bout of stock market turmoil presents a major challenge to the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, who has spun himself as the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top economic steward, ahead of the prime minister, Li Keqiang. Xi was reportedly livid over a humiliating stock market debacle in mid-2015, lambasting senior economic officials after he appeared on the front cover of the Economist fighting to prop up Chinese shares. Experts say the credibility of Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic policymakers has been further damaged by the latest week of financial turmoil. The Japanese finance minister Taro Aso questioned whether Beijing could afford to keep supporting the yuan in light of its record decline in foreign reserves last month. On Friday morning there were unconfirmed reports that Xiao Gang, the head of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), was set to resign. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Chinese authorities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ability to manage the capital markets and their currency has been greatly dented this week because they put into place what turned out to be very badly thought out new regulations for the capital markets that have only added to volatility,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Nicholson. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think the markets are still waiting to see what happens next week and how determined the Chinese government will be in intervening in both the equity and currency markets, to try and manage both of them. Any sort of rebound in global equities \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a major rebound at least \u00e2\u20ac\u201c will probably be delayed until you do see a significant and continued intervention by the Chinese authorities in both the currency and the equity markets.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Christopher Balding, a professor of finance and economics at Peking University\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s HSBC business school, said Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic flip-flopping and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wild swings in policymaking\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd had severely damaged confidence. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Chinese investors want very similar things that international investors want: they want clarity, they want to understand what is going on, they want to know what the policies are, they want stability and [to know] what the rules are,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The constant back-and-forth and changes just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t engender confidence that Beijing has really any idea what they are doing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The depreciation of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency, the yuan or renminbi, has spooked investors and fuelled capital flight out of China. A dramatic day of global trading on Thursday saw \u00c2\u00a330bn wiped off the FTSE 100. On Friday morning China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank appeared to respond to investor concerns by fixing its currency higher against the US dollar with a midpoint range of 6.5636 per dollar. However, Nicholson said Beijing was now in a major fix. On one hand it wants to see the yuan weaken in order to boost flagging exports amid signs China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy was in far greater trouble than the government has admitted. On the other hand Beijing also desperately wants to avoid the global panic that the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s devaluation would spark. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is the dilemma they face,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to worry everybody and every time they devalue it causes panic globally.

The volatility and chaos caused by disappointing Chinese data and the failed attempt to control the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market with circuit breakers had sent investors running for the hills this week. But a 2% rise in the Chinese market earlier on Friday, following the abandonment of the circuit breakers and some support from the authorities for the yuan, gave some hope that a better day was in prospect.</p> <p>Better than expected US jobs figures put an end to that, prompting talk of further US rate rises and pushing the dollar higher, and by extension the oil price lower. With all the other geopolitical problems - North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible hydrogen bomb, tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran - as well as Chinese inflation data this Saturday, traders decided to take their money off the table ahead of the weekend.</p> <p>Market analyst Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A degree of calm in Chinese markets overnight has done little to placate sentiment, whilst better than expected employment data out of the US is also adding to woes. As global growth projections are trimmed whilst the Federal Reserve eyes the next interest rate hike, across the board it seems as if the economy will now face sustained headwinds.</p> </blockquote> <p>So Brent crude is currently down 1.6% at $33.18 a barrel, pushing commodity companies lower again. </p> <p>The FTSE 100 has lost nearly \u00c2\u00a385bn in value this week, recording its biggest weekly fall (5.28%) since August last year when the Chinese (yes, them again) sent ructions through global markets by devaluing the yuan.</p> <p>According to CNBC, the global market as measured by the S&amp;P Global Broad Market Index has lost more than $2trn this week. The final scores for the day showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 fell 41.64 points or 0.7% to 5912.44</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.31% to 9849.34</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 1.59% at 4333.76</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB lost 1.58% to 19,869.49</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 1.66% down 8909.2</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market is 0.81% lower at 585.98</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 62 points or 0.38%.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-568fddc9e4b0600201f49473\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-08T16:10:29.929Z\">4.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One of the reasons for the decline in markets since the initial enthusiasm for the US jobs data is the feeling that the strong figures make a rate rise more likely. The disappointing wages growth might mitigate against an early rise, but the general feeling seems to be that even dearer borrowing costs are now more likely. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Heading into the close, the FTSE 100 has given up all its gains for the day, finishing a tough week on a miserable note.</p> <p>After a passable performance overnight for the Chinese market, hopes were high that stock markets in Europe and the US could claw back some of their own losses. So far on this side of the pond, that has not been the case.</p> <p>Equity traders have been left bereft of reasons to be optimistic this week, and it looks like the China fears of the past few days will remain with us as we head into a new week. US job numbers kicked off 2016 in fine form, well ahead of estimates, but the lack of wage growth was the fly in the ointment. The fear now is that such good numbers, even with inflation worries, will encourage the Fed to continue with its planned four hikes this year, putting fresh pressure on equity markets.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-568fd732e4b0600201f49158\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/larryelliott\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-08T15:36:59.203Z\">3.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our economics editor Larry Elliott on the US jobs data:</p> <blockquote> <p>It seems just like the good old days. Almost <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/08/us-jobs-report-december-2015-economy-jobs\">300,000 jobs were added to payrolls in America in the last month of 2015</a>, continuing the upward trend of recent months. The US is once again living up to its reputation for being a gigantic jobs machine.</p> <p>Well, perhaps. Jobs are certainly being created at a good lick and the US has an unemployment rate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 5% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that the eurozone, at 10.5%, would die for. There are signs that people who had given up hope of finding work are being encouraged back into the labour market.</p> <p>Inevitably, this will lead to speculation that the Federal Reserve has left it too late to start raising interest rates and will now be forced to play catch up with a more rapid increase in the cost of borrowing than Wall Street is expecting. There is already talk of the Fed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/16/federal-reserve-us-interest-rate-rise-fed-funds-janet-yellen\">repeating December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate hike</a> in March.</p> <p>The markets may be getting ahead of themselves. Employment and unemployment are lagging indicators: they provide a guide to what has happened to an economy in the past rather than what is happening now or what will happen in the future. Some of the forward-looking indicators \u00e2\u20ac\u201c <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-idUSKBN0UI1GM20160104\">for manufacturing, for example</a> \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have been worryingly weak.</p> <p>The Fed will certainly be looking closely at the rate of job creation in the US, but it is equally interested in what is happening to wages. And the story here is that pay pressures are extremely muted.

Economist Nina Skero at the Centre for Economics and Business Research does expect a US rate rise, but perhaps not until the third quarter of the year:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Overall, the data add to the view that the US economic recovery steams ahead as wage gains and the unemployment rate approach long-run norms and as job creation figures, which admittedly can be rather volatile, remain high.</p> <p>In the aftermath of December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s historic Federal Open Market Committee decision and this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data releases perhaps the question on the minds of many is what is the future of US monetary policy? It is important to keep in mind that as one swallow does not a summer make, one rate hike does not a normalized monetary policy make. Even with the December rise interest rates in the US remain low and although the committee has restated its intention to maintain an accommodative monetary policy, it is reasonable to expect further hikes in 2016 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an expectation further strengthened by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong labour market data.</p> <p>However, this is not to say that sources of risk which could slow down the recovery do not exist, both domestically and globally. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour-market release shows a participation rate of 62.6% - well below pre-crisis levels. On the global front, equity markets turmoil and the slowdown in China are among the greatest concerns.</p> <p>The exact pace and extent of further interest rate hikes is difficult to predict given that the FOMC itself maintains that it is data-dependent and that it will continue to make interest rate decisions based on a series of indicators that it is monitoring rather than on a pre-set schedule.<br></p> <p>Keeping in mind that the US economy is expected to perform strongly in 2016, but also that December minutes show that the FOMC wants to observe the potentially delayed impact of the rate rise before making further hikes, Cebr expects interest rates to rise to 0.75% in the third quarter of 2016.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-568fcb71e4b0d22ca1a4bdb9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-08T14:48:50.060Z\">2.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s someone who thinks the Federal Reserve could raise US interest rates at its March meeting despite the uninspiring wage data</strong>. Harm Bandholz, chief US economist at UniCredit Research said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Average hourly earnings were only flat between November and December. But thanks to a positive basis effect, the year on year rate ticked up to 2.5% from 2.3%. But while the Fed has said at a number of recent occasions that it puts more emphasis on the actual development of inflation rates when determining the appropriate path for short-term interest rates, we think that the unambiguous display of strength in the labor market will continue to bolster the confidence of FOMC members that (a) consumer spending will continue to power the US economy ahead \u00e2\u20ac\u201c despite global headwinds, and (b) that faster wage gains will eventually lift domestic inflation rates. Accordingly, we continue to expect three rate hikes for 2016, with the next one coming at the March meeting.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the jobs numbers themselves he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To be sure, the labor market in the fourth quarter of 2015 most likely benefited from two special factors. First, there was a technical rebound in October, after the August and September numbers disappointed (in part due to seasonal adjustment issues). And in November and December, the unusually mild winter weather clearly supported employment in weather-sensitive areas, notably construction. </p> <p>There is, however, in our view no reason at all to question the underlying message of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and the previous couple of employment reports: The US labor market continues to be red-hot despite daily reports of global economic headwinds and financial market turmoil. The reason for this resilience \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as highlighted at several occasions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is that most of the value added and of the job creation in the US occurs in the services sector, which is barely affected by global developments. And this trend strengthened further in 2015. After in 2014 81% of jobs were created in services, this number rose to a whopping 94% in 2015; with another 10% coming from the construction sector! That leaves a very small share of the labor market exposed to the adverse impacts of global economic headwinds and low oil prices.</p> </blockquote> <p><a><br></a><br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-568fc8cee4b0d22ca1a4bc94\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-08T14:33:55.383Z\">2.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CapEconComms/statuses/685469021802754052\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Commodities?src=hash\">#Commodities</a> (even <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/gold?src=hash\">#gold</a>) unfazed by strong US jobs report: big <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFP?src=hash\">#NFP</a> gains suggest growth fears overdone, but wage data won&#39;t yet worry Fed.</p>&mdash; Capital Economics (@CapEconComms) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CapEconComms/status/685469021802754052\">January 8, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-568fc80ce4b0a0fd811ab3e7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-08T14:33:26.731Z\">2.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As expected after the better than expected US jobs figures, Wall Street has moved ahead in early trading.</p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average has added 110 points or 0.6% while the S&amp;P 500 is up 0.4% and the Nasdaq 0.7%.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-568fc6c2e4b0d22ca1a4bb9e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-08T14:25:24.886Z\">2.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story on the US non-farm payrolls:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/08/us-jobs-report-december-2015-economy-jobs\">US jobs report: economy adds 292,000 positions in strong finish to 2015</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-568fc645e4b0600201f48961\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-08T14:24:01.316Z\">2.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More detail on the US jobs:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad864c704d8e6ad72788ae6d2982e0a6fbc70031\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad864c704d8e6ad72788ae6d2982e0a6fbc70031/0_0_742_825/450.jpg\" alt=\"Job changes by sector\" width=\"450\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Job changes by sector</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bureau of Labor Statistics</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the mining sector, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Employment in mining continued to decline in December (-8,000).

The unemployment rate stood unchanged at 5.0%, still very low by any standards.</p> <p>One considerable disappointment in this survey, and perhaps a more important one as far as the pace of future fed hikes is concerned, is the wages figures. These grew at only a 2.5% year on year rise, and were flat over the month in December. Consensus had been looking for a modest 0.2% month on month increase, which would have taken wages into a range they had not inhabited since before the financial crisis. Instead, wages still seem to be struggling to rise. There was also no change in the average workweek, which tends to support the notion that wage pressures remain subdued, as increased hours frequently indicate a tight labour market and building wage pressures.</p> <p>Consequently, and even with the strong headline payrolls figure, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think these figures support a March rate hike, talk of which had been building over the past week following strong non-manufacturing ISM and ADP data.

The advanced economies faced similar challenges at corresponding stages in their development. But, in coping with the consequences of financial turbulence, the advanced economies often suffered significant losses of output relative to potential. The Beijing authorities are professedly seeking to change China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic growth model from one which depends on exports and capital investment to one more firmly based on domestic consumption. But they may be over-estimating the extent to which politicians can choose how their economies grow. Since curbing growth in some sectors is usually easier than boosting it in others, the danger is that the attempt to re-orient the economy will result in overall weaker growth This is one reason, which seems to be widely acknowledged, why China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future growth could well fall short not only of recent rates but even of the Beijing authorities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 more conservative projections for the years to come.</p> </blockquote> <p>Then there are the demographic problems, which prompted the abolition of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One child per family\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rule:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>By 2050, those aged 65 or over could well stand at 38% of the labour force, slightly less favourable even than Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s present ratio. There could be ameliorating circumstances for China. There may be scope for more migration from the countryside to urban centres without loss of agricultural production, though much less than there used to be. There will very likely be support to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP growth from a shift in the urban workforce from low-productivity activities to higher-productivity occupations. Further, China would perhaps be less opposed on cultural grounds than Japan to immigrant labour, though there have been no moves in that direction yet. Indeed, the ruling Communist Party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highly developed sense of self-preservation might be expected to resist any disturbance of the status quo. At the same time, in the nearer term, China faces a unique problem, the result of the recent abandonment of the one-child policy in favour of a two-child policy. To the extent that this measure is effective in raising the birth rate, it will temporarily boost the dependency ratio, that is, the proportion that the non-working population, old and young, bears to those of working age. Those who are working will need to increase their output merely to meet the needs of a growing non-active population. There will likely be a reduced margin of savings to finance capital investment and thereby to support future growth.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25487dc61504e9542d3be231ab3c4fbf9e895357\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25487dc61504e9542d3be231ab3c4fbf9e895357/0_0_2442_1616/1000.jpg\" alt=\"(FILES) This file handout picture taken and released by the Japan Coast Guard on December 22, 2015 shows a Chinese Coast Guard ship near disputed islets, known as the Senkaku islands in Japan and Diaoyu islands in China, in the East China Sea.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A photo released by the Japan Coast Guard on December 22, 2015 shows a Chinese Coast Guard ship near disputed islets, known as the Senkaku islands in Japan and Diaoyu islands in China, in the East China Sea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Japan Coast Guard/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the geopolitics,...</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The region is also a potential war-zone in a way that neither North America nor even Europe appears to be at the moment. Reports this week that North Korea has tested a hydrogen bomb is a reminder of the severity of the threat. Beyond the North Korean danger, both the East China Sea and the South China Sea are possible flashpoints. In the former area, there was a stand-off between Japan and China over the Senkaku (Diaoyu) islands through most of last year. But on 20 December an armed Chinese coast-guard vessel entered territorial waters that Japan claims around the islands. In response to these and other regional tensions, the Japanese government has proposed for the fiscal 2016/17 year a 1.5% increase in military spending to a highest-ever level. This is significant in view of the pressure to achieve reductions in other spending programmes. The Japanese government had been allowed, under the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s post-war constitution, the right of self-defence, which would have covered operations around the Senkaku islands, but Mr Abe nevertheless pressed for, and in September secured, an amendment that would allow Japan to afford military help to allies. This strongly suggests that the Abe government foresees the possibility of Japan taking part in the resistance to what several nations in the region regard as Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aggressive strategy in the South China Sea.</p> <p>It seems a long time since the Spratly islands first hit the headlines. It was as long ago as 1999 that a Filipino naval ship deliberately ran aground on one of those islands to establish a claim to the archipelago. Last year, in a dramatic development, it became clear that China was determinedly seeking to enforce its own title to the area when it built an artificial island on the foundation of the Mischief Reef and went on to claim, in contravention of UN rules, territorial waters around that construction. The US Navy has since sought to enforce freedom of the seas by disregarding China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretensions, thereby precipitating low-level exchanges with China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ships.</p> <p>Vietnam also believes it has interests to defend in the South China Sea. In an ominous development, its government announced on 23 December that it would be taking delivery from Russia of two more Kilo-class submarines to supplement the four it already deploys. These vessels are reckoned to be especially effective in relatively shallow waters (the Iranian navy has three of them). Vietnam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s army has put troop concentrations in the northern province on the border with China under \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchigh combat readiness\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This appears to be a defensive move. But investors should note that Vietnam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defence doctrine is not based on attacking China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s naval forces head-on, a contest that Vietnam could hardly expect to win. Rather, in the event of hostilities, the aim of the strategists in Hanoi would be to use the submarines to prey on merchant shipping heading to and from Chinese ports through the South China Sea. Their calculation is that the resulting prohibitive cost of freight insurance, or indeed the unwillingness of insurers to provide cover at all, would cripple China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade and economic activity. It could also topple China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial system, an objective looking less fanciful in the light of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s evidence of fragility. Given Vietnam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record in getting the better of super-powers, this strategic view should perhaps be taken more seriously than investors seem prepared to do at the moment.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-568fa252e4b0d22ca1a4aa7d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-08T12:01:06.930Z\">12.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drama in the City -- high street retailer Sports Direct has issued a profits warning.</strong></p> <p>The company admitted that it could miss its target of \u00c2\u00a3420m profits by up to \u00c2\u00a340m, following weak sales since its last financial results on 10 December.</p> <p>It blamed:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153a deterioration of trading conditions on the high street and a continuation of the unseasonal weather over the key Christmas period\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> </blockquote> <p>Shares are down around 5%, making it the biggest faller in London.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f46ae97d21919efe05fc646cb26f2acbfb880860\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f46ae97d21919efe05fc646cb26f2acbfb880860/0_0_689_367/500.jpg\" alt=\"Sports Direct share price today\" width=\"500\" height=\"266\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sports Direct share price today</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomson Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Several other retailers have blamed the warm weather recently - including Next and Marks &amp; Spencer.

                "bodyText":"And in Europe the FTSEurofirst 300 fell 7% over the course of the week, marking its worst weekly performance since August 2011 amid the eurozone crisis. On that, gloomy, note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close the blog after what has been a tumultuous week. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back on Monday to cover all the week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial developments. To add to the New Year market gloom, the FTSE 100 has made its worst weekly start to the year since 2000. The Dow Jones Industrial had already recorded its worst ever 4-day opening at the start of the year and the modest rise so far on Friday is unlikely to improve things, unless there is a major revival before the close. A poor week for global stock markets finished in negative fashion despite earlier hopes of a recovery. The volatility and chaos caused by disappointing Chinese data and the failed attempt to control the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market with circuit breakers had sent investors running for the hills this week. But a 2% rise in the Chinese market earlier on Friday, following the abandonment of the circuit breakers and some support from the authorities for the yuan, gave some hope that a better day was in prospect. Better than expected US jobs figures put an end to that, prompting talk of further US rate rises and pushing the dollar higher, and by extension the oil price lower. With all the other geopolitical problems - North Korea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible hydrogen bomb, tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran - as well as Chinese inflation data this Saturday, traders decided to take their money off the table ahead of the weekend. Market analyst Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said: A degree of calm in Chinese markets overnight has done little to placate sentiment, whilst better than expected employment data out of the US is also adding to woes. As global growth projections are trimmed whilst the Federal Reserve eyes the next interest rate hike, across the board it seems as if the economy will now face sustained headwinds. So Brent crude is currently down 1.6% at $33.18 a barrel, pushing commodity companies lower again. The FTSE 100 has lost nearly \u00c2\u00a385bn in value this week, recording its biggest weekly fall (5.28%) since August last year when the Chinese (yes, them again) sent ructions through global markets by devaluing the yuan. According to CNBC, the global market as measured by the S&amp;P Global Broad Market Index has lost more than $2trn this week. The final scores for the day showed: The FTSE 100 fell 41.64 points or 0.7% to 5912.44 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.31% to 9849.34 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 1.59% at 4333.76 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB lost 1.58% to 19,869.49 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 1.66% down 8909.2 In Greece, the Athens market is 0.81% lower at 585.98 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 62 points or 0.38%. One of the reasons for the decline in markets since the initial enthusiasm for the US jobs data is the feeling that the strong figures make a rate rise more likely. The disappointing wages growth might mitigate against an early rise, but the general feeling seems to be that even dearer borrowing costs are now more likely. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said: Heading into the close, the FTSE 100 has given up all its gains for the day, finishing a tough week on a miserable note. After a passable performance overnight for the Chinese market, hopes were high that stock markets in Europe and the US could claw back some of their own losses. So far on this side of the pond, that has not been the case. Equity traders have been left bereft of reasons to be optimistic this week, and it looks like the China fears of the past few days will remain with us as we head into a new week. US job numbers kicked off 2016 in fine form, well ahead of estimates, but the lack of wage growth was the fly in the ointment. The fear now is that such good numbers, even with inflation worries, will encourage the Fed to continue with its planned four hikes this year, putting fresh pressure on equity markets. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our economics editor Larry Elliott on the US jobs data: It seems just like the good old days. Almost 300,000 jobs were added to payrolls in America in the last month of 2015, continuing the upward trend of recent months. The US is once again living up to its reputation for being a gigantic jobs machine. Well, perhaps. Jobs are certainly being created at a good lick and the US has an unemployment rate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 5% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that the eurozone, at 10.5%, would die for. There are signs that people who had given up hope of finding work are being encouraged back into the labour market. Inevitably, this will lead to speculation that the Federal Reserve has left it too late to start raising interest rates and will now be forced to play catch up with a more rapid increase in the cost of borrowing than Wall Street is expecting. There is already talk of the Fed repeating December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate hike in March. The markets may be getting ahead of themselves. Employment and unemployment are lagging indicators: they provide a guide to what has happened to an economy in the past rather than what is happening now or what will happen in the future. Some of the forward-looking indicators \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for manufacturing, for example \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have been worryingly weak. The Fed will certainly be looking closely at the rate of job creation in the US, but it is equally interested in what is happening to wages. And the story here is that pay pressures are extremely muted. Average hourly earnings were flat in December and were up by just 2.5% over the year as a whole, a much weaker outcome than Wall Street had been anticipating. His full analysis is here: Markets are flagging after the initial burst of enthusiasm following the US jobs data. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now up 51 points, the FTSE 100 is just 2 points higher while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is down 42 points. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Initially buoyed by a bombastic non-farm figure the global indices couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sustain their surge, the US open ending up not being the white knight the European markets were looking for. Perhaps the superb non-farm figure (at 292,000 against the 203,000 expected and an upwards revised 252,000 last month) was tempered by falling wage growth (at 0.0% against the 0.2% forecast) and an unchanged unemployment rate. Or perhaps investors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t willing to take too much risk into the weekend, especially with the prospect of another awful start to Monday on the cards. Either way the Dow couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t manage to match the gains its futures were promising, at points flagging in the same way the European indices have done for much of the day. Chinese inflation figures are due over the weekend which could prompt further market ructions next week, given what has happened in the past few days. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something to put the latest US jobs figures in context: Back with China, and here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a graphic showing all the recent intervention in the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market: IG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Joshua Mahony is not surprised by the fluctuations in the dollar following the non-farm payroll report: But not everyone agrees. Economist Nina Skero at the Centre for Economics and Business Research does expect a US rate rise, but perhaps not until the third quarter of the year: Overall, the data add to the view that the US economic recovery steams ahead as wage gains and the unemployment rate approach long-run norms and as job creation figures, which admittedly can be rather volatile, remain high. In the aftermath of December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s historic Federal Open Market Committee decision and this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data releases perhaps the question on the minds of many is what is the future of US monetary policy? It is important to keep in mind that as one swallow does not a summer make, one rate hike does not a normalized monetary policy make. Even with the December rise interest rates in the US remain low and although the committee has restated its intention to maintain an accommodative monetary policy, it is reasonable to expect further hikes in 2016 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an expectation further strengthened by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong labour market data. However, this is not to say that sources of risk which could slow down the recovery do not exist, both domestically and globally. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour-market release shows a participation rate of 62.6% - well below pre-crisis levels. On the global front, equity markets turmoil and the slowdown in China are among the greatest concerns. The exact pace and extent of further interest rate hikes is difficult to predict given that the FOMC itself maintains that it is data-dependent and that it will continue to make interest rate decisions based on a series of indicators that it is monitoring rather than on a pre-set schedule. Keeping in mind that the US economy is expected to perform strongly in 2016, but also that December minutes show that the FOMC wants to observe the potentially delayed impact of the rate rise before making further hikes, Cebr expects interest rates to rise to 0.75% in the third quarter of 2016. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s someone who thinks the Federal Reserve could raise US interest rates at its March meeting despite the uninspiring wage data. Harm Bandholz, chief US economist at UniCredit Research said: Average hourly earnings were only flat between November and December. But thanks to a positive basis effect, the year on year rate ticked up to 2.5% from 2.3%. But while the Fed has said at a number of recent occasions that it puts more emphasis on the actual development of inflation rates when determining the appropriate path for short-term interest rates, we think that the unambiguous display of strength in the labor market will continue to bolster the confidence of FOMC members that (a) consumer spending will continue to power the US economy ahead \u00e2\u20ac\u201c despite global headwinds, and (b) that faster wage gains will eventually lift domestic inflation rates. Accordingly, we continue to expect three rate hikes for 2016, with the next one coming at the March meeting. On the jobs numbers themselves he said: To be sure, the labor market in the fourth quarter of 2015 most likely benefited from two special factors. First, there was a technical rebound in October, after the August and September numbers disappointed (in part due to seasonal adjustment issues). And in November and December, the unusually mild winter weather clearly supported employment in weather-sensitive areas, notably construction. There is, however, in our view no reason at all to question the underlying message of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and the previous couple of employment reports: The US labor market continues to be red-hot despite daily reports of global economic headwinds and financial market turmoil. The reason for this resilience \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as highlighted at several occasions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is that most of the value added and of the job creation in the US occurs in the services sector, which is barely affected by global developments. And this trend strengthened further in 2015. After in 2014 81% of jobs were created in services, this number rose to a whopping 94% in 2015; with another 10% coming from the construction sector! That leaves a very small share of the labor market exposed to the adverse impacts of global economic headwinds and low oil prices. As expected after the better than expected US jobs figures, Wall Street has moved ahead in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has added 110 points or 0.6% while the S&amp;P 500 is up 0.4% and the Nasdaq 0.7%. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story on the US non-farm payrolls: More detail on the US jobs: On the mining sector, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said: Employment in mining continued to decline in December (-8,000). After adding 41,000 jobs in 2014, mining lost 129,000 jobs in 2015, with most of the loss in support activities for mining. Further consideration of the wages data - and the implications for the Federal Reserve to hold fire on another rate rise - has seen the dollar lose some of its initial strength in the wake of the figures. Against the pound, the US currency is at $1.4572 compared to $1.4556 earlier. On the wages figures, Alex Lydall at Foenix Partners said: Not all components were positive in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s payroll print with Average Hourly Earnings being a particular concern falling 0.2% below forecasts. More jobs being created can only be seen as good news, but with hourly earnings lagging, labour cost inflation is still a slight concern to Janet Yellen. The strong payrolls number has vindicated the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to raise rates in December, said Rob Carnell at ING Bank, but the next increase may not come until June. He said: However, aside from this strong headline, there is not much else to get too excited about. The unemployment rate stood unchanged at 5.0%, still very low by any standards. One considerable disappointment in this survey, and perhaps a more important one as far as the pace of future fed hikes is concerned, is the wages figures. These grew at only a 2.5% year on year rise, and were flat over the month in December. Consensus had been looking for a modest 0.2% month on month increase, which would have taken wages into a range they had not inhabited since before the financial crisis. Instead, wages still seem to be struggling to rise. There was also no change in the average workweek, which tends to support the notion that wage pressures remain subdued, as increased hours frequently indicate a tight labour market and building wage pressures. Consequently, and even with the strong headline payrolls figure, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think these figures support a March rate hike, talk of which had been building over the past week following strong non-manufacturing ISM and ADP data. Our house forecast for the next hike in June is still, we think, a more likely outcome. Wages in the US were also on the rise, the figures show, but perhaps not enough for another interest rate hike at the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next meeting. The year on year gain was 2.5% in December compares to 2.3% in November, and is expected to pick up further as employment increases. However the average hourly earnings figure dropped a cent in December. The full US jobs report is here. Here are the charts showing the US job gains and unemployment rate: The jobs data may well have vindicated the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate decision, but there is no reason to be complacent, suggests Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com. He said: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s far too soon to know definitively if Fed Chair Janet Yellen and Co. made the right decision in raising interest rates last month. However, December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s well above expected non-farm payroll figures will confirm her assessment that the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest economy is in rude health. Despite the positive jobs figures, there are plenty of challenges on the horizon for Yellen to navigate, not least depressed oil prices and the Chinese economy playing havoc with exchanges the world over. Observers will be hoping that next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US retail sales figures show a bumper holiday trading period. The better than expected US jobs data could well prompt further rate rises this year, and this has pushed the dollar higher again. Sterling has hit the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s low of $1.4556 , down from $1.4590 beforehand, while the euro has fallen around 1%. Markets seem to like the news. The FTSE 100 is now up 47 points and is back over 6000, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has climbed 0.3% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has come off its lows, down 0.16%. US futures are now showing a 147 point opening on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The jobless rate however has come in line with forecasts at 5%. November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs figure has been revised up from 211,000 to 252,000 and October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s from 298,000 to 307,000. The non-farm payroll numbers for December showed a 292,000 rise compared to expectations of 200,000. That seems to back up the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to raise interest rates last month. Our Financial editor, Nils Pratley, has kicked the tires on Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit warning. His verdict - the City is changing its view of Mike Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s empire, fast. And can the weather really be blamed? Should a mild winter really upset trading at a sportswear chain? Sports Direct is not in the coats and jumpers business in the way that Marks &amp; Spencer and Next are. Warm temperatures, in theory, might even encourage better sales of trainers and tracksuits than freezing conditions. Doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Sports Direct have a strong online business to capture the switch to online shopping? And surely the weather hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t changed radically since management said four weeks ago it remained confident of achieving top-line profits of \u00c2\u00a3420m in the current financial year; now it says anything between \u00c2\u00a3380m and \u00c2\u00a3420m is possible. After this turbulent week, many in the City and on Wall Street just hope the US jobs report will be undramatic: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nearly time for the final major piece of economic data of the week -- the latest US jobs report for December. Economists expect around 200,000 new jobs were created last month: On a normal week, the Non-Farm Payroll is the main event. Today, it feels less important compared to the ructions over China. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also slightly less dramatic, given that the Federal Reserve took the plunge and raised interest rates last month. Of course, if Non-Farm is much weaker than expected, it could fuel concerns that the Fed hiked too early. Ransquawk have helpfully rounded up the Wall Street guesstimates: Wise heads in the City say that we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fixate on the exchange rate between the yuan and the US dollar. Instead, we should look at how the yuan is shaping up against a basket of other currencies (who will also have suffered from the stronger dollar too) And as these charts shows, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency has been more stable on this basis:: So, the time to panic might be when the trade-weighed yuan dives, as that would suggest Beijing was struggling to handle the situation. Senior City economist Stephen Lewis has issued a long note on China today, explaining why there is such anxiety about China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stability, and the consequences for the global economy if things turn very sour. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve cropped out some highlights below, as it provides some useful insight into the situation. Lewis points out that Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to rebalance its economy away from manufacturing and into consumption will inevitably hurt growth: It should be no surprise that a rapidly growing industrial economy such as China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is drifting into choppy financial waters. The advanced economies faced similar challenges at corresponding stages in their development. But, in coping with the consequences of financial turbulence, the advanced economies often suffered significant losses of output relative to potential. The Beijing authorities are professedly seeking to change China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic growth model from one which depends on exports and capital investment to one more firmly based on domestic consumption. But they may be over-estimating the extent to which politicians can choose how their economies grow. Since curbing growth in some sectors is usually easier than boosting it in others, the danger is that the attempt to re-orient the economy will result in overall weaker growth This is one reason, which seems to be widely acknowledged, why China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future growth could well fall short not only of recent rates but even of the Beijing authorities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 more conservative projections for the years to come. Then there are the demographic problems, which prompted the abolition of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One child per family\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rule: By 2050, those aged 65 or over could well stand at 38% of the labour force, slightly less favourable even than Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s present ratio. There could be ameliorating circumstances for China. There may be scope for more migration from the countryside to urban centres without loss of agricultural production, though much less than there used to be. There will very likely be support to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP growth from a shift in the urban workforce from low-productivity activities to higher-productivity occupations. Further, China would perhaps be less opposed on cultural grounds than Japan to immigrant labour, though there have been no moves in that direction yet. Indeed, the ruling Communist Party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highly developed sense of self-preservation might be expected to resist any disturbance of the status quo. At the same time, in the nearer term, China faces a unique problem, the result of the recent abandonment of the one-child policy in favour of a two-child policy. To the extent that this measure is effective in raising the birth rate, it will temporarily boost the dependency ratio, that is, the proportion that the non-working population, old and young, bears to those of working age. Those who are working will need to increase their output merely to meet the needs of a growing non-active population. There will likely be a reduced margin of savings to finance capital investment and thereby to support future growth. And then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the geopolitics,... The region is also a potential war-zone in a way that neither North America nor even Europe appears to be at the moment. Reports this week that North Korea has tested a hydrogen bomb is a reminder of the severity of the threat. Beyond the North Korean danger, both the East China Sea and the South China Sea are possible flashpoints. In the former area, there was a stand-off between Japan and China over the Senkaku (Diaoyu) islands through most of last year. But on 20 December an armed Chinese coast-guard vessel entered territorial waters that Japan claims around the islands. In response to these and other regional tensions, the Japanese government has proposed for the fiscal 2016/17 year a 1.5% increase in military spending to a highest-ever level. This is significant in view of the pressure to achieve reductions in other spending programmes. The Japanese government had been allowed, under the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s post-war constitution, the right of self-defence, which would have covered operations around the Senkaku islands, but Mr Abe nevertheless pressed for, and in September secured, an amendment that would allow Japan to afford military help to allies. This strongly suggests that the Abe government foresees the possibility of Japan taking part in the resistance to what several nations in the region regard as Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aggressive strategy in the South China Sea. It seems a long time since the Spratly islands first hit the headlines. It was as long ago as 1999 that a Filipino naval ship deliberately ran aground on one of those islands to establish a claim to the archipelago. Last year, in a dramatic development, it became clear that China was determinedly seeking to enforce its own title to the area when it built an artificial island on the foundation of the Mischief Reef and went on to claim, in contravention of UN rules, territorial waters around that construction. The US Navy has since sought to enforce freedom of the seas by disregarding China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretensions, thereby precipitating low-level exchanges with China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ships. Vietnam also believes it has interests to defend in the South China Sea. In an ominous development, its government announced on 23 December that it would be taking delivery from Russia of two more Kilo-class submarines to supplement the four it already deploys. These vessels are reckoned to be especially effective in relatively shallow waters (the Iranian navy has three of them). Vietnam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s army has put troop concentrations in the northern province on the border with China under \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchigh combat readiness\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This appears to be a defensive move. But investors should note that Vietnam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defence doctrine is not based on attacking China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s naval forces head-on, a contest that Vietnam could hardly expect to win. Rather, in the event of hostilities, the aim of the strategists in Hanoi would be to use the submarines to prey on merchant shipping heading to and from Chinese ports through the South China Sea. Their calculation is that the resulting prohibitive cost of freight insurance, or indeed the unwillingness of insurers to provide cover at all, would cripple China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade and economic activity. It could also topple China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial system, an objective looking less fanciful in the light of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s evidence of fragility. Given Vietnam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record in getting the better of super-powers, this strategic view should perhaps be taken more seriously than investors seem prepared to do at the moment. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drama in the City -- high street retailer Sports Direct has issued a profits warning. The company admitted that it could miss its target of \u00c2\u00a3420m profits by up to \u00c2\u00a340m, following weak sales since its last financial results on 10 December. It blamed: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a deterioration of trading conditions on the high street and a continuation of the unseasonal weather over the key Christmas period\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Shares are down around 5%, making it the biggest faller in London. Several other retailers have blamed the warm weather recently - including Next and Marks &amp; Spencer. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very plausible that demand for Sports Direct parka coats have fallen recently. But demand for other kit might have softened the blow? A month ago, The Guardian exposed working conditions at Sports Direct, where workers are chivvied by tannoy to work faster, and underwent searches after their shift was over. With trading conditions worsening, the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shareholders have a lot to ponder... The European stock market rally is petering out. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is now in the red today: Now this is interesting.. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s centraal bank has issued a statement, pledging to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153further liberalise\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd interest rates. Reuters has more details: The central bank also said it would make the yuan more international, keep the currency basically stable, further improve the currency formation mechanism and deepen reforms of the foreign exchange management system and financial institutions. The central bank will use medium-term loans, and pledged supplementary loans and credit policies to support key areas of the economy. The central bank also said it would maintain prudent monetary policy and flexibly use monetary policy tools to keep adequate liquidity in the banking system. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just tuning in, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what you need to know.... A sense of calm has returned to global stock markets today, following the worst start to a new year on record. But China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy remains a big fear, that could well dominate most of this year. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market has stabilised, closing 2% higher. Beijing authorities are thought to have been buying up shares, in an attempt to restore confidence. Traders were also encouraged that the yuan was fixed at a higher level today, easing fears of a currency war.But confidence in the Chinese authorities has been hit by this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drama: Christopher Balding, a professor of finance and economics at Peking University\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s HSBC business school, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Chinese investors want very similar things that international investors want: they want clarity, they want to understand what is going on, they want to know what the policies are, they want stability and [to know] what the rules are. The constant back-and-forth and changes just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t engender confidence that Beijing has really any idea what they are doing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: European stocks are all in the green today, ending a wild week on a stronger note. Jasper Lawler of CMC Market says: A rebound in Chinese shares and the price of oil provided some relief for shares in Europe on Friday after a brutal first week of the year. But despite the recovery, world markets have still suffered a remarkably poor start to the year. $4trn has been wiped off global shares, according to Bloomberg A handy reminder of how markets began 2016: When financial historians look back at this period, they will probably conclude that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ill-fated and short-lived circuit breaker was not the best idea ever created. It was meant to prevent mayhem, by briefly suspending trading when the market fell 5% and closing it off for the day if it lost another 2%. But as we saw on Monday, and Thursday, it actually sparked crashes as investors rushed to sell shares at the first sign that the market was going down. So, full credit to Beijing for culling it yesterday - a move that was immortalised by the FT: Alastair McCaig of IG says the abolishment of the circuit breaker helped Chinese shares to rise today. Human psychology has had a strong hand to play in the way Chinese markets have behaved. The removal of the system that suspends the market should it fall too much has, ironically, seen the fear of entrapment reduced with Asian investors. Britain could lose almost 1% of global economic output if China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy suffers a serious hard landing, according to analysis from Oxford Economics. And that would actually mean the UK gets off relatively lightly, compared to the pain which emerging markets would suffer. Over in Hong Kong, investors are catching their breath after the worst new year week since 2000. The Hang Seng index closed higher today, up 0.6%. But heavy losses earlier this week mean it lost 6.6% so far this year. Dr Nikos Paltalidis, lecturer in Finance at Durham University Business School, also reckons fears over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market are overblown. He points out that shares did soar by 50% last year - a clear sign of a speculative bubble that is now deflating. However, that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that the selloff won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cause serious consequences. Paltalidis says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The sudden wave of concern about China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s looming economic catastrophe is overblown. However, the burst of the stock market bubble, increases the concern about the knock on effect on the real-estate market. Chinese policymakers might need to respond with additional currency devaluation, and if things get worse, some form of quantitative easing, to avoid a collapse in asset prices. Despite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s small recovery, European stock markets are on track for their worst week since last August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout (which was also triggered by China). Richard Hunter, Head of Equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, says investors have adopted \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the brace position\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd this week:, wiping around 5% off the major indices. What should have been a perky start to 2016, with New Year optimism underpinned by portfolio positioning as investors buy stocks, has been eclipsed by ongoing concerns on global growth, the oil price and negative geopolitical developments. The general souring of sentiment had been exacerbated by the Chinese circuit breakers, along with Fed minutes which questioned the strength of belief in the December hike and sellers apparently pushing against an open door.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd One of Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top allies has called for calm over China. Speaking on Bloomberg TV a moment ago, Michael Fuchs argued that the panic over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets has been overdone. I do believe that China is getting back on track. It is still tracking a 7% growth rate - 7% growth is a decent number.... I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not so pessimistic that China is going to be in a deep crisis. But Fuchs also warned that German industry, such as car markets and chemicals producers, will suffer if China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy weakens. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sense of relief in the foreign exchange markets this morning, as emerging market currencies recover. Ilya Spivak, currency strategist at DailyFX, has the details: Investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 mood brightened after two days of aggressive selling after China suspended circuit-breakers that shut off stock market trade after just 14 minutes of activity yesterday and set the daily Yuan fix a bit higher. The risk-geared Australian, Canadian and New Zealand Dollars outperformed while the safety-linked Japanese Yen proved weakest on the session. In a few weeks Beijing will have a window of opportunity to take fresh steps to shore up its economy: After 30 minutes of trading, European markets are all showing small gains: This week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ructions have not improved Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation for economic competence. As Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services puts it: As we have argued before, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s authorities have clearly bitten far more than they can chew in their markets and economy reform efforts, with a clear sense that they are at best fumbling in the dark emerging. He also warns that the current calm in the markets is probably only \u00e2\u20ac\u0153transitory\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The oil price is rising this morning, in another signal that markets are a little calmer this morning. Brent crude has gained 1.5% to $34.26 per barrel, having hit fresh 11-year lows yesterday. Mining stocks are recovering some ground, with commodity trader Glencore up 2.3% and Rio Tinto up 1.5%. Again, a small move - as Accendo Markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Mike van Dulken points out: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets are open, and showing some small gains in early trading. The FTSE 100 has risen by 20 points, or 0.3%, to 5974, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX is 0.4% higher. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty small potatoes, given the Footsie lost 2% yesterday while the DAX shed 3%. How much market value has been destroyed in this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market rout? According to CNBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jacob Pramuk, we have lost.....(puts on Dr Evil voice) two trillion dollars! He explains: The S&amp;P Global Broad Market Index, which tracks global stock performance, has lost $2.23 trillion in market value this year. For perspective, the total trumps estimated U.S. student loan debt of more than $1 trillion and would represent roughly 12 percent of U.S. government debt. But that might not capture the full scale of the rout. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s widest measure of listed companies shows a four trillion dollar loss: The Financial Times also flags up that Beijing authorities appears to be buying shares today: By lunch time the indices were up, amid reports that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state-backed funds were once again buying up shares On Thursday the securities regulator said that its promulgation of permanent rules restricting stock sales by large shareholders did not indicate that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153national team\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is withdrawing from the market. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Its market stability function will not change,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the agency said. The statement marks a shift in tone from late August, when the regulator said that the national team would halt regular share purchases. More here: China markets motor higher in choppy trading Good morning from London, where City traders are arriving at their desks and looking nervously at developments in Asia overnight. And the latest news is that the Chinese market has just closed up for the day. The Shanghai composite index jumped 2%, or 61 points, to finish at 3,186 points, following the wild ride which Martin has been tracking through this blog. It does appear that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state-backed funds have been active in the market, buying up shares and giving retail investors a little confidence. Signs that Beijing has been intervening to support the yuan have helped shore up confidence too. Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to abandon China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new circuit-breaker rules has also paid off (they had been fuelling the crisis, as investors were rushing ditch shares before the market fell 7% and was shut for the day). But it really has been a turbulent start to the year. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has lost 10% of its value this week - the worst run since the Great Fall of China last summer. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for me to sign off from Sydney and pass you over seamlessly to Graeme Wearden in London for what should be an interesting day. Thanks for following us. While not a great start to the year for the Japanese market. This is how the European opening looks. Still a bit of a mixed bag. Associated Press has just put together a thought-provoking three reasons for concern about the Chinese economy. A tumbling currency which has unnerved world markets but which is probably up to 8% overvalued. Transition to an economy based less on cheap manufacturing and more on consumer spending and services. Mismanagement such as poor communication and bungled execution of policies such as the ill-fated \u00e2\u20ac\u0153circuit breaker\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd have aggravated an already worsening situation. Japan has just closed down at an estimated cost this week of $320bn in market capitalisation. Ouch. Better day so far in Shanghai and Shenzen as this chart on the CSI300. While this picture of the yuan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s devaluation tells us the story from a different angle. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153national team\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd appears to have steadied the economic ship after state intervention to prop up the yuan prompted a rally in Chinese stocks The bluechip CSI300 and the Shanghai Composite were up 3% in afternoon trade Elsewhere the Nikkei was down 0.45% and the Australian market finished 0.39% lower. Mixed picture from European futures trade ahead of the open Questions about sustainability of Chinese policy from Japanese finance minister Oil has risen off 12-year lows to $34.31 a barrel but key metals such as copper and nickel still suffering For a full story on the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s developments so far, my colleague Tom Phillips has just filed this report from Beijing: In another snippet from Tom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report, there are rumours that the head of the Chinese regulator, Xiao Gan, will be resigning tomorrow. IG analyst Angus Nicholson said in a note today that: Confidence in China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to manage their capital markets has only been further damaged after they announced the removal of their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153circuit breakers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after only being in place for four days (sending the market limit down 50% of the time) and rumours circulating that CSRC head Xiao Gang would be resigning tomorrow. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll try to find out more about that as the day goes on. In broader economic news, a strong jobs figure is expected from the US later today. The magnificently named non-farm payrolls are due on Friday lunchtime US time and are expected to show that employers likely maintained a fairly strong pace of hiring in December. Nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 200,000 jobs, just a slight step down from the 211,000 created in November, according to a Reuters survey of economists. That puts unemployment at around 5% and might further calm market nerves. Also to some extent justifies the Federal Reserve decision to tighten monetary policy last month. Back to the Beijing competence theme with the Wall Street Journal weighing in... The ASX/S&amp;P 200 index has closed below 5000 points after a sixth straight session in the red. The benchmark was 19.5 points, or 0.39%, lower at 4,990.8, while the broader All Ordinaries index was down 19.4 points, or 0.38 per cent, at 5,049.4, Australian Associated Press reports. My colleague in Beijing, Tom Phillips, says China has mustered the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153national team\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to fight to avoid the kind of stock market turmoil that left president Xi Jinping embarrassed last year. Tom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full report will be on the website soon but he quotes Christopher Balding, a professor of finance and economics at Peking University\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s HSBC Business School, saying that Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic flip-flopping and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wild swings in policymaking\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd had severely damaged confidence. Chinese investors want very similar things that international investors want: they want clarity, they want to understand what is going on, they want to know what the policies are, they want stability and [to know] what the rules are. The constant back-and-forth and changes just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t engender confidence that Beijing has really any idea what they are doing. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a European view: A couple of hours to go before trading opens in Europe and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a mixed picture about what is going to happen there. According to IG, the FTSE 100 will open up 13 points while the Dax in Geramy looks likely to open down 19 points. Some straighter business news out of China today shows that demand for electric cars is growing. BYD, a Chinese carmaker backed by Warren Buffett\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, raised its 2015 profit estimate to a five-year high, citing strong demand for its electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles, Reuters has reported. Government policy has helped boost demand, it said. Despite a slowing economy and volatile financial markets, Chinese automakers such as BYD and Geely Automobile Holdings have flagged bumper profits for 2015, boosted by favourable government policies and consumer preferences that stoked demand for their products. BYD said late on Thursday it expects net profit attributable to shareholders to climb between 518% and 557% for 2015, compared with an earlier forecast of a rise in the range of 435% to 481%. Nerves do seem to have been settled by the PBOC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s yuan intervention/fix policy. The steps today to fix the yuan firmer and then get state-owned banks to prop up the offshore yuan value look contradictory in the light of previous days\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 actions. But in the absence of the circuit breaker it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s done the trick for now. The CSI300 and Shanghai Comp have paused for lunch up 2.75% and 2.39% respectively. The Nikkei is up a smidgeon but the ASX is still trailing at 0.53% down But Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy still looks a bit cack-handed to some: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good day for charts. Expert opinion is quite divided about the state of play in China. Tian Weidong, analyst at Kaiyuan Securities in Shanghai put what might be described as the party line: The market is back to normal Investors can buy and sell as they wish. Under the circuit breaker mechanism, the market was suffocated. But other were a little more nuanced in their assessment of a day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading that hs seen the Chinese markets climb back into positive territory despite the lack of circuit breaker. Mohamed El-Erian, the chief economic adviser at Allianz, said China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to suspend a stock circuit breaker made sense, but the implementation and timing did not. China realized that it had very tight limits on the markets, he told Bloomberg, which did more harm than good. They realised this, which is good news. The bad news is they took it off at a very peculiar time and did so without a whole set of compensating measures. The mainland Chinese markets are coming up for their lunch break, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good time to check on the scoreboard. Asia Pacific markets are all up, except Australia. Nikkei up 0.39% (at lunch) CSI300 up 2.8% Shanghai Composite up 2.2% ASX/S&amp;P 200 down 0.43% Hang Seng up 2.2% Kospi up 0.08% Oil may have rallied a bit but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still a poor outlook for prices of other industrial commodities. London Copper has dropped 1% to $4,480 a tonne this afternoon, nearing 2009 lows. Nickel fell 2%, while lead and zinc eased nearly 1%. None of that is great for the Australian-Anglo mining behemoth BHP Billiton which is down again by 0.43% this afternoon on the Australian stock market. Rio Tinto, which is not exposed to oil prices in the same way, is up more than 1.5%. And Australian gold producers are doing well out of the chaos. The precious metal rose to a two-month high of $1,113.2, a gain of 4.9 percent so far this year. The Japanese finance minister Taro Aso has warned that the Chinese might find it hard to continue supporting the yuan given the decline in its foreign currency reserves revealed on Thursday. Aso said Tokyo that further declines could trigger further capital flight from China and potentially set off competitive currency devaluations in other countries. Foreign exchange reserves have already fallen this much due to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s purchases of yuan to support its own currency, so it could be difficult to continue. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign exchange reserves fell $512.66 billion in 2015 to $3.33 trillion, central bank data showed on Thursday. $107.9 billion was accounted for in December alone. Reuters quotes a trader at a European bank in Shanghai that state-owned banks were offering dollar liquidity at 6.59 yuan per dollar in an attempt to push it higher. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confused picture, not helped by the difference in the onshore and offshore value of the yuan. Reuters explains what happened after the PBOC set the yuan at 6.5636 today, with the currency moving towards that fix from an overnight close of 6.5929 backed by state-owned banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 intervention: The onshore yuan recovered to 6.5887 in morning trade, while the offshore yuan was about 1.4 percent weaker at 6.6798, narrowing a spread that reached around 2 percent a day earlier, making the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency management task more complicated. After its sharply lower fix on Thursday, the PBOC had later sown confusion by reportedly intervening heavily to defend the yuan in offshore trade, reversing a decline of more than 1 percent that took it to a record low of 6.7600 per dollar. That left dealers at a loss to know what the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aims were. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The sharp drop has led to speculation that China is letting go of the reins on the CNY (yuan), or perhaps targeting faster depreciation to reach an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcequilibrium\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 level,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd wrote analysts at Barclays, while conceding that no one was really sure. The Chinese central bank, the PBOC, is intervening to support the yuan, according to Reuters. The global oil benchmark, Brent crude, has rallied 2% today after China boosted the yuan. Brent had risen 56 cents to $34.31 a barrel as of 12.50 AEDT (0150 GMT), having hit $34.72 earlier. It settled down 48 cents at $33.75 in the previous session, after marking $32.16, a level last seen in April 2004. US crude was trading 63c higher at $33.90 a barrel. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not easy to keep track this morning but here are the main points. Asia Pacific has seen wild trading on the main stock markets amid continued uncertainty and doubts about Chinese policy The People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to fix the yuan firmer initially boosted equities after a nervous start But trading has been volatile: Shanghai Composite and CSI300 index both more than 1% higher after first lurching up, then down. Nikkei up 0.3%; ASX/S&amp;P 200 down 0.5%; Kospi up 0.16%; Hang Seng up 1.09% Oil rises off 12-year lows $34.31 a barrel Aussie dollar rises, while Japanese yen drops Australian retail sales met expectations with 0.4% growth in November It should be said at this point that the volatility of the Chinese markets is much more significant for what it tells us about policy-making in Beijing than the intrinsic importance of the numbers. Most people accept that the share prices in China are totally overvalued and must be allowed to fall. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the disorderly manner in which this is happening which makes it interesting. My colleague Nils Pratley wrote on Monday that Beijing risked making the same mistakes this week as they did in the northern summer by stopping prices finding their natural level. Read what Nils had to say here. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty much come to pass: Are you keeping up at the back? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a confused picture today and no mistake. The chart in this tweet is quite helpful though. Thanks to Patrick McGee of the FT. Traders were following China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead upwards. But the Chinese markets are all over the place. After an early rally, the Shanghai Composite index and the CSI300 index of leading shares are heading south again. How low will they go? Decent Australian retail sales for November helped boost the ASX. They were up 0.4% boosted by a 1% rise in the cafes and restaurants category, yet proof if any were needed that Australians just love to eat out. Household goods sales increased by 0.9%. Total retail spending was $24.77bn in November, up from $24.66bn in October, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said. Stock markets have rallied across Asia Pacific. The Nikkei is down just 0.24%, while the ASX/S&amp;P 200 in Australia is now into positive territory. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the first time the PBOC has fixed the yuan stronger in nine days. A lower number equals a stronger fix because it relates to what it takes to buy one US dollar. The People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China set the midpoint rate at 6.5636 per dollar prior to market open, firmer than the previous fix of 6.5646, and firmer than the previous day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s closing quote 6.5929. That is the first time the PBOC has firmed the midpoint against the dollar in 9 trading days, after it allowed the biggest fall in the yuan in five months on Thursday, pressuring regional currencies and sending global stock markets tumbling as investors feared it would trigger competitive devaluations. The Australian dollar is an immediate beneficiary of this stronger yuan fix. The Aussie has gained almost half a cent in the last 10 minutes and is now buying US70.60c. Equities following upwards. The yuan fix is a good deal more stabilising than previous ones this week. Last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close was 6.5929 to the US dollar which means the PBOC has opted for a more confidence-boosting currency level for now. Yuan fixed at 6.5636 Only a few minutes before the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China announces today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fix for the yuan. A weaker than expected fix has twice triggered market crashes this week so this is going to be a key moment. Yesterday China published figures for foreign reserves which showed it was burning through cash to prop up the yuan. So will they stick or twist today? Good morning and welcome to the live blog. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been another lively morning on the financial markets and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tense ahead of the opening of the Chinese mainland markets at 12.30 AEDT. The Chinese regulator has scrapped its controversial \u00e2\u20ac\u0153circuit-breaker\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd mechanism which has been triggered twice this week when losses hit 7%, forcing the markets to cease trading. Added to the continued devaluation of the yuan, traders around the world have drawn the conclusion that the Chinese authorities know something about the state of their economy that fairly rosy official figures are not showing. So will prices be allowed to fall to a fair value after six months of restrictions on sales? Or will the state instead intervene with mass buying of stocks? Perhaps they will try to moderate the yuan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent devaluation in order to boost confidence? Meanwhile, the market in Australia \u00e2\u20ac\u201c always the first major market to face the new ball, as it were \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has fallen more than 1%. More here:",

The price of Brent crude, the global benchmark, had risen more than 2% on Friday after China sought to boost the yuan, and its stock exchanges abandoned a new \u00e2\u20ac\u0153circuit breaker\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd mechanism that had been blamed for much of the stock market havoc. However, in an echo of the see-saw pattern in stock markets those gains were later erased and Brent was trading at about $33 a barrel, near a low hit in 2004. With worries about a global downturn intensifying, investors offloaded riskier shares and flocked to so-called safe-haven assets such as gold and government bonds. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So much for the new year bringing some relief to the markets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said credit strategists at the French bank Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Worries about China, the endless drop in oil prices and even new geopolitical tensions pounded the markets, punishing risk assets with a flight to quality that was in full swing,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd they wrote, in a research note entitled: What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Chinese for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ouch\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd? Chinese stock markets were suspended twice in a week after 7% falls tripped a new circuit breaker mechanism. It had been intended to stem sharp sell-offs but in the end appeared to have the opposite effect. In a dramatic U-turn, the mechanism was withdrawn just days after it had been introduced. Chinese stocks recovered by 2% on Friday after the yuan edged higher following days of depreciation that spooked investors and fuelled capital flight out of the country. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s removal of counter-productive circuit breakers, state buying and a rise in the yuan helped prevent another stock market rout and alleviated concerns that the central bank would continue the rapid devaluation of the currency.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd After a day of wild trading, the Shanghai composite index and the CSI 300, which comprises the biggest stocks from the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, finished about 2% higher, at 3,186.78 and 3,361.56 respectively. Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng added 0.6%. The latest bout of stock market turmoil presents a major challenge to the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, who has portayed himself as the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top economic steward, ahead of prime minister Li Keqiang. Xi was reportedly livid over a humiliating stock market debacle in mid-2015, lambasting senior economic officials after he appeared on the front cover of the Economist fighting to prop up Chinese shares.",

The general concerns about oversupply and lack of demand have been brought into focus by a Morgan Stanley report saying the oil price could fall to $20 a barrel, <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jan/11/china-stock-market-5-percent-europe-ftse-live#block-5693761de4b0f2d1f22c6dcd\">as mentioned earlier.</a></strong> The bank said crude could fall further due to devaluation of the Chinese currency:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In an oversupplied market, there is no intrinsic value for crude oil. The only guide posts are that the ceiling is set by producer hedging while the floor is set by investor and consumer appetite to buy. As a result, non-fundamental factors, such as the US dollar were arguably more important price drivers in 2015. In fact, when we assess the more than 30% decline in oil since early November, much of it is attributable to the appreciation in the trade-weighted US dollar.... With the oil market likely to remain oversupplied throughout 2016, we see no reason for this trading paradigm to change.</p> <p>Given the continued US dollar appreciation, $20-25 oil price scenarios are possible simply due to currency....For every 1% move in the trade-weighted US dollar, we tend to see a 2-4% move in Brent. Therefore, a 3.2% increase in the US dollar, as implied by a 15% yuan devaluation, could push down oil 6-15% ($2-5 a barrel), which could put oil in the high $20s. If other currencies move as well, the move in the US dollar and oil could be even greater. Hence, we remain bearish, even after the notable downward move already. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-01-11T16:28:51.078Z\">at 4.28pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5693c18de4b0962b6cc0e575\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-11T15:04:17.457Z\">3.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Back with UK stocks and Mike Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sports Direct International is the biggest faller in the FTSE 100 at the moment, down nearly 6% at 407.4p.</strong></p> <p>The controversial company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares plunged 15% on Friday - wiping more nearly half a billion off its market value - after it warned annual profits would be \u00c2\u00a340m lower than expected.<br></p> <p>It blamed a fall in the number of shoppers visiting the high streets, and unseasonably warm weather in the run-up to Christmas.</p> <p>The profits warning came just a month after a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/10/sports-direct-share-price-falls-following-guardian-working-practices-revelations\">Guardian investigation</a> revealed that Sports Direct effectively pays thousands of temporary workers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay\">below the national minimum wage</a> of \u00c2\u00a36.70 an hour and subjects warehouse staff to a regime of searches and surveillance.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9125ace2a674506f76f3e6cfea0004aab266f2ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9125ace2a674506f76f3e6cfea0004aab266f2ad/0_0_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sports Direct falls\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sports Direct falls</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luke Macgregor/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall follows a number of analyst downgrades in the wake of the profit warning.

But as Magnus explains, authorities are more likely to keep weak borrowers afloat:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Even though government officials speak occasionally about the need to allow corporate defaults and restructuring, and recognise bad debts in the banking system, the political and institutional blockages to such outcomes are formidable. If they could be overcome, adjustment might be softened, for example, by significant tax cuts for households and spending transfers from the state to the private sector. But the political will is not there.</p> <p>Instead, all we are likely to see is more credit easing, in the wake of the six initiatives since late 2014 to cut interest rates and banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reserve requirements, albeit to no economic effect.

                "bodyText":"For a while it looked like European shares were going to shake off their worries about China, despite a 5% fall in that country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market after the weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation figures. But with oil continuing to plunge - down to a new 12 year low at one point - investors found themselves facing another tricky day. The FTSE 100 fell to a three year low, while other European markets also ended in the red. And ahead of the US reporting season, Wall Street seems to be struggling to find direction. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: Looking ahead, the US quarterly earnings season gets underway with Alcoa reporting after the close tonight, whilst tomorrow morning UK manufacturing and industrial production data will be under scrutiny in the morning as traders optimistically look for some overdue good news from the domestic economy. Attention will also be on Chinese equities, although a relative absence of high profile data from Beijing in the short term may help calm nerves here. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 40.61 points or 0.69% at 5871.83 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax was down 0.25% at 9825.07 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.49% lower at 4312.74 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.57% to 19,756.14 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 0.26% lower at 8886.1 In Greece, the Athens market lost 0.73% to 581.68 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 8 points lower. Brent crude, meanwhile, has slumped nearly 6% to $31.63 a barrel. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. The FTSE 100 has fallen to its lowest level since early December 2012, down 40.61 points to 5871.83. Given the weak oil price - and copper falling to its lowest level since 2009 on continuing concerns about the Chinese economy - markets are now edging lower. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down marginally, while the FTSE 100 is off 22 points and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac are both down around 15 points after a rather more positive start to the day. Oil continues to fall, and has taken the shine off any early stock market gains. Brent crude is 4% lower at $32.17 a barrel while US crude is down below $32 to i12 year lows. The general concerns about oversupply and lack of demand have been brought into focus by a Morgan Stanley report saying the oil price could fall to $20 a barrel, as mentioned earlier. The bank said crude could fall further due to devaluation of the Chinese currency: In an oversupplied market, there is no intrinsic value for crude oil. The only guide posts are that the ceiling is set by producer hedging while the floor is set by investor and consumer appetite to buy. As a result, non-fundamental factors, such as the US dollar were arguably more important price drivers in 2015. In fact, when we assess the more than 30% decline in oil since early November, much of it is attributable to the appreciation in the trade-weighted US dollar.... With the oil market likely to remain oversupplied throughout 2016, we see no reason for this trading paradigm to change. Given the continued US dollar appreciation, $20-25 oil price scenarios are possible simply due to currency....For every 1% move in the trade-weighted US dollar, we tend to see a 2-4% move in Brent. Therefore, a 3.2% increase in the US dollar, as implied by a 15% yuan devaluation, could push down oil 6-15% ($2-5 a barrel), which could put oil in the high $20s. If other currencies move as well, the move in the US dollar and oil could be even greater. Hence, we remain bearish, even after the notable downward move already. Back with UK stocks and Mike Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sports Direct International is the biggest faller in the FTSE 100 at the moment, down nearly 6% at 407.4p. The controversial company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares plunged 15% on Friday - wiping more nearly half a billion off its market value - after it warned annual profits would be \u00c2\u00a340m lower than expected. It blamed a fall in the number of shoppers visiting the high streets, and unseasonably warm weather in the run-up to Christmas. The profits warning came just a month after a Guardian investigation revealed that Sports Direct effectively pays thousands of temporary workers below the national minimum wage of \u00c2\u00a36.70 an hour and subjects warehouse staff to a regime of searches and surveillance. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall follows a number of analyst downgrades in the wake of the profit warning. Cantor Fitzgerald slashed its target price from 700p to 480p with a hold recommendation, with analyst Freddie George saying: At the interim results, we gave the company the benefit of the doubt even though retail sales were disappointing. In view of the lack of transparency on strategy and in view that the company is likely to be eliminated from the FTSE100 over the next quarter, we are now taking a more cautious view on valuation. We are thus reducing our target price to 480p from 700p, which on our revised pre-tax profit forecasts, downgraded by around 14%, broadly values the company at 14 times full year 2016 earnings. We are, however retaining our hold recommendation on the stock, which has declined by almost 40% since the interim results announcement. Liberum cut from buy to hold and said: At the interims in December we downgraded 2016-18 pretax profit by between 6% and 8%. Following the trading update on 8 January we downgrade again, by 8% in 2016 and 6% in 2018. While the latest update only related to weakness over the past month we see a lack of earnings momentum in the short to medium term, and a lack of European M&amp;A. Sports Direct has levers that it can pull, notably automating the distribution centre, but will not do so until the future shape of the business is clear. The US stock market is making a valiant attempt to put the problems in China behind it. The Wall Street opening bell has just been rung, and the Dow Jones industrial average has jumped by 102 points in the first few minutes. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a gain of 0.63%. The broader S&amp;P 500 index is up a similar amount, while the technology-focused Nasdaq index has gained 0.8%. A quick recap: 1) China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has suffered another day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heavy losses, losing 5%m to close at its lowest level since September. Investors remained anxious, despite Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to reassure them: XTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunug says: Fears have heightened over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ailing economy and with confusion towards the unexpected devaluations leaving market participants questioning Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overall policy intentions; global sentiment may remain heavily depressed. 2) European stock markets have shrugged off the latest selloff. The FTSE 100 is pretty flat today, while the German and French markets are leading other markets slightly higher: Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says markets are in a state of flux, fixated on China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems. The conditions are not that of a calm rising bull market or a raging bear market but a volatile sideways price range, still undecided which way to break. 3) Concerns over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowing economy pulled copper down to a seven-year low. Figures released over the weekend showed that manufacturers continued to slash prices, suggesting weak demand. 4) Oil has dropped towards 11-year lows today, with Brent crude shedding 2% to $32.91 per barrel - sparking fresh woe for the Russian ruble. Analysts at Morgan Stanley have predicted that oil could slump to $20/barrel, if the US dollar were to spike (which could happen if the global economy falters). 5) Analysts fear that if Beijing mishandles the crisis, it could trigger a wave of corporate defaults. 6) Luxury carmaker Rolls-Royce has already been hit by China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes, reporting that sales in the country shrank by 54% last year. Luxury carmaker Rolls-Royce has just reported a sharp decline in sales in China Sales to Chinese customers shrank by 54% in 2015, the company says; the latest indication that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has weakened in the last year. Rolls-Royce, which is part of Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BMW, warns that: In China, significant headwinds impacted negatively on the entire luxury sector and Rolls\u00e2\u20ac\u2018Royce was not immune to these developments. The slump took the shine off some otherwise decent results from Rolls-Royce. It delivered a total of 3,785 new cars globally during 2015, down from a record high of 4,063 in 2014. Rolls-Royce sales can give a good insight into which parts of the global economy are hot, or not. In 2015, it says it managed a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong performances in all global regions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, apart from China. That includes record sales were reported in Asia Pacific (up 13%), the Middle East (up 4%) and North America (up 6%). It also grew sales in these countries: Korea: up 73% Japan (up 7%), Qatar (up 21%), Russia (up 1%), UK (up 2%) South Africa (up 7%). And apparently it sold more \u00e2\u20ac\u0153super-luxury\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd cars (costing \u00e2\u201a\u00ac200,000 or more) than anyone else. But China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems ended a five-year run of rising sales. Torsten M\u00c3\u00bcller-\u00c3\u2013tv\u00c3\u00b6s, chief executive, says it was a tough 12 months: \u00e2\u20ac\u01532015 was a year of tremendous challenge for the entire luxury industry. I am very proud of our success which was achieved against a backdrop of considerable global uncertainty.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full statement released a few minutes ago. Three months ago, M\u00c3\u00bcller-\u00c3\u2013tv\u00c3\u00b6s admitted being surprised by the rapid developments in China, and cited Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anti-corruption drive as one factor. He told the BBC that: The whole anti-corruption campaign... is very much around investigating where your money is from, to whom you are related and so on and so forth. That of course scares people who are quite affluent, and no one wants to be visible currently in that kind of environment and people are shying away from... obvious luxury goods, and that is not only true of cars but for jewellery and for precious watches and so on.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top tax official, Lin Homer of HMRC, has surprised us by resigning today. As my colleague Sean Farrell points out, her tenure has been marked by criticism over the way HMRC tackled tax avoidance by large companies, among other issues: Homer, who was made a dame in the New Year honours list, has been the subject of political controversy during her tenure. She revealed in February that most UK clients of HSBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Swiss business who settled with the tax authorities did so under an extraordinarily lenient agreement. Homer also apologised in November that HMRC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s giant call centre had failed to answer a quarter of the 50m calls it received each year. More here: There are signs that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deteriorating economy is bottoming out. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to new monthly economic indicators published by the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) today, based on the latest economic data. But the Paris-based think-tank also sees signs that the UK recovery is faltering, while the eurozone continues to grow slowly and steadily. The financial markets could be on track for a rough year, having posted the worst start to a new year ever. Tim Edwards, senior director of Index Investment Strategy at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, has pulled together some charts showing how week 1 of the year often sets the tone. Major markets lost around 5% last week, so this chart really doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bode well. But at least the opening week isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as important as early September -- a time dominated by European elections, and investors returning to their desks after their holidays. Edwards explains: Historically speaking, years that have started badly have more frequently ended badly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and to a greater extent than might be supposed, given the expected impact of a single week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance. However, those who wish to divine the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s yearly performance from that of a single week might be better off waiting until September. One bad week doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make a recession, but this research from JP Morgan suggests the global economy has come off the boil in the last month or so: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s situation-as-normal in the commodities market this morning, with copper dropping to its lowest price since spring 2009. Copper had managed a brief rally at the turn of the year, but has been (predictably) hit by the latest turmoil in China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s markets. Any recovery could be a few weeks away, at least, according to analyst Daniel Hynes of ANZ in Sydney: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Expectations coming into 2016 were for a better macro environment, but the likelihood is that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not going to see any real rebound until well after the Chinese New Year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wall Street is expected to rise when trading begins in four hours time. Perhaps investors are becoming less skittish about China, and turning their attention to other issues. The next US earnings season begins this week, with major companies reporting how they fared in the last three months. That will show how the American economy is faring, as David Kelly, chief global strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management explains: These numbers will still be impacted by lower oil prices and a higher dollar. However, the year-over-year comparisons on these issues are easier than in the third quarter and should result in a return to positive year-over-year growth in operating earnings. Overall, the US economy isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t booming, profits aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t soaring and China isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t out of the woods. Interesting developments in Greece overnight - the country has a new opposition leader. And the new man, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, is a serious reformer with the ability to shake up the Greek economy should he take power one day. Our Athens correspondent, Helena Smith, explains why it matters: For Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shattered business and finance worlds, the election of the reform minded Harvard-educated Kyriakos Mitsotakis to the helm of the main opposition New Democracy is generating thinly disguised excitement this morning. Aides are talking of the centre-right party \u00e2\u20ac\u0153undergoing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a Tony Blair moment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c albeit 15 years late. At 47, Mitsotakis not only speaks the language of realpolitik, his innate cosmopolitanism and experience in banking are of natural appeal to the international creditors keeping the debt-stricken country afloat. The secret of Mitsotakis is that he will appeal to social democrats, pro-European liberals who now want Greece to change through reform. To date, the leftist prime minister Alexis Tsipras has been given a free reign because of the power vacuum that the weak opposition has presented. Mitsotakis sees himself in the tradition of European progressives: although fiercely pro-market his stance on issues from gay rights to greens is decidedly moderate and forward looking. By moving New Democracy to the centre, the newly installed leader will not only give Tsipras a run for his money but force him to implement the pro-market \u00e2\u201a\u00ac86bn bailout program if he wants to stay in power. That automatically increases the chances of early elections. In that sense Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote may well be a ground-breaking event of potentially seismic repercussions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a major challenge not only for Tsipras but New Democracy itself. With 75 % of the vote counted Mitsotakis had won 51.6 % against 48.4% for his challenger Vangelis Meimarakis widely identified with the old political establishment. Even if New Democracy collapses in disarray \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and as it is bitterly divided this is not ruled out \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Mitsotakis may well attract support from the centre left who see in him a viable alternative for reform. His surprise win over Meimarakis (despite his name conjuring old-school nepotism as the scion of a political dynasty) is a first step in that direction. In a week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time, high-flying members of the global elite (plus a bunch of journalists) will gather in Davos for the annual World Economic Forum (WEF). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chance to discuss the global situation, cut deals, and plot the way ahead - at a crucial time for the world economy. But this year, Angela Merkel won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be there. Instead, the German chancellor will stay at home to deal with an escalating domestic crisis over migration, following scores of assaults and robberies at Cologne on New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eve. The FT got the story last night, saying: With a lot on her plate, she [Merkel] had already decided well before the Cologne attacks not to make her regular trip to the Davos World Economic Forum, the global leaders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 gathering this month. Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s camp insist there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing unusual here: Merkel doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go to Davos every year - she skipped 2014 after suffering a skiing injury. But generally, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appeared to enjoy WEF - and I suspect she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be missed. But given the growing criticism at home over her refugee strategy, this probably isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the time to be rubbing shoulders with Davos Man (and Woman). The recent gyrations in the markets are is forcing City economists to rip up their oil price forecasts. Morgan Stanley has predicted that Brent crude could slide to as low at $20 per barrel this year, if the US dollar continues to strengthen [any commodity priced in dollars would fall if the US currency goes up in value] They told clients today that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Given the continued U.S. dollar appreciation, $20-$25 oil price scenarios are possible simply due to currency. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The U.S. dollar and non-fundamental factors continue to drive oil prices.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The fundamentals of oil aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t great either, given the risks from China. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why French bank SocGen has taken a knife to its predictions too. It now reckons Brent will average $42.50 per barrel this year, not almost $54.... There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drama in the international currency markets, where the Chinese currency has strengthened against the US dollar. The yuan has gained 1% in so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcoffshore trading\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, reaching a one-week high of 6.6170 yuan to the US dollar. That comes after Beijing fixed the on-shore yuan at a stronger level than last week, at 6.5807 yuan to $1. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a gain of around 0.2%, which could be taken as a signal that China isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t planning a major yuan devaluation. And that is helping to push shares higher in Europe - where the German DAX and French CAC are now around 0.8% higher. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ructions in the Asian markets: Experienced City economist and China-watcher George Magnus has written about the China crisis in the Financial Times. He points out that the big worry isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market, but the possibility of credit defaults. And there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of potential for problems here. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corporate and local government debt burden has swelled to around 250% of GDP, by some measures, up from \u00e2\u20ac\u02dconly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 100% in 2008. With the economy slowing, some defaults could be inevitable. But as Magnus explains, authorities are more likely to keep weak borrowers afloat: Even though government officials speak occasionally about the need to allow corporate defaults and restructuring, and recognise bad debts in the banking system, the political and institutional blockages to such outcomes are formidable. If they could be overcome, adjustment might be softened, for example, by significant tax cuts for households and spending transfers from the state to the private sector. But the political will is not there. Instead, all we are likely to see is more credit easing, in the wake of the six initiatives since late 2014 to cut interest rates and banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reserve requirements, albeit to no economic effect. The credit binge, then, will continue until it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. The oil price is heading towards new 11-year lows this morning, giving the Russian ruble another knock. Brent crude has shed 3%, or around one dollar per barrel to just $32.58, close to last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lows. That heralds more pain for oil producers in the Middle East, and also Russia. Its currency has hit a fresh low this morning, at 76 rubles to the dollar. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much panic in Europe about today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff in China, yet anyway. The French and Italian markets have crept higher at the opening, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX is only down 0.2%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another wet and gloomy morning in the City. And that matches the mood in the markets, where the FTSE 100 has dropped 21 points 0r 0.4% in early trading. Our old friends, the mining stocks, are leading the selloff. Anglo American, Antofagasta, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto are all down between 1.6% and 2%. They continue to be hit by fears that China could knock the global economy off course, meaning weaker demand for materials such as iron ore, copper, coal, nickel, zinc. City experts have spent the weekend fretting about China, reports Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top currency analyst Kit Juckes: If my inbox is anything to go by, the big market issue this weekend is whether the Chinese authorities can restore confidence in their ability to manage an orderly adjustment of the Yuan. So what happens next? Kit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best guess is that the Chinese economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbumpy landing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 continues, as Beijing struggles to rebalance its economy and embrace more free-market principles. Even if China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some way from the inconsistent quartet of free trade, free capital mobility, independent monetary policy and a fixed exchange rate, they have moved closer and will struggle to find consistent policies. Nervousness across Asian markets and fear of bigger capital outflows and a bigger FX move are going to go on haunting markets. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff means that the Chinese stock market has now lost 15% of its value this year - over just 6 trading days. The latest Chinese inflation figures are also fuelling worries over its economy this morning. Figures released over the weekend showed that factory-gate prices have now fallen for 46 months in a row. That suggests domestic demand is still weakening, forcing Chinese firms to charge less for their wares - which could ripple out across the global economy, driving prices lower worldwide. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer inflation rate inched up to 1.6%, from 1.5% in November. European stocks are expected to dip this morning: A late rush of selling in Shanghai has sent the Chinese stock market sliding to its lowest level in over three months. The CSI 300 index slumped by 5% to close at just 3,192 points, a drop of 169 points. Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that its financial system is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153largely stable and healthy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (see opening post) clearly wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough to stop the index hitting its lowest levels since the aftermath of the summer crisis: Overnight, Chinese authorities fixed the yuan at a level similar to Friday - resisting any temptation to weaken its currency again. But economists predict more scuffles in the currency wars, as Angus Nicholson of IG explains: Global markets are still in the grips of China fears, and it is uncertain whether the Chinese government can do enough to reassure global investors. The People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China (PBoC) fixed the CNY largely unchanged from its position on Friday. But this halt in the weakening of the currency appears to have done very little to investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations that there will be further depreciation of the currency in the near future. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Brace yourselves for another week dominated by fears over China, with a dash of stock market volatility and a weak oil price thrown in too. Equities have already posted their worst start to a New Year ever, and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no respite as investors worry about exactly how bad the Chinese situation is. Over the weekend, Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign exchange regulator declared that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial system is robust. It said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic fundamentals are strong. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Foreign exchange reserves are relatively abundant and the financial system is largely stable and healthy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But will that reassure global investors following recent heavy stock market losses, mounting pressure on the yuan, and concerns that more corporations could default on their debts? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

On a day when the cost of crude hit a new 12-year low and edge closer to the $30 a barrel level, Morgan Stanley posted a forecast on Monday of $20-25 a barrel for oil based on movements in currencies.

                "bodyText":"The Chinese authorities have resorted to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nuclear strength\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd weapons to deter an attack on the yuan by short sellers and convince sceptical investors that they are in control of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spluttering financial system. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank fixed the currency firmer again on Tuesday but traders were not persuaded and the currency slipped in early trade despite what dealers called aggressive intervention to support the currency. The gap between the mainland yuan and its offshore counterpart had grown in recent days but suspected intervention by China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state-owned banks brought them almost into line on Tuesday. The action sent the rate at which banks charge each other to borrow yuan in Hong Kong to a record high of 67% on Tuesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The market suspects that the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China is possibly using major state banks to directly drain yuan liquidity in offshore markets,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said a dealer at an European bank in Shanghai. The dealer described the strength of the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions as being of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nuclear-weapon\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd level strength. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Its actions are comparable to steps taken by other central banks when they previously fought against international speculators, such as George Soros,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Equity markets in China looked set to end in positive territory with the Shanghai Composite Index falling up 0.5% in afternoon trading and the CSI300 index up 1% . But other markets in the region continued to struggle with the Nikkei off 2.7% in late afternoon trading while the ASX/S&amp;P 200 in Australia closed down for the eighth session in a row. Oil prices, which have lost 20% already this year amid uncertainty about the Chinese economy, continued to slide on Tuesday. Brent crude fell 43c to $31.12 a barrel having earlier touched $31.08, their lowest since April 2004. US crude was trading at $30.98 per barrel, also down 43c. Signalling a desire for stabilisation, the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China set the mid-point for the yuan at 6.5628, barely changed from the previous strong fix and higher than its late levels on Monday. Perceived mis-steps by China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s authorities have stoked concerns in global markets that Beijing might be losing its grip on economic policy, just as the country looks set to post its slowest growth in 25 years. Amid suspicions by some in the market that China wants the yuan to devalue in order to boost its ailing exporters, sources suggested there were moves afoot for China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cabinet to take a bigger role in overseeing financial markets. The state council has set up a working group to prepare for upgrading the cabinet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial department to bureau level, said a source close to the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leadership. Officials were doing their best to talk up the currency which was trading up slightly at 6.5757 to the dollar at 4am GMT on Tuesday. The central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist Ma Jun said on Monday that the bank planned to keep the yuan basically stable against a basket of currencies, and fluctuations against the US dollar would increase. Han Jun, deputy director of the office of the Chinese Communist party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading group on financial and economic affairs, said a more substantial decline in the yuan was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ridiculous\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153impossible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He was speaking at a briefing held at the Chinese consulate in New York, suggesting the authorities were broadening their verbal campaign to deter yuan sellers. Not all are convinced, however. Goldman Sachs on Monday sharply cut its forecast for the yuan for this year and next. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With export growth deeply in negative territory, and exports likely to remain weak in coming months, it is likely easier to reach a policy consensus to allow some depreciation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Goldman analysts wrote in a note. Morgan Stanley has also cut its forecast, predicting that the yuan could fall to 7.31 to the dollar by the end of 2017. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While policymakers are still trying to maintain the trade-weighted (yuan) exchange rate in a stable range, we now anticipate that they will transition towards targeting a depreciation ... earlier than initially expected,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the bank said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This move will help policymakers to still cut interest rates to manage deflationary pressures, but will imply further depreciation of the yuan (against the dollar).\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Figures for China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s December trade accounts are due on Wednesday and are expected to show further falls in both exports and imports. But on Tuesday, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top planning agency said the economy likely grew by the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target of around 7% in 2015 and added 13 million new jobs as it announced the approval of more large infrastructure projects to avert the risks of a sharper slowdown. China achieved its main economic targets in 2015, Li Pumin, spokesman for the national reform and development commission (NDRC) told a news conference.

                "bodyText":"Thanks to China making strong efforts to support the yuan, European markets have moved higher, albeit off their best levels. The continuing slide in oil prices has tempered some of the earlier enthusiasm, while Chinese trade data early on Wednesday is likely to cause further volatility. Meanwhile the pound hit a five and a half year low against the dollar following disappointing manufacturing data which seemed to push a UK rate rise further into the distance. The closing scores for European markets showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 0.98% or 57.41 points at 5929.24 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax added 1.63% to 9985.43 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac climbed 1.53% to 4378.75 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB rose 1.08% to 19,970.10 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.33% at 8915.4 In Greece, the Athens market was 2.16% better at 594.26 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently virtually unchanged, up just 3 points while Brent crude is down 3% at $30.56. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Global oil demand is expected to grow more strongly than previously expected, according to the US Energy Information Administration. But so is US production. The EIA has raised its forecast for oil demand in 2016 by 20,000 barrels per day, and it expects 2017 world oil demand to reach 96.61m barrels, up 1.42m from the 2016 figure. It also expects US crude production to have risen by 720,000 barrels a day in 2015, from a previous forecast of 630,000. Brent crude is currently down just over 2% at $30.86 a barrel, while WTI has been close to falling below $30 a barrel. The US measure has fallen as low as $30.1 a barrel and is currently down 1% at $30.32. Despite the oil price volatility, stock markets are holding up. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: UK and European shares advanced...as global markets attempt to undo some of the damage wreaked by the tumultuous first week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading. A higher Chinese yuan was the main source of comfort behind the rise in stocks. The price of oil was less supportive as it jumped back and forth between gains and losses near 12-year lows after a series of investment banks lowered forecasts to as low as $10 per barrel. After staging a tentative recovery earlier, the oil price has fallen into negative territory again. Brent crude, which touched $32.38 a barrel at one point has drifted back to $31.01, a 1.7% decline on the day as the dollar continues to strengthen. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enough from Paris. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s get back to the UK, where Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first minister Nicola Sturgeon has commented on the news that BP is cutting one in five jobs in the North Sea. Our Scotland editor Severin Carrell has the story: The first minister said the BP cuts and falling oil price were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153difficult\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and admitted the price could yet fall further, as predicted by Morgan Stanley. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a very difficult time indeed for people working in the North Sea,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Nicola Sturgeon said. The Scottish government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s North Sea jobs task force, set up a year ago after the first wave of industry cuts, would offer support the workers affected, she said. But pressed on the scale of the latest job cuts by one of the North Sea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest operators, BP, and the plunging oil price \u00e2\u20ac\u201c now at a third of the $100 a barrel price forecast by her government in the Scottish independence reference, she refused to agree that the sector was in crisis. She said BP and Oil &amp; Gas UK, the industry body, had both stressed North Sea oil had a bright future and were planning continued investment. However, Sturgeon conceded that while lower oil prices helped consumers and the wider economy through cheaper fuel costs, the job losses and cuts in oil industry spending was having a direct, negative impact on economic output. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is undoubtedly the case that there will be a wider impact. We will look carefully at unemployment figures and at GDP figures. [Again] while I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m trying to underplay the significance of the North Sea but a lower oil price has other impacts on the wider economy in terms of lower fuel costs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery has not been been built on rising debt within the economy, Mark Carney insists. He acknowledges that household debt levels are still relatively high, but points out that the private sector has been reducing its borrowing. However, there are now signs that consumers are borrowing more. As Carney puts it, we have moved from a post-crisis risk aversion environment to a more normal one. The challenge for central bankers such as himself, and the others huddled in Paris today, is to spot when animal spirits are getting out of hand - as a hike in borrowing costs would still hurt reckless borrowers: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ugly rumour\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that global regulators are planning Basel 4 - a new set of regulations to keep banks in check - says Carney. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not true. Mark Carney is now speaking at the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Christian Noyer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd symposium in Paris. But the current Bank of England governor may not say much to move the markets - he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcin blackout\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ahead of Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate decision. Instead, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outlining how UK banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 profitability has fallen since the financial crisis: That is partly because they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re taking on less leverage, due to tougher regulation post-crisis, and partly because they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stumping up such hefty penalties to cover bad behaviour in the past. That misconduct charge should fall in the future, as banks clean up their game, Carney suggests, adding that retail banking is still very profitable in an environment of ultra-low interest rates. The UK thinktank NIESR has just issued its latest forecast for UK growth. And it predicts that the economy slightly picked up speed in the last three months of 2015, growing by 0.6%. That would be an increased on the 0.4% recorded between July and September. Is that too optimistic, given the weakness of the manufacturing sector? We get the official first estimate of GDP for the last quarter of 2015 in a couple of weeks, on the 28th of January. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chilly mood in the City this afternoon. No, not the weather (although it is a little brisk). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because Albert Edwards, the notoriously pessimistic analyst at Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale, is starting to deliver his annual assessment of the markets. You can probably set your dial to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgloom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Albert can certainly pull in the crowds.... Back in Paris, Sheila Bair - head of the Systemic Risk Council - is warning of potential trouble ahead. She points out that governments typically pay down debt during recoveries - this time, borrowing is going up and up. Wall Street clearly didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the memo to sell everything. Shares are up in early New York trading, following Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead. And the oil price has now turned positive today, up 2% at $32.16, on hopes that the situation in Chinese is calming down. The IMF have uploaded Christine Lagarde\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech here. It ends with a call to arms to help emerging economies: According to some estimates, a successful convergence process in the emerging world could triple the size of the global economy in the next 25 or 30 years. The global community cannot afford the costs of stalled convergence. The 85 percent matter! Lagarde concludes her speech by wishing Christian Noyer a happy retirement following his time at the Bank of France. She suggests he takes a tip from Mervyn King - who left the Bank of England vowing to learn to cook and dance. Good idea, but Noyer should avoid emulating Lord King\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other hobby -- supporting Aston Villa. Christine Lagarde is now explaining how the IMF is pushing for a new global approach to financial stability, to help emerging markets. She says we need two things: 1) a stronger financial safety net. 2) a better framework for safer capital flows. On the safety net, the IMF chief says the current situation is simply unfair. Emerging markets are locked out of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153swap lines\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd between central banks that provide essential support in times of crisis. This makes the global safety net stronger for advanced countries than it is for emerging economies. Yet emerging economies critically depend on advanced-country currencies in their trade and finance. The size of the current safety nets also need to be reviewed, she adds. And on capital flows, Lagarde says emerging markets suffer from the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153short-term nature and inherent volatility\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of global capital flows (as investors in advanced economies look for a decent rate of return). Maybe hot money is too hot, Lagarde suggests. More long-term, equity based, financial flows would help - meaning financial buffers could be smaller. You can watch Christine Lagarde\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech here. Over in Paris, Christine Lagarde is speaking at the symposium to mark the retirement of former French central bank chief Christian Noyer. The head of the International Monetary Fund starts by touching on China, saying its economic rebalancing is a positive long-term move, but one that brings short-term spillover effects. And she warns that commodity prices are unlikely to rally strongly anytime soon. She says last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US interest rate rise has been successful. It was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clearly communicated and priced in by markets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but the key point is how the future normalisation of monetary policy is handled by the Federal Reserve. And on emerging markets, Lagarde warns that the appreciation of the US dollar comes at a tricky time - with developing markets already facing slower growth and falling commodity prices. If emerging market growth falls by 1%, that knocks 0.2% off advanced economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s significant, she insists, given the current growth rates of advanced countries. Although shares are picking up today, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still plenty of nervousness about the future. And analysts at Royal Bank of Scotland have added to the nerves, by telling clients they should sell up before markets really hit trouble. Our markets reporter Nick Fletcher explains: Investors face a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cataclysmic year\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd where stock markets could fall by up to 20% and oil could slump to $16 (\u00c2\u00a311) a barrel, economists at the Royal Bank of Scotland have warned. In a note to its clients the bank said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sell everything except high quality bonds. This is about return of capital, not return on capital. In a crowded hall, exit doors are small.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It said the current situation was reminiscent of 2008, when the collapse of the Lehman Brothers investment bank led to the global financial crisis. This time China could be the crisis point. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: Over in the Telegraph, Ambrose Evans-Pritchard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mood has also darkened. He warns: The risk is that this market storm drags on long enough to hit investment, regardless of what the economic data should imply. At the end of the day, market psychology can itself become an economic \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fundamental\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Pessimists warn that unless there is a batch of irrefutably good data from China over the next two or three months, the sell-off could become self-fulfilling and quickly metamorphose into the next global crisis. Shares are rallying across Europe as investors shrug off their worries about China, and Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing malaise. They are taking heart from Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong stance on the yuan earlier today, when it aggressively supported its currency in the international markets. That is seen as a sign that China isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t planning to spark a full-blown currency war by allowing the yuan to devalue wildly. So, the German DAX has jumped by almost 2.5%, with other indices close behind. German manufacturers are leading the way, such as Volkswagen (+4%), BMW (+3.3%) and BASF (+2.9%). Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says some stability appears to have returned to the markets: There is a feeling that perhaps the selling pressure that has characterised stock markets last week may ease somewhat, as profit-taking among shorts and bargain hunting takes hold. However, with earnings season now underway, the selloff seen in 2016 so far could provide great buying opportunities for those expecting to see positive updates. The City is also cheered by this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial results, which saw retailers Morrisons and Debenhams both beat forecasts. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, points out that the fall in the pound should help UK manufacturers. But November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak performance may show the sector dragged the economy back at the end of 2015. Beck says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Industrial production fell by 0.7% between October and November, with all four of the sub-sectors seeing output decline. This was the largest monthly fall in output since January 2013. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The biggest cause for concern is the manufacturing sector, where output declined by 0.4% for a second successive month in November. This may have followed a very strong September, but the business surveys continue to point to \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at best \u00e2\u20ac\u201c stagnation. Although the recent fall in the pound should provide some support to exporters, it is difficult to find many other reasons for optimism around the manufacturing sector. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With manufacturing on course for only modest output growth in Q4 and the other components of industrial production likely to have contracted, the economy is going to be almost wholly reliant on services to drive growth once again. Our short-term model continues to point to GDP growth of 0.6% in Q4, up from 0.5% in Q3. But there is now a risk that the preliminary estimate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c due in just over two weeks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c shows another below-par outturn of 0.5%.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Looks like China will be in focus tomorrow too, when we discover how well (or badly) it traded with the rest of the world... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unions know who to blame for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing decline - finance minister George Osborne. The chancellor warned last week that a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccocktail of risks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 threaten the UK, including China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowing economy. But TUC general secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady reckons the blame lies closer to home: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cocktail of threats has been spiked with his own failures. Not least of these is manufacturing, which is still far behind its pre-crisis peak and has fallen by 1.2 per cent over the last year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the government had made the right choices with strong investment in skills, infrastructure and innovation, we could be in a much stronger position.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady also points out that UK steel production has shrunk by a third from its recent peak, as UK factories struggle to cope with falling prices and competition from abroad. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Steel production has seen its sharpest fall since the financial crisis. This is the inevitable result of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure to step in and give UK steel the support it needs. Unless the government puts in place a genuine industrial strategy, we risk further serious consequences for steel and many other manufacturers down the supply chain.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Thousands of oil workers at BP face the axe, as the company adjusts to the new era of cheaper oil. Reuters has the story: Oil major BP plans to cut at least 4,000 jobs globally in its oil production division this year to reduce costs amid a steep decline in oil prices. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We want to simplify structure and reduce costs without compromising safety. Globally, we expect the headcount in upstream to be below 20,000 by the end of the year,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a company spokesman said. He said BP was planning to reduce headcount by 600 people in the North Sea over the next two years with most cuts to happen in 2016. Back to oil.,.. and Nigeria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suggestion today that OPEC could hold an emergency meeting soon has been slapped down by the United Arab Emirates. UAE energy minister Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazroui argued that the cartel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current strategy (not cutting production) should be given more time. Mazroui said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not convinced OPEC alone can change or can solely unilaterally change this strategy just because we have seen a low in the market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd After November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak performance, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial production sector is still around 9% smaller than before the crisis. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure/inability (take your pick) to expand its manufacturing sector in the last 15 years has meant we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve run a persistent current account deficit, with imports consistently outpacing exports. But does it matter, when the services sector fills some (but not all) of the gap? An economist who blogs as Polemic Paine argues that Britain should embrace the fact that other countries can manufacturer goods much cheaper than us: The UK is the second largest exporter of services in the world and the US economy is currently 88% services. In a competitive world it is better to export high value goods rather than low value goods unless you can make those low value goods at such low prices that (price x volume) = big. Whilst there are countries with populations willing to accept lower wages than us for their day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work we have to sell goods they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. And that is now mostly services..... He concludes: Once upon a time the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agricultural industry accounted for 90% of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. It is now about 3%. Should we readjust back to that too for nostalgias sake? As long as we are exporting services that pay for the lower valued manufacturing stuff we buy in then that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine. Yet services are lost in the data. The historic way of measuring trade data demotes many services into the invisibles part of the equation leaving attention resting on the more obvious manufacturing figures.  Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full piece: Weak week. Waiting. I guess people would worry less if services was able to cover *all* the shortfall from the trade in goods: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also the worry that financial services can turn around and bite the economy when a crisis erupts (plus the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcimplicit subsidy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that taxpayers cough up to protect them from failure) JP Morgan reckons that first UK rate rise is now 10 months away. Economist Malcolm Barr explains: Recent disappointments in the pay data and the drop in oil prices had already put our call for the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to raise rates in May at risk. The weakness in this IP report is the straw that breaks the camel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s back. We hence push our forecast for the first hike back by 6 months to November 2016. The forecast shows rates rising by 25bp a quarter thereafter. In our minds, the MPC are very much in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153data dependent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd mode, rather than feeling at all constrained to adhere to any path suggested by their commentary. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s certainly little chance that the Bank of England will raise interest rates this week: Our best guess is that the MPC vote will remain at 8-1 at this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, although these data raise the risk that McCafferty will choose to withdraw his vote for higher rates for now. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 Sterling has fallen to its lowest level against the US dollar since early June 2010, following the disappointing UK industrial production data. The pound has shed half a cent, touching $1.4484, as traders calculate that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no prospect of interest rates rising soon. Jake Trask, currency analyst at UKForex, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Both industrial and manufacturing production have posted lower-than-expected readings for November. Combined with soft growth figures and Brexit fears, these results will likely dampen any expectations of a UK interest rate rise in the near future\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The FT points out that UK manufacturing has been weakening for several months: Just in: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial sector suffered its biggest fall in output in almost three years, as manufacturing shrank again. Industrial production shank by 0.7% month-on-month, according to the Office for National Statistics. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the biggest drop since January 2013, and much worse than expected. It says: There were decreases in all of the main sectors, with manufacturing, mining &amp; quarrying and electricity &amp; gas having the largest contributions to the decrease. This can partly be blamed on the unusually warm winter, which has meant less demand for energy to heat homes and businesses. But manufacturing struggled too; its output fell by 0.4% in November compared with October, and was 1.2% lower than a year ago. It suggests British business are suffering from weaker overseas demand, partly due to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic worries. It leaves the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vision of a rebalanced economy led by a revitalised factory sector looking as distant as ever. And it also highlights why demand for oil is weak, leading to supply gluts and sliding prices. Many US oil producers will suffer severe financial pain, and possibly go bust, unless the oil price recovers from its current lows, analysts fear. Marketwatch has the details: As many as a third of American oil-and-gas producers could tip toward bankruptcy and restructuring by mid-2017, according to Wolfe Research. Survival, for some, would be possible if oil rebounded to at least $50, according to analysts. The benchmark price of U.S. crude settled at $31.41 a barrel, setting a 12-year low. More than 30 small companies that collectively owe in excess of $13 billion have already filed for bankruptcy protection so far during this downturn, according to law firm Haynes &amp; Boone. More here: Plunging prices could force a third of U.S. oil firms into bankruptcy Retail magnate turned football chairman Mike Ashley could suffer a double relegation this year. Shares in his Sports Direct chain have fallen by almost 4% this morning, as the aftermath of last Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit warning continues to reverberate. Yesterday they tumbled by 7%, as analysts scramble to reassess their view of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prospects. Sports Direct is currently valued at \u00c2\u00a32.4bn, which is not enough to maintain a place in the FTSE 100 index. And with Newcastle United 18th (two from bottom) in the Premier League, it could be a year to forget for the club\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s owner. This chart shows how Beijing drove up the interest rate on offshore yuan deposits overnight, in a bid to strengthen the currency. This was designed to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcencourage\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 traders to hold renminbi and inflict losses on speculators who were betting against it. The latest slump in the oil price isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t causing alarm in the European stock markets. Instead, shares are rallying as traders applaud China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aggressive moves to prop up the yuan overnight. The German DAX has gained 1%, bringing some relief to Frankfurt where investors have been worrying about a global downturn. In London, the FTSE 100 gained half a percent. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been so much volatility this year that markets may not stay higher for long..... Debenhams has also beaten festive expectations, posting a 1.9% jump in like-for-like sales over Christmas. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rather better than its main rival, Marks &amp; Spencer, which posted a 5.8% decline in general merchandise sales. M&amp;S blamed unusually warm weather, but clearly some retailers coped better than others ... 2015 was a rough year for UK supermarket chain Morrisons, as it struggled to cope with falling sales and profits. But this year has begun better, with the company beating forecasts over the crucial Christmas period. My colleague Sean Farrell explains: Morrisons achieved a surprise increase in sales over Christmas as customers returned to the supermarket chain. Sales at stores open a year or more, excluding fuel, rose 0.2% in the nine weeks to 3 January, Morrisons said in a trading statement. City analysts had expected like-for-like sales, which exclude new stores, to fall 2%. Morrisons said customers were starting to return to its stores with like-for-like transactions up 1.3% in its core supermarkets during the period. The chain has been badly hit by competition from the German discounters Aldi and Lidl and has cut prices to compete. And the City likes the news - sending its shares soaring 12% in early trading. Other supermarkets are benefitting too - Tesco shares are up 5.5%, and Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has gained 2.8%. Perhaps Christmas wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as bad as feared.... There is relief in Shanghai as the China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market closes up today. The Shanghai composite ended the day 0.7% higher at 3,215 points, meaning it is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dconly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 down 13.8% so far this year. Investors welcomed the news that Beijing had stepped up its support for the yuan today. As mentioned in the introduction, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank intervened aggressively in the offshore currency markets today, boosting the renminbi and sparking a record surge in the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s money-market rates. That might scare off speculators who had been been betting against the yuan. OPEC members who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like the look of $30 per barrel oil should take a deep breath -- analysts at Standard Chartered think prices could hit $10(!) a barrel. The bank argue that the strength of the US dollar, and pessimism in the stock market, could send oil down to levels not seen since 1999. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Given that no fundamental relationship is currently driving the oil market towards any equilibrium, prices are being moved almost entirely by financial flows caused by fluctuations in other asset prices, including the US dollar and equity markets. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We think prices could fall as low as $10/bbl before most of the money managers in the market conceded that matters had gone too far.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The slump in the oil price could prompt the OPEC cartel into an emergency meeting, according to Nigeria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy minister. Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu, Nigeria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minister of state for petroleum resources, told reporters at a conference in Abu Dhabi that a couple of OPEC members have already suggested a meeting. This would give an opportunity for OPEC members to cut production rates, something they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve declined to do at their scheduled meetings. OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy appeared to be keen to flood the market with crude, drive prices down, put rival suppliers such as shale out of business, and pick up the pieces later. The speed of the slump in prices over the last 18 months may prompt a rethink, though.. Oil is coming under renewed pressure today, as traders speculate about just how low the crude price will fall. Crude prices tumbled by another 3% today, hitting fresh 12 year lows. It is being driven down by concerns over the world economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness which is fuelling the oversupply glut. Brent, sourced from the North Sea, hit a low of $30.43 per barrel in early trading, before struggling back to $30.80 As we warned yesterday, Morgan Stanley analysts believe oil could hit $20 this year -- and at this rate, it might happen sooner than crude producers would like. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It looks like another day dominated by two familiar themes - China, and oil. Overnight, Beijing has managed to strengthen the yuan, seemingly throwing the monetary kitchen sink at its currency to prevent another devaluation. As we explain here: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The market suspects that the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China is possibly using major state banks to directly drain yuan liquidity in offshore markets,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said a dealer at an European bank in Shanghai. The dealer described the strength of the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions as being of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nuclear-weapon\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd level strength. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Its actions are comparable to steps taken by other central banks when they previously fought against international speculators, such as George Soros,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. That means European markets are likely to be calm this morning: On the UK front, we find out how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial sector fared in December, at 9.30am GMT. And Bank of England governor Mark Carney is giving a speech in Paris this afternoon , at 2.15pm GMT. Hopefully he might touch on the turmoil that has gripped the world markets this year. And there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flood of UK company news, particularly on the retail front. Struggling supermarket group Morrisons, high street chain Debenhams, and pasty-purveyer Greggs are all updating the City. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

                "bodyText":"The run-up to Christmas is the busiest time of year for high street and online retailers. With companies now revealing how they performed during the vital festive season in January trading updates, the winners and losers are emerging \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Tesco Tesco cheered the City with news of a much stronger than expected performance, pushing sales in its core UK supermarkets business up by 1.3%. Analysts forecast a fall of up to 3%. Chief executive Dave Lewis said the group, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest retailer, had benefitted from lower prices on an improved range of products and better customer service. Home Retail Group The group has warned that poor sales at its Argos chain would hurt profits, with a 2.2% fall in like-for-like sales in the 18 weeks to 2 January, worse than analysts expected. Sales at its stores slumped 13% in December, with shopping centre and high street stores badly hit, which was only partly offset by 10% growth in digital sales. Its other chain, Homebase, enjoyed 5% growth, boosted by kitchen and bathroom products. Burberry Sales at Burberry have improved after a return to growth in China and strong demand in Europe, but the British fashion brand warned that the outlook for the luxury sector remained uncertain. Burberry said like-for-like sales were flat in the last three months of 2015. This was an improvement on the 4% decline of the previous quarter, but missed the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own targets. Retail sales revenues edged up 1% to \u00c2\u00a3603m. The company highlighted a slump in Hong Kong and Macau, which dragged down sales across the Asia Pacific region overall, even though mainland China and South Korea returned to growth. Sales in Hong Kong fell again, by more than 20%, while Japan remained strong. Burberry stressed all its Hong Kong stores remained profitable. Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sales at stores open a year or more fell 0.4% in the 15 weeks to 9 January, better than a predicted fall of 0.7%. The supermarket said the Christmas campaign had been helped by the success of the Mog the cat advertising campaign. Chief executive Mike Coupe said the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance in the third quarter of its financial year meant it now expected sales at established stores to be better in the second half of the year than in the first half. Primark The fashon chain experienced a disappointing Christmas as warm, wet weather across Europe hit sales growth. Analysts said sales at the cut-price chain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s established stores were flat in the 16 weeks to 2 January compared with the same period a year before. Analysts had expected growth of 2%. Primark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s difficulties reflected problems for many clothing retailers ahead of Christmas, as shoppers left knitwear, coats and winter boots on the shelves during the warmest December on record. JD Sports JD Sports like-for-like sales across the UK and Europe rose 10.6% over Christmas, prompting a hefty profit upgrade, with analysts raising their target price on the stock with shares rising more than 4%. The retailer is now confident of beating market expectations for annual profit before tax and one-off items of \u00c2\u00a3136m by up to 10%. JD has recorded strong demand for trainers made by Nike and other leading brands and women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sportswear for some time, which pushed first-half profits up 80% to a record \u00c2\u00a346.6m. Fortnum &amp; Mason The venerable grocer has emerged as a Christmas winner after its famous hampers, sold via a revamped website, proved popular around the world. The London department store, founded in 1707, said like-for-like sales were 15% up over the key Christmas period, the five weeks to 3 January, pushing annual profits up 31% to \u00c2\u00a35m. Fortnum said it recorded the best trading day in its history on 15 December. Online sales were particularly strong, up 38% year-on-year, after the firm redesigned its website. Sales of hampers rose 26% as it dispatched products to a record number of countries. The group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expansion beyond its traditional base in Piccadilly appears to have paid off. Fortnum\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flagship London store delivered the highest sales total, but the biggest percentage increase came from its store at Heathrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Terminal 5, where sales rose 63%. Morrisons Morrisons achieved a surprise increase in sales over Christmas as customers returned to the supermarket chain. Sales at stores open a year or more, excluding fuel, rose 0.2% in the nine weeks to 3 January. City analysts had expected like-for-like sales, which exclude new stores, to fall 2%. Morrisons said customers were starting to return to its stores with like-for-like transactions up 1.3% in its core supermarkets during the period. Debenhams Christmas sales beat expectations with a 3.5% rise as the department store chain relied less on discounts and cut stocks of coats and outerwear to take account of warmer winter weather. Home Retail Group The owner of Argos and Homebase issued an unusual profit warning before Christmas, stating that the festive season was less predictable than in the past and that it was investing more than expected in launching a same-day delivery network across the country. The warning was linked to the rise in prominence of Black Friday in the UK, which has led to a peak in sales in late November and widespread discounting on the high street. The company is scheduled to publish sales figures for the Christmas period on 14 January. These will be more heavily scrutinised than usual by investors after Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revealed it had made a takeover bid for Home Retail. Bonmarch\u00c3\u00a9 The clothing retailer targeted at women over 50 also downgraded its profit expectations before Christmas. The company said on 16 December that trading on the high street had been very challenging and had not normalised since Black Friday, as it battled against discounting and warmer-than-average weather, which dampened demand for winter clothing. Game Digital For the second Christmas in a row, the video games retailer warned that its performance and profits were not as strong as it hoped. Shares in the company fell 40% on 23 December as Game outlined a collection of reasons why it struggled. This included gamers making a slower-than-expected switch to the new PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles, but at the same time a slowdown in sales of older content. These factors were exacerbated by a decline in visitor numbers to the high street and shopping centres during December. Next Traditionally among the Christmas winners, Next set the tone for a string of gloomy January trading updates from clothing retailers when it warned that sales between 26 October and 24 December rose by just 0.4% year-on-year. This represented a notable slowdown in sales for Next compared to the rest of the year and included a 0.5% drop in in-store sales. Simon Wolfson, the chief executive, blamed the performance on unusually warm weather and even produced a chart to show how the changing temperature affected demand for winter coats. John Lewis The department store managed to outperform its rivals by reporting a 7% increase in sales for the six weeks to 2 January. Not only did John Lewis deliver a 6% rise in clothing and beauty products despite the weather, but home sales rose 5% and electricals gained almost 10%. The performance was driven by the retailer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s online business, with sales on smartphones and tablet computers up 31%. Online accounted for 40% of John Lewis sales, with in-store sales estimated to be down. Waitrose The pressure on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supermarkets took its toll on Waitrose, the John Lewis Partnership\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upmarket grocer, which suffered a 1.4% fall in sales at established stores. Food retailers are being dragged down by fierce competition, changing shopping habits, and price deflation, which is the result of falling commodity prices and retailers battling over the price of essentials and seasonal favourites. Despite Waitrose suffering a decline, boss Mark Price said he believed the retailer had gained market share in December. Marks &amp; Spencer It was a tale of two Christmasses for Marks &amp; Spencer. Sales in the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s food business rose by 0.4% in shops open for more than year, but like-for-like sales in general merchandise, which is primarily clothing, slumped by 5.8%. Like his peers the M&amp;S chief executive Marc Bolland said the mild weather had weakened demand for winter clothing. Bolland also announced he would step down as boss of M&amp;S. Greggs The bakery chain saw a slowdown in year-on-year sales during the festive period, which it blamed on a strong period of trading the previous Christmas and a fall in visits to its high street stores. Poundland The discount retailer was another Christmas loser. Although Poundland sales rose 29.4% in the 13 weeks to 27 December, this included stores acquired through the \u00c2\u00a355m deal to buy 99p Stores and a swath of new stores that it has opened. Analysts estimated that sales at Poundland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s established stores had fallen by around 3%. As a result, Poundland warned that annual profits will now be at the lower end of expectations. Sports Direct A miserable month for Sports Direct was capped off by a shock profit warning. The company said that a fall in footfall on the high street and a unseasonal weather since its latest statement on 10 December meant that annual profits could miss the target of \u00c2\u00a3420m by as much as 10%. The profit warning followed an investigation by the Guardian into the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s treatment of workers, and analysts said this could have sparked a backlash by shoppers. House of Fraser The department store chain, now owned by Chinese conglomerate Sanpower, enjoyed a 5.3% year-on-year rise in sales at its established shops and online. Nigel Oddy, chief executive, said he was delighted with performance in the six weeks to 2 January. Oddy said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This year, we saw a very strong start to the key Christmas season with Black Friday being particularly strong online, with sales up 40% on the year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c our biggest online day ever. Our stores have also performed well over the festive period, in particular our recently refurbished stores which showed strong growth in the final week before Christmas.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd",

The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 rose 31.73 points or 0.54% to 5960.97 after earlier climbing as high as 6011 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.25% to 9960.96 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 0.3% at 4391.94 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB added 0.85% to 20,139.87 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 0.21% higher at 8934.5 In Greece, the Athens market edged 0.83% lower to 589.35 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down 135 points or 0.84%. On that note, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow for the Bank of England interest rate decision, a host of trading statements and all the other major financial developments. Ahead of Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of England interest rate announcement - when no change is pretty much nailed on - sterling dropped to a new five and a half year low of $1.4380 before recovering to $1.4455. Recent week data has suggested that an interest rate rise is now not likely until towards the end of the year, in contrast to the US Federal Reserve which has already made its first increase. Sterling has now lost around 6% in just a month, on concerns about the strength of the UK economy. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: In yet another reflection of the fragility of financial markets, what was expected to be a rare green day for the FTSE is becoming increasingly likely to turn red once more, as oil prices tumble in the wake of the US crude inventory number. A mix of strong Chinese trade data overnight, and an indication that Russian crude output could be cut in the coming months, managed to provide a lift with US crude prices rising relatively calmly and consistently. However, much like a house of cards, something that took the whole day to build has been blown down in the space of five minutes. The fact that a lower than expected US crude inventories figure would typically be supportive for oil prices goes to show that for now the oil market is finding buyers hard to come by in the face of such intense selling. The US figures also show that weekly gasoline stocks have jumped 8.4m barrels to 240.43m, compared to forecasts of a 2.7m increase. This is reportedly the biggest two week rise on record, and points to continuing weak demand. Another reason for the fall in crude prices once the figures were released. The EIA said: Total motor gasoline inventories increased by 8.4 million barrels last week, and are above the upper limit of the average range. Brent crude, which had earlier jumped as high as $31.92, has now slipped back 0.8% to $30.60 a barrel. US oil has dipped to as low as $30.31. Oil prices have slipped back after US crude stocks showed a weekly rise to levels not seen at this time of year for 80 years. The increase of 0.2m barrels was less than the forecast rise of 2.5m barrels but the Energy Information Administration figures contrast with those of the American Petroleum Institute, which said on Tuesday that crude stocks had unexpectedly fallen. In its report the EIA said: U.S. commercial crude oil inventories (excluding those in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve) increased by 0.2 million barrels from the previous week. At 482.6 million barrels, U.S. crude oil inventories remain near levels not seen for this time of year in at least the last 80 years. The US has followed other global markets by recording an opening rise, although it is not a particularly convincing one. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up around 53 points or 0.3%, while the S&amp;P 500 has climbed by a similar amount. Meanwhile former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers has told Bloomberg TV that he would be surprised if the world economy could comfortably withstand four hikes. He said: And I think that basically markets agree with me. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why despite the statements that are being made, markets aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expecting four hikes. If you ask if there are risk that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to find ourselves in a situation within the next two years where policy is going to have to reverse, yes. I think that is a significant risk. Rosengren also said (as reported by Reuters) that US central bankers faced challenges by hiking rates when other central banks were still easing (eg the ECB). He said this divergence of policy could make foreign exchange trading \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more volatile.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Following December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate rise by the US Federal Reserve, attention turned almost immediately to when the next one would be, and how many there could be in 2016 in total. The Fed indicated when it sanctioned dearer borrowing costs that there could be four quarter-point rises over the course of 2016. But since its December meeting things have changed somewhat, especially in China, and worries about a slowdown in global growth have increased. So Eric Rosengren, Boston Federal Reserve president, is now saying there may be a more gradual path for rate rises than is currently expected. The market rout in China and the falling oil price have added to concerns that global growth has slowed significantly, he told the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce. He said the Fed may now have to slow the rate of rate rises: I hope the economy continues to improve, so that further normalization is appropriate. It is important, however, to carefully manage risks to the economy, including those emanating from abroad. Further increases in rates are in my view likely to be gradual. While monetary policy should not overreact to short-term temporary fluctuations in financial markets, policy makers should take seriously the potential downside risk to their economic forecasts and manage those risks as we think about the appropriate path... Further tightening will require data continuing to be strong enough that growth will be at or above potential, so that Federal Reserve policymakers can be confident that inflation will reach our 2% target. On Monday Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart said he did not think there would be enough new data to be able to decide on another rate hike until at least April. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chart from Bloomberg showing the best and worst stock markets so far this year (yes, all 13 days of it): We had figures earlier showing that Greek inflation was rising faster than the eurozone average, and now Barclays had reduced its eurozone forecasts: City experts have been falling over themselves to predict how fall the oil price will fall, with Standard Chartered\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $10 a barrel the outlier at the moment. But the latest odds from Ladbrokes suggest that may be a step too far. The bookie is offering 4/1 on a fall below $25, 20/1 on below $20 and 100/1 on below $10. Ladbrokes Alex Donohue said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bearish oil speculators can cash in at an attractive fixed-odds price if the index plummets below $10 this year. The betting markets suggest such a fall is highly unlikely to happen however, with the odds favouring stability or even a rise from current prices.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More scepticism over the Chinese trade data. Sanjiv Shah, chief investment officer at Sun Global Investments, said: The higher export data may in part reflect past false transactions designed to overcome restrictions on transfers of currency outside the country. Recent data has shown sharp declines in foreign exchange reserves and independent estimates indicate a sharp increase in capital outflows in October and November. This means the level of exports in October and November may have been understated and the increase in exports in December is more apparent than real. However, if there has been a true and sustainable recovery in exports, this may relieve some of the pressure on yuan to weaken. It is too early to say that the decline in the yuan has led to a sustainable increase in China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s competitiveness and therefore a healthier path for Chinese exports. But given current weak trends on global growth and demand, there are still many grounds for scepticism on this point. Over to Greece, and the European Central Bank will only start buying the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt as part of its asset purchase scheme if Greece shows a strong commitment to its bailout programme. That comes from ECB president Mario Draghi ahead of a first review of the Greek programme due to start later this month. Reuters reports: Draghi added that even if the ECB waived the minimum credit rating requirement for Greek debt, the timing of possible asset purchases also depended on a set of additional factors linked to the program reviews and would be subject to various purchase limits. The Greek central bank earlier said that reinstating the waiver was on the agenda, raising hopes that Greece could soon be included in the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quantitative easing program. But sources close to the bank earlier said that the waiver is unlikely until it becomes clear that the first review, due to start later this month, is heading for success. The better than expected Chinese trade data has lifted European markets, with commodity companies leading the way. Oil has moved higher after briefly falling below $30 a barrel on Tuesday, with Brent crude now up nearly 2% at $31.46. Copper rose from a six and a half month low, up almost 1% after the Chinese figures, giving some respite to beleaguered mining company shares. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long deflationary spiral is over. Greek consumer prices rose by 0.4% annually in December (on a harmonised basis) which is the first upward move since February 2013. As this chart shows, Greek inflation (light grey) is rising faster than the eurozone average (dark blue). Thousands of jobs are being axed across Europe by General Electric, including in Germany, the UK and France. The US engineering giant is cutting staff following its acquisition of French firm Alstom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy division. The cuts include 765 positions in France and 1,700 in Germany, according to GE spokesman Renaud Petitjean. However, the French workforce should be protected by GE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to create one thousands extra jobs (a promise it made during the takeover). Petitjean told Bloomberg that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Any potential job that will be impacted in France will have to be replaced at the end of the period. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These positions, if we cancel them, will have to be recreated in addition to the 1,000 we promised to create.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That guarantee doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stretch to Britain, though, where Sky News says 660 jobs will go. Oh dear. Eurozone factories suffered falling output last November, according to the latest data from the region. Industrial output contracted by 0.7% during the month, reversing a recovery in October. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly due to weaker demand for energy, but manufacturers also reported that they made less heavy-duty machinery and long-lasting consumer products. Stats body Eurostat explains: Production of energy fell by 4.3%, capital goods by 1.9% and durable consumer goods by 1.0%, while production of non-durable consumer goods rose by 0.1% and intermediate goods by 0.7%. Fictional cat Mog should be lapping up a saucer of gold top milk this morning, after helping Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s beat City forecasts over Christmas. The clueless charming feline fronted up Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s festive adverts, and the move appears to have paid off. Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s posted total sales growth of 0.8% in the last 15 weeks. If you strip out new stores, like-for-like sales dipped by 0.4% - better than the 2% which had been expected. Good news for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second largest supermarket chain, as it tries to pull off a merger with Home Retail. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a boost for Save The Children, as my colleague Sean Farrell explains: The advert was viewed almost 37m times online and sales of a book and soft toy raised more than \u00c2\u00a31.5m for Save the Children, Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s said. Commodities are rallying this morning, pushing up the price of oil, copper, platinum and copper. Only gold is lagging, having benefitted from recent anxiety. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s China trade data should reassure some nervous investors, says Tom Rafferty of the Economist Intelligence Unit, despite question marks over their accuracy. The data is in line with other indicators that suggest China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is stabilising on the back of sustained stimulus measures, some of which have been targeted at the external sector. There will be some qualms expressed about the reliability of the data, given the weaker performance in December of other major Asian exporters. However, China has consistently outperformed the region in what was a difficult year for global trade. Rafferty also reckons China will avoid economic meltdown this year: Although cautious about trade prospects for 2016, but we expect a modest pick-up in global demand and a weaker renminbi to help lift China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s export value growth to 2%, folllowing the contraction last year. We forecast import value growth of 4% as domestic demand stabilises and distortions caused by the oil price fall in late 2014 drop out of the base comparison. Now this is important..... investors are anticipating that oil will remain low for several years. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s via Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil expert, Javier Blas: Troubled mining company Anglo American is the top riser in London, as the Footsie clambers back over the 6,000 point mark for the first time this week. Anglo is benefitting from China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s improved trade figures, which might suggest improved demand for commodities this year. Last year, its share price plunged by around 80% as the price of iron ore, copper and coal weakened. Other natural resource companies are also leading the rally, followed by oil giants BP and Royal Dutch Shell. They are getting a lift from this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rising oil price (see here) Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the FTSE 100 top risers this morning. The surprise 2.4% jump in Chinese exports last month suggests that the manufacturers are benefitting from a cheaper currency. And that might lead Beijing to conclude that they shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry about the yuan weakening: Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency strategist Kit Juckes says: I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help wondering if the positive response to a bounce in yuan-denominated export growth that is a reward for the Yuan depreciation strategy, won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just encourage more of the same. If a weaker currency pays dividends for China, as it did for others, then chances are, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see more competitive devaluation in the months ahead across Asia. Oil is staging a recovery this morning too, having hit 12-year lows yesterday. US crude oil has gained almost 2% to $30.97 per barrel, having plunged below the thirty dollar mark last night. Brent crude is hovering around $31.35 per barrel. European stock markets are rallying in early trading, as relief over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade figures ripples through the City. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 64 points, or 1%, to 5992. Mining companies are among the risers. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says the Chinese data, and a rally on Wall Street overnight, are boosting confidence, if only temporarily. This gives hope to the bulls that a bottom has been found and a short-term reversal is on the cards. Cynical City types often question whether China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic data can really be trusted, given the sheer challenge of assessing its economy (and the fear that officials could massage the figures to avoid causing ructions). And today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade report does include one curious element - a 10% surge in exports to Hong Kong. That means Hong Kong imported more from mainland China than the United States (!), and make the total exports data look much better. Some of this trade will certainly be genuine, with goods moving on from Hong Kong through the global economy. But this may also show that some companies have been fiddling the figures, and disguising speculative capital flows as routine trade. That would be bad for two reasons. a) Chinese trade would be less healthy, b) capital flight could be a bigger problem. Bloomberg has more details: Economists said the surprise gains may harken back to past instances of phony invoicing and other rules skirted to escape currency rules. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government said in 2013 said some data on trade with Hong Kong were inflated by arbitrage transactions intended to avoid rules, an acknowledgment that export and import figures were overstated. The increase in exports to Hong Kong and China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s imports from the city probably indicate \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fake invoicing,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Iris Pang, a senior economist for Greater China at Natixis SA in Hong Kong. Invoicing of China trade should be larger in December because of the wider gap between the onshore yuan and the offshore yuan traded in Hong Kong, she said. Surging China Trade With Hong Kong Raises Doubts Over Recovery Other Asian markets have performed well today, with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei jumping by almost 3%. It does appear that investors are a little less anxious about the state of the world economy today, after such a rough start to 2016. The Chinese stock market has suffered fresh losses today, despite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecast-beating trade figures. After an encouraging start, the Shanghai stock market suffered one of its traditional late selloffs. This wiped another 2.4% off the benchmark index, taking its losses in 2016 to a chunky 16.6%. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re now close to the depths plumped in last summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. While Europe was sleeping, China has wrong-footed analysts by reporting better-than-expected trade figures. There was a lot of anticipation that December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade figures would be an absolute shocker. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true that there are signs of weakness, with imports dropping by 4% year-on-year..... ....But exports surprisingly rose, by 2.3% in yuan-denominated terms. It may be a sign that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is coping better than feared. But Beijing remains cautious about the prospects for 2016: Customs spokesman Huang Songping warned at a news conference that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade faced \u00e2\u20ac\u0153many challenges\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in 2016 due to weak external demand, Reuters reported. One of the main reasons for China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lower exports in 2015 was weak external demand, he added. The 5% fall in the value of the yuan since last August had helped support exports but the impact would begin to fade, he said. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: China sees \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmany challenges\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in 2016 as trade slumps on weak external demand That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pushed shares up across Asia, and is expected to put Europe on the front-foot: Whether this is enough to prevent another day of turmoil in the commodity markets, though, remains to be seen. Oil is bobbing above the $30 per barrel mark this morning. Also coming up today, supermarket chain Sainsbury is updating the City on its financial results over Christmas. At first glance, they show that like-for-like sales fell 0.4% - better than analysts had feared. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

                "bodyText":"US stocks fell heavily on Wednesday, with the Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 500 falling 2.5% to take the index below 1,900 points for the first time since September, due to growing concerns about the falling oil price, which dipped below $30 a barrel for the first time in nearly 12 years. The S&amp;P 500, which closed at 1,890 points, suffered its worst day since September and has fallen by 10% since its November peak taking it into \u00e2\u20ac\u0153correction\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd territory, something that has not happened since August 2014. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped by 364 points, or 2.2%, to 16,151, and the Nasdaq composite dropped 159 points, or 3.4%, to 4,526. This deepened the New York stock exchange\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already worst start to a year on record. Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market declines were triggered by new figures showing US gasoline stockpiles had increased to record high, which caused Brent crude prices to fall as low as $29.96, their lowest level since April 2004, before settling at $30.31, a 1.8% fall. The oil price has fallen by 73% since a peak of $115 reached in the summer of 2014. Industry data showed that US gasoline inventories soared by 8.4m barrels and stocks of diesel and heating oil increased by more than 6m barrels \u00e2\u20ac\u201c confirming the forecasts of many analysts that a huge oversupply of oil could keep prices low during most of 2016. Analysts said that growing fears of a weakening outlook for the global economy, made worse by falling oil prices, was behind the steep falls. Some oil analysts this week predicted that the price could fall as low as $10. In recent days several analysts have warned that the global economy could suffer a repeat of the 2008 crash if the knock-on effects of a contraction in Chinese output pushes down commodity prices further and sparks panic selling on stock and bond markets. Amid the turmoil, a $48bn bond offer by brewer Anheuser-Busch Inbev \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to fund its takeover of SAB Miller \u00e2\u20ac\u201c attracted a record $110bn of offers as investors sought relatively safe investments. Earlier in the day China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market fell more than 2% after officials played down the significance of better-than-expected trade figures for December, saying exports could sink further before they find a floor. The numbers surprised the markets, where economists had been forecasting a much weaker reading. Traders were also cheered when the numbers were translated into the weakening local currency, the yuan, which showed exports reaching a record value in December, up 2% on the previous year. They appeared to offset gloomy predictions of a stock market rout in 2016 made by several investment bank analysts, including RBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit chief, Andrew Roberts. Roberts warned earlier this week of a possible 20% drop in stock markets and a period of turmoil that would knock the prospects for global GDP this year. His advice to investors was to sell everything except high quality bonds. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market rallied almost 20 points initially, but comments by officials that weak demand for Chinese goods would continue to hurt the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy in 2016 sent the Shanghai composite down 2.4% by the end of the trading period to 2949.

Oil recovered some ground after falling below $30 a barrel, with Brent crude currently 2% higher at $30.94, but investors are clearly still worried about the weakness in commodities and the outlook for China.</p> <p>More worries for the car industry, with Renault being raided, added to the downbeat mood and helped push the Dax and Cac - which have a number of listed carmakers - lower.</p> <p>Meanwhile US shares, after a weak start, recovered some of their recent losses, helped by dovish comments from Federal Reserve member James Bullard. Bullard had been pushing for rate rises and finally got his way in December, but a cautious speech in the wake of the oil price fall and the current market rout suggested he might be moderating his views on when further rate rises could be sanctioned.</p> <p>So the final scores in Europe showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 finished 42.74 points or 0.72% lower at 5918.23, having earlier touched a new five month low</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.67% to 9794.20</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 1.8% at 4312.89</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 1.67% to 19,803.41</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 1.64% lower at 8787.7</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market lost 2.62% to 573.92</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 191 points or 1.1% better.</p> <p>On Friday there are a number of economic figures which could add to the volatile mood. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got UK construction statistics due for release in the morning and these will be closely followed as they may offer some respite from the swathe of downbeat economic prints we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen of late. Also, US retail sales and consumer confidence numbers will be under scrutiny as the market looks for clues of any impact from the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate hike. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a rollercoaster session, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s certainly good to be finishing with losses that are so limited.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow.</em></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5697cb1de4b0ecd109f14aca\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-14T16:25:53.084Z\">4.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>With the US rally helping to pull European shares away from their worst levels, Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Markets remain stuck in a closely-fought contest between the optimists and pessimists, and while in Europe the latter still appear to be in charge, on Wall Street the buyers are back. Just as US markets yesterday torpedoed a nascent rally, today our American cousins are doing their best to stymie any further bearish momentum. Car makers dominate the news today, with Fiat Chrysler, Peugeot and Renault all hit hard, with the latter two due to an emissions investigation that doubtless has its roots in the VW scandal of 2015. As with banks, investors are learning that scandals do not tend to stop at one firm, and with car firms so prominent on the French and German exchanges, it is no surprise that the CAC and DAX remain firmly in the red.</p> <p>Oil prices are enjoying a rare pause in their downward slide, but it still looks to be only a matter of time before they continue their exploration of the $20 zone. The combination of bearish factors remains the key driver, with no hint of real production cuts coming from the key producers</p> <p>Further helping sentiment was a decent set of figures from JPMorgan, which rose 2%, with strict cost control helping and return on equity holding at a steady 9%.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5697c694e4b01b84906dcd9c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-14T16:03:06.066Z\">4.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A rebound in oil prices is helping markets recover some of their early losses.

                "bodyText":"A rally on Wall Street after Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump helped European shares come off their worst levels, but they still ended the day in the red. Oil recovered some ground after falling below $30 a barrel, with Brent crude currently 2% higher at $30.94, but investors are clearly still worried about the weakness in commodities and the outlook for China. More worries for the car industry, with Renault being raided, added to the downbeat mood and helped push the Dax and Cac - which have a number of listed carmakers - lower. Meanwhile US shares, after a weak start, recovered some of their recent losses, helped by dovish comments from Federal Reserve member James Bullard. Bullard had been pushing for rate rises and finally got his way in December, but a cautious speech in the wake of the oil price fall and the current market rout suggested he might be moderating his views on when further rate rises could be sanctioned. So the final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished 42.74 points or 0.72% lower at 5918.23, having earlier touched a new five month low Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.67% to 9794.20 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 1.8% at 4312.89 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 1.67% to 19,803.41 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 1.64% lower at 8787.7 In Greece, the Athens market lost 2.62% to 573.92 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 191 points or 1.1% better. On Friday there are a number of economic figures which could add to the volatile mood. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said; We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got UK construction statistics due for release in the morning and these will be closely followed as they may offer some respite from the swathe of downbeat economic prints we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen of late. Also, US retail sales and consumer confidence numbers will be under scrutiny as the market looks for clues of any impact from the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate hike. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a rollercoaster session, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s certainly good to be finishing with losses that are so limited. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. With the US rally helping to pull European shares away from their worst levels, Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said: Markets remain stuck in a closely-fought contest between the optimists and pessimists, and while in Europe the latter still appear to be in charge, on Wall Street the buyers are back. Just as US markets yesterday torpedoed a nascent rally, today our American cousins are doing their best to stymie any further bearish momentum. Car makers dominate the news today, with Fiat Chrysler, Peugeot and Renault all hit hard, with the latter two due to an emissions investigation that doubtless has its roots in the VW scandal of 2015. As with banks, investors are learning that scandals do not tend to stop at one firm, and with car firms so prominent on the French and German exchanges, it is no surprise that the CAC and DAX remain firmly in the red. Oil prices are enjoying a rare pause in their downward slide, but it still looks to be only a matter of time before they continue their exploration of the $20 zone. The combination of bearish factors remains the key driver, with no hint of real production cuts coming from the key producers Further helping sentiment was a decent set of figures from JPMorgan, which rose 2%, with strict cost control helping and return on equity holding at a steady 9%. A rebound in oil prices is helping markets recover some of their early losses. Brent crude is now up 2% at $31 a barrel. Did we mention volatile? The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now 161 points higher, helping pull European markets off their worst levels. The European Central Bank could cut its deposit rate further after last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reduction, according to the minutes of the December meeting, with inflation in danger of missing its targets. They said: A cut in the deposit facility rate of 10 basis points was seen as unlikely to trigger material negative side effects and was also seen as having the advantage of leaving some room for further downward adjustments. Economist Timo del Carpio at RBC Capital Markets said: The ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest Meeting Account reveals something of a rift within the Governing Council. However, while we already knew that support for action was not unanimous, the debate itself was not as\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbinary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as some might have assumed. In particular, at least some of those who argued against the proposed measures still favoured providing further stimulus of some kind. Thus, while we continue to judge that monetary policy settings will remain on hold at the forthcoming meeting, the actual policy debate looks set to remain as lively as ever, not least in the context of the renewed downside risks to inflation. After a brief attempt at a rally as Wall Street opened, US markets are following the rest of the world lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 59 points or 0.3% lower despite the oil market stablising. So the volatile pattern of recent days is continuing, with sentiment not helped by JP Morgan chief executive Jamie Dimon saying that the US economy could worsen after its recent growth. James Bullard, one of the members of the US Federal Reserve, has been keen to raise interest rates and got his way in December. But with many analysts believing the current market rout and worries about the Chinese economy should delay any further rises from the Fed, even Bullard is sounding more cautious. Reuters reports: The continued rout in global oil markets may have caused a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153worrisome\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd drop in U.S. inflation expectations that will make it harder for the Federal Reserve to reach one of its key policy targets, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said on Thursday. Since the dramatic fall in oil began in 2014 Fed officials have insisted the impact on U.S. price levels would be temporary, bottoming out at some point and allowing inflation to rise to the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2 percent target. Bullard said that in general he still feels that is the case, with low oil prices an overall \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bullish factor for the U.S.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that is supporting consumer spending and record levels of auto sales. But he said both market-based and long-term measures of inflation expectations have been declining, and their continued fall \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is becoming worrisome.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Household and business expectations about inflation are considered a key component determining actual price increases, and, if they become unmoored to the downside, could pull the rate of inflation lower in a way that is difficult to change. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Low inflation expectations may keep actual inflation lower, all else equal, making it more difficult for the Fed to return inflation to target,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bullard said. Over in the US, and the number of Americans claiming unemployment benefit rose unexpectedly last week. Initial jobless claims climbed by 7,000 to 284,000, compared with forecasts of a fall to 275,000. But this is the 45th week that claims have been below 300,000, confirming the view that the US jobs market is currently fairly robust. This follows the December non-farm payroll figures which showed a surge in job numbers. Meanwhile US import prices fell 1.2% in December, the sixth monthly decline as the effects of the collapse in oil prices continues to be felt. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, also reckons the BoE won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t raise rates in the next few months: He argues that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s simply not a strong reason to hike borrowing costs, given inflation is almost zero and wage growth just 2%. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The outcome of January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting points firmly away from a majority of the MPC favouring a rate rise anytime soon. Notably, none of the three criteria for considering a rate rise as set out by the Governor in a speech in July last year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c quarterly GDP growth in excess of 0.6%, a convincing pick-up in core inflation and a sustained rise in wage growth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are currently present. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Therefore, we stick with our view that the first hike is most likely to come towards the end of the year. If anything the recent global financial turmoil emphasises that the risks are skewed towards a longer period of inaction. So if not today, when might UK interest rates rise? Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management, reckons the Bank of England will sit tight until the EU referendum has been held - perhaps in June, or September. The recent decline in the oil price will have played a part in the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thinking, not so much because they see it as a signal of poor global growth prospects, but because it will keep inflation lower in 2016 than they would have expected a few months ago. On top of this, there have been some signs of weakness in the average earnings figures, which is an indicator on their key watch list. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Looking ahead, lower sterling should lead to rising import cost inflation, while the bulk of the labour market data is still relatively strong. There will be no interest rate hike ahead of the Brexit referendum however, given the uncertainties which the vote is already creating.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about the Renault raids that have given the markets a shunt: The UK government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to hold a referendum on EU membership may have helped weaken the pound this year, the Bank of England says. This is the key section from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minutes: The sterling effective exchange rate index (ERI) had fallen by around 3% since the fifteen-day average starting point used in the November Inflation Report projections. This appeared in part to be a reaction to the ECB policy decision on 3 December 2015. Since the start of 2016, however, some market contacts had additionally cited the forthcoming UK referendum regarding EU membership as a possible explanation for the depreciation of sterling. Option-implied sterling volatilities had risen and there had been an increase in the price of protection against the risk of sterling depreciation compared with the price of protection against an appreciation. The Bank of England also flags up that UK workers aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t getting large pay rises, with wage growth slowing to 2% last month. Despite continued reductions in the rate of unemployment, pay growth remains restrained and appears to have dipped slightly in the most recent data. Another reason not to dust off the rate-hike button today. The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minutes are online here. The Bank of England admits its latest inflation forecasts now look too optimistic, thanks to the tumbling oil price. In the minutes from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, it says: Twelve-month CPI inflation rose to 0.1% in November and is likely to rise modestly further in the coming months as some of the large falls in energy and food prices a year earlier drop out of the annual comparison. But the 40% decline in dollar oil prices means that the increase in inflation is now expected to be slightly more gradual in the near term than forecast in the Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s November Inflation Report projections. It also points to the turmoil in the markets: Recent volatility in financial markets has underlined the downside risks to global growth, primarily emanating from emerging markets. Breaking: UK interest rates have been left unchanged at 0.5%, extending a run dating back to March 2009. But it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t unanimous. The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate-setting committee was split 8-1, with Ian McCafferty continuing to push for higher borrowing costs. The prospect of a new chapter in the car emissions scandal has gone down very badly in Europe. The German DAX and French CAC are now both down at least 3%: Renault is leading the rout, with shares plunging by a fifth. Peugeot are down almost 7%. And in Frankfurt, Daimler are down 5.5%, BMW are off 4.5% and Volkswagen are down 4.6%. Shares in other European automakers are taking a tumble too: The Renault raids suggest that the emissions scandal which began at Volkswagen last year is spreading. French unions officials have confirmed that police visited Renault\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offices last week, and seized several computers. AFP has the details French anti-fraud detectives have raided several production sites of automaker Renault, unions said Thursday, possibly to investigate emissions foul play. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Agents from the (anti-fraud unit) DGCCRF intervened in various Renault sites last Thursday,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the CGT Renault union said in a tract. The probe targeted the sites\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 engine control units which suggests, the union said, that the raids \u00e2\u20ac\u0153are linked to the consequences of the Volkswagen rigged-engines affair\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They took the personal computers of several directors,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the union said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We yesterday (Wednesday) questioned management about this but received no reply,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Franck Daout, a representative of the CFDT union, told AFP. The CFDT said it had been alerted to the raids by some of its shop floor members. Contacted by AFP, neither the anti-fraud unit nor Renault\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s management had any comment. In the wake of the Volkswagen emissions scandal, Renault said last month that it would invest 50 million euros ($55 million) to bring the real emissions of its cars into line with those measured in official test conditions.  Renault is declining to comment on those reports of a fraud raid, Reuters says. Shares in French carmaker Renault just plunged 15%. The newswires are citing reports that the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offices were raided by police last week. Sterling has hit its lowest level against the euro in a year, as traders continue to anticipate that UK interest rates aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t being hiked anytime soon. One pound is now worth \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.3147, a level last seen in mid-January 2015. That means one euro is worth 76p. A weakening currency puts more pressure on the Bank of England to consider a rate hike, as it would push up the cost of imported goods. But it will be welcomed by British exporters for the same reason. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Caroline Hyde has blogged about this today, pointing out that fashion chain Burberry cited the weaker euro as a threat to its business this morning. She adds: So there we have it Mr Carney...get the pound to plummet. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what would make the business world happier. But of course central banks don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t target exchange rates now, do they...? Perish the thought.... Next week is Davos time, when politicians, policymakers, business leaders and other members of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcglobal elite\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 gather for their annual meeting in Switzerland. And climate change will be high on the agenda. The World Economic Forum has surveyed 750 experts, and found that the threat of global warming is even more serious than other dangers - such as weapons of mass destruction, water crises, mass involuntary migration and a severe energy price shock. Our economics editor Larry Elliott reports: The report, prepared by the WEF in collaboration with risk specialists Marsh &amp; McLennan and Zurich Insurance Group, comes a month after the deal signed in Paris to reduce carbon emissions. The WEF said evidence was mounting that inter-connections between risks were becoming stronger. It cited links between climate change and involuntary migration or international security, noting that these often had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153major and unpredictable impacts\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Cecilia Reyes, Zurich\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief risk officer, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Climate change is exacerbating more risks than ever before in terms of water crises, food shortages, constrained economic growth, weaker societal cohesion and increased security risks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Meanwhile, geopolitical instability is exposing businesses to cancelled projects, revoked licences, interrupted production, damaged assets and restricted movement of funds across borders. These political conflicts are in turn making the challenge of climate change all the more insurmountable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c reducing the potential for political cooperation, as well as diverting resource, innovation and time away from climate change resilience and prevention.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd New York\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market may stabilise today after Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout wiped 364 points (-2.2%) off the Dow Jones industrial average. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what the futures market is predicting when trading begins in four hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time: S&amp;P 500: 2 points higher at 1,892 Dow Jones: 32 points higher at 16,183 Nasdaq 100: 6 points higher at 4,189 There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plenty of time for this to change, though.... In around 90 minutes time, investors and economists will be poring over the minutes of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of England meeting. And while everyone expect interest rates to remain unchanged at 0.5% at noon, the question is now whether the BoE hikes this year. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says borrowing costs will remain unchanged for some time: In the current climate of tumbling oil prices, crashing stock markets and a likely next leg lower for inflation expectations, it is clear the UK rate hike forecasts continue to push further back day by day. In recent months, the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate-setting committee has been split 8-1, with Ian McCafferty a lone voice calling for rates to rise to 0.75%. But he might change his mind, given recent events. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency firm World First, predicts McCafferty will return to the fold today. Since the last meeting, oil markets have slumped \u00e2\u20ac\u201c crude oil traded below $30 a barrel for the first time in 12 years overnight \u00e2\u20ac\u201c global growth has slowed, equity markets have dipped and fears, rightly or wrongly, of a recession have increased..... This time last year, following a slump in oil prices, Ian McCafferty decided to stop voting for a rate increase having done so since the autumn. This is probably the key development in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. McCafferty has shown that he is willing to change his mind when the data changes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c something of which there is a woeful lack of in central banking \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and a unanimous vote for a hold at 0.5% will solidify pound at these low levels. Although Brent crude is clinging on above $30 this morning, its earlier tumble to $29.73 per barrel continues to pull markets down. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turning into a bad morning for the City (unless you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve shorted the market, of course): A strong Christmas performance from Tesco has not been enough to counter a wave of fear striking the FTSE 100 as oil prices slumped and travel stocks were sold off following terrorist attacks in Jakarta. Adding to concerns, the offshore Chinese yuan fell despite the PBOC setting a higher fix for the onshore rate as traders bet on future depreciation. There had been signs that the recovery was petering out in the past day or so but equities finally succumbed when Brent crude prices hit a 12-year low early Thursday. Glad to see my typos are causing amusement.... The attacks in Jakarta today (liveblog here) may also be weighing on shares today, although worries over the global economy appear to be the main driver. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, says: Investors have once again realised that nothing has changed and a bounce wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really warranted. A depressed oil price remains hindered by global oversupply and the prospect of it getting worse as Iran returns to market, while China jitters continue to shake everything from commodities to financials. Attacks such as those overnight in Jakarta are also becoming much too frequent even if markets have developed thicker skin.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff has pushed the FTSE 100 down to a five-month intraday low. The blue-chip index hit 5836 this morning, a level not seen since the Great Fall of China last summer. And it trading finished now, the Footsie would be at its lowest closing point since November 2012. Merlin, the theme park group, is leading the selloff after being downgraded by JP Morgan: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has recorded its fastest growth since the early days of the eurozoen eurozone debt crisis. New official figures show that GDP rose by 1.7% during 2015, the best result in four years. ING economist Carsten Brzeski says Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s solid recovery continues: It was yet another year in which the German economy defied earlier swan songs and, despite many headwinds like the Greek crisis, the slowdown in emerging markets and China and increased geopolitical uncertainties, continued the recovery. But this could be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as good as it gets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he adds. Without any new structural reforms and investments it is hard to see any sharp acceleration of the economy any time soon. Separate figures have shown that Germany also posted a budget surplus in 2015. I suspect will reassure many Germans, but irk commentators who believe Germany should be spending more to help the European economy pick up. The FTSE 100 is flirting with is now sporting a triple-digit point loss. The blue-chip index is down 110 points right now at 5849, a loss of almost 1.9%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a broad-based selloff, only defied by retailers such as Tesco who posted surprisingly good results this morning. The turbulent market conditions don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear to be going anywhere fast, warns analyst Tony Cross of Trustnet. Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s modest gains on the FTSE-100 have already been eclipsed as investors become increasingly nervous over the outlook for crude oil. Wall Street sold off heavily into the close last night and this is very much setting the pace, leaving the vast majority of London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue chip equities trading squarely in the red. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s markets are bathed in electronic red ink this morning, with major indices all losing at least 1%. Several UK retailers are defying the selloff. Tesco jumped almost 7% to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard after surprising the City with a jump in Christmas sales. Burberry are close behind, up 3%, after announcing sales growth in China again. And among smaller companies, JD Sports are up 5.3% after it said profits would beat expectations this year. Even Home Retail are up, gaining 3.6% despite warning that Argos sales were weak. Traders may be betting there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more chance that the company will succumb to a new takeover offer from Sainsbury..... And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re off! European market are falling sharply at the start of trading. In London, the FTSE 100 has slid by 73 points, or 1.2%, to 5887, following the losses in Asia earlier today and on Wall Street last night. Other European indices are down around 1.3%, hit by worries over the global economy and China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowdown. The FTSE 100 has now lost 5.5% of its value this month - a rough start to the year. Joe Brent of City firm Liberum explains why: In 2016, UK indices have suffered their worst start since 2008. There is plenty to worry about globally; China, emerging markets, commodity prices, monetary tightening, negative earnings momentum, high valuations and a tired looking bull market. Over in the City, the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policymakers are gathering to set monetary policy. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no chance of a rate rise, given the recent market turbulence and weaker economic data that has sent the pound to its lowest level against the US dollar since 2010. FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga says: Investor sentiment towards the Sterling continues to weaken ahead of the anticipated Bank of England (BoE) rate decision today, in which markets broadly expect rates to be left unchanged at the record 0.5% low. Since the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s December meeting, the overall outlook for the UK economy has dimmed considerably with a downwards revision of Q3 GDP and a decline in industrial productions renewing concerns around the potential slowdown in economic momentum in the United Kingdom. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mixed news from fashion chain Burberry this morning. On the upside, its sales in mainland China are growing again after a worrying slide last year. That helped send retail revenue up 1% in the last three months on 2015. On the downside, turnover in Hong Kong and Macau took a hit in the last quarter. CEO Chris Bailey says it was tougher than expected, as market upheaval hits demand for expensive coats and handbags. While Burberry was impacted by the ongoing challenges facing the luxury sector, headwinds in Hong Kong and Macau masked an otherwise stronger performance in many markets. Home Retail has warned that poor sales at its Argos chain would hit group profits. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s significant, as the company only recently rebuffed a takeover bid from Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. My colleague Julia Kollewe has the details: Argos posted a 2.2% fall in like-for-like sales in the 18 weeks to 2 January, worse than analysts had expected. Walk-in sales slumped 13% in December, with shopping centre and high street stores badly hit, which was only partly offset by 10% growth in digital sales. Home Retail\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other chain Homebase enjoyed 5% growth, boosted by kitchen and bathroom products. The company confirmed that is in advanced discussions to sell the DIY chain to Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wesfarmers for \u00c2\u00a3340m. City analysts are impressed with Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Christmas performance: On a busy morning for retail news, Tesco is grabbing the headlines. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest supermarket has defied its critics by reporting a 1.3% rise in sales over the Christmas period. It suggests CEO Dave Lewis is making good progress in his labours to turn the company around. My colleague Fiona Walsh explains: Tesco cheered the City with news of a much stronger than expected performance over Christmas, pushing sales in its core UK supermarkets business up by 1.3%. Most analysts had been expecting sales to fall. Chief executive Dave Lewis said the group, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest retailer, had benefitted from lower prices on what he called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an outstanding range of products.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brent crude is bobbing around $30.50/barrel this morning, after hitting $29.73 last night. That means motorists should be able to look forward to cheaper fuel costs, given that crude has lost a third of its value since December. Industry body RAC insists that fuel prices should follow suit. Spokesman Simon Williams said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With no apparent end in sight to the free-falling price of oil, motorists can expect some really low fuel prices in 2016. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Breaking through the pound a litre price point for both petrol and diesel was clearly a welcome landmark, but it looks as though there is more to come. In fact we may get to a bizarre time when a litre of fuel is cheaper than a litre of some bottled waters.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Angus Nicholson of IG has warned that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a negative feedback loop of self-perpetuating fear seems to have gripped global markets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as shares dive across Asia. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff is also being driven by renewed fears over the situation in China, and the possibility that Beijing will devalue the yuan sharply. Angus explains: China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor communication of FX (foreign exchange) policy and concomitant selloff in its equities appear to have lit a fire of negativity beneath global market sentiment. The threat of a dramatic devaluation by the Chinese government to ease its deflationary and debt-related pressures hangs heavy on markets like a Sword of Damocles. Despite China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s successful efforts this week to regain control over the offshore renminbi, the possibility of a major one-off devaluation in the currency is probably far higher than a black swan tail risk event. The fact that it is reportedly even being discussed by People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of China (PBoC) advisors likely assigns it a probability as high as 20%. Pessimism has swept through Asia today, sending markets down to a three-year low. The sight of Brent crude oil below $30/barrel prompted big losses across the major indices. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei tumbled by 4% at one state, and finished the day down 474 points (down 2.7%) at 17,240. The Australian market shed 1.5%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Tin hats on, chaps. It could be a rough day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading in the stock markets, after the latest slide in the oil price hits confidence. Last night, Brent crude oil fell through $30 per barrel for the first time since 2004, after new inventory figures showed that US gasoline stockpiles had hit a record high. That sent Wall Street traders into a selling frenzy last night, as my colleague Rupert Neate explains: US stocks fell heavily on Wednesday, with the Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 500 falling 2.5% to take the index below 1,900 points for the first time since September, due to growing concerns about the falling oil price, which dipped below $30 a barrel for the first time in nearly 12 years. The S&amp;P 500, which closed at 1,890 points, suffered its worst day since September and has fallen by 10% since its November peak taking it into \u00e2\u20ac\u0153correction\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd territory, something that has not happened since August 2014. Asian markets have already taken a bath, and Europe is expected to follow suit. Spread-betters are calling the FTSE 100 down over 1%: And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big day for corporate news, with a flurry of retailers reporting Christmas trading. That includes Tesco, Home Retail, Burberry, JD Sports, ASOS, Associated British Foods (which owns Primark), Mothercare, Moss Bros and SuperGroup. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll do our best to cover them all.",

                "bodyText":"With this, we are closing up for the day. Have a great weekend, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back on Monday. Stock markets have fallen sharply following poor US retail sales and industrial production data which point to slower economic growth at the end of 2015. Markets were already spooked by the continued slump in oil prices. On Wall Street, the Dow shed more than 400 points, a drop of 2.3%, and the Nasdaq is nearly 120 points off, a 2.7% decline. The FTSE 100 index is down 2.1%, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC is off 2.8% and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has lost nearly 3%. Oil prices have hit fresh 12-year lows. Brent crude has been below $30 a barrel for most of the day, and was down nearly 5% at one stage. Some currency investors are betting against sterling in the derivatives markets on the assumption that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd referendum will be held this summer. Reuters is reporting that options market pricing shows a jump in the cost of hedging against volatility between six and nine months from now. Another bad day on the markets. The FTSE 100 index is now trading 1.9% lower, a fall of more than 115 points to 5804.32. The Dax in Frankfurt has tumbled 2.8% while the CAC in Paris has lost 2.4%. Wall Street has opened sharply lower: the Dow lost more than 350 points, a 2.1% fall, in the first few minutes of trading. The Nasdaq is down 2.6%. The US industrial production data are also bad. Output fell for the third month in a row, by 0.4% in December, after a downwardly revised 0.9% decline in November. Production was held back by a strong dollar and cutbacks made by energy firms in the wake of plunging oil prices. Taken together with the worse-than-expected retail sales figures, they paint a worse economic picture in the last three months of 2015. Steve Murphy, US economist at Capital Economics, said the retail sales figures point to fourth-quarter GDP growth of 1% annualised. All things considered, it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear that the record warm temperatures in December or the latest downward leg in gasoline prices are boosting spending in any meaningful way. We now estimate that real consumption growth was a disappointing 1.5% to 2% annualized in the fourth quarter, with overall GDP growth at an even weaker 1%.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Neil Saunders, who heads up retail consultants Conlumino, said retail sales were held back by discounting and a lacklustre performance of many key holiday categories. Retailers had to work hard to persuade consumers to spend money. There are a number of explanations for the December pure retail number not being higher. The first of these is that the comparative from last year was fairly tough... A relatively weak product line up in electricals failed to capture consumer interest, resulting in a sales decline of around 3.5% in December; and although sales picked up the latter end of the month, clothing also put in a lackluster performance thanks to warmer than average weather. The third and final factor is discounting, which was more widespread and deeper this year than last: while this probably helped to stimulate some spending activity, it did not result in huge volume uplifts; as such, the net effect was to dampen overall sales growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He sums up 2015 thus: Retail is now best described as being in a state of respectable but constrained growth. Despite consumer finances improving and despite consumers having more money to spend this is not consistently finding its way into cash registers. Retailers are having to work increasingly hard to persuade consumers to part with their cash.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd US retail sales for December were disappointing, said ING economist Rob Carnell, who found the figures somewhat puzzling. There is no single explanation for the weakness. Warmer than usual weather may heve reduced spending on seasonal clothing, but doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t explain why auto sales were so much at odds with other auto sales data which are very strong. Falling electronics sales are also hard to explain, as is food, miscellaneous sales, and general merchandise.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Factory gate prices also fell in December, by 0.2%, reflecting sharp drops in energy costs, according to the US Labor Department. This could dampen expectations that inflation will rise towards the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target. Over 2015 as a whole, producer prices fell 1%, the weakest reading since the series started in 2010. US retail sales slipped 0.1% in December, wrongfooting economists who had forecast no change. Unusually warm weather meant retailers struggled to shift winter clothes, and cheaper gasoline dragged down sales at service stations. The November retail sales figure was revised higher to 0.4%, the US Commerce Department said. More worryingly, retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services (which can be volatile), fell 0.3% last month, following a 0.5% rise in November. Royal Bank of Scotland chairman Howard Davies has put the probability of Britain exiting the European Union at 35% in an interview with Bloomberg Television. This probability assessment is based on a review of all the polls and also reflects what RBS economists think, Davies said. You cannot be sure how a referendum like this can go, the polls currently will tell you that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a small majority in favour of remaining, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very volatile environment. And what the polls also will tell you is that the thing people most worry about is immigration in some form, and of course if you had a referendum at a time when immigration was in the news, when the evening bulletins were full of boats across the Atlantic, or there was some great terrorist attack attributed to migrants, this could affect public opinion a lot. So I think there will be all kinds that will play into that decision when it comes which will not be fully rational based on an analysis of the impact on the City of London.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd On China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic slowdown, he said: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re adjusting to that changed role of the Chinese economy, or changed growth rate, and of course the peripheral economies around China which will be affected in the same kind of way.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here are the key points of the interview: Brexit: \u00e2\u20ac\u015335% probability\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd His pessimism about UK / European investment banking Downsizing of RBS investment bank is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153going well\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Banks are more constrained in bets they can take There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an adjustment to Chinese growth There are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fault lines\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in world economy Davies also talked about his lunch with David Bowie, who died on Sunday, and Iggy Pop in east Berlin in the 1970s: [Bowie] was worried about travelling around east Berlin as he was, and so he approached the British authorities. And as it happened, a friend of mine was in the British Embassy in east Berlin, and I was staying there for the weekend. And we escorted him around in a British diplomatic car and had lunch in the Bertolt Brecht restaurant.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Institute of Directors has sent us their response to the news that two former bosses of the Co-operative Bank, including its ex-CEO, have been banned from holding senior positions in the City. Simon Walker, director general of the IoD, said there was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 clearly also a failure on the part of the whole board\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This is further proof that the leadership of the Co-operative Bank in the run up to its spectacular failure was woefully lacking in the skills, knowledge, and decision-making needed for a major financial institution. It is stark reminder that even brands which carry a positive public reputation can have it snatched away from them if their corporate governance isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t up to scratch. Non-executive directors are there to constructively challenge executives on their actions. Where they do not, as at the Co-op, it can be to the great detriment of the organisation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employees and customers. The Co-op traded on its reputation as an ethical and reliable bank, but while senior executives and the board may have believed their own hype, they manifestly failed to embody these principles, with devastating results.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The IoD believes training for non-executives, including trustees of charities and third sector organisations, is vital for good governance and holding executives to account. It is launching a new course for charity trustees on May. Russia has poured cold water on the idea of co-ordinated oil output cuts with Opec, the oil cartel, to prop up plunging oil prices. Brent crude is holding below the $30 a barrel mark on Friday, down 4% on the day. A global oil glut has pushed prices more than 70% lower over the past 18 months. Russian energy minister Alexander Novak said it is unlikely that such cuts would be agreed, adding that they would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not be efficient\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in any case. The RIA news agency quoted Novak as saying in an interview with RBC TV: From our point of view, it is unlikely that all the countries within OPEC can agree on production cuts, let alone those countries which are not in the Opec coalition. Such consultations have been underway for the past year and a half since oil prices started to fall in mid-2014. [But] we see that in 2015 countries like Saudi Arabia in Opec have increased total production by 1.5m barrels per day.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Opec meeting ended without an agreement on how to shore up oil prices and some members of the cartel urged Russia to reduce its own output. In the past, Russia has argued that its harsh climate makes it hard to restart production once wells have been closed. We said earlier that the Shanghai Composite index had entered bear market territory, joining the rest of China. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth noting that the CSI 300 index, which comprises the top 300 stocks of the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets, has been there for some time. The Bank of England has banned the former boss of the Co-operative Bank, Barry Tootell, from holding a senior banking job. The lender nearly collapsed under the weight of its debts. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Prudential Regulation Authority also banned Keith Alderson, a former managing director of the Co-op Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corporate and business banking division. Both men also received fines. It is the first time the chief executive of a bank has been banned over their role during the financial crisis. PRA chief executive Andrew Bailey said: This action makes clear that there are serious consequences for senior individuals who fall short of the PRA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expectations. The new Senior Managers Regime, which will be introduced in March, will further ensure that senior managers are held duly responsible for their actions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shares are still tumbling, with the FTSE 100 index in London down 72.24 points, or 1.2%, at 5845.99. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has lost 0.9% while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC is 1.2% lower. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, has this reassuring message. Here in the UK, the energy regulator has accused the big six energy firms of overcharging customers. They haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cut their retail prices despite plunging wholesale prices on international markets. The Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy editor Terry Macalister writes: The big six energy companies including SSE, npower and E.ON have made no recent announcements about cutting retail prices although British Gas did reduce its tariff by 5% last August. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think they are overcharging in many cases,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the head of Ofgem Dermot Nolan told BBC Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today programme. There should be bigger cuts in retail energy bills, he added. This list of the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main trading partners published by Eurostat shows the rising importance of the US, while there is less trade with Russia (unsurprisingly). Exports to the US grew 20% in the first 11 months of last year versus the same period in 2014, while sales to Russia slumped 29%. The healthier November trade data have raised hopes that a stronger trade performance boosted the economy as a whole and helped eurozone GDP growth improve in the fourth quarter of 2015, wrote Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight. The eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus with the rest of the world widened in November, according to preliminary figures from Eurostat. It rose to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac23.6bn in November, from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20.1bn a year earlier. Exports of goods to the rest of the world rose 6% while imports grew 5%. The surplus on trade within the 19-nation currency bloc reached \u00e2\u201a\u00ac145.7bn, from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac138.5bn a year earlier. Brent crude has just fallen to a fresh 12-year low of $29.46 a barrel. On a lighter note, with global stock markets sliding and savings rates at record lows, the best investment at the moment could be a handbag. My colleague Sean Farrell writes: Not just any handbag, though. The accessory in question is the Hermes Birkin, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most coveted bag, which can cost up to \u00c2\u00a3150,000 new. In the 35 years since the actor and singer Jane Birkin sat next to Hermes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 boss Jean-Louis Dumas on a plane and complained about not being able to find a good leather weekend bag, the Birkin bag has beaten returns for gold and the benchmark US S&amp;P 500 index, according to the luxury bag retail site Baghunter. Read the full piece here. Back to oil, which is still below $30 a barrel. It hit $29.73 at one stage, the lowest since February 2004, and is now trading at $29.89 a barrel. The International Atomic Energy Agency could issue its report on Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s compliance with an agreement to rein in its nuclear programme during a meeting in Vienna on Friday, whereupon western sanctions could be lifted and open the door to more oil supply from Iran. The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil exports are already on track to hit a nine-month high in January, at 1.1m barrels a day. Analysts at Commerzbank said: With sanctions on Iran likely to be lifted, more oil is flooding the markets. Although the additional supply had been imminent for some time, current sentiment ought to send prices further south.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd They cut their 2016 forecast for oil prices to $50 per barrel for Brent by the end of the year, down from a previous forecast of $63. Sterling has hit a 5 1/2 year low against the dollar again, as traders are growing doubtful over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic outlook and the timing of the first rate hike \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which some don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect until early next year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and fears over \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd intensify. Prime minister David Cameron has promised a referendum on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s membership of the EU by the end of 2017, but it may come as early as June this year. Volatility in markets is likely to increase in the run-up to the poll. The pound slipped 0.5% to $1.4337 earlier, its weakest level since May 2016. It has lost more than 6% in the past six months. It also lost ground against the euro. The euro rose 0.7% to 75p, not far off a one-year high of 76.06p it hit on Thursday. The Bank of England said that British banks saw a notable rise in demand for personal loans and other unsecured credit in late 2015, and this is expected to continue into this year. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit conditions survey said banks were awarding more unsecured lending to households as lenders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 appetite for risk grew. The increase in unsecured credit availability appeared particularly apparent in other unsecured lending, such as personal loans, where credit scoring criteria were reported to have loosened.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The latest data show that net unsecured consumer credit climbed to \u00c2\u00a31.5bn in November from \u00c2\u00a31.2bn in October, taking it to its highest level since February 2008. It was the ninth month running that unsecured consumer credit had been over \u00c2\u00a31bn. Construction output fell 0.5% in Britain in November from October as firms took on fewer new work, according to official figures out just now. Production was down 1.1% on a year ago. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European lenders are expected to start a review of Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reform programme next week, although talks on debt relief may still be several months away. Before those talks start, Greece needs to conclude a first review of reforms agreed last summer under its third bailout programme with its lenders, which include the EU executive and the International Monetary Fund. European Commission vice president Valdis Dombrovskis said in an interview with Greek daily Kathimerini: We are ready to the start the review as soon as possible, most likely next week. But we are not setting any time limit for when the review should be concluded.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dombrovskis said that to secure a positive progress review, Greece needs to implement pension reform, set up a new privatisation fund and find ways of achieving primary budget surpluses for 2016 to 2018. He said: If Greece concludes the review, it will show it is serious with its promises, its programme is on track and this would be a very positive step so that stability is restored.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Greece and some eurozone officials have said the review could be finished next month, but Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the chairman of eurozone finance ministers, cautioned on Thursday that it could be months rather than weeks. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos believes an agreement could be reached within four weeks. He has been touring eurozone capitals to explain the reforms and drum up support for an early conclusion to the review. Dombrovskis said the European Commission is assuming that the IMF will once again be part of the bailout. The Washington-based fund provided financing for Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first two bailouts in 2010 and 2012. But IMF chief Christine Lagarde has said that the fund will probably only decide in the spring whether to take part in the third bailout. She told Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s S\u00c3\u00bcddeutsche Zeitung that the issues of debt sustainability and progress on pension reforms will be key. It is clear that pension reform is the trigger that will prove that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic position is improving.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The IMF has not provided any aid to Athens since August 2014 under a previous programme that is due to expire next March. Brent crude has fallen below $30 a barrel again, losing one dollar to $29.88 a barrel, a 3.2% drop. Independent City analyst Nick Bubb says about Bonmarch\u00c3\u00a9, which already lowered its profit estimates in mid-December and stuck to that guidance on Friday: Back on Dec 16th, poor old Bonmarch\u00c3\u00a9 was one of the first fashion retailers to warn that trading conditions during November and early December had been very challenging and since then that story has been well played out. Interestingly, however, Beth Butterwick, (the soon-to-be-departed CEO), says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the short period since Christmas, demand has trended towards more normal levels\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (which bears out the message from the recent John Lewis sales figures.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The latest John Lewis figures out this morning were strong, showing sales rising 15.6% last week year-on-year (against a sluggish week a year ago), driven by electrical goods (up 18.8%) and fashion (15.4%). Online sales were also strong, rising nearly 26%. After Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flurry of retail news, Friday is much quieter. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a round-up of the main corporate news. The competition regulator has given the final clearance for BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contentious \u00c2\u00a312.5bn takeover of EE, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest mobile phone network, reports Sean Farrell. You can read more here. The Competition and Markets Authority said it did not expect the takeover to lead to a substantial reduction in competition or detriment to consumers in any market in the UK, including mobile and broadband services. It said there was little overlap between BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mainly fixed phone, broadband and pay-TV business and EE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mobile phone operation. The merger was also unlikely to make things worse for other operators using BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s network. UK housebuilder Bovis Homes is leading gains on the FTSE 250 index, rising 3.4% to 953p, after posting record profits for 2015. The company delivered 3,934 homes last year, which represents an increase of over 8% from 2014. The average selling price rose 7% to \u00c2\u00a3231,000. Like its peers, Bovis is confident about the housing market, which is underpinned by government-backed initiatives such as help to buy. H&amp;M said it had a good December, with sales up 10% year-on-year. In November, mild weather in north America and Europe put customers off buying winter clothing at the Swedish retailer and sales rose only 4%. Bonmarch\u00c3\u00a9, the UK bargain fashion retailer who targets women over 50, fared less well. Like-for-like sales were down 1.3% in the quarter to 26 December. Simon Smith, chief economist at broker FxPro, says 2016 so far has been a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153terrible year for global stock markets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. According to unofficial theory a 20% decline in a stock index means that it has entered an official bear market and we saw this from the Shanghai Composite overnight following another 3.5% loss. The end of the week in Asia has seen emerging markets record their third weekly loss in a row and the same can be said for some European markets. This is now starting to be reflected in profit forecasts for S&amp;P companies across the pond where we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing the most downgrades to earnings compared to upgrades since 2009. Crude prices are also lower overnight but for all the talk about whether oil will fall to $20 or whether it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t we have to remember that commodities entered their massive bear market by the 20% measure as far back as 2014.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd European stock markets are also in the red, half an hour after the open. UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index down 0.08% at 5913.19 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax down 0.4% at 9757.21 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC down 0.6% at 4287.36 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex down 0.6% at 8732.50 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MiB down 1% at 19,592.78 This means that the Shanghai Composite index, which recorded its lowest close since December 2014, is now in a bear market. It has lost more than 20% from its recent high on 22 December. A bear market is defined as a drop of 20% or more from a recent high. The tech-focused Shenzhen Composite, which finished 3.4% lower at 1,796.1, already entered a bear market a week ago, and is now down 24.5% from its recent 22 December high. Asian stock markets finished in the red. The Shanghai Composite lost 3.5% to 2902.22 The Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 Index shed 3.2% to 3118.73 Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei slipped 0.5% to 17,147.11 Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng fell 1.2% to 19,587.58 On the agenda today: UK construction figures for November and the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit conditions survey, both out at 9:30 GMT. Eurozone trade figures for November at 10 GMT; US retail sales for December at 13.30 GMT and US industrial production for December at 14.15 GMT. European car sales figures are out. They show that Volkswagen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market share in Europe fell last year for the first time since 2007 as the emissions rigging scandal took its toll. VW accounted for 24.8% of new cars sold in Europe compared with 25.5% in 2014, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Association in Brussels. The industry as a whole had a good year, with sales jumping 9.2% to a six-year high of 14.2m vehicles, compared with VW\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 6.2% increase. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest carmaker has lost ground to rivals such as Fiat Chrysler, BMW and Daimler since the scandal broke in mid-September and put consumers off buying its cars. Bloomberg has all the details. The ACEA said all major car markets had a strong finish to 2015. Spain (+20.7%), Italy (+18.7%) and France (+12.5%) posted double-digit percentage gains during the month, followed by the UK (+8.4%) and Germany (+7.7%), which also performed better than in December 2014. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Brent crude is continuing its slide, trading down 1.85% at $30.31 a barrel at the minute. New York Light crude is down even more, losing 3% to $30.27 a barrel. The market is bracing itself for more supply from Iran. Western sanctions on the country are expected to be lifted within days, after a historic nuclear deal with Tehran was reached last summer. Brent is heading for a weekly loss of about 10%. Mining giant BHP Billiton has been forced to write down the value of its onshore American oil and gas assets by more than 30% in the wake of the slump in crude oil prices. Fresh pressure on oil prices and poor Chinese lending data pushed Asian stocks to 3 1/2 year lows on Friday. New lending by Chinese banks was weaker than expected in December and well down on the previous month. Banks extended 597.8bn yuan ($90.76bn) of new loans in the final month of 2015, fuelling concerns that Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to boost borrowing via monetary easing are not transmitting to the real economy. Li Huiyong, an economist at Shenyin &amp; Wanguo Securities in Shanghai, said: The fall in new yuan loans showed there was little demand for investment and reflected sluggish economic performance in the real economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd",

But, in common with its peers, 2016 has been a different story so far and its shares are down 6%. Still they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re trading around $98, which is way above the social media group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $38 issue price at the time of its Wall Street flotation in 2012.</p> <h2>Amazon</h2> <p>Amazon shares, which finished 2015 122% up on the previous year, have also been losing ground in the first few days of 2016. The Amazon share price, which has touched $700 in the past three months, has now dived under $600 as investors worry that founder Jeff Bezos might ramp up investment in the group again rather than restrict it in order to boost profitability.</p> <h2>Netflix</h2> <p>Netflix shares, which have hovered around $130 in the past three months, have come perilously close to dropping below $100 this week. The nervousness comes in line with the sector but also reflects nervousness over subscriber numbers. Netflix recently announced an earlier-than-expected expansion into 130 new countries, including India and Russia.</p> <h2>Alphabet (formerly known as Google)</h2> <p>Alphabet, the company created last year to become the parent for Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s search engine and several other companies it owns, is also seeing some weakness, with its shares trading at just under $700 after being around $750 towards the end of last year. Its market capitalisation, though, at $482bn, is fast catching up with Apple.</p> <h2>Twitter</h2> <p>Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price has been hitting all-time lows of around $18, well below the $26 price at the time of its flotation in November 2013. Investors are worried about the messaging platform\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowing user growth and they aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet sold on the idea of adding a service that would adapt its 140 character model.<br></p> <h2>Apple</h2> <p>Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have drifted down from around $120 to $96 since November last year as concerns have grown over iPhone sales. The technology giant is scaling back orders for its previously hot-selling device. But it remains the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest company by market capitalisation, at about $550bn.</p>",

Glancy, Prongay and Murray, a Los Angeles-based law firm, alleges in its class action lawsuit that GoPro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s management statements since July 2015 have been false and misleading \u00e2\u20ac\u201c specifically with reference to sales of the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hero camera range. For others, the extreme market reaction to problems in the delivery of one product is a very good reason to remain in the private sector and not float. Suranga Chandratillake, a partner at Balderton, an investor in companies such as Betfair, Wonga and The Hut, said the huge share price reaction was down to one product not working out as expected: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While that is not a good thing, the reaction seems extreme and is typical of public markets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c extreme enthusiasm/pessimism around technology companies.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That overreaction, he says, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is one of the big drivers of why many big tech companies, such as Uber and AirBnb, are choosing to stay private. It allows them to stay agile, build for the long term,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. GoPro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement came in the middle of a difficult week for US technology stocks. Over the last week both Fitbit, the exercise monitor, and Etsy, the digital crafts marketplace, have sunk to all-time share price lows. Shares in the larger technology companies are also well down on their three-month highs. Facebook was trading at $95 on Friday afternoon, compared with $107 at the end of December. Netflix is down from $130 to around $103, and Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are trading at around $570 compared with $694 at the end of 2015. GoPro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s management and investors will be hoping its next products can revitalise its flagging stock. The company is expected to launch a new line of products in the first half of 2016, including a flying camera. Should that catch on, investors could return. Woodman tried to remain optimistic, when he addressed employees by email after the news of the revenue shortfall. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the type of day we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re used to at GoPro. But from the looks of things \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 tomorrow is looking pretty damn good.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd How the tech giants have fared All the major US technology groups have suffered from share price falls, along with the market, so far this year. Facebook Shares in Facebook performed strongly in 2016, finishing the year 33% up. But, in common with its peers, 2016 has been a different story so far and its shares are down 6%. Still they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re trading around $98, which is way above the social media group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $38 issue price at the time of its Wall Street flotation in 2012. Amazon Amazon shares, which finished 2015 122% up on the previous year, have also been losing ground in the first few days of 2016. The Amazon share price, which has touched $700 in the past three months, has now dived under $600 as investors worry that founder Jeff Bezos might ramp up investment in the group again rather than restrict it in order to boost profitability. Netflix Netflix shares, which have hovered around $130 in the past three months, have come perilously close to dropping below $100 this week. The nervousness comes in line with the sector but also reflects nervousness over subscriber numbers. Netflix recently announced an earlier-than-expected expansion into 130 new countries, including India and Russia. Alphabet (formerly known as Google) Alphabet, the company created last year to become the parent for Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s search engine and several other companies it owns, is also seeing some weakness, with its shares trading at just under $700 after being around $750 towards the end of last year. Its market capitalisation, though, at $482bn, is fast catching up with Apple. Twitter Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price has been hitting all-time lows of around $18, well below the $26 price at the time of its flotation in November 2013. Investors are worried about the messaging platform\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowing user growth and they aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet sold on the idea of adding a service that would adapt its 140 character model. Apple Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have drifted down from around $120 to $96 since November last year as concerns have grown over iPhone sales. The technology giant is scaling back orders for its previously hot-selling device. But it remains the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest company by market capitalisation, at about $550bn.",

Proposals put forward by the leftist led administration have been quick to elicit howls of protest with demonstrators taking to the streets.</p> <p>The IMF, which has yet to decide whether it wants to be even part of a third bailout programme for Greece (<em>a topic expected to dominate talks when prime minister Alexis Tsipras meets the IMF chief Christine Lagarde on the margins of the Davos gathering later this week</em>) has been especially tough amid mounting speculation \u2013 and leaks \u2013 that the proposals, a particularly sensitive issue given the hardship of austerity and recession, are wholly inadequate.</p> <p>In an unusual fit of pique, the usually mild-mannered finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos appeared to draw a line in the sand this afternoon. The IMF had to make clear whether it stood by the leaks or not, he said. <br>  \u201cI want the IMF to clarify whether these are really its own leaks or the imagination of journalists,\u201d he said of the reports that the body had roundly rejected the government\u2019s plan. \u201cI have been given no such notification \u2026 if [the reports are right] I expect it in writing,\u201d he told reporters adding that both sides had agreed that the negotiations would not be conducted through leaks. </p> <p>Racheting up the pressure the Oxford-educated economist insisted that while Athens was open to discussion it also had its own red lines. </p> <blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cIt is very important that pensions are not reduced for a 12th or 13th time for social and economic reasons.\u201d </p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> <br>The red-hot issue is like to dominate what may well be a wrenching time ahead. Lenders behind the biggest bailout in global financial history signaled today through the European Commission that mission chiefs would not be returning to Greece before they received clarification on the proposals.  It could only be a matter of time before the euro zone crisis erupts again. &lt;end&gt;</p> <p><strong>And on that note, we\u2019re wrapping up.

                "bodyText":"And on a final note, tough negotiations between debt-stricken Greece and its creditors over further cost-cutting measures has once again \u2013 alas - got off to a rocky start as the role of the International Monetary Fund comes under scrutiny. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens Before they had even begun, tensions between Greece and the Washington-based IMF had overshadowed the arrival of the first technical teams in Athens today. This latest round of talks \u2013 the prelude, the government hopes, to completion of a review that will open the way to the much-anticipated debate on debt relief \u2013 hinges to great degree on the government forging ahead with its commitment to reform the country\u2019s pension system. Proposals put forward by the leftist led administration have been quick to elicit howls of protest with demonstrators taking to the streets. The IMF, which has yet to decide whether it wants to be even part of a third bailout programme for Greece (a topic expected to dominate talks when prime minister Alexis Tsipras meets the IMF chief Christine Lagarde on the margins of the Davos gathering later this week) has been especially tough amid mounting speculation \u2013 and leaks \u2013 that the proposals, a particularly sensitive issue given the hardship of austerity and recession, are wholly inadequate. In an unusual fit of pique, the usually mild-mannered finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos appeared to draw a line in the sand this afternoon. The IMF had to make clear whether it stood by the leaks or not, he said. \u201cI want the IMF to clarify whether these are really its own leaks or the imagination of journalists,\u201d he said of the reports that the body had roundly rejected the government\u2019s plan. \u201cI have been given no such notification \u2026 if [the reports are right] I expect it in writing,\u201d he told reporters adding that both sides had agreed that the negotiations would not be conducted through leaks. Racheting up the pressure the Oxford-educated economist insisted that while Athens was open to discussion it also had its own red lines. \u201cIt is very important that pensions are not reduced for a 12th or 13th time for social and economic reasons.\u201d The red-hot issue is like to dominate what may well be a wrenching time ahead. Lenders behind the biggest bailout in global financial history signaled today through the European Commission that mission chiefs would not be returning to Greece before they received clarification on the proposals. It could only be a matter of time before the euro zone crisis erupts again.  And on that note, we\u2019re wrapping up. Back tomorrow for a busy day. After a jittery day, Europe\u2019s main stock markets all closed lower tonight. That extends 2016\u2019s losses, but it\u2019s a whimper rather than a rout as London\u2019s FTSE 100 hits a new three-year low. Here\u2019s the final prices: FTSE 100: down 24 points at 5,780, -0.42% German DAX: down 23 points at 9,522, -0.24% French CAC: down 20 points at 4,190, - 0.5% With no US action to excite them, traders rather ran out of juice by the close of another day dominated by the sliding oil price. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains: The absence of the usual bump in afternoon volumes from US investors left European stock markets a little sleepy on Monday as Americans celebrated Martin Luther King Jr Day. As has become the custom recently; it was the volatile price of oil that set the tone for equity trading. A bounce off the lows set in Asian trading for crude oil helped an encouraging start for European equities but as oil prices slid back, equities fell into the red. It\u2019s not all gloom today. Over in Ireland, there are signs that its economy continues to recover from its debt crisis. From Dublin, Henry McDonald reports: A sure sign that at least the Irish economic recovery is powering ahead - record numbers of passengers passed through Dublin Airport in 2015. Dubin Airport Authority reveals today that 25 million passengers went through its doors over the last 12 months. That is far higher than its previous peak in 2008 at a time when the Celtic Tiger was still roaring and just before the financial crash. Transatlantic traffic at Dublin Airport is up 47% since 2008 while in the same period traffic to continental Europe has risen by 6.7% To cope with growing passenger numbers, Dublin Airport Authority is midway through hiring about 350 new staff in areas such as security, customer service and asset management. The growth in passenger numbers is expected to continue into 2016, as 11 new scheduled services have already been announced for this year, including new direct transatlantic services to Hartford Connecticut, Los Angeles, Newark and Vancouver. There are also new long-haul charter services to Cancun in Mexico and Montego Bay in Jamaica. Dublin Airport supports or facilitates a total of 97,400 jobs in the Irish economy and contributed \u20ac6.9 billion to the national economy, according to a major study by economic consultants InterVISTAS has found Time for a quick recap: European markets have lurched between gains and losses today as the turmoil in the financial markets enters its third week. The main indices are all in the red after six hours trading, with investors nervous ahead of tomorrow\u2019s Chinese growth figures. And with Wall Street closed for Martin Luther King Day, it could be a cagey afternoon too. The oil price has staged a small rebound, now hovering around the $29 per barrel mark. But it earlier fell to $27.67, on fears that Iran will add to the world\u2019s glut of crude. Ladbrokes, the betting firm, reckons it\u2019s odds-on to keep falling this year, now that sanctions have been lifted on Tehran. Fall below $25 in 2016: 10/11 Fall below $20 in 2016: 3/1 Fall below $10 in 2016: 10/1 China is still centre-stage, after its central bank took new steps to ward off speculators driving down the yuan. Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz has suggested that China isn\u2019t as much of a basket case as some fear. But tomorrow\u2019s GDP figures could show if he\u2019s right. I\u2019m off to pack for Davos, but I\u2019ll be back later with the close of the European markets... Nigeria\u2019s stock market is enduring a bad day. The main index has slumped 4% to its lowest level since mid 2012, hit by the falling oil price. That\u2019s 20% off its recent peak - and barely half its value in mid 2014. In a double dose of bad news for the UK economy, Asda is cutting 200 jobs at its headquarters in Leeds. It follows a tough Christmas for the Walmart-owned supermarket chain. A thousand jobs are being cut across Tata Steel\u2019s British operating, including 750 at its Port Talbot plant in Wales. The Indian conglomerate blamed the surge of cheap imported steel into Europe, which exacerbated cheaper steel prices. And the CBI has echoed those concerns: Emma Watkins, CBI Wales Director, says: \u201cThese job losses are a real setback to the Welsh economy and it\u2019s clear that firms in our steel industry face major global challenges to stay competitive. \u201cChinese steel imports look to be having a big impact and it\u2019s important that the European Commission urgently reports back on whether the market has been distorted unfairly by excess market supply. The FT sums it up: Here\u2019s a sobering fact: the total value of the world\u2019s listed companies has dropped to its lowest level since the autumn of 2013: That suggests investors are expecting weaker global growth and smaller dividend payments in the coming years. Volatile morning this. European markets have now crept into positive territory again, with the FTSE 100 up a \u2018mighty\u2019 13 points. And that\u2019s partly because oil has crept back over $29 per barrel mark in the last few minutes. Over in Paris, president Francois Hollande has announced a new \u20ac2bn job creation scheme to tackle France\u2019s unemployment crisis. The plan will set aside \u20ac1bn for job training, and also provide \u20ac2,000 subsidies to a company when they take on a low-paid worker. Hollande told business leaders that the plan wouldn\u2019t require more taxation: \u201cThese two billion euros will be financed without any new taxes of any kind, in other words, they will be financed by savings.\u201d Hollande\u2019s presidency has been dogged by economic woes, with unemployment climbing steadily to record highs. Today\u2019s speech shows a ratcheting up of the rhetoric, as Associated Press explains: French President Francois Hollande has declared what he called \u201ca state of economic emergency\u201d and says it\u2019s time to redefine France\u2019s economic and social model. Hollande laid out a series of proposed economic measures Monday in an annual speech to business leaders to boost long-stagnant French growth and reduce chronic unemployment. Today\u2019s floundering rally means that that Stoxx 600 index of major European companies has shed 15% of its value since the start of December. Does this validate the famous \u201cSell Everything\u201d call issued by Royal Bank of Scotland analysts this month? Not according to Tom Stevenson, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International. He reckons investors should hold their nerve: \u201cWe should remember that volatility is the price you pay for the long-term outperformance of equities over other asset classes. \u201cIt is also worth remembering that staying fully invested through market cycles makes sense because missing even a handful of the best days in the market can seriously compromise your long-term returns. The best days in the market invariably follow close behind the worst ones \u2013 time in the market matters more than timing the market.\u201d We\u2019ll know in a few months who is right... Reuters is reporting that China\u2019s top stock market regulator has offered to quit, after seeing hundreds of billions of dollars wiped off shares in recent months. It\u2019s not clear if Xiao Gang\u2019s resignation has been accepted; but he may pay the price for the turbulence at the start of this year. Over to Reuters.... Xiao Gang, 57, chairman of the China Securities RegulatoryCommission (CSRC), tendered his resignation last week after his brainchild, a \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d mechanism to limit stock market losses, was blamed for exacerbating a sharp selloff and was deactivated on January 7, just three days after its introduction, a source with ties to the leadership and a financial industry source told Reuters. The circuit breaker imposed a \u2018time out\u2019 if the market fell by 5%, and halted trading if it then dropped by another 2%. Regular readers will remember how the circuit breaker forced trading to be suspended on its first day, on 4th January, and again on the 7th. Those City analysts were right to be cautious..... Europe\u2019s main stock markets are all in the red. The brief rally has unwound itself, and here\u2019s the situation: FTSE 100: -13 points at 5794 (-0.2%) German DAX: -40 points at 9,484 (-0.6%) French CAC: -35 points at 4,174 (-0.8%) Hardly a major selloff, but it\u2019s disappointing that the early flickers of optimism were blotted out so quickly. IG\u2019s Chris Beauchamp says: In mid-morning trading, the FTSE 100\u2019s early gains have evaporated as quickly as yesterday\u2019s snowfall. The ructions in the global markets have just driven India\u2019s main index down to a 20-month low: Stocks are being pulled down by today\u2019s falling oil price; energy exploration firm Cairn Energy has tumbled by 7%. Nobel prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz reckons that fears over China are overblown. Speaking in Davos, Stiglitz told Bloomberg that: \u201cThere\u2019s always been a gap between what\u2019s happening in the real economy and financial markets.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s happening in China is a slowdown by all accounts....but it\u2019s not a cataclysmic slowdown.\u201d More here: Davos Veterans Say Stop Worrying About China\u2019s Market Meltdown Over in Davos, the World Economic Forum is making the final preparations ahead of its Annual Meeting, which begins on Tuesday night. One of the main items on the agenda is the Fourth Industrial Revolution - the rise of more intelligent machines and new technologies such as self-driving cars, 3D printing and the blockchain that underpins Bitcoin. And a new report from WEF has just warned that seven million jobs could lost in advanced economies over the next five years, particularly in heathcare, energy and financial services. My colleague Jill Treanor has checked out the report. Here\u2019s her story: Europe\u2019s early rally is already petering out, with the FTSE 100 now up only 4 points at 5808. I guess there\u2019s not much to inspire investors this morning. And many may be keeping to the sidelines today, as the latest Chinese GDP growth figures are released overnight. China\u2019s central bank took fresh measures over the weekend to protect its currency against speculators. The People\u2019s Bank of China announced that foreign banks who engage in offshore yuan trading must place some of their yuan reserves with the central bank. The move may deter the banks from aggressively driving down the yuan. Or as PBoC put it, imposing the reserve requirement would \u201cinhibit pro-cyclical behaviour\u201d. In the short term, the move appeared to work, as the yuan strengthened a little against the US dollar. But Kit Juckes, currency strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, fears that it shows Beijing is making up policy on the hoof. The danger is that this just leaves markets to focus attention elsewhere. City analysts are cautioning that today\u2019s rally in Europe may be a temporary respite. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says that \u201cconcerns are still growing over global economic strength in the face of a collapsing commodities space\u201d. And Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct reckons a \u201ctemporary halt\u201d has been called in the equity rout, particularly as the US market will be closed today. Oil remains front of mind for many and the prospect of Iranian supplies coming back onto the global market certainly rattled investors in the Middle East yesterday, but elsewhere the reaction has been rather more muted. We\u2019ve seen a calm session in Asia, although with crude prices now retreating once again, it would seem ambitious to think that we can read too much into the current air of calm. With many markets on Wall Street closed for Martin Luther King Day, this may also help calm nerves - the week may not open with quite the catastrophic start some had eyed. European stock markets are actually rising this morning, which might reassure nerves. The FTSE 100 index has gained 35 points, of 0.6%, to 5839. That claws back some of Friday\u2019s rout, where the blue-chip index lost around 110 points. Shares are also picking up in France and Germany, where losses in 2016 have been even steeper than in London. It\u2019s a fairly muted bounceback -- markets are only up around 1%. But after two weeks of mayhem, any recovery will be welcome in the City (assuming it lasts). Investors will be watching the oil market closely this week, says Michael Hewson of CMC Markets: The continued weakness in commodity prices, particularly in the oil and gas sector continues to spook world markets and now that Iran has been given the green light to come in from the cold, it is likely to be difficult to see where the next rebound in oil prices is likely to come from, raising concerns about further bankruptcy losses across the sector, if as predicted prices fall further towards $20 a barrel. It\u2019s been a grim few months for commodities, with oil at a 12-year low and many metals hitting their lowest levels since the financial crisis. And Bloomberg\u2019s Caroline Hyde flags up that City speculators are betting that the slump will continue: Oil traders have marked Iran\u2019s return to the markets by sending the cost of crude oil down to its lowest level in over 12 years. The West\u2019s decision to lift sanctions on Tehran helped to push Brent crude down to $27.67 per barrel today. Traders are anticipating a new surge of supplies hitting the market, intensifying worries about supply gluts. We\u2019ve known for a while that sanctions were likely to be removed, so it shouldn\u2019t have shocked many traders. Japan wasn\u2019t the only Asia-Pacific market to suffer the Monday blues. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index fell by 1.1%, hitting a three-year low, as fears over China\u2019s economy hit confidence again. Australia\u2019s market also weakened, reflecting concerns that demand for its commodities will be weak in 2016. It\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 20 index lost another 0.7% - putting it close to a bear market too. China\u2019s market, though, defied the general gloom to finish 0.4% higher. Japan\u2019s stock market is on the brink of a new bear market, after being hit by the global market turmoil. After another day of heavy selling, the Nikkei index lost another 191 points, or 1.1%, today to close at 16,955. That\u2019s a four-month low, and around 19% off its recent high set last August. Once it loses 20%, it will be officially in \u2018bear market\u2019 territory. Japanese exporters have been hit by the strength of the yen, which has rallied this year as nervous investors sought protection from riskier assets. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After the worst start to a New Year ever, world markets are facing another week of turbulence. Friday night\u2019s Wall Street rumble, which wiped another 390 points off the Dow Jones industrial average, has sent nerves on edge across the globe. Fears continue to build over China, with its slowing economy threatening to puncture the huge credit bubble that has build up in recent years. And oil could continue its crazy ride downwards. Iran is preparing to start pumping more crude supplies into a well-stocked market, after sanctions were lifted last night. Middle Eastern markets have already been rattled, with Saudi Arabia\u2019s index shedding over 5% yesterday to a near five-year low. Kuwait lost more than 3%, while Qatar tumbled by 7%. The European and US stock markets have already shed 8% this year, a shocking loss of wealth in just two weeks. It may not be the great market crash that more pessimistic analysts have been calling for years. But the scale of the losses this year suggest that investors have turned much more negative about the prospects for the global economy as a whole. Gareth Isaac, fund manager at Schroders, says China is a serious worry: Regarding China, we don\u2019t see the cataclysmic 2008-style \u2018credit crunch\u2019 forming that some market participants do, but that doesn\u2019t mean that we are not concerned. There are significant risks. China now accounts for approximately 17% of global GDP; up from 10% in 2005. Any material slowdown in the second largest economy in the world would have significant ramifications for the rest of the globe. China is attempting to make the transition from a manufacturing-led economy to a service-led economy \u2013 a transition that took the UK generations \u2013 in a decade or so. That process is not going to be without difficulty, and the Chinese authorities are learning as they go. Mistakes will happen. And that\u2019s why traders are going to be cautious today, this week, and through much of 2016.....",

                "bodyText":"China\u2019s economy grew at its slowest rate in a quarter of a century in 2015, data released on Tuesday showed, increasing pressure on Beijing to address fears of a prolonged slowdown and ease the jitters affecting global markets. The full-year growth of 6.9% was only just short of government expectations of 7% but by contrast, growth in 2014 stood at 7.3%. The national bureau of statistics\u2019 bulletin showed GDP growth at 6.8% in the three months to December, easing from 6.9% in the previous quarter \u2013 the slowest quarterly rate since 2009, when growth slowed to 6.2%. The slide from the previous quarter was expected, but will add to concerns about the health of the world\u2019s second-biggest economy as it confronts a range of challenges, including weak exports, high debt levels and slowing investment. China\u2019s industrial output in December rose 5.9% from a year earlier, compared with forecasts for a 6.0% increase. The lack of surprises did at least offer some respite to stock and currency markets. MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.2% on Tuesday after earlier touching its lowest level since October 2011. Australian shares added 0.8%, while Tokyo\u2019s Nikkei dropped 0.3%. In Shanghai, recent volatility gave way to a 0.2% rise, following a 13-month low on Monday.

Other industrialised economies would find little to complain about if they enjoyed growth figures approaching those released on Tuesday, but in the Chinese context the data are cause for concern. Having experienced double-digit growth for more than a decade \u2013 during which it replaced Japan as the world\u2019s second-biggest economy \u2013 China is now going through a painful period of readjustment as growth inevitably slows. Its structural transformation from an economy heavily reliant on industrial exports to a more service-oriented one was still in progress, the statistics bureau said in a statement. It added that China was going through \u201ca crucial period during which challenges need to be overcome and problems need to be resolved and the task of comprehensively deepening the reform is still heavy\u201d. China\u2019s uncertain handling of its transition has sent shockwaves around global markets. Shanghai stocks have plunged to 13-month lows despite a massive government rescue package.

Six months ago, in a speech in Lincoln, he said the decision on whether to increase the cost of borrowing would <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/16/uk-interest-rate-rise-new-year\">come into sharper relief around the turn of the year</a>. That was seen as an indication that a tightening of policy would be announced sooner rather than later.</p> <p>Well, the turn of the year has arrived, Carney has decided that the time is not yet ripe for a rate rise. Marching the markets up to the top of the interest rate hill only to march them down again has become a bit of a habit.</p> <p>For all that, the governor\u2019s caution is justified.

It also warned that a \u201ctide of refugees\u201d was putting the EU under strain and that action was needed to ensure that migrants could find jobs.</p> </blockquote> <p>Full story here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/19/imf-cuts-global-growth-forecasts\">IMF cuts global growth forecasts</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-01-19T10:01:39.170Z\">at 10.01am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-569e08bbe4b0cb645dc30430\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-19T10:00:08.530Z\">10.00am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The inflation figures, along higher than expected, should not put pressure on the Bank of England to raise rates, said James Knightley at ING Bank:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>December UK headline consumer price inflation has come in at 0.2% year on year, up from 0.1% in November and is the fastest rate of price increase since January 2015. Meanwhile the core rate of inflation (excluding food and fuel) rose 1.4% year on year versus a consensus forecast of 1.2%. This was also the highest inflation rate since January last year.</p> <p>The details show air fares contributed positively (up 26.8% year on year! Sea fares were up 20.3%) \u2013 note that the transportation component was the only one of 12 CPI sub components to actually increase. It showed transport prices swinging from -2.1% year on year to -0.2%. However, food prices saw intensifying deflation, as did clothing, furniture, recreation and culture. Therefore, today\u2019s pick-up in inflation (particularly core) can\u2019t really be viewed as suggesting the story regarding inflation has changed much. After all, transportation prices will fall back again next month given what has happened to fuel costs.<br></p> <p>Given that inflation remains so soft and with tomorrow\u2019s UK labour report set to show a further slowing in the pace of wage growth, the Bank of England is under no pressure to respond. Moreover, the Brexit uncertainty poses clear risks for growth, particularly through the investment and hiring channels, which will more than offset concerns about inflation risks from sterling\u2019s recent falls. As such we see little prospect of BoE action ahead of the EU referendum, which seems set for June/July. We continue to have November as the probable start point for UK rate hikes, assuming the UK votes to remain an EU member state.<br></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-569e0841e4b03e04102e173d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-19T09:57:57.006Z\">9.57am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bbf656ba8ba91f2cfe7b7818b541ca1f2e852f89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbf656ba8ba91f2cfe7b7818b541ca1f2e852f89/0_0_746_527/500.jpg\" alt=\"UK inflation contribution\" width=\"500\" height=\"353\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">UK inflation contribution</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Office for National Statistics</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-569e0788e4b06544a9da911f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-19T09:55:06.043Z\">9.55am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The pound has moved to its day\u2019s highs against the dollar and euro, as the UK inflation figures came in higher than expected.</p> <p>Sterling touched $1.4340, up from $1.4320 before the data, while against the euro it strengthened from 76p to 75.82p.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-569e06ffe4b0cdd2b1e0ce2f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-19T09:53:00.115Z\">9.53am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FOREXcom/statuses/689380128820838400\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Other measures of UK inflation were also stronger than expected with RPI rising 1.2% vs. 1.0% expected and HPI +7.7% vs. 7.3% y/y <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FX?src=hash\">#FX</a> ^FR</p>&mdash;

Instead, there is a rapidly different business environment forming in China.

                "bodyText":"PS: If you\u2019d like to learn more about Mark Pollock, please start here: And that is all from us for tonight. Back in the morning. GW Davos isn\u2019t just about greedy bankers and scheming politicians. Tonight, the press pack are hearing from Mark Pollock, who became the first blind man to reach the South Pole in 2009. The next year, he fell from a second floor window, broke his back, and is paralysed. He\u2019s currently explaining how he\u2019s been working with pioneering doctors who are working on spinal cord injuries and seeking a cure for paralysis. Impossible? Not if you listen to Pollock, whose resolve and optimism is quite, quite gripping. He believes a cure is possible, saying: The next big step for mankind is to take the first step after paralysis. And he\u2019s shown us videos of how he has worked with scientists to get his own body working again (we just saw him bend his left leg, thanks to an array of wiring). Pollock\u2019s message is that, in the 4th industrial revolution, biotechnology and genetic engineering could help a new wave of pioneers to redefine what it means to be human (I\u2019m paraphrasing him). Google him, please, and find out more about what he\u2019s doing. It sounds pretty important. An intriguing theme has emerged around this year\u2019s Davos - the Falklands Islands. Argentina\u2019s new president, Mauricio Macri, has declared that he wants to rebuild his country\u2019s relationship with the UK, more than thirty years after the Falklands War. Macri is going to meet with David Cameron at Davos; we\u2019ll be poised for that. The awards ceremony is over, and delegates are fanning out across the Congress Centre, and beyond, ready for tomorrow\u2019s action. DiCaprio announces that his foundation is making a new \u00a315m donation to help protect fragile ecosystems. This includes rainforests in Sumatro, and protecting other rainforsts from the palm oil industry. And finally, Leonardo DiCaprio is picking up a Crystal Award for his work on environmental issues and climate change. The Hollywood actor tells delegates at Davos thatworld leaders took an important first step in Paris with their agreement to reduce carbon emissions. But there\u2019s much more to do. The Paris agreement was a call to action, but it falls to all of us to help fight against the \u201cirreversible damage\u201d that climate change will cause. We simply cannot afford the greed of the oil industry to determine the future of humanity. Enough is enough, you know better, the world knows better. History will put the blame for this devastation firmly at their feet. And DiCaprio insists that fossil fuel reserves must be left where they are. Climate change cannot be stopped unless fossil fuels are left in the ground. The next Crystal award goes to Chinese actor Yao Chen. She\u2019s known as the Queen of Weibo, with 78 million followers on the social media site (there\u2019s an audible gasp in the audience). Chen is being recognised for her work raising awareness of the refugee crisis, visiting migrant communities in countries such as Philippines, Thailand, Ethiopia, Lebanon and Pakistan. Chen thanks aid organisations, the UN, and her husband for his support, and talks about how helping other people is important; it helps to meet the needs of the helper too. America\u2019s poorest communities could be changed forever if they could spawn the next technology giant, will.i.am continues. That\u2019s the long-term goal of his foundation. Hilde Schwab, who co-founded WEF with her husband Klaus, has the floor in Davos. She\u2019s announcing the winners of the Crystal Awards - WEF\u2019s annual prizes for people who have gone the extra mile to make the world better (no, they don\u2019t give them to Wall Street bankers) This year\u2019s winners are actors Yao Chen and Leonardo DiCaprio, artist Olafur Eliasson, and musician and entrepreneur will.i.am. Hilde explains that Eliasson has helped create and strengthen communities by building large-scale installations and designs. Next comes Will.i.am (of the Black Eyed Peas, younger readers) is being recognised for his work bringing educational opportunist to the underpriviliged. His I am Angel foundation has helped keep young people in education and out of Will.i.am is now on stage, joking that he grew up near gangs in the ghettos of America but he was more scared of his mother than the gangs so he kept out. But turning serious, he says he wants kids to aspire to be the next Steve Jobs, the next Bill Gates, and fix the world\u2019s problems rather than waiting for governments to do it for them. One of Davos\u2019s many curious traditions is a habit of ringing cowbells when a keynote session is about to start. And that ding-ding noise in the distance means the opening ceremony is getting underway. Back at the cancer moonshot talk, Joe Biden has called on the public to do their bit to help tackle the illness. It won\u2019t be easy, or cheap. As well as warning about the impact of automation, Axel Weber, chairman of UBS, is discussing today\u2019s latest downgrade of global growth forecasts by the IMF. It was like groundhog day, he say, as the IMF had downgraded its forecasts nine times. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign we have moved to a lower growth economy.\u201d Weber adds that the problem isn\u2019t so much cyclical as structural. The low growth, low inflation and low interest environment was likely to remain, he said. UBS chairman Axel Weber says politicians need to address the rising inequality that the robot revolution will cause: Jill is tweeting the details: While Biden was demanding more progress on cancer, Swiss bank UBS has been presenting a new report into the fourth industrial revolution. And you may be unsurprised to hear that UBS reckons the richest will benefit most from new technologies such as robots, AI, 3D printing, and all those cutting-edge systems. Why? Because firms will be able to use robots to squeeze out low-paid workers, boosting their profit margins at the expense of the poorest. Here\u2019s the story, by Jill Treanor: Joe Biden is now challenging the experts on the panel, who includes top cancer researchers from the US and beyond, to share their data better. Big data, he insists, is the key to this moonshot. What would happen if I asked all of you who have data..... to get together in one room. Could that make sense, to talk to each other?... No-one dares to object. Well, in that case I\u2019m going to do it, Biden grins. Not for the cameras, but for my own knowledge, and to make faster progress. Some reaction to Joe Biden\u2019s words: Here\u2019s another photo from the cancer moonshot talk: Data is absolutely crucial to Joe Biden\u2019s cancer moonshot: When Joe Biden talks about a cancer moonshot, he is harking back to the Apollo landings, and John F Kennedy\u2019s declaration that America would put a man on the moon before the end of the 1960s. This battle is different, though, partly because Biden doesn\u2019t think the Federal government can do all the work. Part of our role is to get out of the way, so the real experts can make the progress we need, the vice-president tells his audience at Davos. But we will also do everything we can at the federal level to help. Cancer has touched nearly all of us in some way, Joe Biden points out - few families have avoided experiencing it. And every year, 14 billion people are diagnosed with cancer, 8 million die from it. That total, of course, includes Beau Biden, the vice-president\u2019s son who died of brain cancer last year. Hello from Davos, where this year\u2019s World Economic Forum is getting underway. Not without a few hitches, though. It\u2019s bumper-to-bumper traffic out there, as business leaders, politicians, policy advocates and the media make the annual trek to WEF. And even the vice-president of the United States, Joe Biden, got caught in the jam; it made him around 30 minutes late for a meeting with top scientists to push for a \u2018moonshot\u2019 to find a cure for cancer. The vice-president apologises profusely and charmingly - but he doesn\u2019t need to; everyone here knows how Davos is a logistical nightmare this time of year. And his mission is so important that it\u2019s well worth waiting a few minutes.....\uf70f And then it\u2019s down to business, with Biden explaining why he believes the world can make huge progress in the next few years. President Obama and I don\u2019t want small change, he insists - we want a Quantum Leap. Biden says: We are at an inflection point - a lot has been achieved in the last decade or less. We have seen amazing advances in science, immunology. Genomics is being leveraged in ways that weren\u2019t possible even six years ago. VP Biden adds that it\u2019s vital to ensure that researchers have access to all the data available, as every cancer centre keeps a record of its own data. Tapping this treasure trove is vital to speeding the process towards finding a cure for cancer. The session is being streamed here. On a busy day and ahead of the start of the Davos conference, here\u2019s a quick recap of events: Chinese GDP shows a slowdown.... ...but markets move higher on hopes for further central bank stimulus UK inflation hits an 11 month high ... but Bank of England governor Mark Carney rules out early rate rise ....which sends the pound sharply lower Meanwhile the IMF cuts its global growth forecasts The oil market could drown in oversupply says the International Energy Agency On that note, we\u2019ll close for the moment. But Graeme Wearden will be back later with the first reports from this year\u2019s Davos gathering. US markets have followed the example of Europe, and are moving sharply higher in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 148 points or 0.9% higher, while the S&amp;P 500 has climbed around 1%. Chinese GDP figures prompted talk of further stimulus measures to support the world\u2019s second largest economy, while positive results from Bank of America and Morgan Stanley added to the upbeat mood. Here\u2019s a horrifying thought. There could be more plastic in the sea than fish in just over three decades. Ahead of Davos, Graeme Wearden reports: As a record-breaking yachtswoman, Dame Ellen MacArthur has seen more of the world\u2019s oceans than almost anyone else. Now she is warning that there will be more waste plastic in the sea than fish by 2050, unless the plastics industry cleans up its act. According to a new report issued by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation at the World Economic Forum on Tuesday, new plastics will consume 20% of all oil production within 35 years, up from an estimated 5% today. Plastics production has increased by twentytimes since 1964, reaching 311m tonnes in 2014, the equivalent of more than 900 Empire State Buildings, the report says, and it is expected to double again in the next 20 years, and almost quadruple by 2050. Despite this growing demand, just 5% of plastic goods are actually recycled effectively, while 40% end up in landfill and a third leak into fragile ecosystems such as the world\u2019s oceans. The full story is here: Mark Carney\u2019s caution on interest rates is justified, says our economics editor Larry Elliott: Mark Carney is half way through his five-year term as governor of the Bank of England. Judging by his latest remarks on the state of the economy he could go back to Canada in the summer of 2018 and still not have raised interest rates. The governor\u2019s speech was notable for its dovish tone. Six months ago, in a speech in Lincoln, he said the decision on whether to increase the cost of borrowing would come into sharper relief around the turn of the year. That was seen as an indication that a tightening of policy would be announced sooner rather than later. Well, the turn of the year has arrived, Carney has decided that the time is not yet ripe for a rate rise. Marching the markets up to the top of the interest rate hill only to march them down again has become a bit of a habit. For all that, the governor\u2019s caution is justified. Carney said a \u201cpowerful set of forces\u201d - some domestic, some global, some long-lasting, some cyclical - had combined to keep interest rates at their record low rates since the Great Recession ended in 2009. Read the full analysis here: On the pound\u2019s decline today, David Lamb, head of dealing at the forex group Fexco, said: The prospect of a UK interest rate rise hasn\u2019t been kicked into the long grass. The Governor hoofed it right out of the park. Mark Carney\u2019s prediction - made last summer - that we would have greater clarity on interest rates at the start of 2016 has been completely overtaken by events. Six months on, the prospects for UK interest rates remain as clear as mud. Even though UK inflation crept up a notch to a paltry 0.2% in December, tumbling oil prices will continue to drag down prices. Against a backdrop of extreme Chinese volatility and slipping rates of both growth and wages in the UK, none of the stars are aligned for a rate rise any time soon. With a UK rate hike now receding into the distance once again, monetary policy in London and Washington will continue to move in opposite directions. As a result the pound has tumbled against the dollar, and it is even slumping against the euro too. The combination of skittish equity markets and the vanishing prospect of a rate hike means investor appetite for sterling is eroding - and as a result the pound\u2019s gradual slide is likely to continue. And the pound is still falling: Answering questions, Carney said the Bank was picking up uncertainty around political events, but investment intentions remained robust. He also indicated that rates could rise before the consumer price index hit 2%: Spot in this chart of today\u2019s movement of the pound against the dollar when Carney started speaking and suggesting now is not the time to raise rates: The governor of the Bank of England has warned that the UK faces \u201ca powerful set of forces\u201d preventing policymakers from raising interest rates and the date of the first rise is still uncertain, writes Phillip Inman. Mark Carney said the plunge in oil prices had dragged down inflation and postponed the date of a rise from the current 0.5%, though he refused to indicate when the central bank would make its first move. Carney said: \u201cMonetary policy will continue to depend on economic prospects and not the calender.\u201d But his gloomy outlook, which also highlighted the rapid slowdown in China and the recent turmoil in global markets, is likely to be seen as delaying the first increase in rates since 2008 until at least the end of this year or possibly 2017. This will force many of the City\u2019s investment banks to tear up their own forecasts, which have pencilled in a rise in the summer or Autumn. Bank of England governor Mark Carney wants to see faster growth and stronger inflation before raising interest rates, with no set timetable for an increase. In a speech at the Queen Mary University of London, he said global and domestic growth had proved weaker than he expected in the middle of last year, when he predicted a decision on rates would come into sharper relief by early 2016. He said: Well the year has turned, and, in my view, the decision proved straightforward: now is not yet the time to raise interest rates. This wasn\u2019t a surprise to market participants or the wider public. They observed the renewed collapse in oil prices, the volatility in China, and the moderation in growth and wages here at home since the summer and rightly concluded that not enough cumulative progress had been made to warrant tightening monetary policy. You can follow his speech live here. And now oil is back over $30 a barrel, despite the International Energy Agency warning of continuing oversupply. Brent crude has jumped 5.7% to $30.18, helped by strong oil demand from China. There is also the hope of more stimulus from the Chinese authorities following the latest GDP figures, which showed a slowdown in growth. Stock markets continue to move higher following the Chinese GDP data, and despite higher than expected UK inflation and the IMF cutting its global growth forecasts. The FTSE 100 is currently up nearly 1.9%, while Germany\u2019s Dax is 2% higher and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 2.3%. In the US the futures are showing a 250 rise on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. As a reminder the US markets were closed on Monday, and fell sharply in the previous session on the tumbling oil price. Crude is now up 4.7% at $29.9 a barrel. And here are the IMF comments on markets and China, courtesy of Reuters: Global financial markets seem to be overreacting to falling oil prices and China, the chief economist of the International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday. Maurice Obstfeld also said it was critical that China is clear about its overall policy strategy, including its currency. \u201cIt\u2019s not a stretch to suggest that (markets) may be reacting very strongly to rather small bits of evidence in an environment of volatility and risk aversion,\u201d Obstfeld said in a news conference held after the IMF cut its global growth forecasts for the third time in less than a year. The IMF has commented on the prospect of Britain leaving the EU: Here\u2019s the UK Treasury welcoming the day\u2019s inflation figures: The IMF is giving more details of its global outlook. Its chief economist Maurice Obstfeld said there were clearly deflationary pressures in the eurozone, and he expected the European Central Bank to ease further as further data comes in. He added that the US recovery appeared to be weaker than the Federal Reserve was expected when it raised interest rates in December. And he played down the recent market turmoil: He said the IMF did not see some of the extreme negative scenarios that the markets seemed to be anticipating. He added that a falling oil price would help consumers, so it was not an unmitigated negative. UK house prices are at a 10 month high, according to the Office for National Statistics: Meanwhile the ZEW confidence index showed a downbeat mood among German analysts and investors in the wake of the recent market turmoil. With any slowdown in China likely to knock the German export market, the ZEW think tank said economic sentiment fell from 16.1 in December to 10.2 in January. But this was higher than a Reuters estimate of 8.2. In the eurozone, inflation has come in at 0.2% year on year in December, in line with expectations. The month on month figure was flat. November\u2019s year on year figure was revised down from 0.2% to 0.1%. That is a long was short of the European Central Bank\u2019s 2% target despite the stimulus package the central bank has instituted. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: Today\u2019s inflation figures suggest that ECB President Mario Draghi\u2019s renewed stimulus plan isn\u2019t yet having the desired effect, and the two per cent target is still a long way off. Record low oil prices, alongside volatility in China and elsewhere, have taken their toll on major economies the world over and the Eurozone is no different. With a stimulus programme in effect and no real room to manoeuvre interest rates further, Draghi is running out of options. Draghi must hope that any extra cash in the pockets of consumers due to low oil prices goes straight back into the economy to spur growth. Back with UK inflation, and Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight expects a UK rate rise in August: With consumer price inflation still only 0.2% in December, there is certainly little immediate pressure on the Bank of England to start raising interest rates. We believe it is pretty unlikely that the Bank of England will raise interest rates (from 0.50% to 0.75%) until at least August \u2013 given the increased probability that inflation will stay lower for longer and a current more uncertain growth outlook. Indeed, there is a very real chance that the Bank of England could delay raising interest rates until the fourth quarter of 2016. Our current belief that the Bank of England will most likely edge interest rates up from 0.50% to 0.75% in August is based on the assumption that economic growth will be reasonable over the first half of 2016, earnings growth sees some renewed pick-up amid a tightening labour market and consumer price inflation trends gradually up. Even if the Bank of England does delay interest rates beyond August, we doubt it will delay acting until 2017 - barring a major slowdown in UK growth. The International Monetary Fund has reduced its growth forecasts in its latest update on the global economy. Our economics editor Larry Elliott reports: [The IMF] has added to concerns about the health of the global economy by cutting its growth forecasts for the next two years and warning that recovery from the financial crisis could be derailed altogether if key challenges are mishandled. The Washington-based body said world output would be 0.2 points lower in 2016 and 2017 compared with forecasts made just three months ago \u2013 and that the risks to its predictions were to the downside. In an update to its World Economic Outlook, the IMF said growth was put at 3.4% this year and 3.6% in 2017. It said central banks should continue to boost growth and that finance ministries should bolster investment spending where possible. It also warned that a \u201ctide of refugees\u201d was putting the EU under strain and that action was needed to ensure that migrants could find jobs. Full story here: The inflation figures, along higher than expected, should not put pressure on the Bank of England to raise rates, said James Knightley at ING Bank: December UK headline consumer price inflation has come in at 0.2% year on year, up from 0.1% in November and is the fastest rate of price increase since January 2015. Meanwhile the core rate of inflation (excluding food and fuel) rose 1.4% year on year versus a consensus forecast of 1.2%. This was also the highest inflation rate since January last year. The details show air fares contributed positively (up 26.8% year on year! Sea fares were up 20.3%) \u2013 note that the transportation component was the only one of 12 CPI sub components to actually increase. It showed transport prices swinging from -2.1% year on year to -0.2%. However, food prices saw intensifying deflation, as did clothing, furniture, recreation and culture. Therefore, today\u2019s pick-up in inflation (particularly core) can\u2019t really be viewed as suggesting the story regarding inflation has changed much. After all, transportation prices will fall back again next month given what has happened to fuel costs. Given that inflation remains so soft and with tomorrow\u2019s UK labour report set to show a further slowing in the pace of wage growth, the Bank of England is under no pressure to respond. Moreover, the Brexit uncertainty poses clear risks for growth, particularly through the investment and hiring channels, which will more than offset concerns about inflation risks from sterling\u2019s recent falls. As such we see little prospect of BoE action ahead of the EU referendum, which seems set for June/July. We continue to have November as the probable start point for UK rate hikes, assuming the UK votes to remain an EU member state. The pound has moved to its day\u2019s highs against the dollar and euro, as the UK inflation figures came in higher than expected. Sterling touched $1.4340, up from $1.4320 before the data, while against the euro it strengthened from 76p to 75.82p. Our report on inflation, from Patrick Collinson: There was a surprise rise in the UK\u2019s inflation rate to 0.2% in December, the first month since January 2015 in which the rate has exceeded 0.1% according to the Office for National Statistics. Transport costs, particularly air fares, and to a lesser extent motor fuels, were the main contributors to the rise, said the ONS. These were partly offset by downward pressure on prices for alcohol and tobacco along with food and non-alcoholic beverages partially offset the rise. Monthly inflation has been between -0.1% and 0.1% for the past eleven months, helped by plunging commodity prices. More here: And here\u2019s the trend for CPI: Here\u2019s a breakdown of the inflation data: This is also the first time the rate has exceeded 0.1% since January 2015, according to the Office for National Statistics. It said: Movements in transport costs, particularly air fares and to a lesser extent motor fuels, were the main contributors to the rise in the rate. Downward pressures from prices for alcohol and tobacco along with food and non-alcoholic beverages partially offset the rise. The UK consumer price index has risen 0.1% in December on a month on month basis, in line with forecasts. But the year on year figure of 0.2% is the highest since January 2015, and higher than expectations of a 0.1% rise. The crude oil market will continue to be oversupplied until at least late 2016, according to the International Energy Agency. It said the market \u201ccould drown in oversupply.\u201d With unseasonably warm weather and rising supply - not least from Iran now sanctions have been lifted - will continue to put pressure on crude prices. The IEA said global oil demand fell to a one year low of 1m barrels a day in the fourth quarter of 2015, down from 2.1m in the previous three months. In its latest monthly report the IEA left its estimate of global demand growth for 2016 at 1.2m barrels a day. The IEA said (quote courtesy Reuters): We conclude that the oil market faces the prospect of a third successive year when supply will exceed demand by 1m barrels a day and there will be enormous strain o the ability of the oil system to absorb it efficiently. Brent crude, which was earlier up 3%, is now 2.5% higher at $29.29 a barrel. A couple of positive comments on the Chinese GDP figures. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI director of economics, said: These figures paint a picture of a Chinese economy which is slowing and rebalancing, but still making a huge contribution to the global economy. In recent weeks, financial markets have struggled to digest this situation, alongside further weakness in oil prices. While direct links between the UK and China are relatively small, the spill-over effects from China\u2019s economic slowdown, alongside continued volatility in financial markets, amplify the downside risks to growth in the UK. Nevertheless, it\u2019s important not to be too downbeat about China or emerging markets more generally. With household incomes up by 7%, and online retails sales growing by 33% last year, China represents a lucrative market for British business. Meanwhile James Sinclair at corporate finance house Clearwater International said: Much will be made of the fact that this is China\u2019s weakest growth in a quarter of a century: Intense volatility in the stock market and the cycle of industrial overcapacity and sluggish external demand have had policymakers looking over their shoulder for a good while. But we don\u2019t see this as the toppling of an economic giant. Instead, there is a rapidly different business environment forming in China. The overall trend for consumer spending is far from grim, and the surging middle class is at the heart of this consumption boom. While consumers are boosting demand for imported goods, there are Chinese companies working in the opposite direction, and redefining what Chinese exporters look like. With the growth of entrepreneurism and innovation in the country, we can expect to see many other Chinese companies both threaten existing industry structures and open up new spaces. By the end of the decade, we still expect China to be one of the leading cross-border investors, and given the patterns we have seen, this is a trend we see no sign of stopping. More on UK inflation. lya Spivak, currency strategist at DailyFX, said: The core year-on-year inflation rate is expected to register at 1.2% in December, unchanged from the prior month. Leading survey data hints downward price pressures may have waned however, opening the door for an upside surprise. Such an outcome may breathe a big of life into rate hike speculation, offering a lift to the British pound. Follow-on comments from Bank of England governor Mark Carney represent a bit of wild card and may either amplify or undermine the initial post-CPI response, depending on the central bank chief\u2019s tone. Despite Bank of England governor Mark Carney saying in the middle of last year that it should be clearer by now when UK interest rates should be increased, that is not at all the case. Recent weak data and the current market turmoil that many analysts do not expect any move until much later this year, if at all. Bank of England policymaker Gertjan Vlieghe seemed to concur on Monday, saying ultra low rates could be here to stay for some years. So Carney\u2019s speech later at the University of London will be closely watched for any hints as to the timing of any rate rise. Still on the corporate front, one of the day\u2019s biggest gainers in the UK market so far is Ocado. The online grocer is up 11% following a revival of talk that Amazon could be interested in a takeover to boost its own fledgling food business. Unilever, which makes everything from Dove soap to Pot Noodle, is expecting trading condtions to be tougher and more volatile this year. The company beat analysts forecasts with full year sales up 4.1%, despite negligible growth in developmed markets and weakness in emerging markets. Full story here: As the markets hold onto their early gains, analyst Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said: A shortfall in Chinese GDP data for 2015 \u2013 and accompanying hopes that this will be the catalyst for further stimulus measures from Beijing \u2013 is the key driver here, and it\u2019s the natural resources stocks that are leading the charge. Whilst some upside is probably warranted \u2013 not least given the protracted falls we\u2019ve accrued of late \u2013 the question as always is just how sustainable these gains will prove to be. The news of weak growth has obviously done nothing to lend support to oil prices, but bargain hunting and a mounting belief that Opec\u2019s over supply of the market will now reign in higher cost production is also helping crude edge higher. A break back above $30/barrel here could prove instrumental in cementing a degree of confidence in the wider market. David Morrison at Spreadco said it will be key to see if markets can maintain their earlyi momentum: How this now plays out could be very instructive. If equities can hold on to early gains then we could finally build some upside momentum and reverse last year\u2019s losses. But if this rally fades, as did all the attempts last week, then that could signal that we\u2019re entering a fully blown bear market. Ahead of the latest EU inflation number and the ZEW confidence figures, Germany has reported a 0.2% year on year rise in its consumer price index. Following a move below $28 a barrel on Monday in the wake of Iran\u2019s promise to increase exports now sanctions have been lifted, crude prices have regained some ground. Brent is now up 3% at $29.44 a barrel, following strong oil data from China where demand in 2015 was at a record 10.32m barrels a day, up 2.5% from the previous year. Following on from Asia, European stock markets have moved higher in early trading. The FTSE 100 has jumped 1.7% or 102 points to 5881.92 while Germany\u2019s Dax is up 2.1%, France\u2019s Cac 1.9% and Spain\u2019s Ibex 1.7%. The Chinese data is behind the moves. With the GDP figure was just shy of the government\u2019s targets, investors are betting on more stimulus from the central bank to give the world\u2019s second largest economy a lift. So mining shares are among the leading risers, with Glencore and Anglo American both up around 8%. Ahead of the World Economic Forum\u2019s annual conference which begins this evening, my colleague Graeme Wearden has looked at the eight key themes, ranging from the rise of the robots to market turmoil and medicine: For UK inflation, most analysts expect the CPI figure to come in at 0.1% but RBC Capital Markets goes a little higher: RBC forecasts CPI inflation at 0.3% year on year in December 2015, up from 0.1% year on year in November. However, as last time, we acknowledge that the risk to the forecast is to the downside as the continued decline in the petrol price has reduced the base effects that were due to kick in on the back of oil price declines at the end of 2014. For RPI inflation, we look for the annual rate to hold at 1.1% year on year. Beyond the monthly print, the message remains that even if inflation does get near 1% year on year soon, there are limited prospects in 2016 for it taking another leg up from there and moving towards the 2% target. As well as China\u2019s stock markets moving higher, the Nikkei and Hang Seng are also in positive territory, up 0.5% and 1.75% respectively. So Europe is expected to follow suit: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. On a busy day for economic news, China has kicked things off with news of the slowest GDP growth in 25 years. The figure of 6.9% growth for the year was not far from the government target but prompted talk of new stimulus measures, and gave some support to the Chinese stock market. The CSI300 index rose 2.95% while the Shanghai composite was 3.2% higher. Here is our report on the Chinese GDP numbers: Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: This morning\u2019s latest Chinese economic data hasn\u2019t really shed any new light on an economy that we know is slowing down. The latest fourth quarter GDP data came in at 6.8%, the slowest pace in 25 years and slightly below consensus expectations, while December industrial production slid back to 5.9% from 6.2% in November, no real surprise given recent weak PMI readings. Retail sales were slightly disappointing coming in at 11.1%, slipping back from 11.2% and breaking a sequence of consecutive monthly improvements since last March. While these numbers are slightly disappointing they don\u2019t point to a sharp slowdown, however it does raise the question as to what further steps to stimulate the economy policymakers will take in the coming weeks. Elsewhere in the run up to Davos, the International Monetary Fund releases its latest growth forecasts. There are also UK and EU inflation figures, as well as a speech from Bank of England governor Mark Carney. Here are the timings: 9.30 GMT UK inflation 10.00 GMT Eurozone inflation 10.00 GMT ZEW consumer confidence index 10.00 GMT IMF\u2019s World Economic Outlook 12.00 GMT Mark Carney speech",

On the eve of the meeting, William White, chairman of the OECD\u2019s review committee and former chief economist of the Bank for International Settlements, said that the problems building in the global financial system were now \u201cworse than it was in 2007\u201d and warned that central bankers had \u201cused up all their ammunition\u201d. \u201cDebts have continued to build up over the last eight years and they have reached such levels in every part of the world that they have become a potent cause for mischief,\u201d he told the Daily Telegraph in London. \u201cIt will become obvious in the next recession that many of these debts will never be serviced or repaid, and this will be uncomfortable for a lot of people who think they own assets that are worth something.\u201d Tom Porcelli, chief US economist at RBC Capital Markets, noted that polls of investors showed investors were more bearish on Wall Street than at any time since mid-1987. \u201cPerhaps characterising the recent bout of negativity as being \u2018pervasive\u2019 is an understatement,\u201d he wrote in a note.",

The world\u2019s biggest mining company, BHP Billiton, forecasts no recovery in iron ore or coal prices over the next few years but hopes for a rebound in copper and oil prices \u201cover the medium term\u201d, it said on Wednesday. The sell-off in Chinese stock markets since last summer, fuelled by fears over the health of China\u2019s economy, has driven copper prices close to six and a half-year lows. The three-month copper contract on the London Metal Exchange lost 1.1% to $4,360 a tonne on Wednesday. Prices remain near their weakest level since May 2009 \u2013 $4,318 \u2013 hit on Friday.",

He said the decision by the Federal Reserve to raise rates and end its massive financial support of the bond markets last year was finally filtering through to investors. \u201cWe have been building up froth for year with everyone relying on the largesse of central banks,\u201d he said. \u201cInvestors don\u2019t feel that the Fed has their back anymore.\u201d The falls have wiped out earlier gains made Tuesday after figures showed growing oil demand from China, as well as hopes the government would introduce further measures to stimulate the world\u2019s second largest economy ahead of the Chinese new year holidays in early February. On top of the slide in the oil price, there are continuing concerns about the strength of the global economy. The International Monetary Fund cut its global growth forecasts on Tuesday, blaming a slowdown in China, the falls in commodity prices and the Federal Reserve\u2019s move to start raising US interest rates. The French CAC, the German Dax and the Shanghai Composite were already in bear market territory, and Japan\u2019s stock market joined them overnight with the Nikkei closing down 3.7%. The CAC lost another 3.5% on Wednesday and the Dax was down 2.8%. Mining giant BHP Billiton has added to the gloom by suggesting it sees no early recovery in iron ore or coal prices. William White, chairman of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) review committee and former chief economist of the Bank for International Settlements, told the Daily Telegraph that the problems building in the global financial system were now \u201cworse than it was in 2007\u201d and warned that central bankers had \u201cused up all their ammunition\u201d. A survey for accountancy firm PwC before the Davos meeting revealed that two-thirds of chief executives saw more threats facing their businesses than three years ago, while the head of Swiss banking giant UBS, Axel Weber, added to the angst in Davos by warning that the world was stuck in an era of low growth. Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, head of investment at stockbroker Interactive Investor, said: Ugly, very, very ugly, describes current equity markets, with momentum swinging negative yet again and the bears firmly in control. The fledgling hope from yesterday that markets were on the turn has been quashed by sharp overnight falls in Japan and Asia, which has seen European markets fall aggressively. With every upturn being followed by deeper falls, investors are increasingly wary as it becomes more and more difficult to determine what might happen next. Oil prices remain under pressure, but the consumer benefits of lower energy prices and higher disposable income have yet to filter through to the wider equity market, which remains unremittingly negative in the face of further prospective asset sales by oil exporting countries\u2019 sovereign wealth funds.",

Biden told U.S. executives including Nathan Blecharczyk, co-founder of apartment-sharing firm Airbnb, Muhtar Kent, chairman and CEO of The Coca Cola Company, and Anthony Scaramucci, founder of hedge fund SkyBridge Capital, to push for change. \u201cYou can change the terms of debate,\u201d he said. \u201cYou actually put governments on notice.\u201d He said he and President Barack Obama privately raise the issue of repression of the LGBT community when they meet political leaders. \u201cI have had some run-ins with at least four heads of state already on this,\u201d said Biden More here: Biden urges U.S. business in Davos to lean on anti-gay states Joe Biden is giving quite a progressive speech tonight at Davos. He\u2019s telling the heads of the world\u2019s biggest businesses that they need to ensure basic protection for workers are the world economy embraces the 4th industrial revolution. Joe Biden also cited one of the statistics of the week - the continued concentration of wealth among the very richest. Joe Biden, the vice-president of the United States, has given the final keynote speech of the day. He started by joking with Christine Lagarde in the audience, saying that he might need some money. Not for a bailout deal (things aren\u2019t that bad today!), but for his own purposes: Whenever I see you, Christine, you say \u201cI know, Greece. I know, Ukraine\u201d. But this time I need a personal loan. But then he turns to the issue of the 4th industrial revolution. It is creating new jobs, and even creating new industries. But will it actually transform the global economy? And will it be for better, or worse? Those who think we must get used to the new normal of slower growth are mistaken, Biden says. Technology is improving productivity, and it can create employment - he cites ride-sharing companies are taking on more staff. And \u201castounding\u201d breakthroughs in science will save lives. But there are dangers, and we must be pro-active. Biden says: How will the warehouse worker who used to ship your order, or the salesman who used to take it, make a living when they are no longer needed? And he goes on to warn that the old relationship between work and wages has been broken, and employees aren\u2019t getting a fair deal: \u201cThe Dow Jones industrial average is down over 500 points\u201d, whispers one Davos attendee. And they\u2019re right. The Dow has shed 536 points, or 3.3%, right now to leave it at 15,475 points. Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister, just whisked through the Davos conference room with a hall entourage. He wasn\u2019t taking press questions, alas, but did share a quick, friendly handshake with Finland\u2019s finance minister, Alex Stubb. I guess relations are warmer than last year, during the months of debt negotiations. Tsipras is meeting with several top officials during his visit, including Christine Lagarde of the IMF. He\u2019s hoping to make persuade them that Athens is making progress, and should be given some leeway on austerity and debt relief. But there is concern that the IMF will take a tough line on pension reform, threatening to reignite the debt crisis again.... US oil prices crashed below $27 for the first time since 2003 after the International Energy Agency warned on Tuesday that the oil market could \u201cdrown in oversupply\u201d. Venezuela requested an emergency Opec meeting to discuss steps to shore up oil prices, but other delegates dismissed the idea. New York light crude tumbled 5.5% to $26.89 a barrel on Wednesday, while Brent crude, the global benchmark, lost 4.2% to $27.56. Plunging oil prices piled further pressure on global stock markets. London\u2019s leading index, the FTSE 100, slid 203.22 points, or 3.5%, to 5673.58. Germany\u2019s Dax tumbled 272.57 points, or 2.8%, to 9391.64 and France\u2019s CAC lost 147.31 points, or 3.5%, to 4124.95. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones has plunged more than 400 points to 15,62.42, a 2.6% drop. The Nasdaq shed 115 points to 4361.53, also a 2.6% fall. Back to Davos, and the Pope has sent a message to politicians and business leaders attending WEF - don\u2019t forget the poorest in society. Pope Francis warned that \u201csoulless machines\u201d should not be allowed to muscle humans out of work, saying: \u201cTo all of you I appeal once more: \u2018Do not forget the poor!\u2019 He continued: Weeping for other people\u2019s pain does not only mean sharing in their sufferings, but also and above all realising that our own actions are a cause of injustice and inequality. Once we realise this, we become more fully human, since responsibility for our brothers and sisters is an essential part of our common humanity. Do not be afraid to open your minds and hearts to the poor. In this way, you will give free rein to your economic and technical talents, and discover the happiness of a full life, which consumerism of itself cannot provide.\u201d Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, has summed up the action on financial markets: FTSE bears have been enjoying themselves today, as the index touches levels not seen since late 2012. The UK market has not been alone, as Europe and now the US join in with the panic of January 2016. Bond yields are heading lower too as investors shun risky assets and stash their money in any safe place going. The main driver of the falls continues to be oil, which has pushed onwards to fresh lows, taking oil stocks with it. A fresh downgrade to IMF growth forecasts underlines what stock markets are telling investors \u2013 that things are looking gloomy across the board.\u201d While we were quizzing Ken Rogoff, Adam Posen, et al, Iranian officials have been taking a pop at Saudi Arabia. Foreign minister Javad Zarif argued that the Saudi\u2019s are to blame for the crisis in the Middle East. The Telegraph has the details. Zarif claimed that: \u201cSaudi Arabia has tried to keep the old staus quo in our region because they don\u2019t think change is in their interest. They unnecessarily panicked and created a lot of mess in our region. And Mohammad Agha Nahavandian, the chief of staff to Iranian prime minister Rouhani, has apparently said Iran will \u2018certainly\u2019 raise oil exports to the levels before sanctions were imposed (they were lifted last week, of course). That\u2019s likely to further inflame tensions within Opec, and keep pressure on the oil price. The sell-off in global market is gathering pace. The Dow Jones is now down more than 400 points, or 2.6%, at 15,593.72. The FTSE 100 index in London has tumbled nearly 230 points, or 3.9%, to 5649.55. Germany\u2019s Dax has lost 335 points, or 3.5%, falling to 9329.09, while France\u2019s CAC is down nearly 180 points to 4087.42, a 4.2% fall. Spot US crude oil futures have dropped below $27 a barrel, the lowest since September 2003, following a warning from the world\u2019s energy watchdog that the oil market could \u201cdrown in oversupply\u201d. Adam Posen, the Peterson Institute director who used to set UK interest rates, has also discussed the crisis with us. He\u2019s not desperately alarmed: \u201cI don\u2019t think we are on the edge of another financial crisis. I don\u2019t even think we are on the edge of another crash. The idea that things are as over-valued as they were last time is false.\u201d Posen said governments should be taking advantage of low interest rates to improve public infrastructure, called on China to boost the economy by creating a social safety net and said central banks should avoid making mistakes. \u201cAt the margin I am not sure the Federal Reserve did the right thing by raising rates last month but I am not sure it was a big mistake. But if the Bank of England or the ECB raised rates, that would be a big mistake.\u201d We\u2019ve now grabbed some time with Ken Rogoff, former IMF chief economist and now economics professor at Harvard, to discuss the market turmoil, and the global economy. Rogoff reckons the problems were concentrated in emerging markets. Asked whether the world was on the edge of another crisis, Rogoff said: \u201cIt feels to me that there is a panic in the markets that doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into the real economy.\u201d Rogoff said that emerging markets would suffer in 2016, but that the US and Europe were \u201csolid\u201d. He added: \u201cIf China goes from 7% growth to minus 2% growth then everybody will be in recession. If it goes to 3-4% growth it will probably not be enough to cause a recession in the developed world. But it is definitely a very precarious situation for emerging markets.\u201d Rogoff said it would help if Chinese policy makers won back the credibility they had lost by their \u201cfoolish\u201d attempts trying to control the stock market and the exchange rate. \u201cIt\u2019s like trying to control the weather. They should let the exchange rate and the stock market find their own level. This is the third leg of the debt super-cycle. First is was the US, then it was Europe, now it is China.\u201d Bob Diamond\u2019s concerns about liquidity (see earlier post) have also been echoed by a top IMF official earlier today: Speaking on a panel, deputy director Min Zhu said: \u201cThe key issue is that liquidity could drop dramatically, and that scares everyone.\u201d \u201cIf everybody is moving together we don\u2019t have any liquidity at all. We have to be ready to act very fast.\u201d Hat-tip to AEP... Canada\u2019s new prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has urged Davos attendees to invest more in his country, in one of his first appearances on the international stage since winning power. Trudeau jokes that while Davos is lovely, business leaders should really check out Whistler (the Canadian ski resort). And on the big issue of WEF, the rise of the robots, Trudeau warns that technology needs to serve the cause of human progress, and growth only succeeds if everyone benefits from it. He also argues that Canada can ride out the oil price slump: We\u2019ve also collared Dennis Nally, chairman of PricewaterhouseCoopers, to talk about the turmoil in the markets. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether we are heading for another crash but unquestionably the environment is clearly having an effect on markets, on everything that is going on here and on the attitudes that exist here in Davos. Confidence levels are down, the volatility we are seeing, There are more threats today than ever. How bad could it get? Who knows. Some people are speculating oil could reach $10 a barrel. I don\u2019t think any of us know. All of this uncertainty has a direct impact on confidence levels\u201d. What should be done? \u201cThere needs to be more dialogue about how [bring] to stability back into the system. I believe there is a disconnect between government, regulators and business\u201d. Bob Diamond, the banker who was forced out of Barclays during the Libor rigging crisis, says there\u2019s no comparison between the situation today and in 2008. Diamond, who has now founded a banking operation called Altas Mara which is expanding across Africa, says: \u201cIt Is a correction, a heathy correction. A lot of people are trying to compare it to 2008, but during the last quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 we probably had the deepest economic correction I have seen. I don\u2019t see us going into that position. The US economy is still strong, Europe is doing surprising well - the easier monetary policy led by governor [of the European Central Bank Mario] Draghi has sown some positives. There is a correction in China.. If china slows down to 6 or 7% (growth) is that a success? That\u2019s fine\u201d He also suggests that new regulations brought in since 2008 aren\u2019t helping to calm the markets: \u201cA lot of people are taking about where is the liquidity, where are the buyers? Basel three, Volcker rule, ring fenced banks, buffer upon buffer of capital. Are we surprised there is less liquidity from the banks?\u201d Here\u2019s one jot of good news, Nouriel Roubini, Davos\u2019s own doctor doom and the economist who predicted the last crash doesn\u2019t think it is going to be that bad this time. \u201cIt is not going to be like 2008-09. There is not the excessive leverage in the financial system that there was last time.\u201d But 2016 is going to be a bumpy year until central banks respond, Roubini warns. \u201dThe big thing that should happen is China should stop kicking the can down the road and get on with some serious structural reforms\u201d. Roubini is also concerned about the impact of smarter technology: To no one\u2019s great surprise, the US markets have followed the rest of the world and moved sharply lower in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 271 points or 1.7% while the S&amp;P 500 has fallen more than 1% and Nasdaq has lost 1.5%. Sir Roger Carr, chairman of BAE Systems, said: I think we\u2019re witnessing a collision of events which has provoked an immediate sense of crisis. Whether it\u2019s commodities, China, oil prices, terrorism, geopolitical turbulence, all have landed particularly in the month of January and there is an immediate impact which is reflected in the stock market. At the moment what is being discounted are some of the positives that come out of low oil prices in economic terms. It is only being looked at in the lens of bad news. It is too early to say whether this is a crisis of lasting proportion but I think we should certainly continue to focus on addressing the challenges that are there for all. China may have slowed down but it\u2019s not stopped. Europe is fragile but is focused on improvement and with the UK\u2019s engagement in encouraging a more competitive Europe. America still has the fundamentals of an entrepreneurial spirit, self sufficiency in energy. When you look to the positive, while things are far from perfect, we are not at the point of absolute crisis. Back in Davos and Gavin Patterson, chief executive of BT, was asked if we were on the brink of another crisis. He replied: On the balance of probabilities no, but it is very finely balanced. It is an unstable environment. In terms of doing business, I\u2019ve just been at a lunch and most of the CEOs there say most of the underlying businesses are pretty good. If there is contagion in financial markets into the business markets that is going to affect confidence and that\u2019s when we could see a slow down. How bad? We\u2019ve got to be used to a period of time when the world is just more volatile and we have to be able to live and manage through those sort of conditions. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to go away. There could be quite significant swings but the underlying number when it\u2019s evened out will be fine. What can be done? We need the financial markets to settle down and hope that confidence remains strong and that it doesn\u2019t affect people\u2019s underlying desire to do business. What is really going in China is a big [concern], elections and referendum around the world is an issue and the state of things in the Middle East which have a knock on effect. The US inflation figures suggest there may only be one Federal Reserve rate rise this year, says Rob Carnell of ING Bank: US CPI for December fell 0.1% month on month versus a consensus 0.0% month on month expectation. Energy prices were down 2.4% month on month, and food prices also fell for a second consecutive month. But it is the weakness in the service sector inflation component that probably caught the consensus out the most. At only +0.1% month on month, this was down on the trend 0.2-0.3% growth in service sector prices over recent months, and may reflect a slightly weaker growth profile in residential rents, though it has to be said that the weakness in services was not confined to rentals, and was reflected also in areas such as recreation and education. Goods (commodities prices) were as ever, very weak (down 0.1% month on month excluding food and energy, down 2.1% year on year). At this stage, with the market looking for no further Fed rate hikes until the second half of 2016, and only one rate hike in total this year, it is our own forecasts with two further rate hikes, one in June, and another in the fourth quarter of 2016, that look more in need of amendment than the market view. The Fed dot diagram suggestion for four further hikes this year looks utterly out of touch with reality, if anyone was still paying any attention to this. In the US, the consumer price index fell 0.1% month on month in December after being unchanged the previous month. Analysts had been expected the index to also remain flat in December, but the falling oil price helped push it lower. But the year on year figure rose 0.7%, following a 0.5% gain in November. The core CPI, which strips out energy and food costs, rose 0.1% month on month after rising 0.2% for the previous three months, and 2.1% year on year. Meanwhile US housing starts fell 2.5% in December, adding to worries about the strength of the US economy. Goldman Sachs has reported a drop in profits for the fourth straight quarter, hit by a $5bn settlement related to sales of mortgage bonds during the financial crisis. The bank\u2019s fourth quarter earnings fell 71.8% to $574m, with its results also affected by the plunge in oil prices, the slowdown in the Chinese economy and US rate rises. The slump in oil prices has sent the rouble to a new record low. The Russian currency fell to 80.92 to the dollar before recovering to 80.85, still down 2.8% on the day. The fall comes amid fears that the commodity-dependent Russian economy could be further hit by the continuing slide in crude prices. London\u2019s leading index has fallen into bear market territory, defined as 20% below its recent peak. The FTSE 100 has fallen to 5688, down more than 3% as the oil price continues to slide amid concerns about oversupply and lack of demand. Worries about the outlook for China have rattled global markets, not helped by gloomy comments from the World Economic Forum in Davos. The leading index has now fallen more than 20% from its intra-day peak of 7122, reached in April last year. Meanwhile Germany\u2019s Dax is down 2.9% and France\u2019s Cac has fallen 3.4%. Brent crude is currently 2.7% lower at $27.98 a barrel. Just grabbed a word with Philip J. Jennings, general secretary of UNI Global Union, about the turmoil in the markets. Are we heading into a crash? Yes, we are heading for a crash, I\u2019m worried about it. Emerging markets were meant to pull us through this crisis. but China is slowing, and the impact will ripple out across the developing economy. And the jobs situation across the global economy will not improve How bad could it get? We are worried abut the economic climate - how deep the crash will be. Those RBS analysts [who said to sell everything] may be right - \u201ccataclysm\u201d could be the right word to use. What should be done? We need leadership. The G20 needs to fulfil the promise they made at the last financial crisis, to not just save the banking sector but to also put the economy back on track. The private sector need to understand that lack of investment isn\u2019t helping, and we need to push wages higher. The G20 needs to put demand back in the economy. Some customers at Italy\u2019s Monte dei Paschi bank have started withdrawing their savings, according to its chief executive. The bank is struggling with its bad loans and has seen its stock market value have this year. Reuters reports: Chief executive Fabrizio Viola did not say how much money savers had withdrawn, or when the outflow began, though he said the fall in deposits was \u201climited\u201d and that the bank could cope with it as he sought to reassure customers and investors. Italian bank shares have lost 20% so far this year as investors, already rattled about global economic growth, have sold out of a sector with low profitability and about 200 billion euros ($218 billion) of loans that are unlikely to be repaid. Monte Paschi - Italy\u2019s third-biggest bank - has lost the most ground as it is perceived to be the most vulnerable; it has the highest level of bad loans as a proportion of assets and was the worst performer in a health check of eurozone lenders in 2014. The Tuscan-based bank\u2019s stock, which had plunged 15% on Monday and 14.4% on Tuesday, was suspended from trading several times after falling 18.2% on Wednesday. The plunge helped dragged down all other Italian banking stocks, with Carige shedding 12.7% and Banco Popolare falling more than 6%. Viola said the plunge in Monte Paschi shares was not a reflection of the bank\u2019s fundamentals, which he said had improved in the last quarter of 2015. \u201cOf course clients turning to our local branches are worried about what they read,\u201d Viola said in a statement. \u201cAt present the size of the funding lost due to clients who decided to move part of their savings elsewhere is limited and anyway below levels seen during the previous crisis the bank faced in February 2013 which was overcome brilliantly.\u201d The 2013 crisis he was referring to was when the world\u2019s oldest bank, already badly weakened by the euro zone debt crisis, was hit by a scandal about loss-making derivatives trades... \u201cOver the past few days many have been wondering about the pace at which people closed their accounts and sold bank bonds,\u201d said Giuseppe Sersale, a fund manager at Anthilia Capital Partners. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it a bank run but there are definitely outflows,\u201d he added. Meanwhile, there are reports of Italian government meetings to discuss the problems in the country\u2019s banking sector: Here\u2019s some words of comfort amid the gloom. European economics commissioner Pierre Moscovici does not believe there will be a repeat of the financial crisis, nor does he think the eurozone\u2019s growth outlook will be changed in the next EC forecasts. And he says central banks still have actions they can take to tackle any further slowdown, even if interest rates are at record lows and plenty of stimulus measures have already been taken. Reuters reports from an interview with Moscovici: Central banks still have more firepower they can use to counter a slowdown in global growth, which does not change the outlook for recovery in the eurozone, European Economics Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said on Wednesday. In an interview with Reuters Television at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Moscovici said he did not believe there would be any return to an international financial crisis, despite turmoil in world markets during the first few weeks of 2016 triggered by China\u2019s slowdown and low oil prices. Asked whether the world\u2019s main central banks had run out of ammunition to revive the global economy after years of record low interest rates and quantitative easing, he said: \u201cThey have got guns and they can act.\u201d Moscovici said he did not expect any major change in the euro zone\u2019s growth outlook when the European Commission issues an updated forecast in early February, despite the sharp slowdown in China and tumbling stock and commodity markets. The EU executive last forecast in November that the euro zone would grow by 1.8 percent this year and 1.9 percent in 2017 after an estimated 1.6 percent last year. \u201cAs I see it today I see no change, no major change in our forecast... for Europe. But of course we\u2019ve got to take into account those downside risks. We don\u2019t need to change our policy stance but to reinforce it,\u201d he said. On global market turbulence and falling commodity prices, Moscovici said: \u201cI don\u2019t feel that the financial crisis is coming back. We don\u2019t feel that we are facing the risk of a breakdown in world growth, but there are downsides that we need to address. The IMF has also weighed in on migration, saying it can be positive. A new report predicts a short-term boot to GDP in countries who take refugees in, and long-term benefits if migrants are integrated well. IMF chief Christine Lagarde has also tried to crush worries that migrants will drive wages down: More on capital flows. The amount of money flowing out of emerging markets, especially China, was much worse than expected last year, according to a report from the Institute of International Finance. In October the finance industry group forecast net outflows from emerging markets of $540bn. Now it says the figure was $735bn, with $676bn from China, as investors pulled out of emerging markets and Chinese companies hurried to pay off overseas loans as the country\u2019s currency depreciated. The institute said: Net capital outflows from emerging markets in 2015 were even larger than we previously thought. We now estimate total net capital outflows (including unrecorded flows captured by net errors and omissions) at $735 billion, up from outflows of $111 billion in 2014. The bulk of these outflows relate to China, driven in part by repayment of corporate foreign currency liabilities in the face of concerns about a weakening currency. We estimate total capital outflows from China amounted to $676 billion in 2015\u2014including $216 billion in unrecorded outflows in errors and omissions. Other emerging markets also experienced net capital outflows, as non-resident inflows slumped on broader concerns about emerging market growth performance and corporate indebtedness. For 2016, we expect continued net capital outflows albeit at a somewhat more moderate pace. The impact of the Fed\u2019s shift to a tightening cycle may be limited as long as it is gradual, but flows to emerging markets will continue to face headwinds from growth and debt concerns. HSBC CEO Stuart Gulliver spoke to reporters after he had finished talking about climate change. Asked about the financial market turmoil, he said that part of the movement was \u201cself fulfilling\u201d as investors liquidated positions to make margin calls on positions. \u201cYou always get an overshoot in times of significant sell offs\u201d. He also warned there could be more sell-offs. \u201cI think we will see further adjustments before we hit equilibrium. We\u2019ll see a little more sell offs before we see equilibrium but we\u2019re closer equilibrium than we were a couple of weeks ago, we\u2019re towards the end of this sort of sell off\u201d. He indicated that growth in China was strong and that yesterday\u2019s figures were 30% of the entire Chinese economy in 2005. The bank is currently deciding whether to keep its headquarters in the UK. Gullliver said an update would be made by the time of the results of February 22. Nariman Behravesh, chief economist of IHS, has some interesting thoughts on China, where he thinks policy makers in Beijing will respond to pressure on the yuan by quietly bringing back capital controls. \u201cThere has been a massive amount of capital flight - around $1 trillion since last summer\u201d Behravesh said. \u201cThat puts huge downward pressure on the exchange rate. The question is what happens next.\u201d \u201cThe first thing that policy makers could do is to let the currency go. That would result in a devaluation of 15-20%. That would have horrible consequences. It could trigger a global currency war and a global recession.\u201d The second thing they could do is keep using foreign currency reserves, but there are limits to that.\u201d Finally, either explicitly or implicitly, they could bring back capital controls\u201d. Behravesh said the third approach would run counter to the reform agenda of China\u2019s leaders, who have expressed a desire for greater financial liberalisation. \u201cBut there are no good options. The least bad option would be capital controls.\u201d Behravesh said there were already signs that China was making it harder for people to take money out of the country. He said the credibility of the Chinese leadership had been undermined by their handling of the financial turbulence since last summer. \u201cThe scary thing has been the ineptitude of Chinese policy makers, who panicked when the stock market fell last August and panicked again at the beginning of this year. They want reform but they don\u2019t really trust markets.\u201d Joachim Gauck, the president of Germany, is addressing the Davos Congress Hall now. He begins by touching on the migration crisis, which is a growing domestic issue in Germany after chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s liberal refugee policy. Almost 60 million are trying to escape war and conflict, and it is presenting the European Union with its biggest ever test, he says. Migration isn\u2019t a new problem, it\u2019s been around for decades as people try to escape from peril, find a better life. He then quotes JK Galbraith, who said that migration was the oldest action against poverty. A look at the list of American Nobel laureates and Oscar price winners shows just how much a country can benefit from migrants\u2019 creativity, Gauck says. Migration, and integration, must be thought of in tandem, he says. But it is our \u201chumanitarian responsibility\u201d to take in people who are fleeing the refugee crisis. He also explains that Germany feels a moral obligation to help, having \u2018fallen so low\u2019 in the past (a reference to the second world war). This may not calm the rebellion within her own party, from those who believe Germany needs to cut the number of migrants entering the country: Update: Gauck goes on to warn that limits may need to be set. Associated Press has a good take: The president of Germany says that limiting the number of refugees entering Europe is necessary and \u201cmorally acceptable\u201d if the continent is to continue to provide help to those in need. While stressing the \u201chumanitarian responsibility\u201d of taking in victims of persecution, Joachim Gauck told a conference in Davos, Switzerland, that Germany and European countries must limit the numbers of people who want to come in to avoid being overwhelmed. My colleague Jill Treanor has spoken to HSBC\u2019s CEO Stuart Gulliver - he has admitted that the bank may not have a decision on whether it is moving its bank out of the UK by next month\u2019s financial results. Al Gore, former US vice-president, says last month\u2019s Paris agreement showed that the world is prepared to do what\u2019s needed to tackle climate change. 195 nations said yes, we will change. The direction of travel has been established....and that message has been received by the World Economic Forum. In Paris, countries committed to keeping global warming down to 1.5 degrees celsius. But there is also disappointment that even more wasn\u2019t achieved. Christiana Figueres, UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, says the Paris talks did not end with an agreement on the carbon price because of the lack of unanimity. \u201cThe Paris agreement had to be unanimous, if there was one country that didn\u2019t agree with the carbon price in 2015 had that been rammed down the throat we would not have had a Paris agreement.\u201d A fixed carbon price would encourage investment in solar and other alternative energy sources, she explains. The stock market sell off is getting worse. The FTSE 100 is now down 170 points or 2.8% at 5706 - only around 20 points off a bear market (20% off its peak). Germany\u2019s Dax is down more than 3% and France\u2019s Cac has fallen 3.3%. The US is unlikely to be much help. Ahead of results from Goldman Sachs and the latest US inflation figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are showing a 329 point decline. Sir Martin Sorrell, chairman of advertising giant WPP, has added his voice to those warning that the world faces slowing growth. The new normal is a low-growth world. Inflation is under too much control, we could do with a bit more of it. That scenario will continue. The system couldn\u2019t sustain pre-Lehman growth rates because it blew up in September 2008. Ken Rogoff, former IMF chief economist and Harvard professor, blamed China for the recent market turbulence. It wasnt due to the Federal Reserve\u2019s \u2018microscopic increase\u2019 in interest rates. He also sees trouble ahead in the developing world: For the next year there is going to be a lot of risk in China and the emerging markets, but not such elevated risks for Europe and the US. Climate change is a big theme at Davos, especially after Leonardo DiCaprio attacked the greed of the energy industry last night. Stuart Gulliver, boss of HBSC, has told one panel that the bank sets tougher lending criteria for coal-fired power stations in emerging markets than those in developed economies. He is also optimistic, he said, about funding alternative energy despite the low oil price. \u201c The public wants to do this,\u201d he said, when asked about funding alternative energy and while the cost of financing for such companies currently high he expected it to fall. He also had a warning about suddenly withdrawing all financing for fossil fuels. There would be \u201cunintended consequences\u201d he said as these companies were major employers and paid tax used by governments to pay for health care etc. Gulliver admitted that HSBC\u2019s annual meeting faced protesters from activists trying to end any investment in fossil fuels. Christiana Figueres, UN expert on climate, insisted she was not one of the activities calling for all carbon fuels to be left in the ground. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, former Nigerian finance minister, has backed the ebola agreement between Gavi and Merck announced today. There was a \u201cshared terror\u201d in Africa last year, she says, during the ebola outbreak in which more than 11,000 people died. Amira Yahyaoui, the Tunisian journalist who is co-chairing this year\u2019s meeting, says the rise of smarter machines (the 4th industrial revolution), should spur humans to understand what makes them human. Speaking on a panel, she says humans are no longer in a monopoly on planet Earth. We are in competition with things that might be better than we are. We are the ones destroying the planet, we are the ones killing humans. So this 4th industrial revolution should maybe be a revolution of values. Yahyaoui also challenged WEF for not achieving gender parity at the forum (although there are three male and three female co-chairs this year, including General Motors boss Mary Barra and International Trade Union chief Sharan Burrow). Eighteen percent of this forum are women, 18 is nothing. I come from a country supposed to be very anti-woman and we are more than 33% women in parliament and we have parity in every election. [WEF has made some efforts on this issue, and offers an extra place to businesses who send at least one female delegate] She\u2019s also concerned that the percentage of people under 30 here is \u201cway less than 18%\u201d. Every generation has been driven by youth, and this one will be too, Yahyaoui continues. Unfortunately, older people love progress, but they hate change, and revolutions are all about change, she concludes. It\u2019s not by improving the candle that we created electricity, and it\u2019s time to create electricity. Geraint Johnes, professor of economics at Lancaster University, said: All regions except London experienced a fall in the unemployment rate, suggesting that the recovery is now well and truly being felt nationwide. The construction industry has continued to play a leading part in the recovery - the number of jobs in this sector has increased by some 77000. Administrative and business support functions have also seen considerable growth - of 50000 jobs - over the latest period. The role played by construction is accentuated further by the continuing high rates of pay increase in that sector. Compared with a year earlier, pay in this sector in November amounted to some 5.6% higher. Taking the economy overall, pay growth remains comparatively muted, at 2.0% - though with negligible price inflation, workers are now experiencing noticeable increases in their real wages. So long as productivity gains can be restored, there is no reason to believe that the increase we are now seeing in pay levels should become inflationary. We should not therefore be expecting an interest rate hike any time soon. And here\u2019s chancellor George Osborne on the day\u2019s data: On the jobs data, James Knightley at ING Bank said: The UK labour data looks pretty decent with employment growth in the three months to November rising 267,000 and the unemployment rate falling to 5.1%, both are better than the 235,000 and 5.2% consensus predictions. However, wage growth did slow close to expectations (ex bonus the three month average is now 1.9% year on year although the single month reading did rise to 2.1% from 1.6%). Consequently, it is an encouraging report that should keep consumer confidence and spending running at healthy levels. However, with Bank of England Governor Mark Carney suggesting there is little appetite for a rate hike any time soon and with the prospect of a Brexit vote set to weigh on activity it looks as though November remains the earliest possible opportunity for a rate rise. Still, sterling has come off its lows following the figures. After hitting a seven year low of $1.4125 it has recovered to $1.4162. Here\u2019s are the average earnings: The government\u2019s plans to cut back the public sector show through in the jobs data. For September 2015, 17.1% of people in employment worked in the public sector, the lowest proportion since comparable records began in 1999. Here\u2019s the Reuters take on the UK data: Wage growth in Britain in the three months to November was its slowest since February, official data showed on Wednesday, the latest sign the Bank of England will take its time before raising interest rates. The slowing in wage growth came even as Britain\u2019s unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to 5.1 percent, its lowest since early 2006, from 5.2 percent in the three months to October. The BoE is keeping a close eye on wage growth as it considers when to raise interest rates at a time when inflation has hovered near zero for months and weakness in the global economy is hurting British output. The unemployment rate of 5.1% was below forecasts of a 5.2% figure. Total weekly earnings rose 2%, compared to expectations of 2.1%. This is also the weakest growth since February. On the wages front, average weekly earnings excluding bonuses rose 1.9% in the three months to November, compared to expectations of a 1.8% rise. This was the weakest growth since February last year. The November figure was 2.1% year on year. For September to November 2015, 74% of people aged from 16 to 64 were in work, the highest employment rate since comparable records began in 1971, according to the Office for National Statistics. The UK December claimant count has fallen 4,300 compared to expectations of a 2,500 rise. The jobless numbers fell 99,000 to 1.675m in the three months to November, meaning the unemployment rate is 5.1%, its lowest since the three months to January 2006. Employment rose by 267,000, the third biggest increase on record. With crude still tumbling - Brent is now down 2.8% at $27.88 a barrel - Shell has spelled out the damage the slump in oil prices is doing to its business. Our energy editor Terry Macalister reports: Shell has warned that its fourth-quarter profits may be 50% lower than last time with full year write-offs as high as $7bn (\u00a35bn), underlining the damage being wreaked on the industry by low crude prices. In the first preliminary results to be reported this year by any of the large oil companies, Shell said it expected earnings to come in at between $1.6bn and $1.9bn and full-year numbers as low as $10.4bn. Further losses will be taken in the last three months of the year, bringing the total amount of writedowns on the sale of assets and other one-off losses to as high as $7bn. The dismal figures ramp up the pressure on Shell\u2019s chief executive, Ben van Beurden, who is trying to justify the \u00a335bn takeover of rival BG which must be agreed by more than 50% of Shell shareholders next week. The full story is here: Gavi, the vaccine group, is announcing a new deal with drugs company Merck to get access to its ebola vaccine. Under the scheme, Merck will make 300,000 doses of the vaccine available in the next few months, for clinical trials and in case there is another outbreak. The vaccine not been fully licenced yet, but testing last year found it was 100% effective in providing protection against ebola. Seth Berkley, the head of Gavi, says there was initially a \u201ccomplete market failure\u201d with ebola, as there was no commercial demand for a vaccine. But the outbreak in 2015, in which more than 11,000 people died, has helped force a rethink. Merck\u2019s product, called VSV-ZEBOV live attenuated Ebola Zaire vaccine, is the most promising available, Berkley says. The suffering caused by the Ebola crisis was a wake-up call to many in the global health industry,\u201d Berkley told an audience at Davos. This agreement means we will be \u201cahead of the curve\u201d next time. The deal will also help Merck to get the vaccine win approval from the World Health Organisation, he added. Gavi is providing $5m to help Merck submit the drug for licensing by the end of 2017. Julie Gerberding, vice-president for public health at Merck, says her company is committed to getting their ebole vaccine fully licenced. She says: The scale and speed of the firestorm in Africa reminded us that mother nature is the best terrorist. It showed that we need to prepare in advance, and also respond quickly when a crisis occurs. And when we have a licenced ebola vaccine, we will make it available at the lowest possible not-for-profit price, Gerberding pledges. Anand Mahindra, director of Indian company Mahinda and Mahindra, is one of the speakers on a panel about the transformation of tomorrow. \u201cI was scared\u201d he said when having dinner in New York and the young girls sitting next to him didn\u2019t talk to each other for 15 minutes while they used their phones. His daughter told him that they would be posting imagines on instagram. \u201cIt was some kind of ghost world,\u201d he said. Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook is sitting alongside him, making the point that tomorrow won\u2019t be transformed while men keep ruling the world. \u201cMen still run the world and I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s going that well\u201d. She conducted a poll of audience - how many women had been told they were too aggressive at work and asked if they should be working. Hands went up. She talked about Facebook\u2019s civil courage initiative to try to end hate on he social network. \u201cThere is no place for hate and intolerance on our platform,\u201d she said. Facebook\u2019s CEO, Sheryl Sandburg, is discussing the future of technology now: In the wake of falls on Asian markets, investors in Europe are seeing heavy losses at the start of trading. The FTSE 100 is down 110 points or 1.8% 5766, its lowest level since November 2012 and less than 100 points off a bear market (down 20% from its all time high last April). Germany\u2019s Dax is down 2.3% while France\u2019s Cac has fallen 2.4% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is down 2.6%. The head of Swiss banking giant UBS, Axel Weber, has added to the angst in Davos by warning that we are stuck in an era of low growth. He pointed out that the International Monetary Fund has consistently been downgrading its short-term growth forecasts, as hopes for a strong recovery have consistently been dashed. Weber says: \u201cLast year the forecast of the IMF for that year was 2% lower than the forecast three years out. It\u2019s just a sign of the fact we are and have moved to a lower growth environment, where the rebound of growth rates we\u2019ve seen in the past we are unlikely to see again soon. We are coming out of biggest global crisis in many decades and it will take time to heal\u201d. Weber also argues that something fundamental has changed - this isn\u2019t just a cyclical phenomenon. And that has left central bankers struggling: As he put it: One of the reasons why growth cannot be reignited is the central banks also have a difficulty to reignite inflation rates. Most of the central banks tell you (their target) is to have inflation rate of around 2%, quantitative easing and massively expanding the balance sheet does not lead to an uptick of inflation close to target at least on the time horizon of one to two years out\u201d. \u201cWe are seeing a low growth, low interest rate environment with low interest rates. We will have to get used to the lower growth environment and low interest rate environment\u201d. Tuesday\u2019s market rally has proved shortlived, with Asian markets down sharply and Europe forecast to follow suit. After rising on talk of growing Chinese demand for oil and hopes of more central bank stimulus to boost the world\u2019s second largest economy, crude is falling back once more. That appears to be a belated reaction to the International Energy Agency saying the market could \u201cdrown in oversupply.\u201d Brent crude is now down nearly 2% at $28.19 a barrel, while WTI is down 3.3% at $27.52. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said the respite from recent negative sentiment has gained little traction: The inability of US markets to hold onto most of its gains was the first clue as oil prices slipped back off their highs once again. Furthermore it is this inability to sustain rebounds for any length of time that continues to gnaw away at investor sentiment in the short term, and keep the pressure on the downside. Here\u2019s our story on the falling Asian markets, with Japan now technically in a bear market: Business leaders in Davos are rather gloomier this year, according to a new report from PricewaterhouseCoopers last night. Terrorism, oil, and China, mean bosses are more worried than at any time in the last 5 years: Good morning from Davos, Switzerland, where the 2016 Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum is getting underway. There\u2019s a bit of snow in the air this morning, and more than a bit of anxiety as global leaders, business chiefs, campaigners, celebrities and the media converge on the small ski resort. This year\u2019s WEF is racked with fears. For example: Will robots devour millions of jobs? How bad is the Chinese economy really? When will the rout in the stock markets end, and does it herald a wave of defaults? Is oil going to hit $20 per barrel, or even $10, and what will that means for petr-exporters? Can the turmoil in the Middle East be tamed? Will Europe sink under the pressure of the refugee crisis? Delegates have a lot on their plates this year, whether they\u2019re mingling in the congress centre or holding top-level meetings behind closed doors. There\u2019s a lot happening today, but here\u2019s a few key events we\u2019ll try to cover: 9am Davos time (8am GMT): Facebook\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg and Microsoft\u2019s Satya Nadella debate the 4th industrial revolution 9.30am: Vaccine group GAVI and Merck announce an ebola vaccine deal 10.30: A session on preventing future shocks in the financial markets, 11.20am: German president Joachim Gauck discusses the migration crisis 3.20pm: Canada\u2019s new PM Justin Trudeau 3.45pm: A session on the refugee crisis, including Queen Rania of Jordan, Peter Maurer of the Red Cross, and Hamdi Ulukaya of Chobani 5.45pm: US vice-president Joe Biden discusses geopolitical security. The full programme is online here. We also get the latest UK unemployment report this morning (9.30am GMT) and US inflation data this afternoon. And while all that\u2019s going on, the stock markets are expected to suffer another bad day. There\u2019s already been a heavy selloff in Asia, and we\u2019re expecting the FTSE 100 to tumble at the open. Here\u2019s the opening calls: UK FTSE: 5767 -110 points German DAX: 9438 -221 French CAC: 4176 -96 Spanish IBEX: 8401 -154 Angus Nicholson of IG says that concerns over China\u2019s slowing economy are building. The somewhat mystifying 3%+ rally in Mainland equities yesterday has proved short-lived and this is likely to punish commodities on European and US exchanges. Some more of the Chinese GDP data has filtered out today and concerns about Chinese economic growth seeing a very weak Q1 in 2016 are growing. So it could be a dramatic day....",

Technically, the major indices formed a topping pattern as they failed to make fresh highs after the China-inspired summer sell-off. Stress in the high yield bond market was becoming apparent even before the Fed hiked rates. That hike now looks as if it will go down as one of the worst-timed rate rises in history, even crowning the ECB\u2019s classic efforts in 2011.

Perhaps not yet - in a statement and press conference in Frankfurt. After last month, when the measures announced proved a disappointment, and the more hawkish elements on the ECB clearly prevented the bank from doing more, Draghi\u2019s comments will be widely watched. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today\u2019s focus is likely to shine on the first ECB rate meeting of 2016, against a continuing backdrop of weak inflation in the euro area.</p> <p>With last month\u2019s December disappointment still fresh in the memory ECB President Mario Draghi will have to convince the markets that the ECB has a plan, and the ammunition to cope with the further slide in inflationary pressures that are likely to ripple across Europe in the coming weeks.</p> <p>It is clear that the hawks won out last month preventing the ECB from acting in a much stronger fashion, and in the process giving the ECB President a bloody nose, after he had indicated the prospect of much stronger action. How Mr Draghi navigates these divisions will be particularly pertinent given how they were revealed in the most recent minutes, especially given that the next projections in March are likely to see inflation expectations guided lower.</p> <p>This is because since last month\u2019s December meeting oil prices have slid another 35%, which means that while the ECB President might come across as dovish later today, after last month\u2019s disappointment markets may not necessarily take him at his word.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2494b2fe927581f6e47d8b56b40c51998ee852c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2494b2fe927581f6e47d8b56b40c51998ee852c/0_0_3252_1951/1000.jpg\" alt=\"ECB President Draghi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">ECB President Draghi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francois Lenoir/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Economists at Unicredit said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>ECB president Mario Draghi will likely sound dovish today, but we expect him to strike a reasonable balance. Mr. Draghi will be careful to avoid fuelling too much speculation about further action to avoid a repetition of the December experience, when the announcement of QE2 fell short of high expectations.</p> <p>At the time, the market\u2019s disappointed reaction resulted in a 3% rally in euro-dollar exchange rate. Today, we do not expect the meeting to cause any major move in exchange rates, as the market seems prepared for a relatively balanced debate.

                "bodyText":"George Soros then went on to launch an astonishing attack on Donald Trump, saying that he was doing \u201cthe work of Isis\u201d. He added: \u201cBy fearmongering he and (Ted) Cruz are doing the work of Isis. They want people to turn against the Muslim community and make the Muslim community think there is no alternative to terrorism. It turns the Muslim community into a breeding ground for Isis. Last month, Donald Trump called for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown\u201d on Muslims entering the US. This prompted a huge petition to have the businessman and presidential candidate banned from the UK, which MPs debated earlier this week. During the debate, Trump was labelled (among other things) a \u201cridiculous xenophobe\u201d. Soros said Vladimir Putin was making the crisis worse by his bombing of civilians in Syria. \u201cHe wants the EU to collapse.\u201d Soros then warned that European countries were in crisis, due to the number of people who have fled to the region: \u201cWe have reached a tipping point where the influx reduces the capacity of receiving countries assimilate or integrate the refugees and we have a panic. It is like a cinema on fire without exit signs.\u201d Soros said 2016 was going to be a difficult year. There would be no further rate rises from the Federal Reserve and the ECB would ease policy in March, he predicted (as Mario Draghi hinted today). George Soros, the billionaire financier turned philanthropist, has warned the World Economic Forum tonight that the migration crisis is putting the European Union in jeopardy. Larry Elliott was at the event, and reports: George Soros said: \u201cThe EU is in an existential crisis as a result of migration. The EU is falling apart.\u201d Backing the idea of a Marshall Plan, Soros said: \u201cMost people know that something has gone terribly wrong. It has to be put right.\u201d As we covered in this liveblog this morning, Germany\u2019s finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has called for billions to be spent helping the troubled countries in the Middle East, to stem the flood of refugees into Europe. Soros added that the same conditions were in place as caused the crisis in 2008. \u201cThere is a financial crisis and a bear market. The source of the disequilibrium is different. In 2008 it was US sub prime. Today it is China where a hard landing is practically unavoidable.\u201d The Greek government says the talks between Lagarde and Tsipras were \u201csincere\u201d. Helena Smith has the details: The Greek government has just issued one of its famous briefing papers calling Tsipras\u2019 talks with IMF chief Christine Lagarde \u201csincere.\u201d The Greek PM \u201cunderlined that time is a critical parameter for the successful conclusion of the Greek programme and the first evaluation [of the economy\u2019s performance,]\u201d the paper said. Both agreed that from now on there should be \u201cdirect communication\u201d between the Greek government and the IMF \u201cso that each side has a clear view of the positions of the other,\u201d it noted. After saying it would be preferable if the IMF did not participate in Greece\u2019s latest bailout, Athens reluctantly agreed last week to the Washington-based body remaining amongst the lenders. Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF, has met with Alexis Tsipras at the sidelines of the World Economic Forum. It was a good meeting, one insider says. And the IMF has now issued a statement, reiterating that Greece needs significant debt relief, as well as pension reforms which are causing such anger in Athens. \u201cThe managing director reiterated that the IMF stands ready to continue to support Greece in achieving robust economic growth and sustainable public finances through a credible and comprehensive medium-term economic program. \u201cSuch a program would require strong economic policies, not least pension reforms as well as significant debt relief from Greece\u2019s European partners to ensure that debt is on a sustainable downward trajectory.\u201d While the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras was addressing delegates in Davos earlier today, opposition against the policies his government is being forced to apply intensified as thousands took to the streets. Our correspondent, Helena Smith, reports from Athens. Opposition to the pension and tax measures set as the price of further bailout funds mounted today as thousands of protestors \u2013mostly from the professions \u2013 joined farmers and fishermen and public sector unionists in denouncing the policies. As Tsipras hob-nobbed in Davos, around 10,000 demonstrators took to the streets \u2013 following up farmer blockades that also expanded - in further evidence that after months (some might say years) of being relatively inactive, the protest movement is once again gaining steam. For the most part, lawyers, doctors and engineers, many said they belonged to Greece\u2019s vast sector of self-employed who stood to be hard hit by the reforms. \u201cA lot of us here voted for the left and feel really betrayed,\u201d Baltis Kapopoulos, an Athenian engineer, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible that the left should be tainted by such policies,\u201d he said in front of the Greek parliament, a placard emblazoned with the words \u2018You won\u2019t kick us out of the country\u2019 above his head. At 29, Kapopoulos said he had no desire to leave Greece but like many might be forced to by the measures. \u201cIf they go through, pensions will drop, contributions will soar and taxes will double. There\u2019ll be a lot of black market work with no insurance. And it\u2019ll be the end of small firms.\u201d \u201cI think the reason there has been such a delay in protest is because people have been shocked. We voted \u2018no\u2019 in the referendum [last July] and 48 hours later, Tsipras went and accepted everything,\u201d he said of the leftist\u2019s spectacular surrender to creditors\u2019 demands under threat of Greece\u2019s ejection from the euro zone. \u201cEither we react now or we never will. It\u2019s the last chance if we don\u2019t want to be forced to leave our country.\u201d Felix Salmon, the sharp-as-a-very-sharp-tack financial columnist, has delivered his verdict on this year\u2019s Davos. And it\u2019s a zinger, surpassing Felix\u2019s earlier criticism of the annual shindig in the mountains. He argues that the excitement and chatter behind the scenes about Donald Trump (the antithesis of the spirit of Davos), shows that WEF\u2019s vision of an open, inclusive approach to solving the world\u2019s problems is failing. Especially as we seem to be collecting more problems, not fewer, from stock market turmoil and oil, to the Middle East. Over to Felix: This year, then, is proving itself to be the Davos of denial, the year that the disconnect between rhetoric and reality became more obvious than ever. The founder of the World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab, is on some level a plutocratic power-broker just like many other rich and powerful men, but his dream of bringing the world together in the service of peace and prosperity is, or was, a genuine one. It has even been bought into by leftist critics who complain that Davos is \u201cincreasingly where global decisions are being taken and moreover is becoming the default form of global governance.\u201d The truth, however, is that with the exception of a few public-health initiatives, the Davos model of \u201cmulti-stakeholder initiatives\u201d and \u201cglobal redesign\u201d has utterly failed in its stated aims. The grandiloquence is as lofty as ever, but the world has not come together; instead, it is fracturing, and the World Economic Forum\u2019s manifold Leaders are reduced to the status of impotent spectators. Some men just want to watch the world burn; Davos Man wants nothing less. But, right now, that\u2019s all he can realistically do. In the financial markets, ECB president Mario Draghi has provided some respite today with his assurances that the central bank will review policy in March - hinting fresh stimulus could come sooner than many investors had been expecting. London\u2019s bluechip FTSE 100 index rebounded from a three-year low on Draghi\u2019s remarks, which followed assurances from his Bank of England counterpart Mark Carney this week that UK interest rates would stay at their record low amid turmoil on global markets and signs that the domestic economy had softened. The FTSE 100 closed up 100 points, or 1.8%, at 5,773.8 but it is still down more than 7% from the start of the year having sold off with other leading bourses around the world on worries over global growth and China\u2019s downturn. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index closed up 2% and on Wall Street the Dow Jones industrial average was up 1.2% and the S&amp;P 500 was up 0.8% at the time of the London close. Analysts cautioned that while Draghi\u2019s words had soothed markets for now, they would need to be followed with real action. Many recalled December\u2019s disappointment when ECB action was deemed much less aggressive than Draghi\u2019s prior promises had led investors to believe. \u201cECB president Draghi once again saw the equity markets confirm his \u2018super\u2019 status as they jumped almost as soon as he started his speech,\u201d said Alastair McCaig, analyst at online trading company IG. \u201cAll in all it was very impressive, especially when you consider he didn\u2019t actually promise anything, but he was convincing enough to get JP Morgan, RBS and Barclays to bring forward their calls for further easing from June to March.\u201d Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, commented: \u201cAlthough equity markets have lapped up the prospect of additional easing like manna from heaven, any euphoria derived from promises of central bank action may prove to be fleeting. Despite Draghi\u2019s assurances, it\u2019s still not clear if the ECB is willing to commit to the sort of massive, unconditional and open-ended QE programmes that we have seen from the Bank of Japan and the Fed.\u201d Now here\u2019s a turn-up. Davos attendees have voted that the answer to inequality lies more in wealth distribution than greater opportunity, we hear. At the start of the debate, the audience were split 65%-35% in favour of opportunity. But after a spirited debate, the vote was switched, reports Philip Jennings of the UNI Global union. George Osborne has denied that the EU renegotiations are hurting the UK economy, and claimed that the recent market volatility is actually a good thing: Speaking to CNBC here in Davos, he said: \u201cInternationally we need a big of a sense of perspective which is, underlying all this volatility are some transformations and transitions which are fundamentally good for the world \u2013 China becoming a more consumption based economy, energy being cheaper\u2026in the European Union and the euro zone, the European Central Bank ready to\u2026step in and support the euro zone.\u201d \u201cBecause of the very sharp falls in the oil price the markets are unstable\u2026but fundamentally for most western economies\u2026the fall in the price of energy is a good thing.\u201d This rather sums Davos up: Businesses at Davos are being urged to provide more financial assistance to help the world prepare for the next major pandemic. Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, has warned that we are simply not ready for another serious outbreak, similar to the Ebola crisis that struck Africa last year. Speaking at Davos he says: Pandemics are not that rare, we have had a dozen in the last decade. He cites Sars, bird flu, Mers, influenza and the Zika virus as examples of diseases which could create a new pandemic. At the moment, vaccines do not exist for any of these viruses. This leaves the world very vulnerable, and we need to address it at the time between epidemics. As well as life-saving drugs, Farrar says countries also need to prepare their response plans, so they are not caught out when a pandemic begins. A new report, from the Commission on Creating a Global Health Risk Framework for the future, estimated that epidemics and pandemics cost the global economy $60 billion annually. Victor Dzau, who oversaw the commission, says: \u201cThe report calls the attention globally that this isn\u2019t just a health issue, it\u2019s a global security issue\u201d The report called for the World Health Organisation to be strengthened, and for more money for R&amp;D. In total, Farrar tells me, just 60 cents or 40p per person would make a dramatic difference in fighting pandemics. That\u2019s $4.5bn, which could come from governments and philanthropic groups as well as business. As Farrar puts it: If we did that, we could go a long way to avoiding another Ebola, or worse. Dr Zia Khan of the Rockefeller Foundation says businesses must do their bit: \u201cWe are looking to the business community, as well as G7 and others, to take up as a call to action. It is directly relevant to them\u201d. If you\u2019re just tuning in, please click here to see our earlier summary of the comments made by the French and Dutch PMs today. Our politics liveblog had rounded up Cameron\u2019s speech - here. In brief, they are that: Cameron said that he was \u201cnot in a hurry\u201d to get an EU deal by February (really, prime minister?) Cameron said there would still be many \u201cimperfect\u201d things about the EU even if he got the reform package he wanted. He urged business to start campaigning now for Britain to stay in a reformed EU. He said Britain could have \u201cthe best of both worlds\u201d in a reformed EU. Lets get back to Davos. And Carlos Ghosn, the CEO of Renault-Nissan, just told me that his company will cope fine if Britain chooses to leave the EU. Asked about the possibility of Brexit, Ghosn said: I\u2019m not worried. Whatever is the decision of the UK we will adapt to it. We will adapt to it. If the UK stays, we will continue what we\u2019re doing. If the UK decides to move out, we will adapt to the situation. I don\u2019t think there is a reason to worry. We knew for many years that this was possible. So we\u2019ll deal with it. But might you be forced to move jobs out of the UK, if we leave the EU? Frankly it\u2019s too early to talk about that. To sum up, ECB president Mario Draghi said the ECB would review and may reconsider its monetary policy in March, and that interest rates were likely to stay at low levels for some time. That hint of further stimulus was enough to send the euro lower against the pound and dollar, and give markets a boost. He also dismissed suggestions the ECB\u2019s governing council was split over December\u2019s decision to cut the deposit rate and extend the length of the QE programme. Last minutes showed governing council was divided, how confident are you you can get a majority for more easing measures. On the 2% target, ex-chief economist of ECB said target should be in longer term not medium because it harms ECB credibility. Disagree that minutes show such divisions. Today\u2019s line of communication was unanimous. We have got a majority over last four years, so should have no doubts the council has the willingness and cohesion necessary to take actions needed. On second point, when people say it should be lower than 2% while others say above, camps are divided. [Economist] confirmed validity of the target. The horizon of reaching this objective is his argument. View of council is we should reject any suggestion we may do less than what\u2019s necessary, in order to achieve target without undue delay. There are global events which could adversely affect objective, but not reason to give up. And with that, it\u2019s all over. Could markets get ahead of themselves as before December meeting? I abstained from blaming markets as such. Communication is a two way affair, hard to put blame of some disappointment on one side only. The council is open to use all necessary instruments to cope with the situation which is materially different from what it was at the beginning of December. In October, said you would re-examine in December and there was action. Is there any difference now? How worried are you about recent drop in inflation expectations? All inflation expectations have declined, and more worryingly, their correlation with inflation has increased. The council has the power, the willingness to act. What is message for countries like Spain whose disinflation is less effective. Is there a need for fiscal change in eurozone. Spain has achieved one of most significant progress in reform, country is now on its way to continue recovery and structural reforms. With very low inflation rates, the internal revaluations become more difficult. One of reasons inflation at 2% makes even more sense in a monetary union like ours. No disagreement on fiscal policy between ECB and EC. We are not the guardians, that is the EC. Fiscal consolidation should be growth friendly based on tax cuts, government spending control and possibly investment. There has been a wave of stock market selling, especially bank shares and Italian bank shares. You more or less gave a clean bill of health to banks, markets seem to disagree with your assessment. On non performing loans, you have asked for information so what is the purpose of this action? This allows me to clarify a confused perception. The NPLs were fully assessed in comprehensive assessment. Nothing new. The provisioning for these was fully determined. So no new unexpected provisioning or requests for more capital will be made by banking supervisor. On Italy, its banks have a level of provision similar to that prevailing in eurozone area, and a level of collatoral. European supervisor is aware it takes years to deal with NPLs, cannot be resolved with short period of time. Good example is Ireland - successful in terms of recovery and they are dealing with NPLs gradually. The questionaire was sent to several banks, not only Italy. It is an enquiry on how banks are managing NPLs. The purpose is to look at different national practices to get one best practice in time. Not an initiative to get banks to deal with NPLs urgently. Don\u2019t think markets disagree but there has been confusion. Hope this helps. Causes of movements in markets? Difficult to assess. Whether it will be transient or not, whether market adjust to a different level, better question for market analysts to answer. Regarding the fall in the oil price - wouldn\u2019t it be better to ignore effect of that. History suggests they will rise again for sure [and lift inflation], why not wait? When we have dramatic movement in commodities we look at three factors: persistence of these changes, if it was a short term effect we would look through it but this has not been our experience. Materiality, the size. Since December oil fell by 40%. Look at second round effects - low commodity prices do feed into other prices and that could generate what we want to avoid, spiralling down phenomona. So far don\u2019t have that, but have to be vigilent. We have to take seriously that low commodity prices for a long period may have second round effects that we want to take action against. Comment on China risks. On refugees, chancellor Merkel is taking a big risk and if situation worsens she could leave, was there a discussion on this domestic German crisis. On China, there have been three main developments - weaker PMI, situation in forex market, situation in stock market. All this generated sizeable capital outflows. We are monitoring. So far indicators suggest there is a gradual deceleration in line with our expectations. But outlook for eurozone area after these developments has been revised downwards. There has been a renewed decline in commodity and oil prices since December. On oil, supply and demand factors and what is happening in China is contributing to demand side. What do we expect? Chinese authorities have reputation for acting responsibly. In last two weeks they have been regaining control of policy. On refugees, can\u2019t talk about one country. Large change but could become opportunity. One of constraints on purchases is political. On financial turmoil have you seen signs of stress among investors, customers. If there were constraints, we will have technical work so we can use all instruments. On second point, best answer to recent developments is to make sure banking sector is resilient. Is a factual statement that all the actions taken have produced a much stronger banking sector than it was before the crisis. But should be cautious about not being too self congratulatory. The commodity volatility we are seeing would previously have tested banking system, but we have seen, they stand pretty resilient. Are you concerned about banking system and financial stability in light of what\u2019s happening in world. We are constantly monitoring financial sector, banking sector, trying to see whether central banks\u2019 monetary policies could become a source of financial instability. So far we have not seen signs of the potential financial instability of the like we have seen in the pre-crisis times. Not our mandate to protect banks\u2019 profitability but we are aware of consequences. Best answer is to ensure economy returns to growth, stable growth. Best answer for banking sector as well. You said no limits to what you could do, could you extend purchases to other classes of assets such as equities, lower other rates not just deposit. On refugee issue, are you concerned of effects of border closures on economy? I can only reiterate there are no limits. If we are to decide about a specific policy we want to be confident there are no technical limits to the size of its deployment. On refugees, this is an extraordinary development which is and will be changing the face of our society in Europe. It is in our hands, the opportunity, the ability to transform this development into an opportunity for future growth in Europe. We are not surrendering in front of these global actions. Our mandate is to reach a level of inflation at if not below 2%, even more determined in face of adverse events. Last month, you said monetary policy was adequate, now reviewing. Does this harm credibility. Inflation could fall below zero despite everything, do central banks not have as much control. Monetary policy has been quite effective - improvement in all financial conditions, now translated into real economic improvements. In December measures we decided were appropriate. But based on prevailing circumstances. We looked at exchange rate, price of oil, growth prospects of emerging markets. Since then, these circumstances have changed. Oil fallen by 40%, exchange rate fallen, and you can see situation of financial and commodity markets. Those measures in December were quite significant (NB one criticsim was the measures were watered down) The credibility of ECB would be harmed if we did not review and reconsider monetary policy stance when we have the full information. We have the determination to act and there are no limits within our mandate. The governing council was unanimous on this line of communication. (there was talk of a split) Now for questions. You will reconsider monetary policy stance in March, what measures do you have left and what can they do? Could you clarify position on Portugals Novo Banco where ECB not said to be involved in the bail in? Draghi: On second question, we are not the resolution authority. On monetary policy: In a speech in New York I said there are no limits to deploying instruments to reach objective of inflation at 2%. Don\u2019t want to discuss specifics of instruments. The euro is dropping as Draghi speaks, on the prospect of further action including perhaps further rate cuts: But European markets seem to like the talk, with Germany\u2019s Dax up 1.2% and France\u2019s Cac climbing 1.3%. ECB president Mario Draghi said the bank had decided to keep key interest rates unchanged, and it expected them to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. He said the asset purchases under the QE programme were proceeding smoothly. He said it was clear that its monetary policies were working. Developments in the real economy, financing conditions have improved, strengthened the eurozone\u2019s resilience recent global market shocks. Extension of QE until March 2017 was appropriate, there was a significant addition of liquidity to the banking system. But he added: \u201cYet as we start the new year, downside risks have increased again amid heightened uncertainty about emerging market prospects, commodity markets, geopolitical risks. Eurozone inflation dynamics are also weaker than expected in December. It is necessary to review and reconsider our monetary policy stance in early March, when new economic projections become available.\u201d He said the fall in the oil price should help consumers and businesses, but the risks to eurozone growth remained to the downside. Inflation expectations will be low in coming months, and pick up only later in 2016. Here\u2019s the full text of the European Central Bank rate decision ahead of president Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference: At today\u2019s meeting the governing council of the ECB decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.05%, 0.30% and -0.30% respectively. And here\u2019s a comment from David Katimbo-Mugwanya, a fund manager at EdenTree Investment Management: The ECB will be keen to take stock in the coming weeks, preferring to appraise the effectiveness of its December policy actions rather than easing further in the immediate future. The central bank will have taken note, nevertheless, of persistent disinflationary pressures stemming from oil and commodity price weakness. Crowds are gathering in the Congress Hall for David Cameron\u2019s speech on Britain\u2019s Place in the World. As covered this morning, we expect the PM to call on business leaders to back him over the EU renegotiations. As it\u2019s a massive UK political story, my colleague Andy Sparrow is going to live blog it himself, here: You can watch the session live here: Just bumped into Jamie Dimon, boss of JP Morgan, whose bank is planning to back the In campaign on the UK EU referendum. He would not say how much the bank is spending - \u201cWe\u2019ve just started doing (it)...Wish we didn\u2019t have to do it at all\u201d. Q: So will JP Morgan stay if there is a no vote? That will depend on how Brexit happens, and which operations the bank could and couldn\u2019t keep in Britain, Dimon replies. He continues: \u201cBritain\u2019s been a great home for financial companies and it\u2019s benefited London quite a bit. We\u2019d like to stay there but if we can\u2019t, we can\u2019t. I can\u2019t tell the British people what to do, it\u2019s up to them\u201d Time for a quick recap. Britain\u2019s future in, or out, of Europe has dominated the morning of the second day of the World Economic Forum in Davos. A series of European politicians have urged the UK not to quit the European Union. Dutch PM Mark Rutte said Europe needs Britain\u2019s \u201coutward looking , trade oriented, growth oriented\u201d approach, and urged UK business and community leaders to speak out. French PM Manuel Valls said Brexit would be a tragedy, while German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble called it a disaster for Britain, and the EU. Valls also suggested that David Cameron will not succeed in completing his renegotiations next month. The migration crisis has also loomed large: Sch\u00e4uble called for a new Marshall Plan to tackle Europe\u2019s refugee crisis, saying billions must be spent. Rutte said that the Dublin agreement, under which migrants seek residency in the first EU country they register in, must be reformed. Otherwise the Schengen agreement allowing free movement across most EU countries will collapse. And Greek PM Alexis Tsipras said the EU needs to do more to help \u201ctransit countries\u201d such as Greece and devise a properly thought-out and paid-for relocation and resettlement plan. Tsipras also clashed with Sch\u00e4uble over Europe\u2019s approach to growth and austerity. The Greek PM wants more help; Germany\u2019s finance minister wants more competitiveness. Elsewhere in Davos... US Treasury secretary Jack Lew has hinted that markets have over-reacted to the oil price slump and China\u2019s slowdown. The chief economist of Brazil\u2019s biggest bank has warned its economic woes could last until 2018 A top Chinese official has defended Beijing\u2019s handling of the crisis.... ...after Christine Lagarde said China has a communication problem. The boss of HSBC has warned that it is hard to raise money for green energy right now The European Central Bank has kept its interest rates unchanged, as expected. After December\u2019s cut, it has left the deposit rate at -0.3%. Its benchmark refinancing rate is steady at 0.05%. The euro has inched up to $1.0915 following the news. Now for ECB president Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference, due shortly. Italy hopes to agree a plan with the EU to help its struggling banks by next week at the latest, Reuters is reporting. The report says the idea is to set up vehicles to help banks sell bad loans, with a disposal price equivalent to between 20% and 30% of the nominal value of the loan. The latest proposal submitted by Italy is being discussed with a technical meeting due on Friday. Yesterday, there were reports that some customers were withdrawing savings from Monte Paschi bank, with its chief executive saying said the fall in deposits was \u201climited\u201d and that the bank could cope with it.. Jack Lew managed to crack a joke; things can\u2019t be that bad. The US Treasury secretary, Jack Lew, is discussing the state of the US economy, and the wider globe. Lew begins by warning that the world economy isn\u2019t strong enough: I look around the world and there are a lot of headwinds. We\u2019ve seen very slugging growth in demand for some years now, and that\u2019s led to a not-strong-enough global economy. And now that things are developing in parts of the global economy that are disruptive, people are reacting to it. And he argues that people are being too negative over recent developments, such as the slump in crude oil. For anyone consuming oil, lower oil is a tax cut. And on China, Lew says the situation isn\u2019t dramatically different than last year. They are in a long and difficult transition, from an export-driven economy to a consumer one. That\u2019s a tough and disruptive process. The big issue in China is whether it can stick to its own economic reform plan, and deliver the growth that it, and the world economy, needs. He said it was important to see how China handled its currency - which was deprecated last summer - and called for \u201can orderly transition\u201d with the exchange rate, and for the Chinese to allow industrial capacity to \u201cright size. \u201cThese are big ifs\u201d, Lew said. And Lew also hints that investors may be getting too jumpy. I know it\u2019s been bumpy days in the market, but I try to look beyond the hour to hour, day to day, to what the big trends are. I\u2019m not minimising that it\u2019s been choppy in the markets, but I think you do need to look at some of these underlying trends in a long-term way. Ilan Goldfajn, chief economist at Brazil\u2019s biggest bank, Ita\u00fa Unibanco, says that his country\u2019s economic malaise is unlikely to be tackled until 2018. Goldfajn warned that : \u201cBrazil has a fiscal problem, it has an external problem and it has a political problem.\u201d The impeachment proceedings against Brazil\u2019s president Dilma Rousseff meant there had \u201cbeen a lame duck government from day one\u201d. Congress was blocking any attempts to resolve Brazil\u2019s economic problems, in part caused by the collapse in commodity prices and in part by mismanagement. Every country in South America had seen its growth rate halved since the end of the commodity super-cycle, Goldfajn said, but Brazil had done much worse than that. It had gone from growth of 4% a year to contraction of 4% a year. The political impasse would last until the next presidential election in 2018, he fears, saying: \u201cThe most likely scenario is that the economic problems are not going to be resolved until then. The economy will eventually not be in recession but there won\u2019t be a recovery either.\u201d Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, warned Davos that Brexit would be disastrous for all involved: BP\u2019s chief executive Bob Dudley says the current situation in the oil market reminds him of the 1986 crisis, where oversupply led to a collapse in prices, reports Reuters. Speaking in Davos, Dudley said he expected further pressure on prices this year as Iran ramped up exports: The first and second quarter will be very difficult....It is a big shock for producing countries. It reminds me of 1986. Prices will remain low for longer but not forever. He said markets would begin to rebalance later in 2016 as the glut of oil reduces and investment falls. Brent crude is currently down 0.4% at $27.76 a barrel. Manuel Valls has also told reporters here that he doesn\u2019t think David Cameron will agree a renegotiation deal next month: French PM Manual Valls says it would be a \u201ctragedy for Europe\u201d if the UK quit the Union. He tells Davos that David Cameron is making some good points, and that a more simple and effective Europe would be good for everyone. We must find a compromise, and everyone must contribute to it. Our British friends must understand we will move forwards hand in hand, together, Valls continues. And he warns that the sight of Britain going it alone, at a time when countries need to work more closely to tackle the world\u2019s problems, would be disastrous: Nothing would be worse than to see a country like UK leave, it would lead to more populism. Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte has told Davos that Europe \u201cneeds\u201d the United Kingdom to stay within the European Union. He also called on business and community leaders at Davos to campaign for the In side in the upcoming referendum, echoing David Cameron\u2019s speech this afternoon. Rutte says: The UK is outward looking , trade oriented, growth oriented, and we do not have enough of that storyline, that tradition, that culture within the European Union. The European Union can only survive if it is relevant to its people, and it can only be relevant if it leads to economic growth, more jobs and prosperity. It is also crucial for the UK to not lose its place in Europe: I believe the United Kingdom will be worse off outside the EU. It will not have the influence it has in the world today.... Isn\u2019t it strange to even debate a Brexit at a time the world is facing all these huge issues and challenges? Rutte goes on to call Cameron \u201cinfluential\u201d and an \u201cexcellent prime minister\u201d. We would all be worse off if he left, so all 28 countries must work together to create an EU that is more competitive, more outwardd-looking, more growth-oriented. If we could achieve that, the whole episide will have a positive ending Are you optimistic about the upcoming summit? Rutte says he is fairly optimistic that leaders could get to an postiive outcome in February, but not certain. He\u2019s also fairly optimistic about the referendum, and urges Davos attendees to speak out. I hope that all of you, business leaders, community leaders, with influence in the United Kingdom will participate. Don\u2019t leave it all to the politicians. You should not preach, as that will never work, but to explain to the British public why it is important in your view for the UK to be part of the European Union. Music to David Cameron\u2019s ears, I expect, as he tours Davos today. Asked about the IMF\u2019s role in the Greek bailout, Sch\u00e4uble appears to admit that he was over-ruled by chancellor Merkel: And the German parliament approved the 3rd bailout on those terms: Sch\u00e4uble responds to Tsipras, saying he does agree that Europe should help countries who need it. But Europe also need to be competitive. Germany has its own problems, including demographic (its ageing population). If we want to make Europe stronger, then we should implement what we agreed to implement. We could just say implementation, stupid. Back to Alexis Tsipras. He says Greece has made great efforts to reform its economy in recent years, through an unprecedented downturn. We lost 25% of our GDP, and unemployment skyrocketed, says the Greek PM. Tsipras then inplicitly criticises Europe\u2019s approach to Greece, saying: Greece needs considerable structural reforms. We must all understand that next to balanced budget, we also have to have growth. Greece needs to tackle corruption, boost investment, and help the state to rebuild itself. And he demands more solidarity, saying: We need a co-ordinated growth strategy, and Europe must help to diminish the inequalities between North and South. We need more Europe, and show more solidarity as well. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble refuses to say whether Germany can cope with another million refugees this year. And he says Europe must spend billions on the areas where refugees are fleeing. He agrees with Alexis Tsipras that Europe cannot become a fortress This problem will cost the European public more than expected, But it cannot be ignored. Sch\u00e4uble says, if Europe is to guarantee its security. It is a problem of and for Europe. Everything that goes wrong with these regions won\u2019t end up in Canada, it will end up in Europe. Alexis Tsipras says all European countries must share the burden of the refugee crisis. Europe must create a two-way system for migration, so people can be returned home. He also calls for much more co-operations between countries; Greece simply cannot cope alone. Next question, on migration, goes to Dutch PM Mark Rutte. Can the Schengen Agreement survive the refugee crisis? Rutte says that 35,000 people have already arrived on the shores of Europe this year. When spring comes, and the numbers quadruple, we cannot as a European Union cannot cope with the numbers any longer. This is the immediate agenda for the next few months. And the priorities include: Success of EU-Turkish union Successful hotspots in Greece and Turkey and Italy Schengen is crucial, Rutte continues. But we also have the Dublin agreement, and it isn\u2019t working. Before we kill Schengen, we have to make Dublin work.... No-one wants to kill Schengen, but if it is only a fair-weather system then it cannot survive. Manuel Valls, France\u2019s prime minister, kicks off the European session by saying security and terrorism are one of the biggest challenges faced by the continent. We are at war against terrorism. A world war. And we as Europeans need to face up to this. And European must work together to fight it, pooling resources, and also sharing more information - including a common programme of oversight of flights and airports. So could EU forces be deployed to hot spots in the Middle East? We need more Europe, not less, says Valls, as he thanks everyone who offered help and support to France after the Paris terror attacks. The Middle East is just two hours from Europe - we cannot ignore what is going on there. We must move away from this selfishness, and find the means to deal with this historic challenge. Hundreds of people are pouring into the Davos Congress Hall for the main set-piece event of the morning - the Future of Europe session. It will pit Greece\u2019s Alexis Tsipras against Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Schauble, with France\u2019s Manual Valls, the Netherland\u2019s Mark Rutte, and Eni chairman Emma Marcegaglia. You can watch it live, here: Perhaps we spoke too soon. The attempted rally in Europe seems to be petering out, with the FTSE down around 8 points and Germany\u2019s Dax off 24 points. Dow futures are also falling, now indicating a 130 point decline at the opening bell. David Morrison at Spread Co said: Equities are on the slide again as crude oil continues its relentless decline. Both WTI and Brent are trading below $28 for the usual supply/demand reasons. However, there are also concerns as speculation mounts over the possibility that Saudi Arabia may unpeg the riyal from the US dollar. The strength of the greenback combined with the low oil price is a serious drain on the Kingdom\u2019s reserves and breaking the peg would be one way of easing the pain. Looks like another topsy-turvey day. Here\u2019s our report on today\u2019s session on the Chinese economy: A senior Chinese official has defended the country\u2019s economic policies and urged investors to stop fixation on fluctuations in its stock market. Fang Xinghai, Office of the central leading group for financial and economic affairs, told the World Economic Forum that while the stock market was down 40% from its peak it was up 30% over 18 months, He also insisted that there was no basis on which to devalue the currency and said the country was commitment to moving to shadowing a basket of currencies. He declared: \u201cChina\u2019s record of honouring itss commitment is superb\u201d. He is speaking against a backdrop of countries concerned about the Chinese economy, its currency - which was devalued during the summer - and the volatility in its stock market. Gary Cohn, chief operating officer of Goldman, said most market participants believed China would devalue its currency this year. He joined Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, in calling for better communication over its polices. Lagarde said: Given the massive transitions in China, there is a communication issue - this is something that markets do not like. Uncertainty, not knowing exactly what the policy is. Not knowing exactly what the renmimni is valued against - the dollar, or a basket of currencies. Better and more communication\u201d would serve the country better, she said. Gary Cohn, chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs, agreed with Lagarde and urged the Chinese to stick its polices once they have been communicated. Fang Xinghai has also told Davos that there is need for more co-operation with global policymakers around the world,\u201dWe have to cooperate more closely to overcome this soft patch,\u201d Fang said. Taken to task by Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associations about what this co-operation meant, Fang said it meant in all areas. More on the ECB ahead of today\u2019s meeting: Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, has weighed in on the Brexit question, arguing Britain should stay in Europe: Italy\u2019s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, is reported to have pulled out of Davos to deal with the problems in the Italian banking sector: Yesterday, there were reports that customers were pulling funds out of the Monti Paschi bank, on concerns over its bad debts. European markets are holding onto their early gains, while US futures are suggesting a dip of around 45 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average when Wall Street opens. David Morrison at trading company Spread Co said: The reaction to the overnight Asian Pacific slump from European equities and US stock index futures has been surprisingly muted. At the time of writing, all the major indices are in positive territory. On the face of it this is quite encouraging, particularly as crude is still trading near its 2003 lows. But once again, what looks like the beginning of a recovery in equities could easily turn out to be nothing more than a \u201cdead-cat bounce.\u201d There\u2019s no doubt there have been signs of stress in global equities for a while now. As far as the US is concerned, in the latter half of 2015 the FANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google (Alphabet)) were responsible for holding up the major indices as the broader market declined. Technically, the major indices formed a topping pattern as they failed to make fresh highs after the China-inspired summer sell-off. Stress in the high yield bond market was becoming apparent even before the Fed hiked rates. That hike now looks as if it will go down as one of the worst-timed rate rises in history, even crowning the ECB\u2019s classic efforts in 2011. To top it all, China suffered a second melt-down just as we began the New Year. The Dutch finance minister, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, has admitted that Europe blundered by not dealing with its banks faster. A group of demonstrators have been spotted in Davos. They\u2019re protesting against China\u2019s activities in the Pakistani territory of Balochistan, where Beijing is developing a large new economic zone. Rough translation: Protests in Davos are not so large now. And that\u2019s because of the huge security presence in this ski resort, which clamps down on any signs of dissent. Top Chinese official Fang Xinghai has hit back at Christine Lagarde\u2019s complaint about communications failings (see earlier post) Fang is the vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, and a senio advisor to the premier Li Keqiang. With markets in turmoil, oil sliding to new lows, concerns about Chinese growth and worries about whether central bankers have run out of ammunition to support the global economy, the president of the European Central Bank will be on the spot later to spell out where he thinks we go from here. Mario Draghi will unveil the ECB\u2019s latest measures - more QE? Perhaps not yet - in a statement and press conference in Frankfurt. After last month, when the measures announced proved a disappointment, and the more hawkish elements on the ECB clearly prevented the bank from doing more, Draghi\u2019s comments will be widely watched. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Today\u2019s focus is likely to shine on the first ECB rate meeting of 2016, against a continuing backdrop of weak inflation in the euro area. With last month\u2019s December disappointment still fresh in the memory ECB President Mario Draghi will have to convince the markets that the ECB has a plan, and the ammunition to cope with the further slide in inflationary pressures that are likely to ripple across Europe in the coming weeks. It is clear that the hawks won out last month preventing the ECB from acting in a much stronger fashion, and in the process giving the ECB President a bloody nose, after he had indicated the prospect of much stronger action. How Mr Draghi navigates these divisions will be particularly pertinent given how they were revealed in the most recent minutes, especially given that the next projections in March are likely to see inflation expectations guided lower. This is because since last month\u2019s December meeting oil prices have slid another 35%, which means that while the ECB President might come across as dovish later today, after last month\u2019s disappointment markets may not necessarily take him at his word. Economists at Unicredit said: ECB president Mario Draghi will likely sound dovish today, but we expect him to strike a reasonable balance. Mr. Draghi will be careful to avoid fuelling too much speculation about further action to avoid a repetition of the December experience, when the announcement of QE2 fell short of high expectations. At the time, the market\u2019s disappointed reaction resulted in a 3% rally in euro-dollar exchange rate. Today, we do not expect the meeting to cause any major move in exchange rates, as the market seems prepared for a relatively balanced debate. The euro has held up well since the 3 December meeting, and it would take a strong (unexpected) dovish signal of imminent action to change this pattern. Mic Mills at Capital Index said: All eyes today will be on the ECB with the interest rate decision at 12:45 [GMT] followed by Draghi giving the post meeting press conference at 13:30, which after last month will need to persuade the markets that there is more in the cupboard, as there seems to be no respite in sight when it comes to deflationary pressure. FXTM analyst Lukman Otunuga said: For an extended period falling commodity prices have left the Eurozone engaged in an ongoing one-sided battle against stubbornly low inflation levels, while stalling domestic economic growth continues to test the European Central Bank\u2019s credibility. It is widely expected that the ECB will remain on standby today and keep rates unchanged, but Mario Draghi may reiterate his dovish mantra and threaten further QE in an attempt to talk down the value of the Euro. At an HSBC breakfast on climate change, the bank\u2019s chief executive Stuart Gulliver has said the current state of the financial markets is not exactly conducive to raising private funds to tackle global warming. \u201cThe markets are showing signs of quite significant distress and it is not a high priority for fund managers to set up a green fund\u201d, Gulliver says. He also says that the crash in oil prices may have the \u201cunintended consequence\u201d of deterring investment in alternative energy sources because the R&amp;D costs will be considered too high. Gulliver says that following the Paris climate change conference governments and the private sector had to raise $5tn a year over the next two decades. \u201cIt is a vast financing challenge\u201d, he says. Despite the falls in Asia, European markets have made a positive start, if not a totally convincing one. The FTSE 100 is up 31 points or 0.5%, while France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.1%, Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is 0.5% better and Spain\u2019s Ibex has added 0.5%. Germany\u2019s Dax, despite Deutsche Bank saying it expected to report a record loss of \u20ac6.7bn for 2015, is ahead by 0.2%. IMF chief Christine Lagarde has warned that Beijing needs to improve the way it communicates with the markets. Currently, investors are being spooked as they watch China embark on a huge economic rebalancing. She tells today\u2019s discussion on China that: Given the massive transitions in China, there is a communication issue - this is something that markets do not like. Uncertainty, not knowing exactly what the policy is. Not knowing exactly what the renmimni is valued against - the dollar, or a basket of currencies. China\u2019s rebalancing is \u201cperfectly manageable\u201d if the right policies are taken, she adds. Ji\u0101ng Ji\u00e0nq\u012bng, the Chairman of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, has argued that China can\u2019t be blamed for the stock market turmoil. Speaking on a panel in China\u2019s economy, Ji\u00e0nq\u012bng said a range of factors are being it. He cites the slow pace of recovery in the world economy, meaning growth is flat. The US interest rate hike, and economic policies in the EU have also created volatility. And commodity prices are under pressure. So the world all over is facing volatility. Some reasons are normal, some are abnormal. There is a certain degree of panic in the market. Policymakers must implement structural reforms to lead the world economy out of this period of low growth, and regulators should work together to reduce volatility. European markets are expected to make an uncertain start after Wednesday\u2019s rout, which saw the FTSE 100 head into bear market territory. A recovery on the Dow Jones Industrial Average from its worst levels \u2013 albeit still showing a 249 point fall \u2013 may give some support, although Asian markets lost their early gains to head into the red again. Here are the opening calls in Europe: Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Now that equity markets, both here in Europe and in the US have slipped into bear market territory the big question now is where do we go to next. That looks highly likely to depend on oil prices and a late rebound off the lows yesterday did see US markets recoup a large portion of their losses, the Dow was 566 points down at one stage, but they still finished the day below their previous lows in August. This late rebound should be enough to see European markets open higher this morning, a welcome respite after yesterday\u2019s sell-off, but it is going to need a significant turnaround in sentiment to recoup the losses seen so far this week, and prevent markets from posting their third successive weekly decline. Oil in fact is slipping back again, with Brent crude down 1% at $27.58 a barrel. David Cameron is to call on the UK\u2019s business chiefs to support him in the upcoming EU referendum to secure Britain\u2019s place in a reformed EU. The prime minister is using his trip to Davos to drum up support, ahead of a potentially decisive EU summit in February where he could secure concessions from fellow European leaders. The PM is expected to say that: \u201cThis is a once-in-a-generation moment and the stakes are high.\u201d Cameron\u2019s message to business chiefs is that if they want Britain to remain in the EU with less red tape and a more complete single market, they need to come out and back the In Campaign. He\u2019ll say: If you want a more competitive Europe, where the single market is completed, where there are more trade deals and fewer regulations: join me in making that case. \u201cIf you believe, like I do, that Britain is better off in a reformed European Union, then, when the time comes, help me make that case for Britain to stay.\u201d Business leaders in Davos have been very unwilling to talk on the record about the Brexit issue, while many international delegates have sounded more worried about the prospect of Britain leaving the EU. So Cameron will certainly be in demand today, as he holds a series of \u2018bilateral\u2019 meetings. Good morning from Davos, where the second day of the World Economic Forum is getting underway. Yesterday\u2019s stock market plunges have sent a shiver through this little ski resort, as the \u201cglobal elite\u201d gather to debate the major issues of the moment. And world leaders and business chiefs will be monitoring events in the markets closely again, following a wild day\u2019s trading in Asia overnight. Today\u2019s session will be dominated by Europe, with prime minister David Cameron giving a big set-piece speech in the afternoon. Cameron is also due to meet with Argentina\u2019s new president, Mauricio Macri, in what could be a thawing of relations between the two countries. Greece is also in focus today, as prime minister Alexis Tsipras tries to lobby creditor nations to cut Athens some slack on austerity and debt relief. He\u2019s expected to meet with Christine Lagarde during the day. And there\u2019s also a big focus on geopolitics, with the migration crisis and the turmoil in the Middle East. Some sessions which we\u2019ll try to cover include: 8.45am CET (7.45am GMT): Where is the Chinese economy headed? Including IMF chief Christine Lagarde 10.15am CET A debate on the future of Europe, including French PM Manuel Valls, Greek PM Alexis Tsipras, Dutch PM Mark Rutte and German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble 12.30pm CET: Treasury secretary Jack Lew discusses \u201cglobal financial priorities in 2016.\u201d 2pm CET: David Cameron on Britain\u2019s place in the world 3pm: How to educate Syria\u2019s displaced children",

Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A sharp rebound in crude oil as well as some warm words from ECB President Mario Draghi turned out to be the perfect ingredients to prompt a sharp snapback in equity markets yesterday after Wednesday\u2019s rout, and this rebound has spilled over into the Asia session with crude oil recovering above the $30 level. The big question now is whether this marks a medium term base, or just a minor relief rally before another leg lower. Given yesterday\u2019s rebound and the subsequent positive session in Asia there now remains the very real possibility that we could well finish the week in positive territory, and if that happens it would be a remarkable turnaround after Wednesday\u2019s carnage.</p> </blockquote> <p>The opening calls for Europe from IG show an upbeat start:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/statuses/690421720482762752\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Our European opening calls:&#10;&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTSE&amp;src=ctag\">$FTSE</a> 5821 up 47&#10;$DAX\u00a09671 up 97&#10;$CAC\u00a04246 up 39&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24IBEX&amp;src=ctag\">$IBEX</a> 8515 up 71&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MIB&amp;src=ctag\">$MIB</a> 18887 up 164</p>&mdash; IGSquawk (@IGSquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/status/690421720482762752\">January 22, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-01-22T07:45:46.390Z\">at 7.45am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-56a1d156e4b0de2cb0bfba25\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/graemewearden\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-22T07:23:28.684Z\">7.23am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Davos 2016: Draghi, Kerry, Macri to speak</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Good morning from Davos, where the third day of the World Economic Forum is getting underway.</strong></p> <p>There\u2019s a big focus on geopolitics today, with US secretary of state John Kerry giving a big keynote address.</p> <p>The migration crisis is also in focus, as Europe braces for another inflow of refugees from the turmoil in the Middle East.</p> <p>Overnight, France\u2019s prime minister, Manuel Valls, has warned that the crisis is destabilising Europe.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/22/french-pm-manuel-valls-says-refugee-crisis-is-destabilising-europe\">French PM Manuel Valls says refugee crisis is 'destabilising' Europe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But there\u2019s no escape from economic worries - European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi is due to address Davos shortly.</p> <p>Investors around the world will be watching closely; yesterday, Draghi hinted that the ECB could take fresh action in March.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Brenda_Kelly/statuses/690433101676335104\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">SuperMario due to speak at the World Economic Forum, in Davos at 7.45am</p>&mdash; Brenda Kelly (@Brenda_Kelly) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Brenda_Kelly/status/690433101676335104\">January 22, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, UK prime minister David Cameron and chancellor George Osborne will be going round Davos, trying to stir British businesses into supporting them in the EU referendum.</p> <p>And Argentina\u2019s president, Mauricio Macri, is in town.

                "bodyText":"This liveblog is creaking under the weight of another day of Davos, so here\u2019s a round-up of the main events. On Migration.... ECB chief Mario Draghi has said the refugee crisis can be good for the European economy, as long as there is determination and confidence. Secretary of State John Kerry has called for a 30% boost in aid spending, and insisted that countries can resettle refugees without endangering national security. David Miliband of International Rescue has said it\u2019s vital to distinguish between refugees and economic migrants, to stop the whole system collapsing On UK matters... Chancellor George Osborne has said Britain will not panic over the turbulence in the markets. Osborne also predicted that the Brexit debate will \u201cget interesting\u201d once voters learn the different options on the table. On gender equality Canadian PM Justin Trudeau has urged delegates not to be afraid to call themselves feminists. While Facebook\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg has warned that gender bias starts in the home, when children get their first pocket money for helping out. On the global economy.... Harvard professor Ken Rogoff said 2016 will be a rough year for emerging markets The head of the WTO has told us he\u2019s optimistic about making progress on trade liberalisation. Christine Lagarde has thrown her hat into the ring to remain as IMF chief for a second term. And in the markets.... Stocks have surged back, on hopes that policymakers will deliver more stimulus if needed to keep the world economy on track. And that may well be all for tonight..... If so, we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Guet Nacht! GW Global stock markets have bounced back at the end of a tumultuous week, as oil prices recovered and the European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, raised hopes of morefurther stimulus measures. It was a week that saw panic selling in global markets, pushing several of them, including London and Japan, into bear market territory, as oil prices tumbled to fresh 13-year lows below $28 a barrel. On Friday, however, European markets rebounded, following a heavy hint from Draghi that the ECB was ready to inject fresh stimulus into the eurozone at the March meeting \u2013 sooner than many investors expected. Here is how things look at Friday\u2019s close: The FTSE 100 index in London has rallied 2.2%, or 126 points, to 5900.01. It is still down 5.5% since the start of 2016. Germany\u2019s Dax is up 2.3%, France\u2019s CAC added 3.3% and Spain\u2019s Ibex added 3.5%. Brent crude is up 7.6%, or $2.24, at $31.48 per barrel. It started the year at $37.85. On Wall Street, stock markets have followed their European counterparts higher. The Dow Jones industrial average is up 0.8% at 16,005 and the S&amp;P 500 is up 1.4% at 1,895. Draghi\u2019s hints had kicked off a \u201cfull-on relief rally\u201d said Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets. He adds: \u201cGlobal stocks rebounded strongly on Friday, capping a massive two-day about turn that erased sharp declines early in the week. The rally was aided by a surging oil price and talk of stimulus from both the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan. The FTSE 100 has seen its first weekly gain this year. The gain is all the more impressive after Britain\u2019s main stock index fell into bear market territory with a 20% decline to the lowest levels since 2012 on Wednesday.\u201d Canadian PM Justin Trudeau is living up to his reputation as a 21st century leader (complete with a gender-balanced cabinet). Trudeau tells Davos that: \u201cLet\u2019s start rewarding politicians and companies who aren\u2019t driven by a macho approach.\u201d He also says feminism isn\u2019t anything to be afraid of: Melinda Gates has told the panel session that she always made sure there were science projects for her husband Bill to do with the children on Saturdays. Their two daughters have ended up interested in maths and science. Chinese businesswomen Zhang Xin, who set up property company SOHO with her husband, says she in favour of quotas to address gender balance. She tells Davos: \u201cI think quotas are an effective way of breaking old habits and bias.\u201d Sheryl Sandberg is less convinced, pointing out that Norway introduced 40% quotes for boardrooms but only 3.4% of companies are run by women. \u201cIt\u2019s not trickling down,\u201d she said. There\u2019s a toddler wage gap in the US, and different expectations between boys and girls, Sheryl Sandberg declares. Gender inequality starts that early, she believes, because: Little boys in home do fewer chores at home and get paid more. We assign our chores to our children in the United States so that the boys are taking out the trash, it takes less time than cleaning the dishes and they get higher allowances. So we start out with different expectations in our home, and the time spent on these different tasks is incredibly important, she adds. Melinda Gates says companies need to have proper family leave policies, not just maternity leave policies. Paternity leave is a way of distributing the burden, as men who take it will spend more time at home helping with the children and the household tasks. America is particularly poor, she adds - just two states have proper family leave policies. Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook started the session on gender parity with the same polling method that she started a session earlier in the week, asking women if they had been asked whether they should be working and if had been described as being too aggressive at work. She said that women were expected to nurturing roles in the office. The irony of the boss of recruitment agency Manpower being on the panel has not be lost on the BBC reporter Lyse Doucet who has tried to convince Jonas Prising to change the name. He appears to have rejected the idea - a brand in 80 countries for 70 years, he says. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s COO, says that the big problem with gender parity is the expectations of what is appropriate for woman. Culturally we are so different around the world, but there\u2019s a really deep cultural similarity, says Sandberg, namely: Men are expected to lead, to provide, to be decision makers. And women are expected to nurture. So women end up doing the \u2018housework\u2019 in the office, and almost all of the housework at home. And we also have an expectations that women won\u2019t lead, says Sandberg. She asks the men in the audience to put their hands up if they\u2019ve ever been told they\u2019ve been too aggressive at work. A couple of hands rise. Now for the women, put your hands up if you\u2019ve ever been told you were too aggressive at work.... and a lot of hands go up: Sandberg then asks \u201cMen, have you been asked whether you should be working?\u201d I can\u2019t see many hands at all. Now the women.... Again, plenty of hands go up. That\u2019s the issue, Sandberg concludes. A debate on gender equality is kicking off in the Congress Hall now, including Melinda Gates, Facebook\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg, and Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau. You can watch it here. Jonas Prising of Manpower Group is also on the panel - the moderator jokes that he\u2019s only allowed if he promises to change the name to Humanpower Group. Melinda Gates speaks first, saying she\u2019s encouraged that women and girls are at the heart of the new sustainable development goals. We\u2019ve all come to recognise that, if you want this increase in equity, if you want this increase in GDP, you\u2019ve got to get the other half working. And politicians are learning that you need to ensure your women and girls have health, and have education. More from the UK chancellor: US manufacturing has performed more strongly than expected at the start of 2016. The Markit manufacturing PMI for January rose from 51.2 in December to 52.7 in January, better than the dip to 51.1 which had been expected. The global rally prompted by hopes of further stimulus from the European Central Bank, as well as a surge in the oil price, is continuing in the US. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has started the last day of a tumultuous week with a rise of 180 points or 1.1%. Like other markets it is now in positive territory since Monday. The S&amp;P 500 is up 1% and Nasdaq has opened 1.8% higher. Meanwhile Brent crude is now up 8% at $31.6 a barrel, helped by comments from Saudi Arabia that $30 oil is irrational and a rebound is likely, as well as the current cold spell boosting demand. In Europe the FTSE 100 is up 2%, Germany\u2019s Dax is 2.2% better and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 3.4%. Christine Lagarde has just spoken to the press, confirming that she will run for a second term as managing director of the International Monetary Fund. In a brief statement, the IMF MD says she has pushed through \u201cquite a few initiatives\u201d and \u201cmoved the institution on, together with a fantastic team of staff\u201d. And I\u2019m prepared to serve the membership longer. So I\u2019m full of energy and enthusiasm to do so. Lagarde first told French TV this morning that she would run again, having been nominated by several finance ministers including the UK\u2019s George Osborne. George Osborne says that the referendum debate in Britain will get \u201cinteresting\u201d when voters learn what the alternatives are. Answering a question after his speech in Davos on what contingency plans the Government has for Brexit, the chancellor said the civil service, the foreign office and the Treasury were currently \u201c100% focused\u201d on the negotiations.\u201d When it comes to the debate the Government will be required publish alternatives to membership of the EU and what arrangements we will have with our neighbours\u201d, Osborne says. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be one of the most interesting aspects of the referendum debate\u201d. Osborne did not spell out the choices, but they include the Norwegian, Swiss and WTO options. The Norwegian and Swiss options provide access to the European single market on payment of a fee but without any say in how the rules are made. The WTO option means Britain would get the same access to the EU market as any other country that was party to global free trade deals. The chancellor played a straight bat when asked about Brexit, saying it was important the talks succeeded and that Britain had the right sort of relationship. He placed special emphasis on how the UK would co-exist with a eurozone that was going to become more integrated due to necessity. But he seemed to be suggesting that the staying in camp would get a boost when the alternatives are laid out. The Telegraph\u2019s James Quinn helpfully tweeted some key points from the lunch too: Elsewhere in Davos, the new Canadian prime minister has been chatting to the boss of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. We hear that it might have been a lunch of economic policy leaders - with the Archbishop of Canterbury thrown in for good measure. Anyway, Christine Lagarde and entourage just breezed past at speed, and Bono came the other way, warbling happily (I don\u2019t think *he* was in this lunch). So normal service is restored. Mark Carney has now emerged from this lunchtime meeting, and we believe that George Osborne may have nipped into. We don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything particularly unusual about this gathering - probably just a chance for all the key players to catch up. It appears that some of the heavy hitters in Davos have held a lunchtime meeting. A few have just left, including Kofi Annan, Ukranian president Poroshenko, Former US vice-president Al Gore, OECD chief Angel Gurria, and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby. Japan\u2019s central bank chief, Haruhiko Kurodo, also emerged. A big crowd has gathered, to see who is next. After a weary time at Davos, UK reporters are resting their legs, tucking into a good lunch, and listening to George Osborne talk to business leaders (the things we go through for you.....) It\u2019s a typically business-friendly speech from the chancellor; he\u2019s telling CEOs that his door is always open to them. He\u2019s also sounding relaxed about the turmoil in the markets, saying that Britain won\u2019t panic because China has hit a few bumps in the road. The two countries are partners for the long term. There\u2019s a few curious quotes too: Former UK prime minister Tony Blair is also in Davos (you\u2019ll be unsurprised to hear), and has spoken about the UK\u2019s upcoming EU referendum. Blair doesn\u2019t think Brexit would be sensible - again, not a shock given the man once rather fancied being president of Europe. The big issue is how we compete with emerging markets like India and China, rather than quitting the largest commercial market and biggest political union in the world. In the end, Blair thinks, and hopes, David Cameron will get a \u201cperfectly good deal from Europe\u201d. But he also predicts that there will be \u201cmore and more uncertainty\u201d as the vote nears. A quick look at the markets, which are continuing their rebound. The FTSE 100 is now up 135 points or 2.3%, Germany\u2019s Dax has added 197 points or 2% and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 132 points or 3%. All three indices are in positive territory for what has been a tumultuous week. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is expected to open around 190 points higher. Oil is also rising again, buoyed by comments from Saudi Arabia that prices could rebound later this year and also by the recent cold snap which is expected to have lifted demand. Brent crude is now up nearly 6% at $30.95 a barrel. Secretary of state John Kerry turns to the refugee crisis, saying President Obama will host a summit at the UN this autumn to rally the world community. The aim is to: Increase by 30% the response to humanitarian funding appeals, Increase the number of humanitarian donors. To a least double the number of refugees resettled or given other safe channels. Expand by 10 the number of countries taking refugees Get a million children into school and a million people working legally. The private sector, civil society, religious groups will be called on to integrate refugees and give them access to employment. And Kerry insists that this isn\u2019t a security threat, saying: I know we can do it in a way that protects the security of our countries. That sounds like a rebuttal to Donald Trump\u2019s promise to impose a ban on Muslims from entering the US, if he become president, which caused such outrage. Last year, people were claiming that Ebola would claim a million lives by last Christmas, Kerry continues. But with international co-operation, including US soldiers sent in by President Obama, the outbreak was stemmed (it killed around 11,000 people). The US and Cuba still have differences, but we are much closer and able to discuss how to close then and \u201cmarch down his road\u201d, says Kerry. John Kerry\u2019s relentlessly upbeat message to Davos is not to give up, there is a lot of positivity in the world too. Between 1990 and 2015 - child mortality has halved. Life expectancy has increased dramatically. The number in extreme poverty has more than halved. And progress is being made on getting more girls into education. The nuclear deal with Iran is also vital, Kerry says, bringing the world back from the brink of war. We were on the cusp of confrontation. I can\u2019t tell you how many leaders, as I travelled through certain areas, told me \u2018you\u2019ve got to bomb it\u2019. Every one of Iran\u2019s pathway to a bomb is now blocked, due to the 98% cut in its uranium stocks and reductions in its ability to refine then. US secretary of state John Kerry is giving his keynote address to Davos. He reminds delegates of the terrible scenes of 2015, from the tiny boy found drowned on a Turkish beach to the Jordanian pilot burned alive by ISIS. I can\u2019t think of a time in my life when I have seen so much atrocity live, thrown at us so relentlessly. Some people wonder if we are trapped in an irreversible decline, a new normal. And if that were true, no politician could fight it. I do not believe that is where we find ourselves. We are not the victims of a pre-destined future, Kerry continues. We feel frustration, because we want to change it. People don\u2019t fly to Davos to celebrate the status quo. You\u2019ve come here to change the world for the better, and define the future. Away from Davos for a moment. Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann, a notable hawk on the European Central Bank\u2019s governing council, is thought to be one of the committee members who helped temper the bank\u2019s stimulus programme in December. The meeting disappointed markets by taking less action than analysts had expected. On Thursday ECB president Mario Draghi hinted at further measures at the bank\u2019s meeting in March, and played down suggestions of splits on the council. And there may be a sign that his dovish words could be followed through: The only time Syrian refugees smile, if you meet them in Jordon or Lebanon or Greece, is when you ask them if they\u2019ll ever go home, David Miliband continues. They say \u2018Inshallah\u2019, God Willing. I want to go home. And they\u2019re not fleeing for economic reasons, they\u2019re fleeing out of utter desperation that if Assad\u2019s barrel bombs don\u2019t get them, and ISIS don\u2019t get them, the Russians will get them. If we fail to see this as problem of monumental political failure inside Syria, we\u2019ll never get to the source of it. Miliband also hits back at suggestions that Europe could tighten its borders to stem the flow from the Middle East. \u201cLet\u2019s get real about this\u201d, the International Rescue chief says (channelling his old boss, Tony Blair?) If any of us were in Syria, or in Lebanon where the average monthly paymen for refugee is $13 per month, we would be trying to get into Europe And equally, all our experiences around the world shows that the higher you build the wall, the more you empower the smugglers. Desperate people will always get around walls - the solution must be to fix the problems in their homeland. Europe is playing catch-up, says David Miliband. The Syria war started in 2011. And you\u2019ve got to act at the source and in Europe, with a proper relocation process. Germany is showing leadership here, with its promise to screen asylum seekers. And this might sound surprising from the head of a refugee agency, Miliband adds, but: It\u2019s right not just that people are screened, but it\u2019s also right that those who don\u2019t qualify for refugee status shouldn\u2019t stay. It\u2019s absolutely vital to the integrity of the system that the distinction between a refugee, which is someone fleeing persecution, and someone on the other hand who is simply an economic immigrant, needs to be maintained. In the US, where Miliband\u2019s International Rescue charity is based, it has the geographical ability to set up a screening pipeline, and work with the UN to bring people over from the Middle East. Relocation is part of the answer in Europe, but not the whole answer, he concludes. Federica Mogherini, high representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, is arguing that Europe has now woken up to the migration crisis, after a slow start. I don\u2019t see it as a failure that we finally have less people dying at sea. In 2013, I saw the hundreds of people dying at sea in 2013, and not even one summit. Now, we have realised it is a European problem. Yes it took too long, but finally we are doing somthing Is Europe failing on migration? Federino Mogherini argues that Europe can\u2019t afford to fail. In 2015, we learned that European Union is not luxury -- not just the Erasmus student project, a single currency, free movement to go on holiday within European. Finally, the leaders and citizens of Europe have realised that without European union we would not be able to face these challenges of migration and security. So the debate moderator, Lyse Doucet, reads out a readers\u2019 comment that EU leaders are failing and need to stop unlimited entry into Europr. Who in the audience thinks Europe is taking too long to react to this crisis, Doucet asks? There\u2019s a big show of hands. The next session, on the future of Europe, is getting underway shortly. You can watch it here. Miliband (D), Macron, and Mogherini are all on the panel, discussing migration and terrorism. It sounds like today\u2019s session on the Russian economy was quite tasty, with former finance minister Alexey Kudrin clashing with deputy PM Yury Trutnev. We\u2019ll dig the quotes out shortly. In the meantime: Roberto Azev\u00eado, the director general of the World Trade Organisation is in Davos seeking to push forward with trade liberalisation in 2016. He will host a small gathering of trade ministers tomorrow but thinks the mood is positive.\u201d I have never seen talks on trade so exciting. I have never heard the words \u201cWTO\u201d and \u201curgency\u201d in the same sentence\u201d, Azev\u00eado says. That\u2019s perhaps hardly surprising given that the WTO spent the period from November 2001 until last December fruitlessly trying to conclude the Doha round - a comprehensive package that included agriculture, services, manufactured goods, the rules of trade and special help for the poorest countries. Azev\u00eado says the WTO has had to become more flexible, seeking a multilateral deal amongst all its 160-plus members but willing to negotiate coalitions of the willing when unanimity proves impossible. \u201cThe system can work. It is working. We have learned how to live with the different views and the very strong disagreements among our members.\u201d Future areas for talks include e-commerce, investment, digital trade and data flows, Azev\u00eado says. Here\u2019s the Treasury on the UK borrowing figures: Today\u2019s figures show that borrowing is down compared to last year, as a number of one-off factors that have affected the data in recent months have unwound. But there is more to do. At a time when we face a dangerous cocktail of risks from the global economy we must continue to work through our plan to deliver a surplus and provide economic security for working people. And here\u2019s the Office for National Statistics on the disappointing retail sales numbers: Promotions during the 2015 Christmas period were more spread out compared with 2014, with retailers offering discounts over a longer period of time rather than a one day event. Clothing and footwear stores struggled in December due to the milder weather. Meanwhile Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: UK retail sales figures for December always had the potential to be a banana skin for Chancellor George Osborne, and he will be disappointed to see sales slide at such a critical time for the sector. The government would have hoped to see high streets up and down the country flooded with shoppers in the run up to the festive period in a bid to boost the economy, but today\u2019s figures tell a markedly different story. All eyes will now be on the UK\u2019s GDP reading next week to see how much poor retail sales figures have affected the bigger picture. UK public borrowing - excluding state controlled banks - dropped to \u00a37.4bn in December from \u00a311.7bn in December 2014. But chancellor George Osborne - who is warning at Davos of a \u201chazardous mix\u201d of risks to the global economy - will still need a big surplus in next month if he is to reach his full year target of \u00a368.9bn as laid out in the Autumn Statement. Retail sales in the UK came in weaker than expected during the crucial Christmas period. Sales volumes fell 1% in December compared to a 1.3% rise in November - itself revised down from an initial 1.7% increase - and below analysts forecasts of a 0.5% decline. That leaves them up 2.6% year on year, again below expectations of a 3.5% rise. These were the weakest figures since September 2014. UK retail spending fell 1% in December year on year compared to a 0.9% rise in November, the biggest decline since May 2009. The eurozone economy got off to a weaker than expected start to the year, according to the latest data. The Markit composite Purchasing Managers Index - which measures services and manufacturing - fell from 54.3 in December to 53.5 in January in the initial estimates. This was the weakest growth for almost a year, and follows ECB president Mario Draghi\u2019s cautious comments on the effect of the recent oil price slump and market turbulence. Price cutting and a weak euro failed to boost demand, said Markit. But its chief economist Chris Williamson, said it would be wrong to get too worried: The cooling in the pace of growth in euro area business activity at the start of 2016 is a disappointment but not surprising given the uncertainty caused by the financial market volatility seen so far this year. It would be wrong to get too worried. The survey data are consistent with GDP rising at a steady quarterly rate of 0.3-0.4% at the start of the year. Howard Archer at IHG Global Insight said: The January purchasing managers\u2019 surveys for Eurozone manufacturing and services activity are weaker than expected -showing overall expansion moderating to an 11-month low - and raise concerns that heightened global economic uncertainty and financial market turmoil are weighing down on a relatively fragile Eurozone cyclical upturn. Global economic uncertainties and problems are clearly a significant threat to Eurozone growth prospects not only through limiting exports but also potentially weighing down appreciably on business confidence, which could affect employment and investment decisions. Further constraints to Eurozone growth comes from high debt levels in some countries and structural limitations. Nevertheless, the Eurozone January purchasing managers\u2019 surveys are far from disastrous, and they still show reasonable new business growth, rising backlogs of work and decent employment growth. Furthermore, confidence in the services sector was at the highest level since May 2011... However, there are likely to be questions about just how much extra stimulus the ECB is likely to deliver in March having been disappointed in December Here\u2019s our story on the recovery in stock markets: European and Asian stock markets bounced back at the end of a tumultuous week, as oil prices recovered and the European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, raised hopes of further stimulus measures. It was a week that involved panic selling in global markets, pushing several of them, including London and Japan, into bear market territory, as oil prices tumbled to 13-year lows below $28 a barrel and further intensified fears over the health of the global economy. On Friday, however, Japan\u2019s Nikkei rallied nearly 6%, its biggest one-day gain in four and a half months, helped by a weaker yen and speculation that the Bank of Japan could unveil new stimulus measures at its meeting next week. In Europe, Draghi hinted that the ECB was ready to inject fresh stimulus into the eurozone at the March meeting \u2013 sooner than many investors had been expecting. The comments pulled European markets off their lows on Thursday afternoon, and gave them a further boost on Friday, with the FTSE 100 index in London gaining nearly 100 points, or 1.7%, to 5872.74 in early trading. Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s CAC were both up 1.8% and Spain\u2019s Ibex rose 2%. Earlier came more signs of uncertainty in the eurozone\u2019s economy, confirming ECB president Mario Draghi\u2019s concerns. In France, the manufacturing sector stalled in January although the services sector picked up after the November terror attacks in Paris. Markit\u2019s initial reading for January showed the French manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index falling from 51.4 in December to 50 in January. But the services index rose from 49.8 to a better than expected 50.6, so the composite index - which tracks both sectors - climbed from 50.1 to 50.5 in January. Over in Germany, Markit\u2019s composite Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index fell from 55.5 in December to 54.5 in the preliminary reading for January. This was slightly below expectations. But Markit economist Oliver Kolodseike said the index still suggested growth in the country\u2019s economy, and it appeared unfazed by recent turbulence: Germany\u2019s private sector economy was largely unaffected by the recent stock market turmoil and intensifying uncertainty stemming from the so-called migrant crisis at the beginning of the year, according to latest survey results. Although the headline index (which measures the combined output of manufacturing and service sector firms) fell to a three- month low, the latest reading was higher than the 2015 average and indicative of robust, although unspectacular, growth of the German economy. Is France\u2019s next president at Davos today? Elsewhere in Davos, Harvard professor Ken Rogoff has warned that 2016 is a \u201crough year\u201d for emerging markets, due to the concentration of problems. We don\u2019t quite know what\u2019s happening in China, it\u2019s slowed down significantly. There\u2019s Russia, where the central bank governor did a \u201cwonderful job\u201d letting the ruble flow. They would have been in crisis otherwise. Then there\u2019s Brazil\u2019s huge political problems. Brazil\u2019s recession might be its worse in 100 years. I\u2019m very happy about what\u2019s happening in Argentina, though, Rogoff adds, to his fellow panelist Alfonso Prat-Gay, the new Argentina\u2019s finance minister. Prat-Gay clenches his fists in triumph. But Prat-Gay then warns that Argentina has \u201cunacceptable and immoral\u201d poverty rates of 30%, with 10 million people who cannot make ends meet. So, nothing sensational from Draghi on monetary policy -- but a level-headed argument that Europe could ride out the migration crisis, and a warning that it cannot afford to fail. Q: Is Draghi worried that the \u2018linear\u2019 push towards ever-closer European union is faltering? Draghi isn\u2019t convinced by this argument. I don\u2019t think it was ever meant to be a linear process. The founders of the EU, because they were pretty intelligent, they expected some bumps on the way. On Greece, Mario Draghi says Europe is in a much better situation than last June. The Greek government has made progress on reforms, and fiscal consolidation. Negotiations are taking place right now [between Greek officials and its creditors] There are three areas of interest: The fiscal targets for 2018-19 Pension reforms - which seems to be a \u2018key point\u2019, Draghi says. Financial sector reforms . There are still a high-level of non-performing loans in Greek banks. So we need a process by which these loans can be sold. I\u2019m pretty sure that an agreement will be found, so that the first review can be swiftly concluded, Draghi conclu The sooner it\u2019s concluded, the sooner the Greek economy can go back to normal, Draghi concludes. As ECB president Mario Draghi speaks in Davos, his comments on Thursday suggesting there may be further stimulus measures at the bank\u2019s meeting in March continue to give a boost to markets. At the open in Europe, the FTSE 100 has jumped 100 points or 1.7%, while Germany\u2019s Dax is up 1.8%, France\u2019s Cac has climbed more than 2% and Spain\u2019s Ibex is up nearly 2%. The refugees heading to Europe are a challenge and an opportunity for Europe, says Mario Draghi. Our society will be changed by this. In which direction, we can only guess. It is also premature to know how long it till take to transform this challenge into an opportunity. But if there is determination, and confidence. that\u2019s the most important thing, because the size of the challenge could actually undermine the confidence and make fear prevail over any other consideration. And the challenge is lost. Right now, we are all working to make it into an opportunity, the ECB president adds. But we mustn\u2019t underestimate the scale of the crisis - the education levels of the refugees, their age, and the willingness of the European countries themselves to invest and co-operate. Draghi says he\u2019s also confident that a way will be found to share the financial burden of the refugee crisis across Europe. Not to co-operate would be to ignore the challenge, and that would not make it disappear. Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank, is discussing the European economy now. He has warned that Euro governments will have to spend more to tackle the refugee crisis. In economic terms, that works out as a fiscal stimulus that could actually push up Europe\u2019s anaemic growth rate. Draghi is also blaming the slump in the oil price, and problems in the emerging markets, for pushing Europe\u2019s inflation outlook even lower. Having made her announcement, Christine Lagarde is now being congratulated by fellow Davos delegates while she snatches a quick breakfast. Two security guards just made it very clear that she\u2019s not speaking to the press right now. Lagarde\u2019s term of office ends in July. Yesterday, Osborne said she was an \u2018outstanding leader\u2019, who would take the world economy forward. But she does also face the prospect of trial in a French court over the Tapie Affair, so there could be a few twists in this tale yet. Breaking news from Davos- Christine Lagarde, managing director of the IMF, has said she will run for a second term. She made the announcement on French TV a few minutes ago, having already been nominated by several finance ministers, including George Osborne. Lagarde said: \u201cI am candidate to a new mandate. I was honoured to receive from the start of the process the backing of France, Britain, Germany, China, Korea.\u201d Super Mario Draghi seems to have done it again. Ahead of his speech to Davos the ECB president has lifted markets with his hints of further stimulus at the bank\u2019s March meeting. Also helping was talk from Saudi Arabia of a recovery in oil prices later this year, which has pushed Brent Crude more than 5% higher to $30.81 a barrel. So on Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped... while in Asia the Nikkei soared nearly 6% and the Hang Seng 3%. A tumultuous week looks set for a positive end. That even applies to the Shanghai Composite, which is up 1.3% on the day and 0.5% on the week - a surprising outcome given the chaos in the markets over the past few days. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: A sharp rebound in crude oil as well as some warm words from ECB President Mario Draghi turned out to be the perfect ingredients to prompt a sharp snapback in equity markets yesterday after Wednesday\u2019s rout, and this rebound has spilled over into the Asia session with crude oil recovering above the $30 level. The big question now is whether this marks a medium term base, or just a minor relief rally before another leg lower. Given yesterday\u2019s rebound and the subsequent positive session in Asia there now remains the very real possibility that we could well finish the week in positive territory, and if that happens it would be a remarkable turnaround after Wednesday\u2019s carnage. The opening calls for Europe from IG show an upbeat start: Good morning from Davos, where the third day of the World Economic Forum is getting underway. There\u2019s a big focus on geopolitics today, with US secretary of state John Kerry giving a big keynote address. The migration crisis is also in focus, as Europe braces for another inflow of refugees from the turmoil in the Middle East. Overnight, France\u2019s prime minister, Manuel Valls, has warned that the crisis is destabilising Europe. But there\u2019s no escape from economic worries - European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi is due to address Davos shortly. Investors around the world will be watching closely; yesterday, Draghi hinted that the ECB could take fresh action in March. Meanwhile, UK prime minister David Cameron and chancellor George Osborne will be going round Davos, trying to stir British businesses into supporting them in the EU referendum. And Argentina\u2019s president, Mauricio Macri, is in town. Might he mention the Falklands Islands? Here\u2019s some of the things we\u2019ll try to cover: 8.45am CET (7.45am GMT): Mario Draghi discusses the outlook for the eurozone economy 10.30am: Securing the Middle East and North Africa, with Iraqi prime minister Ha\u00efdar Al Abadi and Lebanon\u2019s Tammam Saeb Salam. 11am CET : Europe at a tipping point: with French economy Emmanuel Macron, EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini, and David Miliband, President, International Rescue Committee 11.30am CET: John Kerry\u2019s special address 1.15pm CET: Press conference with the President of Argentina, Mauricio Macri, 4.45pm CET: Preparing for the next pandemic, including Bill Gates and Jim Kim, head of the World Bank.",

                "body":"<h2><strong>What is happening on global markets?</strong></h2> <p>The new year kicked off with a global stock market and commodities rout over worries about the global economic outlook and China\u2019s economy in particular. Plunging prices recovered at the end of last week, partly on reassurances of more stimulus to come from the European Central Bank, but traders are bracing for more volatility. At one point, oil prices fell below $28 per barrel \u2013 a 25% drop since the start of the year \u2013 on the combined effects of a supply glut and waning demand. Investors have dumped riskier stocks in favour of safe-haven assets, such as gold and government bonds. The FTSE 100 index of London-listed shares bounced back but is still down more than 5% since the start of the year.</p> <h2><strong>What do the experts think?</strong></h2> <p>Cutting its forecasts for global growth, the International Monetary Fund expressed concern about a slowdown in emerging market economies, China\u2019s difficult rebalancing away from an exports-driven economy, lower commodity prices and the ending of ultra-loose monetary policy in the US, which has just raised its interest rates for the first time in almost a decade. The IMF warned that recovery from the financial crisis could be derailed if key challenges are mishandled.</p> <p>The European Central Bank has also pointed to the downward pressure on eurozone growth for similar reasons. Its president, Mario Draghi, hinted the ECB was ready to print more money and cut borrowing costs, to counter those headwinds.</p> <h2><strong>What is China\u2019s role in this?</strong></h2> <p>Worries about China\u2019s true economic strength are at the heart of the jitters. After more than a decade of double-digit growth, during which it overtook Japan to become the world\u2019s second largest economy, things have inevitably slowed down. Last year China\u2019s GDP officially expanded by 6.9%, the slowest pace for 25 years; some say the true picture could well be half that. Other economic data from China has underscored the country\u2019s mammoth task of rebalancing the economy away from reliance on its vast manufacturing sector and exports to a more diverse mix.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5371ee8b9fbad42c366f3c6398ae2720821d2ba8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5371ee8b9fbad42c366f3c6398ae2720821d2ba8/0_23_3618_2171/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A container ship being loaded in Qingdao, Shandong province, China.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A container ship being loaded in Qingdao, Shandong province, China.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>China\u2019s woes are being felt in other economies because it is such a big commodities consumer: the slowdown in the world\u2019s biggest energy user is weighing on oil prices. There have also been dramatic swings on China\u2019s stock markets. A debt-fuelled rush of individual investors helped inflate a bubble on China\u2019s main exchanges but it burst last summer. There have been more steep falls in recent weeks. The CSI300 index of the largest listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen is down 16% since the start of this year and 42% since a peak last June.</p> <p>More worrying are the moves in China\u2019s currency. Beijing stunned markets last August by devaluing the yuan, taken by some as a distress signal. A weaker yuan cheapens Chinese exports, shoring up its manufacturing sector. But the fear is that China will \u201cexport\u201d deflation because a cheaper yuan cuts the price of its imports in advanced economies. Sharp swings in the currency this month have fanned fears China could repeat last summer\u2019s move but policymakers insist they have no fresh intentions to weaken the yuan.</p> <p>Finally, there is scant confidence among investors in Beijing\u2019s ability to manage economic transition following a string of seemingly futile interventions in markets and confused messages from policymakers. Six interest rate cuts since November 2014 have failed to halt the economic slowdown. A mechanism to curb stock exchange volatility \u2013 a so-called \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d \u2013 was introduced this month and then scrapped within days after it appeared to merely exacerbate the mayhem on markets. Amid worries about whether Beijing will keep its word over stabilising the yuan, IMF chief Christine Lagarde has urged China to communicate better with financial markets.</p> <p>But China cannot carry the blame alone, say experts. Despite rapid growth it makes up only 13% of the world economy, notes Ha-Joon Chang, who teaches economics at Cambridge University. As of 2014, the US, the eurozone and Japan together accounted for nearly half of the world economy. \u201cThe rich world vastly overshadows China,\u201d Chang says.</p> <h2><strong>Is this a repeat of the 2008 crisis?</strong><br></h2> <p>Speaking in Davos, billionaire speculator George Soros said: \u201cThere is a financial crisis and a bear market&#xa0;\u2026 The source of the disequilibrium is different. In 2008 it was US sub-prime housing. Today it is China, where a hard landing is practically unavoidable.\u201d Others warn that the vast money-printing programmes by central banks known as quantitative easing have flooded markets with easy money and propped up asset prices while little has been done in the last seven years to address fundamental economic problems. Those analysts warn that big imbalances remain in the global economy, that the world\u2019s banking system has not been reined in and national governments have made little progress in restructuring their economies towards more diverse sources of jobs and growth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"afcfb8de68616b932e0f1c7be022995263fe9c11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afcfb8de68616b932e0f1c7be022995263fe9c11/0_41_2835_1701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Soros\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Soros: \u2018The cause of the disequilibrium is different.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Should investors keep calm and carry on?</strong></h2> <p>Yes, say other experts: the underlying economic data is not that weak and markets will soon stabilise.

                "bodyText":"What is happening on global markets? The new year kicked off with a global stock market and commodities rout over worries about the global economic outlook and China\u2019s economy in particular. Plunging prices recovered at the end of last week, partly on reassurances of more stimulus to come from the European Central Bank, but traders are bracing for more volatility. At one point, oil prices fell below $28 per barrel \u2013 a 25% drop since the start of the year \u2013 on the combined effects of a supply glut and waning demand. Investors have dumped riskier stocks in favour of safe-haven assets, such as gold and government bonds. The FTSE 100 index of London-listed shares bounced back but is still down more than 5% since the start of the year. What do the experts think? Cutting its forecasts for global growth, the International Monetary Fund expressed concern about a slowdown in emerging market economies, China\u2019s difficult rebalancing away from an exports-driven economy, lower commodity prices and the ending of ultra-loose monetary policy in the US, which has just raised its interest rates for the first time in almost a decade. The IMF warned that recovery from the financial crisis could be derailed if key challenges are mishandled. The European Central Bank has also pointed to the downward pressure on eurozone growth for similar reasons. Its president, Mario Draghi, hinted the ECB was ready to print more money and cut borrowing costs, to counter those headwinds. What is China\u2019s role in this? Worries about China\u2019s true economic strength are at the heart of the jitters. After more than a decade of double-digit growth, during which it overtook Japan to become the world\u2019s second largest economy, things have inevitably slowed down. Last year China\u2019s GDP officially expanded by 6.9%, the slowest pace for 25 years; some say the true picture could well be half that. Other economic data from China has underscored the country\u2019s mammoth task of rebalancing the economy away from reliance on its vast manufacturing sector and exports to a more diverse mix. China\u2019s woes are being felt in other economies because it is such a big commodities consumer: the slowdown in the world\u2019s biggest energy user is weighing on oil prices. There have also been dramatic swings on China\u2019s stock markets. A debt-fuelled rush of individual investors helped inflate a bubble on China\u2019s main exchanges but it burst last summer. There have been more steep falls in recent weeks. The CSI300 index of the largest listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen is down 16% since the start of this year and 42% since a peak last June. More worrying are the moves in China\u2019s currency. Beijing stunned markets last August by devaluing the yuan, taken by some as a distress signal. A weaker yuan cheapens Chinese exports, shoring up its manufacturing sector. But the fear is that China will \u201cexport\u201d deflation because a cheaper yuan cuts the price of its imports in advanced economies. Sharp swings in the currency this month have fanned fears China could repeat last summer\u2019s move but policymakers insist they have no fresh intentions to weaken the yuan. Finally, there is scant confidence among investors in Beijing\u2019s ability to manage economic transition following a string of seemingly futile interventions in markets and confused messages from policymakers. Six interest rate cuts since November 2014 have failed to halt the economic slowdown. A mechanism to curb stock exchange volatility \u2013 a so-called \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d \u2013 was introduced this month and then scrapped within days after it appeared to merely exacerbate the mayhem on markets. Amid worries about whether Beijing will keep its word over stabilising the yuan, IMF chief Christine Lagarde has urged China to communicate better with financial markets. But China cannot carry the blame alone, say experts. Despite rapid growth it makes up only 13% of the world economy, notes Ha-Joon Chang, who teaches economics at Cambridge University. As of 2014, the US, the eurozone and Japan together accounted for nearly half of the world economy. \u201cThe rich world vastly overshadows China,\u201d Chang says. Is this a repeat of the 2008 crisis? Speaking in Davos, billionaire speculator George Soros said: \u201cThere is a financial crisis and a bear market \u2026 The source of the disequilibrium is different. In 2008 it was US sub-prime housing. Today it is China, where a hard landing is practically unavoidable.\u201d Others warn that the vast money-printing programmes by central banks known as quantitative easing have flooded markets with easy money and propped up asset prices while little has been done in the last seven years to address fundamental economic problems. Those analysts warn that big imbalances remain in the global economy, that the world\u2019s banking system has not been reined in and national governments have made little progress in restructuring their economies towards more diverse sources of jobs and growth. Should investors keep calm and carry on? Yes, say other experts: the underlying economic data is not that weak and markets will soon stabilise. Emerging economies with dollar-denominated debts are certainly facing challenges as the US raises interest rates, but the outlook for the dominant developed economies looks better, they argue. Even Nouriel Roubini, the economist known as Dr Doom who predicted the last crash, told Davos: \u201cIt is not going to be like 2008-09. There is not the excessive leverage in the financial system that there was last time.\u201d Fears about China are also overdone, say others, including Steve Schwarzman, billionaire boss of the private equity firm Blackstone Group. \u201cIf I thought China was in a freefall I would be really concerned. I actually don\u2019t. The consumer and the service economy is holding up pretty well in China,\u201d Schwarzman told Bloomberg Television in Davos.",

Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With oil prices lower, it\u2019s perhaps no surprise that equity markets have followed this lead although it is certainly worth noting that today\u2019s sell-off [on the FTSE 100] does look remarkably measured...Panic could well have enveloped the market given the downturn we saw for crude just before European bourses opened for the week, so this is certainly something that\u2019s notable.

Tightening monetary policy today would require faith that our forecasting models will work and the tightness in labour market quantities and measures of labour market churn will soon translate into stronger wages and then higher inflation. But, unfortunately, these models have not been working very well recently. Therefore, although I still have faith, I would like to see a bit more upward movement in these wage and cost measures to build confidence that the normal chain of tight labour markets feeding through into higher wages is still intact. In other words: trust, but verify. The most recent falls in oil prices, by delaying the recovery in inflation, provide the luxury of a bit more time to build this confidence.\u201d<br></li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-01-25T16:35:41.027Z\">at 4.35pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-56a64937e4b05514c2d81423\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-25T16:15:03.596Z\">4.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Is the gloom about a slowdown in China overdone?</strong> Julian Jessop at Capital Economics thinks so:</p> <blockquote> <p>According to the official GDP data, China\u2019s growth was 6.9% in 2015, which would be the slowest since 1990. Our own China Activity Proxy (CAP) suggests that the true growth rate has been much weaker, perhaps as low as 4.3% in 2015. However, while sluggish by China\u2019s recent standards, even 4.3% would still be a respectable pace of growth anywhere else. Our CAP also suggests that the worst of China\u2019s slowdown is now in the past.</p> <p>Indeed much of the recent gloomy commentary about the impact of slower growth in China on the rest of the world misses a number of other key points. First, it was never likely that China could maintain double-digit growth as incomes caught up with those in West. Some slowdown was both inevitable as the economy matured, and desirable as part of rebalancing away from over-investment towards consumption.</p> <p>Second, China\u2019s slowdown is nothing new. Growth peaked in 2007 and had been on a clear downward trend since 2011. Crucially, this has not prevented advanced economies from picking up, or global growth from stabilising.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2da646b4779abd8babcf9c1839fe55f777112b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2da646b4779abd8babcf9c1839fe55f777112b4/0_0_5184_3112/1000.jpg\" alt=\"China\u2019s volatile stock market.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">China\u2019s volatile stock market.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Imaginechina/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>Third, the much larger size of China\u2019s economy means that even much slower rates of growth can deliver big increases in demand from year to year and maintain a high contribution to global growth. Indeed, on the official data at least, the increase in China\u2019s GDP in 2015 was practically the same as in 2007, even though the annual growth rate had more than halved. (The differences would be larger using our CAP estimates, but the essential point still stands.)</p> <p>To be clear, there are valid concerns over the medium-term outlook for China, including high and rising levels of debt and the damage to credibility caused by botched interference in the equity market and by the poor communication of changes in currency policy. But despite some genuine risks, China\u2019s economy is not collapsing. Nor is there much to justify fears that the turmoil in China\u2019s equity or currency markets will cause major problems in the rest of the world. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56a645bae4b085519d005708\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-25T15:56:53.664Z\">3.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And on the Dallas Fed survey:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IanShepherdson/statuses/691648217751109633\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">If you&#39;re surprised that manufacturing surveys from oil/gas country are horrendously weak, you&#39;re in the wrong job.</p>&mdash; Ian Shepherdson (@IanShepherdson) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IanShepherdson/status/691648217751109633\">January 25, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56a64126e4b04953535d8f81\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-25T15:48:39.025Z\">3.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">New US manufacturing survey shows slump</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The Federal Reserve raised interest rates at its December meeting on the basis the US economy was strong enough to cope. </strong></p> <p>But a <strong><a href=\"http://www.dallasfed.org/microsites/research/surveys/tmos/index.cfm\">Dallas Federal Reserve manufacturing survey</a></strong> tells a different tale, with the business activity index coming in at -34.6 compared to -21.6 in November and a forecast of just -14.

The lead of the remain campaign has narrowed though across all polling companies, with a few polls even showing the leave campaign in the lead. The share of don\u2019t knows is still quite significant, i.e., on an average 15% of the voters are undecided.

                "bodyText":"Another drop in the crude price after news of record production from Iraq in December has helped get the week off to a downbeat start. Stock markets have ended lower, albeit not with any of the dramatic moves seen in the past few days. Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said: With oil prices lower, it\u2019s perhaps no surprise that equity markets have followed this lead although it is certainly worth noting that today\u2019s sell-off [on the FTSE 100] does look remarkably measured...Panic could well have enveloped the market given the downturn we saw for crude just before European bourses opened for the week, so this is certainly something that\u2019s notable. It\u2019s also worth pointing out that despite this weakness in crude, the natural resources stocks haven\u2019t been left propping up the index, with that title instead going to the banks. A downgrade for Lloyds plus concerns over an even more onerous regulatory system appear to be rocking sentiment here. Brent crude is currently 4.6% lower at $30.70 a barrel, while a disappointing manufacturing survey from the Dallas Federal Reserve has also dented sentiment ahead of the latest Fed meeting this week. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 23.01 points or 0.39% at 5877.00 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.29% to 9736.15 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.58% at 4311.33 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB dropped 2.03% to 18,641.47 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 1.78% at 8367.7 In Greece, the Athens market edged up 0.07% to 534.72 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 75 points or nearly 0.5%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The outlook for UK inflation does not warrant an interest rate rise any time soon, according to Kristin Forbes, one of the Bank of England\u2019s nine policy-setters, writes Katie Allen. US economist Forbes has released a speech on the UK labour market in which she highlights a mixed picture: a low unemployment rate but slow pay growth. That echoes the tone of the minutes from the Bank\u2019s latest policy meeting when the monetary policy committee (MPC) voted 8-1 to leave interest rates at their record low of 0.5%. Only Ian McCafferty voted for a rate rise. Forbes says the UK labour market appears to be almost back to normal but that the drop in global oil prices has given the MPC a bit more time to judge if the tighter labour market would boost wages and help inflation return to the Bank\u2019s 2% target from 0.2% now. Her message seems to be that labour costs are slowly building but they are not yet at a level where policymakers can be confident UK inflation will hit 2%. Here are key quotes from Forbes speech, entitled \u201cA tale of two labour markets: the UK and US\u201d, released today but to be delivered tomorrow to the Henry Jackson Society in parliament: \u201cWith slow wage growth, inflation currently at 0.2%, and downward price pressure from cheaper energy and sterling\u2019s past appreciation, there appears to be little risk of inflation suddenly spiking to well above our 2% target in a way that would require increasing interest rates soon.\u201d \u201cA close look at the UK and US labour markets suggest that they are stronger and tighter than the most popular headline wage figures suggest. After a severe crisis and prolonged recovery, they have largely returned to normality. \u201cIn the UK, however, wages and labour costs have not yet gained enough momentum to be consistent with inflation reaching our 2% target. Tightening monetary policy today would require faith that our forecasting models will work and the tightness in labour market quantities and measures of labour market churn will soon translate into stronger wages and then higher inflation. But, unfortunately, these models have not been working very well recently. Therefore, although I still have faith, I would like to see a bit more upward movement in these wage and cost measures to build confidence that the normal chain of tight labour markets feeding through into higher wages is still intact. In other words: trust, but verify. The most recent falls in oil prices, by delaying the recovery in inflation, provide the luxury of a bit more time to build this confidence.\u201d Is the gloom about a slowdown in China overdone? Julian Jessop at Capital Economics thinks so: According to the official GDP data, China\u2019s growth was 6.9% in 2015, which would be the slowest since 1990. Our own China Activity Proxy (CAP) suggests that the true growth rate has been much weaker, perhaps as low as 4.3% in 2015. However, while sluggish by China\u2019s recent standards, even 4.3% would still be a respectable pace of growth anywhere else. Our CAP also suggests that the worst of China\u2019s slowdown is now in the past. Indeed much of the recent gloomy commentary about the impact of slower growth in China on the rest of the world misses a number of other key points. First, it was never likely that China could maintain double-digit growth as incomes caught up with those in West. Some slowdown was both inevitable as the economy matured, and desirable as part of rebalancing away from over-investment towards consumption. Second, China\u2019s slowdown is nothing new. Growth peaked in 2007 and had been on a clear downward trend since 2011. Crucially, this has not prevented advanced economies from picking up, or global growth from stabilising. Third, the much larger size of China\u2019s economy means that even much slower rates of growth can deliver big increases in demand from year to year and maintain a high contribution to global growth. Indeed, on the official data at least, the increase in China\u2019s GDP in 2015 was practically the same as in 2007, even though the annual growth rate had more than halved. (The differences would be larger using our CAP estimates, but the essential point still stands.) To be clear, there are valid concerns over the medium-term outlook for China, including high and rising levels of debt and the damage to credibility caused by botched interference in the equity market and by the poor communication of changes in currency policy. But despite some genuine risks, China\u2019s economy is not collapsing. Nor is there much to justify fears that the turmoil in China\u2019s equity or currency markets will cause major problems in the rest of the world. And on the Dallas Fed survey: The Federal Reserve raised interest rates at its December meeting on the basis the US economy was strong enough to cope. But a Dallas Federal Reserve manufacturing survey tells a different tale, with the business activity index coming in at -34.6 compared to -21.6 in November and a forecast of just -14. This marks a six year low, with companies hit by the strength of the dollar. The Dallas Fed said: Texas factory activity fell sharply in January, according to business executives responding to the Texas Manufacturing Outlook Survey. The production index\u2014a key measure of state manufacturing conditions\u2014dropped 23 points, from 12.7 to -10.2, suggesting output declined this month after growing throughout fourth quarter 2015. The Federal Reserve meets again this week to unveil its latest rate decisions although there is no press conference. One Dallas Fed respondent said: I expect the Fed to recognise the weakness in the economy and the fact that we are in recession and drop interest rates again. That is unlikely to happen but there is a growing feeling the rate rise in December could have been premature. Speaking of the snow, US government offices are shut today: ...But this week\u2019s Fed meeting goes ahead as planned: The drop in oil prices has led to an initial fall in the US markets which, despite the storms hitting the east coast, have opened on time. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is 66 points or 0.44% lower, while the S&amp;P 500 has slipped 0.2% and Nasdaq is down 0.3%. Oil prices continue to slide, losing much of the gains made during Friday\u2019s rally. As we said earlier, there are several reasons for the decline, including Iraq\u2019s production hitting a record in December and oil giant Saudi Aramco saying it won\u2019t cut investment in new production. In a speech in London Abdalla el-Badri, secretary general of Opec, said both members and non-members of the oil producing group (like Russia) should tackle the problem of oversupply together. He put some of the blame for the glut of crude on smaller oil-producing countries. He said: It is vital the market addresses the issue of the stock overhang. As you can see from previous cycles, once this overhang starts falling then prices start to rise. Given how this developed, it should be viewed as something Opec and non-Opec tackle together. Yes, Opec provided some of the additional supply last year, but the majority of this has come from non-Opec countries. It is crucial that all major producers sit down to come up with a solution to this. At the moment Brent crude is down nearly 4% at $31 a barrel. Greece\u2019s economy is expected to have contracted by 0.2% last year, according to Bank of Greece governor Yannis Stournaras. The country is likely to stay in recession in the first half of 2016, he said in a speech to Hellenic American Chamber of Commerce, but it could rebound over the course of the year. He called for the first review of its economic reforms by creditors to be completed quickly, saying a failure to do so would be destabilising. Unilever\u2019s boss Paul Polman - who earlier said the company would not scale back its UK operations if Britain voted to leave the EU - has hit out against a possible sugar tax. Graham Ruddick reports: The boss of Unilever, one of the world\u2019s biggest food manufacturers, has warned that a sugar tax will not solve Britain\u2019s obesity crisis and urged the government not to introduce one. Amid a growing clamour from politicians and campaign groups for a sugar tax, Paul Polman said there was little evidence that introducing a levy on food and drink with a high sugar content would help tackle obesity. Unilever makes some of Britain\u2019s most popular snacks, including Magnum, Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s, and Cornetto ice-creams. The full story is here: A referendum could be held in June this year, provided prime minister David Cameron reaches a deal at next month\u2019s EU summit, reckon Credit Suisse: Ministers have calculated that roughly four months are required between the announcement of the referendum and the referendum. Our base-case scenario is for the referendum to be held in June 2016, but any delays in the renegotiation could push it out further. The final outcome of the renegotiation and the deal that Prime Minister Cameron manages to secure is important, in our view, for the result of the referendum. Opinion polls so far show a lead for the remain campaign with 45% voting to remain in the EU versus 39% voting to leave, if we take an average of the opinion polls in December 2015. The lead of the remain campaign has narrowed though across all polling companies, with a few polls even showing the leave campaign in the lead. The share of don\u2019t knows is still quite significant, i.e., on an average 15% of the voters are undecided. Since the lead of the remain campaign is narrow, the undecided voters will be key for the outcome of the referendum. But the bank adds (wisely): It is also important to be cautious while interpreting these opinion polls, given that in past events such as the UK 2015 general election they were not completely reliable. They are also likely to move once the deal with the EU is finalized as we discussed above. Here is Credit Suisse\u2019s possible timeline of events: Brexit would also have long-term implications for the UK\u2019s political landscape, Credit Suisse points out in their new report. For example, what if Scotland largely votes to stay in and seizes on the overall exit decision as a reason to hold another referendum? Or what if Brexit creates a recession painful enough to allow the opposition Labour Party under supposed \u2018radical\u2019 Jeremy Corbyn to benefit from a surge in opinion polls? This could mean that investors are less willing to hold UK assets. including government debt and shares in British companies. CS say: A significant risk for the UK would be selling by foreign holders of UK assets. Britain\u2019s EU referendum was a big issue at Davos last week. IMF chief Christine Lagarde warned that Brexit fears are destabilising the financial markets at a critical time, while many delegates spoke privately about the issue. Now Credit Suisse, the Swiss bank, has weighed in, saying Britain\u2019s exit from the EU could be an \u201cimmediate and simultaneous economic and financial shock\u201d for the UK economy. It would wipe 2% off GDP, they believe, triggering a snap recession. Brexit would also dent business confidence, weaken the pound, hit real incomes, and deter foreign investors from putting money into the UK . The report is called \u201cBrexit: Breaking up is never easy, or cheap\u201d. It warns: If the UK votes to leave the EU, it is likely to entail an immediate and simultaneous economic and financial shock for the UK. We can expect a drop in business investment, hiring and confidence. A sudden stop of capital flowing into the UK could make the large current account deficit difficult to sustain and lead to a sharp fall in sterling. In its most extreme that could mean a level drop in GDP of 1%-2% in the short term due to the toxic blend of depressed business confidence, tightening financial conditions, higher inflation and falling real incomes. A freeze on capital flowing into the UK would be problematic, given the size of Britain\u2019s trade deficit. Given that these capital flows finance the large current account deficit in the UK (roughly 4.0% of GDP), this will make the current account deficit difficult to sustain. A vote to leave the EU could be the catalytic event that turns the UK\u2019s current account deficit from \u201csomething to worry about\u201d to \u201ca problem\u201d. This table outlines its predictions: One key issue is what relationship the UK would have with Europe, if it left. Credit Suisse reckons Britain is unlikely to duplicate any existing models used by, say, Switzerland. In our view it is more likely to be a unique relationship tailored specifically for the UK, resembling a free trade agreement for goods with restrictions for services.

Over in Greece, prime minister Alexis Tsipras has marked the first anniversary of his famous election victory - which prompted so much drama and discord during 2015. The milestone comes amid widespread criticism and protests against the third bailout deal he signed last summer, as street protests against proposed pension reforms and tax rises mount measures. From Athens, Helena Smith reports In what many saw as an exercise in damage limitation, Alexis Tsipras the Greek prime minister marked the occasion with a speech last night in Athens under a giant banner proclaiming: \u201cone year of the left, one year of struggle.\u201d \u201cWe are proud that we fought these historic battles, that we gave [Greeks] a breath of dignity, that we clashed with a conservative establishment in Europe,\u201d he declared. The battle isn\u2019t over. It is still in front of us. Europe, a year later, is not the same. The seed that we sowed is fertilising and we already have the first fruits of this development.\u201d Many, starting with farmers, might not agree with that. With creditors signalling that the government\u2019s proposed pension reforms are far from adequate - not least because they fail to cover a fiscal gap of \u20ac1.8bn this year alone - Tsipras more than ever is caught between a rock and a hard place. He\u2019s meeting with union leaders representing doctors and lawyers today, in an attempt to rebuild relations. A meeting with a committee representing farmers will likely follow later this week with the finance ministry saying it is also examining ways of reducing taxes for those who earn less than \u20ac9,500 a month. Piling the pressure on Tsipras\u2019 two party coalition, the union of public sector employees, Adedy, announced this morning that it will be staging a protest rally in Athens tomorrow. Back in the City, shares in DIY chain Kingfisher have slumped to the bottom of the league table today, down 4%. Investors don\u2019t seem impressed by its new strategy, announced this morning, which includes returning \u00a3600m to shareholders. David Hellier has taken a look, and explains: There are nine separate operating companies within Kingfisher that the group said last year it would bring together. The idea is that the combined operation will benefit from economies of scale in its buying power and hopefully help create a more unique Kingfisher product range. Kingfisher has costed the plan at about \u00a3800m, knocking \u00a350m off profits in year one and \u00a370m-\u00a3100m in year two. The company\u2019s chief executive, Veronique Laury, who is due to meet analysts and investors in London on Monday, said the aim was to \u201cleverage the scale of the business by becoming a single, leveraged company\u201d. More downbeat news from UK manufacturers this morning, who continue to struggle with a tough export market, according to a survey from business group CBI. Its latest snapshot of industry for the three months to January showed both domestic and export new orders were near-flat, although that did represent an improvement on the previous quarter when orders fell. Manufacturers do expect some growth in domestic new orders and output over the next quarter, but export new orders are expected to remain flat and optimism about the overall business situation declined a little further, according to the 465 firms surveyed. The survey follows official data showing manufacturing slipped into recession last year. The manufacturers\u2019 organisation EEF has forecast tens of thousands of job losses in the sector this year as it grapples with steel plant closures and a sharp drop off in orders from the embattled North Sea oil and gas industry. But in the CBI survey, 25% of firms said they expected employment to increase in the next quarter and 17% expected it to decrease, giving a balance of +8%, marking a turnaround from October\u2019s net balance of -8%. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI director of economics, said: \u201cManufacturers have seen a flat start to 2016 but while we have seen real problems in some industries in the last few months, there are signs that orders and production are stabilising overall. \u201cUncertainty around the prospects for global growth, uncompetitive energy costs and the strength of the pound have all played their part in UK manufacturers finding conditions tough when trying to sell overseas. \u201cOver the longer term, strong investment in innovation and skills is vital to boosting our performance in exports, so it\u2019s great to see firms planning to invest more in training and products over the next year.\u201d JP Morgan\u2019s weekly healthcheck of the global economy shows that growth remains modest: The patient isn\u2019t flat on the floor, but it isn\u2019t ready to run the 400 metres either. The recent market turmoil has left many traders and analysts gasping for a G&amp;T or two (or three). And swanky tonic provider Fever-Tree may be feeling the benefits. Shares in the company have surged 5% this morning, after it told the City that it expects sales growth of 77% for the second half of 2015. The company has been riding the new boom in mixology and exotic spirits, since its founders toured the globe to source ingredients for a tonic that (they say) is a rather better match for gins than your standard fair. Not that it comes cheap. A pack of four small bottles sets you back \u00a33 - or three times as much as a humble dash of Schweppes. IFO\u2019s top economist, Klaus Wohlrabe, has told Reuters that German businesses are \u201cfrightened at the start of the new year\u201d. Here\u2019s some reaction to this drop in German business morale this month (see last post) Morale among German business leaders has taken a thump this month, as concern over the global economy builds. The monthly survey of German economic sentiment from the IFO think tank shows that business leaders are less optimistic about the future. IFO\u2019s \u2018current assessment\u2019 index dipped to 112.5, down from 112.8, while the expectations index fell to 102.4 from 104.6. Holger Sandte, analysts at Nordea markets, says the German manufacturing is suffering from problems in overseas markets. He also tweeted this graph: Ouch. Russia\u2019s economy has suffered its deepest slump since the dark days after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. New data shows that Russian GDP shrank by 3.7% in 2015, the biggest annual decline since 2009. That show the impact of the slump in the oil price, which has hit Russia\u2019s energy revenues. The sanctions imposed by Western governments following the Crimea and Ukraine crisis have also hit the Russian economy, restricting exports and access to capital. Today\u2019s action in a Bloomberg nutshell: FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga warns that economic fundamentals are still weak: Anxieties around slowing global growth, ongoing China woes, and emerging market weakness continue to weigh heavily on global sentiment, while the extended decline in commodity prices have sabotaged most major central banks inflation goals. The selloff in oil is gathering pace this morning, and pushing European markets lower. Brent crude has now lost 3% this morning, and is now down at $31.20 per barrel. There seem to be five factors driving oil down this morning, reversing some Iraq saying its production hit a record in December Saudi oil giant Saudi Aramco has said it won\u2019t cut investment in new production The spike caused by Storm Jonas, which hit the East Coast of the US last week, is fading Indonesia has said that only one OPEC member wants an emergency meeting (probably Venezuela) Traders are taking profits after seeing the oil price surge on Friday. That\u2019s now weighing on European markets, pushing commodity stocks down. This could be a tricky day for investors, warns Conner Campbell of SpreadEx. It\u2019s the final week of 2016\u2019s dreadful January, leaving the markets with a few more days to mitigate the disastrous losses that have plagued the start to the New Year. Not that the morning\u2019s trading is inspiring much hope so far\u2026 With the European indices already losing whatever green glow their futures had acquired, failing to capitalise on last Friday\u2019s week-rescuing surge, it looks like investors are in store for another long day. The seemingly fretful nature of investors this morning is likely to only be exacerbated by a general lack of data, with the day\u2019s main event, a speech from Mario Draghi in Frankfurt (with the markets likely hoping for a few more stimulus hints from the golden-tongued ECB President) not arriving until the early evening. Draghi will be speaking at Deutsche B\u00f6rse New Year\u2019s reception, at 7pm local time (6pm GMT). Trading had begun in Europe, with the main stock markets gaining around 0.3% to 0.5%. But almost immediately, they started slipping back. The sight of the oil price dropping back below $32/barrel is hitting confidence. Tony Cross, analyst at Trustnet, says: We\u2019ve got a rather troubling start to the European session with crude oil having sold off quite sharply over the last hour or so. We remain well up on the prices posted at the middle of last week, but this weakness could unsettle equity markets which soared last week as oil prices appeared to find something of a foot-hold. The oil price is rather frisky this morning. Brent crude hit $32.81 per barrel in early trading, a two week high. But it couldn\u2019t hold such giddy heights for long, and is now down 1% at $31.85. Why? Well, the blizzards in America has been pushing energy prices higher, on predictions that demand for heating will rise. But a few minutes ago, Reuters reported that Iraqi oil production hit a record high in December. That could push up the oil glut, and give traders a reason to sell. But as one wise City head points out, the data doesn\u2019t always make a clear story: Investors would be wise to treat today\u2019s market rally with some caution. China\u2019s slowdown, and the knock-on effect on emerging markets, means 2016 is going to be a turbulent year. Angus Nicholson of IG sees trouble ahead: It\u2019s difficult to know how long this little resurgence in risk appetite will last. China is about to go offline for Chinese New Year beginning 8 February; this could remove the destabilising force of the Chinese equity markets for a while. But China\u2019s Q1 data is set to be very weak, and, when this starts filtering out in March and April, that could really turn global sentiment (and oil) as soon as the data hits. And despite last week\u2019s rout, shares don\u2019t look terribly cheap on a historical basis, he adds: Historically, markets are still trading at relatively elevated levels according to Shiller\u2019s CAPE, with the S&amp;P 500 still trading higher than one standard deviation above the long-term average. Hopes that world central bankers will act again to stimulate growth and ward off a global downturn drove markets higher across Asia. In Japan, the Nikkei gained 152 points, or 0.9%, to close at 17,110. Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200 rallied by almost 2%. And China\u2019s Shanghai composite index, which has experienced so much volatility this year, was a model of calm restraint. It closed 0.5% higher. So why the rally? Because, despite the waves of angst this year, traders haven\u2019t quite lost their faith in central bankers to do \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 to keep the show on the road. Last Thursday, European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi was pretty clear that the ECB will take fresh action in March. And on Saturday, Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda told Davos he believes there are no limits to the BoJ\u2019s tools for fighting deflation. However... Japanese stocks are still down 10% this year, and China has lost 16% (!), after recent heavy losses. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After chasing corporate chiefs and world leaders around Davos last week, it\u2019s back to business as usual today. And after a week of global market turmoil, Monday could be a little calmer. There\u2019s already been a decent rally in Asia overnight (more in a moment), and European markets are expected to rise when trading begins at 8am GMT, extending Friday\u2019s rally. There\u2019s not much corporate news in the diary, but Kingfisher - the owner of DY chain B&amp;Y - is publishing a strategic update. And Fevertree, which makes swanky tonic waters, is releasing results too....",

Oil was on the slide, falling back below $30 a barrel on continuing fears of a supply glut at a time when demand is weakening.</p> <p>So European markets began with falls of nearly 2%. But a revival in the crude price came amid talk that Opec could be prepared to cut production if rival producers followed suit. That, along with some decent financial results from the likes of Procter &amp; Gamble, set Wall Street off to a positive start and gave a lift to markets elsewhere. Ahead of Apple\u2019s latest figures later and the US Federal Reserve interest rate decision on Wednesday, the final scores in Europe showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 finished up 34.46 points or 0.59% at 5911.46, having fallen as low as 5771. Commodity companies led the rebound.</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.89% to 9822.75</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac closed 1.05% higher at 4356.81</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 1.51% to 18,923.83</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.46% better at 8692.5</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market added 2.15% to 546.22</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 285 points or 1.78% higher.</p> <p><em>On that note, it\u2019s time to close up.

The transfer of income from producers to consumers, who are more likely to spend on other goods and services, should boost global demand. At worst, the impact might be expected to be neutral, with the winners offsetting the losers. In practice, though, the net impact of the recent slump in oil prices appears to have been negative, or at least perceived as such in financial markets.</p> <p>There are a number of factors at play here. First, the speed and extent of the slump has itself added to the uncertainty about the global economy. Rightly or (more probably) wrongly, the fall has been interpreted as evidence of a collapse in demand and fuelled fears about a hard landing in China in particular.</p> <p>Second, the costs to producers have been proportionately much larger (relative to their incomes) than the benefits to consumers. This concentration of losses relative to the more diffuse benefits is one reason why producers appear to have cut their spending more quickly and by a larger amount than consumers have increased theirs.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4dd0af88d165ae6bdaaa473eace73706eedbc96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4dd0af88d165ae6bdaaa473eace73706eedbc96/0_0_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oil fields in Kazakhstan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oil fields in Kazakhstan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shamil Zhumatov/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>This asymmetry has compounded the negative impacts on financial markets. Energy companies may now only account, for example, for a small share of the US junk bond market, but the fear is that there will be widespread defaults throughout this sector, rippling through the financial system as a whole. Similarly, the impact on the 20% or so of the UK FTSE 100 accounted for by commodity producers is far more visible than the potential benefits to the remaining 80% who are not.</p> <p>Pressure on oil producers to sell assets accumulated in Sovereign Wealth Funds has also soured the mood, even though this selling might actually boost the global economy if the proceeds are used to support local spending.</p> <p>The additional downward pressure on headline inflation from lower energy costs has revived fears that vulnerable economies may slip into a more damaging period of deflation.</p> <p>However, this analysis does also allow us to draw some more positive conclusions. Stabilisation in oil prices \u2013 even at a low level \u2013 should at least ease some of the associated uncertainty about the health of the global economy. The downward pressure on headline inflation should unwind too. Many of the negatives are also about timing. Producers have generally been quicker to adjust their spending, but eventually this should be outweighed by increases in spending by consumers on other goods and services.</p> <p>On balance, then we continue to expect an extended period of lower oil prices to boost global growth over the next few years, even if this process may take longer than we had anticipated.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56a79880e4b085519d006727\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-26T16:06:36.100Z\">4.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The recovery in the oil price has given a boost to stock markets and follows hopes that Opec would be willing to cut production if non-member countries - notably Russia - also agree to reduce supply.</strong></p> <p>Iraqui oil minister Adel Abdel Mahdi said he saw some flexibility for a deal with rival producers, and as a consequence, Brent crude is now up 2.9% at $31.38.

Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at online trading group IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As oil goes, so goes the rest of the market. Yesterday a rapid decline in crude paved the way for stock markets to give up their gains, but today the price of black gold is on the up again, with the reliable market rumour of production cuts providing the foundation for both Brent and WTI to move back above $31 a barrel.</p> <p>At this point, a decision between Opec and non-Opec members to cut production is not the important element; the key point is such talk allows the price to move upwards to a position where bears can hit the \u2018sell\u2019 button once again.</p> <p>Rallies in oil in recent months have only lasted a few days, and once talk of a deal dries up, the way will be clear for the downtrend to resume.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56a792ece4b085519d0066c0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/helenasmith\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-26T16:00:39.607Z\">4.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>More protests in Greece.</strong> Helena Smith reports:</p> <blockquote> <p>Unionists representing Greece\u2019s 35,000-strong nurses\u2019 federation have been protesting outside the finance ministry in the latest display of fury over the leftist-led government\u2019s draft proposals overhauling the pension system.

                "bodyText":"Volatile days are becoming the norm but even by those standards, the swings during the course of the day\u2019s trading were pretty notable. A 6% slump in Chinese markets - partly driven by poor rail freight figures casting new doubt on the strength of the country\u2019s economy - got things off to a bad start. Oil was on the slide, falling back below $30 a barrel on continuing fears of a supply glut at a time when demand is weakening. So European markets began with falls of nearly 2%. But a revival in the crude price came amid talk that Opec could be prepared to cut production if rival producers followed suit. That, along with some decent financial results from the likes of Procter &amp; Gamble, set Wall Street off to a positive start and gave a lift to markets elsewhere. Ahead of Apple\u2019s latest figures later and the US Federal Reserve interest rate decision on Wednesday, the final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 34.46 points or 0.59% at 5911.46, having fallen as low as 5771. Commodity companies led the rebound. Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.89% to 9822.75 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.05% higher at 4356.81 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 1.51% to 18,923.83 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.46% better at 8692.5 In Greece, the Athens market added 2.15% to 546.22 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 285 points or 1.78% higher. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back again tomorrow. The slump in the oil price should theoretically be good for the global economy but stock markets at least do not seem to be taking that on board. Julian Jessop at Capital Economics says: In principle, a lower oil price should be positive for the world economy. The transfer of income from producers to consumers, who are more likely to spend on other goods and services, should boost global demand. At worst, the impact might be expected to be neutral, with the winners offsetting the losers. In practice, though, the net impact of the recent slump in oil prices appears to have been negative, or at least perceived as such in financial markets. There are a number of factors at play here. First, the speed and extent of the slump has itself added to the uncertainty about the global economy. Rightly or (more probably) wrongly, the fall has been interpreted as evidence of a collapse in demand and fuelled fears about a hard landing in China in particular. Second, the costs to producers have been proportionately much larger (relative to their incomes) than the benefits to consumers. This concentration of losses relative to the more diffuse benefits is one reason why producers appear to have cut their spending more quickly and by a larger amount than consumers have increased theirs. This asymmetry has compounded the negative impacts on financial markets. Energy companies may now only account, for example, for a small share of the US junk bond market, but the fear is that there will be widespread defaults throughout this sector, rippling through the financial system as a whole. Similarly, the impact on the 20% or so of the UK FTSE 100 accounted for by commodity producers is far more visible than the potential benefits to the remaining 80% who are not. Pressure on oil producers to sell assets accumulated in Sovereign Wealth Funds has also soured the mood, even though this selling might actually boost the global economy if the proceeds are used to support local spending. The additional downward pressure on headline inflation from lower energy costs has revived fears that vulnerable economies may slip into a more damaging period of deflation. However, this analysis does also allow us to draw some more positive conclusions. Stabilisation in oil prices \u2013 even at a low level \u2013 should at least ease some of the associated uncertainty about the health of the global economy. The downward pressure on headline inflation should unwind too. Many of the negatives are also about timing. Producers have generally been quicker to adjust their spending, but eventually this should be outweighed by increases in spending by consumers on other goods and services. On balance, then we continue to expect an extended period of lower oil prices to boost global growth over the next few years, even if this process may take longer than we had anticipated. The recovery in the oil price has given a boost to stock markets and follows hopes that Opec would be willing to cut production if non-member countries - notably Russia - also agree to reduce supply. Iraqui oil minister Adel Abdel Mahdi said he saw some flexibility for a deal with rival producers, and as a consequence, Brent crude is now up 2.9% at $31.38. But given the recent volatility, the gains may not last long. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at online trading group IG, said: As oil goes, so goes the rest of the market. Yesterday a rapid decline in crude paved the way for stock markets to give up their gains, but today the price of black gold is on the up again, with the reliable market rumour of production cuts providing the foundation for both Brent and WTI to move back above $31 a barrel. At this point, a decision between Opec and non-Opec members to cut production is not the important element; the key point is such talk allows the price to move upwards to a position where bears can hit the \u2018sell\u2019 button once again. Rallies in oil in recent months have only lasted a few days, and once talk of a deal dries up, the way will be clear for the downtrend to resume. More protests in Greece. Helena Smith reports: Unionists representing Greece\u2019s 35,000-strong nurses\u2019 federation have been protesting outside the finance ministry in the latest display of fury over the leftist-led government\u2019s draft proposals overhauling the pension system. Nurses, who have been hard hit by austerity, starting with relentless rounds of wage cuts, have become increasingly vociferous in recent months. Many turned up in surgery outfits. The country\u2019s union of civil servants (ADEDY) will stage a much bigger protest rally and march this evening to coincide with an extraordinary debate in parliament over the proposed measures. It will be the first time that prime minister Alexis Tsipras clashes in the 300-seat House with Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the newly-elected leader of New Democracy, the centre right main opposition party. The Harvard-educated erswhile banker, among the biggest champions of reform in Greece, has recently been leading polls. Odysseus Trivalas, who heads ADEDY, told me: \u201cWithout any prospect of growth or reduction in unemployment the proposed pension reforms are unsustainable. The government keeps saying without these measures the system will collapse but we argue that with contributions so low and unemployment so high it will collapse anyway if the government does not provide extra funding through the budget.\u201d \u201cThe funds should have been strengthened with all that money that was initially earmarked for the recapitalisation of banks. They didn\u2019t listen to us and now they will pay the price because these protests are not going to end soon.\u201d Forecasts that Greek banks would need as much as \u20ac25bn to withstand possible shocks proved to be vastly over-inflated when it was estimated in November that recapitalisation needs would not exceed more than \u20ac5.7bn. Farmers, who have also taken to the streets, are expected to expand tractor roadblocks nationwide during a rowdy meeting of union heads currently taking place in Thessaloniki. They have signalled they would be likely to vote to cut off road links and customs terminals with Bulgaria and Turkey to the north and east - causing yet more financial havoc for Greece. \u201cIt is going to be very difficult for them to roll back without concrete promises by the government,\u201d Travalas added. \u201cWe are all one group now, determined to stop this legislation going through.\u201d More US data, and this time it is more positive for the Federal Reserve. January\u2019s consumer confidence index came in at 98.1, better than the 96.5 expected and the 96.3 level in December. Dennis de Jong at UFX.com said: Despite global economic volatility, that US consumer confidence levels are higher than expected will be music to the ears of Fed Chair Janet Yellen. The US job market has surely contributed to the feel good vibe, with unemployment at a seven year low, in addition to sinking prices at the pumps providing consumer\u2019s wallets with a much needed fillip. There are still dangers on the road ahead for Yellen and Co as global growth expectations have been downgraded and a strong dollar is starting to hurt US exports. However, considering the outlook for other major economies, Yellen has every right to be pleased with the start to the calendar year. The World Bank has cut its forecast for crude oil prices for 2016 by $14 a barrel to $37, and also reduced its predictions for 37 out of 46 commodities. Phillip Inman reports: The World Bank has slashed its forecast for oil prices this year, saying the cost of a barrel of crude will stay near its current lows for the rest of 2016. The Washington-based institution said a glut of oil that sent prices crashing by almost half last year and another 27% this month will continue to dominate the market for the next year. It added that warm winter weather in Europe and weaker than expected growth in China and other emerging economies will depress demand and keep the average price at $37 a barrel, down from a projection of $51 last October. \u201cLow prices for oil and commodities are likely to be with us for some time,\u201d said John Baffes, senior economist and lead author of the bank\u2019s commodities markets outlook. \u201cWhile we see some prospect for commodity prices to rise slightly over the next two years, significant downside risks remain.\u201d Brent crude is currently up 1.1% at $30.85 a barrel. Here is our full story: More weak data for the US Federal Reserve to consider as it gathers for its first meeting since raising interest rates in December, a move many believe may have been a mistake. The US services sector has seen its slowest growth since December 2014. The Markit initial reading for the purchasing managers business activity index came in at 53.7 in January. This is down from 54.3 the previous month and just below the expected 53.9. Markit said: U.S. service providers started the year with another slowdown in business activity growth...Although still indicative of a solid increase in business activity, the headline index has now signalled weaker overall growth in four of the past five months. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit said a drop in business confidence suggested things could get worse: The survey data paint an inauspicious start to the year for the US economy. A struggling manufacturing economy is being accompanied by a services sector where growth showed further signs of losing momentum in January even before the bad weather hit. The data are by no means disastrous, signalling a 1.5% annualised rate of economic growth at the start of the year, but the drop in business confidence to one of its lowest levels for over five years suggests that firms are bracing themselves for worse to come. Worries about financial market volatility, the impact of slower growth overseas, a downturn in the energy sector and uncertainty about higher interest rates all took their toll and set the scene for further weakness in coming months. On what has been a volatile day for markets so far, Wall Street has started off on the front foot ahead of results from Apple and as the Federal Reserve begins its latest two day meeting. With oil recovering from its early falls - Brent crude is now up 1.6% at $30.99 a barrel having fallen as low as $29.27 - the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 133 points or 0.8% in early trading. In Europe the FTSE 100 is 0.15% higher while Germany\u2019s Dax, France\u2019s Cac and Spain\u2019s Ibex have edged into positive territory despite the earlier 6% slump on the Chinese market. Britain\u2019s economy continues to grow pretty steadily, according to the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist Andy Haldane, and a Chinese slowdown is unlikely to push the world economy into negative growth. Haldane said in an interview with Wolverhampton\u2019s Express and Star newspaper: We would have to fall a long way, or something very untoward would have to happen for that to fall into negative territory,. I think that is a reasonably unlikely event. Now are there things that could happen that could slow that rate of growth? Yes there are. It\u2019s true to say there are some concerns about how rapidly the Chinese economy is growing. These days China is of such a size and it\u2019s sufficiently well integrated into the world economy that when it sneezes there is a sense at which the world economy is at risk of catching a cold. Does that mean there is a chance that world growth could slow from current levels? Yes, there is a chance of that. Do I think there is a big risk of us being tipped into negative growth in the world economy? That strikes me as quite unlikely as things sit today. Meanwhile, as Carney was speaking, the World Economic Forum has announced the Bank of England governor as one of eight \u201csenior decision makers\u201d joining a taskforce to discuss the future of the global financial system. The group was formed at the request of Carney and WEF founder professor Klaus Schwab and it will \u201cwork to identify, analyse and propose recommendations in response to major transformative forces influencing the future of global finance and economics.\u201d A recent WEF document identified five areas which the taskforce could discuss in its first meeting: emerging markets, technologyi, regulatory and monetary policies, loss of trust in financial services and financial inclusion. Apart from Carney the other members of the taskforce are Citgroup chief executive Michael Corbat; Blackrock chairman Laurence Fink; HSBC chairman Douglas Flint; Bank of America chairman Brian Moynihan; Raghuram Rajan, governor of the Reserve Bank of India; Min Zhu, deputy managing director of the IMF; and Liu Mingkang, economics and finance fellow at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Why is governor Mark Carney worrying about the current account deficit anyway? The current account is significant, as it shows the balance between the goods, services and financial transactions into, and out of, the UK. Britain has been running a persistent deficit for some time -- dubbed the \u2018invisible deficit\u2019, as the financial markets have been relaxed about it. But historically, countries with large current account deficits have often been hit with currency crises, as investors eventually lose faith and stop buying your assets. That\u2019s what Mark Carney means when he mentions the \u201ckindness of strangers\u201d. A currency depreciation can actually help fix a current account deficit, as it makes imports unpleasantly expensive while helping exporters compete. But as our economics editor Larry Elliot has argued, Britain doesn\u2019t have the manufacturing base to really profit from a Sterling crisis. So if international investors decide not to buy UK assets, or hold the pound, if Britain\u2019s EU membership is in doubt, there could be a problem..... A quick recap of the main points from the Governor of the Bank of England\u2019s appearance at parliament: 1) Mark Carney warned that Britain\u2019s current account deficit is still a risk to financial stability, due to the current market instability and the looming referendum on EU membership. He warned that: First, the general global environment has been much more febrile, much more volatile. Relying on the kindness of strangers is not optimal in that type of environment, and that\u2019s what is the case when you\u2019re running a 4%, 4.5% current account deficit. And secondly, the possibility of a risk premium being attached to UK assets because of certain developments exists. And that plays into the riskiness of the situation. Carney also agreed that \u201cmaterial decisions\u201d can have an impact on financial stability, when questioned about Brexit. 2) Carney gave a clear hint that he might stay at the Bank of England for longer than planned. The governor\u2019s five-year term expires in July 2018, and he will decide this year whether to plump for a full eight-year term. I guess this is a new form of forward guidance.... If he does, Carney would return to the jobs market just as the IMF\u2019s top job comes up. #MediaSpeculation 3) Carney said the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate hike last month has added to the turbulence in the market. He said that domestic inflation pressure justified the hike, but cautioned that policymakers need to be aware that safe-haven currencies, and riskier ones, could both be buffeted as commodity prices tumble. 4) Carney said there is \u201cno concern\u201d at present, about direct or indirect stresses on UK banks. He argues that new capital rules, designed to bail in investors, should protect the system. 5) Carney also pointed out that OPEC\u2019s ability to influence the oil prices isn\u2019t what it was (as the plunge in the Brent crude oil price shows us) 6) Carney has also talked himself into a trip to the cinema. Hopefully The Big Short won\u2019t give him any flashbacks Stock markets have recovered some of their early losses. The FTSE 100 is now down just 28 points, or 0.5%, having been down almost 100 points earlier. On a lighter note, Wes Streeting then asks Mark Carney if he\u2019s seen The Big Short, the new film of Michael Lewis\u2019s excellent book about the US sub-prime crash that almost brought down Wall Street. I feel like I lived it, Carney replies [he was running the Bank of Canada at the time] I haven\u2019t seen it, but I\u2019m sure I will. I\u2019m happy to go. The question was prompted by Paul Waugh of the Huffington Post: A bottle of wine for any reader who spots the Carneys at their local Odeon. Q: Has the MPC or FPC gathered any information on how negative interest rates might affect the UK economy? We have thought more carefully about where the zero lower bound is, Carney replies. [ie, could they cut rates below the current record low of 0.5%?] But the actual question of negative interest rates, and the impact on the financial system, has not arisen, as we don\u2019t think that is the prospect. Labour MP Wes Streeting asks Carney whether the Treasury has ever leant on him over banking regulations. No, and it wouldn\u2019t make a difference if it tried, Carney replies. Q: And is the bank worried about recent elections in Spain and Portugal, given the relative instability of the governments which arose? Carney says the latest financial stability report concluded that the biggest risk had moved from advanced economies to emerging economies. He still thinks that is still the case. Rachel Reeves MP asks Carney about Britain\u2019s current account deficit, and the implications on UK trade if it leaves the EU. Q: Is the UK current account a growing risk, a declining risk, or a stable risk? And do you think Brexit would make it more or less of a risk? Carney says the current account deficit has gone down somewhat, and the improvement in the European economy should mean our net foreign income improves (as Britain exports more across the Channel). But he won\u2019t say that the riskiness has not gone down, for two reasons: \u201cFirst, the general global environment has been much more febrile, much more volatile. Relying on the kindness of strangers is not optimal in that type of environment, and that\u2019s what is the case when you\u2019re running a 4%, 4.5% current account deficit. And secondly, the possibility of a risk premium being attached to UK assets because of certain developments exists. And that plays into the riskiness of the situation. Carney didn\u2019t define \u2018certain developments\u2019, but it\u2019s pretty clear what he meant. Credit Suisse, the Swiss bank, warned yesterday that investors would probably demand a considerably higher risk premium to hold UK assets if the public voted to leave the EU. John Mann MP demands to know whether Carney had any role in the decision to abandon Britain\u2019s review of banking culture. This decision was taken entirely by the FCA, Carney replies. We have nothing to apologise for regarding our handling of UK bank culture, Carney continues, adding that the BoE isn\u2019t yet satisfied with bank\u2019s responses to questions about their conduct. Mark Carney is asked whether Britain would face financial instability if it votes to leave the EU. The governor says the Bank will reveal its precautionary measures \u2018after the fact\u2019. Speaking carefully (to avoid saying anything too controversial) he adds that material decisions can have an impact on financial stability, but doesn\u2019t give a particular view on Brexit. Carney also denies that central bankers hope the oil price goes up, to push inflation higher. Q: Can OPEC survive the slump in the oil price? Mark Carney says that OPEC\u2019s ability to influence the global supply has been diminished, given technical developments and increased supply sources (eg US shale gas). But the competitive position of the major opec suppliers, especially Saudi Arabia, is unrivalled as they can produce oil cheaper than many others. So one scenario is that OPEC has some influence, but at a lower price point. Back in the committee room, Mark Carney has been fielding questions about market turbulence, and the oil price. We are in an environment of \u201cheightened risk aversion\u201d which could continue for some time, says the BoE governor. And that will effect currencies that are seen as safe (the US dollar, the Swiss franc), and those that are riskier (emerging market currencies). Authorities need to bear this in mind. Here\u2019s a piece of idle speculation..... If Mark Carney does change his mind and serve a full eight years at the Bank of England, he would leave the BoE at the end of June 2021. That\u2019s also the summer when the managing directorship of the International Monetary Fund becomes vacant. Christine Lagarde appears to be nailed-on to do a second five-year term, starting in July 2016. When he arrived in London, the talk was that Carney fancied a move into Canadian politics. The prime minister-ship is now in Justin Trudeau\u2019s youthful hands, and could stay there for some time. Having run two central banks (UK and Canada), and also chaired the Financial Stability Board, Carney would be well-qualified to run the International Monetary Fund. It would also break the European hold on the top job at the IMF, without giving it to an American. Looking away from the select committee.... Tesco has been ordered to improve the way it deals with suppliers. An official inquiry into the 2014 scandal around Tesco\u2019s financial results found that the supermarket has delayed payments to suppliers, to support its profits. Christine Tacon, the Grocery Code Adjudicator, was damning about Tesco\u2019s behaviour, saying: \u201cI was troubled to see Tesco at times prioritising its own finances over treating suppliers fairly.\u201d Here\u2019s some reaction: Now the Treasury Committee has moved onto the new rules to handle failed banks, which will see bond-holders \u2018bailed in\u2019 to cover the costs of a rescue. Q: When will the system be ready, and will it work? Carney says several things need to happen. 1) Banks need to refinance debt, so that their \u2018bail-in-able debt\u2019 is in the right place within the organisation, to cover the cost of failure. 2) The holders of the debt need to know that they can be bailed in - he doesn\u2019t want retail bond investors to be surprised that they are now shareholders. 3) That knowledge will creates an incentive on bond-holders to ensure that banks hold enough equity to handle problems. The aim is to be ready by 2019, says Carney, so that the \u2018ring-fenced\u2019, systemically important banks are protected and can keep running after a collapse, if needed. This process will cost billions, and it will push up funding costs. But that\u2019s the price of avoiding another huge taxpayer-funded bailout. Q: But could the markets freeze up, leaving banks unable to protect themselves? Carney says he\u2019s met with many bank chiefs recently (including, I suspect, at Davos), and confirmed they are on track with building up the capital buffers they need. He argues that there\u2019s very little chance of one bank failure causing a systemic failure. That\u2019s more likely to be triggered by a general shock to the economy. Right now, he insists, there are no concerns about direct or indirect stresses on major banks. Q: Carney is then asked who, if anyone, he consulted before giving a speech last week saying that it\u2019s not time to raise interest rates? I wouldn\u2019t clear a speech with anyone before giving my personal view, Carney replies. Q: But did you discuss it with anyone on the MPC (monetary policy committee)? All draft speeches by MPC members are circulated in advance, as a courtesy, says Carney. And he denies that he said rates would definitely stay on hold for some time (as some papers reported) Q: So was the speech also shared with members of the FPC? (financial policy committee)? It wasn\u2019t - MPC speeches aren\u2019t typically shared with the FPC beforehand. Q: Was the Federal Reserve right to raise interest rates in December? Carney gives a long answer, arguing there is solid growth at the core of advanced economies. And domestic inflation pressures merited the change in monetary policy, he argues. Q: But did the rate hike cause the turmoil in the financial markets in recent weeks? The governor says that it was not the fundamental cause, but it did contribute to it. Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury Committee, then asks Mark Carney if he is reconsidering his decision to only serve five years at the Bank of England. Could he now decide to serve the full eight years? Carney smiles, then replies that he\u2019s certainly not planning to leave and follow Andrew Bailey to the FCA. We are making progress at the Bank of England, but there\u2019s more work to do, the governor says. And if I were to request a longer term, I\u2019d probably have to do so by the end of this. Carney is half-way through his five-year term. Tyrie says it would be valuable to know as soon as possible whether Carney might change his mind, and seek a longer stint at the Bank of England. The session begins with Mark Carney paying tribute to Andrew Bailey\u2019s career at the Bank of England. It will probably take three to six months to appoint a new deputy governor to replace Bailey. There is no designated successor, Carney adds. So get your application ready, readers Heads-up: Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, is about to start taking questions from the Treasury Committee. The session is being streamed live here. Looking back at the markets quickly... the FTSE 100 is still deep in the red, down 64 points or 1% at 5812. Oil is recovering some of its early losses, but it\u2019s still down around 2% at $29.91 per barrel. George Osborne has really surprised the City by announcing Andrew Bailey as the new head of the FCA. Bank of England governor Mark Carney says he\u2019s a fine choice (although would he really say anything else?....) Andrew is an extraordinary public servant who has devoted his entire professional life to serving the people of the United Kingdom. During his career, he has worked across all of the Bank\u2019s policy areas, combining leadership and innovation to deliver consistently the Bank\u2019s policy objectives. His work in helping to manage the crisis and then to develop the post-crisis regulatory framework has been exemplary. Here\u2019s some instant reaction: Newsflash: Britain has a new City regulator. Andrew Bailey, the deputy governor of the Bank of England, has just been named as the new chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority. He replaces Martin Wheatley, who was ousted by chancellor George Osborne last July. Bailey has been in charge of prudential regulation at the Bank of England - trying to sure that banks stick to the rules, and avoid the damaging risks that caused the 2008 financial crisis. Osborne\u2019s decision to sent Wheatley packing last year has been seen as a sign that the British government was taking a friendlier approach to the City. Here are a couple of photos from China\u2019s brokerage houses, as investors watched the market tumble by 6%. Analysts are divided over the severity of the Chinese slowdown. Yogi Dewan, founder of Hassium Asset Management (a wealth management firm) told Bloomberg TV that China is \u201cslowing, not melting down\u201d. He argues that Beijing are taking some \u201cvery positive\u201d steps, including devaluing the yuan and building close financial links with Europe. But Joseph Oughourlian of Amber Capital Investment Management is less optimistic. He is steering clear of companies who benefitted from China\u2019s investment boom over the last 15 years. FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga says investors are worried that capital will continue to ooze out of China, as people try to escape its slowing economy: A re-established wave of risk aversion gripped Asian equities sending most into red territory, while elevated fears that China capital outflows may accelerate as the economy decelerates has sent the Shanghai Composite Index diving -6.3% lower, to levels not seen in 13 months. With days like today continuing to come back to haunt the Shanghai Composite Index, the Chinese New Year period and the trading break couldn\u2019t come soon enough. Shares in easyJet have dropped by 2%, after the company reported that recent terror attacks have weakened demand. The budget airline said revenue suffered after November\u2019s Paris terror attack, and the bombing of a plane flying form Egypt\u2019s Sharm el-Sheikh. The recent market turmoil has also been a mixed blessing for the airline. The fall in the oil price will save it \u00a3180m on fuel costs, however currency moves will wipe out \u00a350m. In other words, easyJet needs fewer dollars to pay for fuel, but it needs to stump up more pounds to buy the dollars first.... Today\u2019s selloff comes nearly a week after global markets slumped into bear market territory, triggering alarm around the world: Simon Smith, chief economist at currency trading firm FXPro, fears that more market turbulence is coming. He writes: Chinese indices are 6% lower overnight, Japanese over 2% in the red and oil is back below 30 bucks a barrel. Volatility has been rising throughout the year so far but we\u2019re still someway off the big spike in the Vix (volatility index or \u2018fear gauge\u2019) last August and so there\u2019s potential for moves in markets to get even more dramatic. Today\u2019s selloff has been triggered by the slide in the oil price, as well as the Chinese market mayhem. Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct explains: Crude is sliding on renewed oversupply fears and even the building narrative we\u2019re seeing from Opec that they are ready to strike a deal with other producer nations \u2013 possibly centred around Russia \u2013 doesn\u2019t really appear to be lending any support to the equation, at least not yet. The gold price has jumped by 1%, as money pours out of shares and into safe-haven assets. That\u2019s usually a sign that investors are worried. Other European markets are also falling, with France\u2019s CAC down 1.6% and the German DAX shedding 1.3%: The FTSE 100 index of major UK companies has fallen by 87 points at the start of trading, or 1.4%, to 5789 Almost every share is falling, as traders face another day of volatile trading dominated by fears over the global economy. BP and Royal Dutch Shell are both down around 3%, mirroring today\u2019s sliding oil price. Mining companies are also suffering, reflecting worries about China. Commodity trader Glencore has shed 3.5%, and Anglo American (which produces iron ore, copper, nickel etc) is down 3.2% Almost every share on the Chinese stock market was hit by today\u2019s rout, with only four gaining ground. A late wave of selling has gripped the Shanghai stock market, sending shares slumping and triggering new angst in financial markets worldwide. China\u2019s benchmark index, the CSI 300, shed 188 points or 6.02% to finish the day at 2940. That\u2019s its lowest level since December 2014. Scores of shares were suspended after falling 10%, the maximum allowed under Chinese stock market regulations. The Shanghai market tumbled by 6.4%, the biggest daily loss since the first week of 2015. The selloff, which helped to drive oil down, came after new economic data showed that China\u2019s rail freight volume dropped by 11.9% last year, compared to 2014. That fuelled fears that China\u2019s economy is slowing faster than official figures show. The crude oil price has lurched back through $30 per barrel. Brent crude has slumped by 3% this morning, and is changing hands at $29.61 per barrel. The selloff is partly being driven by oversupply fears, with OPEC members sticking to their guns and keeping pumping in an apparent attempt to drive other suppliers out of business. Kit Juckes of French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale says the weak oil price will add to the gloomy mood in the markets: The fall in oil prices will make most of the headlines and drive most of the movement in markets today, unless it is reversed for no particularly good reason. The latest driver is the news that Iraqi oil output is strong. US production remains the key swing on supply and is what will eventually trigger a turn. But it will take hard news about declining US output to shift the market mood. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It looks like being another \u2018challenging\u2019 day in the markets. Asia\u2019s two-day rally has hit the wall, with most markets falling. Japan\u2019s Nikkei just closed down 2.4%, and we\u2019re expecting European stock markets to fall at the open (8an GMT). The surge of optimism which pushed shares higher at the end of last week has dissolved, in the face of worries about deflation and economic slowdown. In the corporate sector, budget airline easyJet and high street tech chain Dixons Carphone are releasing results. Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, is testifying to MPs this morning about the BoE\u2019s financial stability report, from 10am GMT. And we\u2019ll have an eye on Greece, where unions are expected to hold a protest rally in Athens today against pension cuts. That comes as We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

The statement comes against a more perilous global backdrop. Since the Fed raised rates on 16 December, stock markets have plunged, oil prices have skidded and China\u2019s leaders have struggled to manage a slowdown in the world\u2019s second-biggest economy.

The wording of its comments on the current state of the global economy will be key, but analysts are divided on what the Fed\u2019s tone will be.</p> <p>Simon Smith, chief economist at FXPro said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>All eyes will be back on the Federal Reserve today as they make their first interest rate decision and monetary policy statement of the year but there are no economic projections or press conference this time round, which come at the next meeting in March. We\u2019ve seen a rise in risk appetite in this final week of January which so far has been a bit of a blood bath, although the recovery from lows in many indices has softened the blow for many investors. This has come as a result of a bounce in oil prices but also a growing expectation that central banks will have to do more to support the global economy.</p> <p>Today\u2019s Fed meeting as a result is likely to see a more dovish tone to it, especially since the market consensus is that we will see fewer rate hikes this year than the Fed is currently pencilling in.</p> <p>Even though we saw a higher than expected rise in US consumer confidence yesterday a big warning shot has come from one of the world\u2019s largest companies Apple which saw its first fall in revenue since 2003.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a59eec51d6b478c60d8d80577479b838861028df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a59eec51d6b478c60d8d80577479b838861028df/0_0_3942_2366/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fed chair Janet Yellen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fed chair Janet Yellen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Susan Walsh/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But lya Spivak, currency strategist at DailyFX, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The rate-setting FOMC committee is broadly expected to keep the benchmark lending rate unchanged this time around. Indeed, priced-in probability of an increase is a mere 14.3%. This puts the spotlight on the text of the statement accompanying the rate decision and the forward guidance contained therein.</p> <p>Investors appear positioned for a dovish outcome having scaled back 2016 tightening bets amid risk aversion since the beginning of the year...</p> <p>For its part, the Fed will have to attempt a difficult balancing act. On one hand, it will have to acknowledge recent market turmoil as well as softening US growth dynamics in the final months of 2015. On the other, it will have to re-focus investors\u2019 attention on mandate-relevant fundamentals and establish the possibility of tightening in March. This is necessary so that such a move, if deemed appropriate, does not trigger an overly violent response.</p> <p>On balance, the case for policy normalization remains compelling. Realized and expected inflation is firming: the latest readings on core year-on-year CPI and hourly earnings growth registered at multi-year highs while 2-3 year breakeven rates have trended upward since August. On the jobs front, the unemployment rate is at the lowest level since 2008 and nonfarm payrolls growth is running at a reasonably brisk pace, with the 12-month trend average at 220k.</p> <p>This means that the Fed statement will have to reassure investors that it will adjust policy if market stress infects the real economy. In the same breath, it will have to explain that as of now, the projected rate hike path has not materially changed since the first post-QE rate hike in December. </p> <p>The markets\u2019 subsequent reaction will depend on the degree of wishful thinking that traders are prepared to entertain. If they emphasize the first point \u2013 a possible result considering the dovish shift in expectations in spite of the aforementioned fundamental evidence \u2013 risk appetite is likely to strengthen. This will see the stocks rising alongside sentiment-geared currencies like the Australian and New Zealand Dollars while the greenback as well as the anti-risk Euro and Yen decline. A focus on the second point will probably deliver the opposite result.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56a8d4fbe4b0de317fbefc60\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-27T14:36:36.263Z\">2.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens lower</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As investors await the latest US oil inventory figures and the outcome of this month\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting, Wall Street is on the slide again.</p> <p>In early trading the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen 113 points or 0.7%, partly due to Apple which is down 3.8% at $96.24 following its disappointing figures.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56a8d28fe4b027b9c9e83740\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-27T14:22:49.756Z\">2.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ahead of the start of US trading, here are some opening calls:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RANsquawk/statuses/692351571607298048\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"in\" dir=\"ltr\">US Pre-market movers:&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CAPN&amp;src=ctag\">$CAPN</a> +34.9%&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24RPTP&amp;src=ctag\">$RPTP</a> +12.1%&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BIIB&amp;src=ctag\">$BIIB</a> +5.4%&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SUNE&amp;src=ctag\">$SUNE</a> +4.9%&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TEX&amp;src=ctag\">$TEX</a> +3.2%&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BBBY&amp;src=ctag\">$BBBY</a> -2.9%&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AAPL&amp;src=ctag\">$AAPL</a> -3.1%&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FCAU&amp;src=ctag\">$FCAU</a> -5%&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BA&amp;src=ctag\">$BA</a> -6.7%&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24X&amp;src=ctag\">$X</a> -7.7%</p>&mdash; RANsquawk (@RANsquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RANsquawk/status/692351571607298048\">January 27, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Note Apple is quoted as falling more than 3%.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56a8ce3ae4b00acfaea29c4e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-27T14:11:08.536Z\">2.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Oil has come back from its worst levels of the day, on renewed hopes that Opec and other producers such as Russia would act to stem the supply glut which has hit prices.</strong></p> <p>Brent crude is now down 0.8% at $31.52 a barrel having fallen to $30.83 earlier.

                "bodyText":"And finally.... Wall Street has ended the night on the back foot, after being underwhelmed by the Federal Reserve. The Dow Jones shed 222 points, or almost 1.4%, to close at 15,944.46. The S&amp;P 500 index, which covers a wider range of companies, lost over 1% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq slid by over 2%. Investors have noted the Fed\u2019s dovish stance, and recognised that the central bank is anxious about the global economy and the market turmoil. But policymakers still see the US economy recovering, which could mean it still raises borrowing costs later this year.... Anyway, we\u2019ll back in the morning, London time, for more reaction. Good night, GW Facebook also posted some highly impressive mobile advertising revenue: Some late breaking news... Facebook appears to have smashed forecasts. The social network has posted earnings of 79 cents per share, compared to expectations of 68 cents. And Wall Street loves it, sending shares leaping in afterhours trading. David Zervos, Chief Market Strategist at Jefferies, is telling Bloomberg TV that the Fed\u2019s statement was quite comforting. But the markets are still being driven by fluctuations in the oil price, and fears over emerging markets, he adds. Zervos says: Markets are still bouncing around on oil, still bouncing around on China. So what could turn the markets around? Signs that the US economy is still doing well, and not entering recession. Our news story on the Fed decision is now live: Here\u2019s a flavour: The Federal Reserve is keeping a key interest rate unchanged while pledging to closely monitor developments in the global economy and financial markets. In December the central bank made the decision to raise rates for the first time since the recession. Stock markets have been turbulent across the world since the move, and all the US markets entered negative territory again after the announcement. The policymakers left their benchmark rate unchanged in a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. Until December, they had kept that rate at record lows. The Fed noted in its latest policy statement that economic growth has slowed since it raised rates from record lows: \u201cThe [Fed] is closely monitoring global economic and financial developments and is assessing their implications for the labor market and inflation, and for the balance of risks to the outlook.\u201d The changes in its statement signaled that the Fed could be prepared to slow future rate hikes if recent market turbulence and global weakness do not abate..... (click here for more). The selloff is picking up pace, with the Dow Jones industrial average now down over 1%. That\u2019s not all down to the Fed, though. Apple has shed 6% after last night\u2019s disappointing results showed that iPhone sales have slowed. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, also points out that the Fed is no longer willing to describe the risks to the outlook as \u201cbalanced\u201d (as covered here). He writes: As expected, the new statement acknowledged the apparent slowdown in activity growth in the fourth quarter. The growth of consumption and business investment is now described as \u201cmoderate\u201d whereas back in December it was described as \u201csolid\u201d. The slowdown in inventory investment also receives an explicit reference. At the same time, the Fed stressed that labourmarket conditions \u201cimproved further\u201d with \u201cstrong\u201d job gains. Ashworth reckons that economic data, and financial markets, may not improve in time to allow a rates to rise in March. But he still expects a string of hikes later in the year. Nevertheless, we still think that once the worst fears about China blow over and US economic growth rebounds, the Fed will end up raising interest rates more rapidly that expected in the second half of this year. We expect the fed funds rate to reach 1.50% to 1.75% by end-2016. The Fed is primarily worried about China, argues Worth Wray, chief economist at wealth management firm Evergreen GaveKal. One expert reckons the Fed\u2019s statement guarantees more market turbulence in the next six weeks: This month\u2019s Fed meeting was always going to be all about the statement, given the FOMC bit the bullet and raised borrowing costs for the first time since the crisis in December. The tone of the Fed\u2019s comments set the tone for the next few weeks -- and the statement is being taken as quite dovish. Chris Beauchamp, Senior Market Analyst at City trading firm IG, explains: Markets got the more dovish tone they were hoping for, with the Fed noting slowing economic growth and tipping its hat towards the idea that inflation won\u2019t rise towards 2% as fast as it thought in December. This doesn\u2019t mean a March move is out of the question, but the reference to global economic developments means that there will have to be plenty more improvement in the US economy before one is a definite possibility. With the risks to the economy no longer seen as \u2018balanced\u2019 this is a Fed committee drawing in its horns. It was never going to admit that December\u2019s move was a mistake, but today\u2019s statement acknowledges that it is not time to get carried away with rate hikes. Matthew Boesler of Bloomberg says the Fed is taking the recent stock market losses seriously, without panicking. Brett House, chief economist of US investment management firm Alignvest, reckons the Fed won\u2019t raise rates four times this year (as it had been expecting). Financial commentator Bobi Petrov reckons rates will remain on hold at the Fed\u2019s next meeting, in early March. The Fed also doesn\u2019t see inflation roaring away this year - hardly surprising, given the oil price tumble. Tonight\u2019s statement says: Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of the further declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further This is a useful tool, showing some of the changes to this month\u2019s statement: Note how jobs growth is now \u201cstrong\u201d after this month\u2019s blowout non-farm payroll report showed 292,000 new hirings in December. Stocks are falling on Wall Street as traders digest tonight\u2019s statement. Not immediately clear why - but investors may be concerned that the Fed has dropped that line about economic risks being balanced. There\u2019s a significant change between this statement and December\u2019s one. The Fed has dropped the line saying that the risks to economic activity and the labour market are \u201cbalanced\u201d. That suggests the Fed thinks the situation has become unbalanced.... You can read the statement online, here. The Fed is also sticking to its view that interest rates will only rise gradually, meaning borrowing costs will remain below the long-term average for some time. But it all depends on the data..... However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. The decision was unanimous -- all 10 members of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee agreed to leave borrowing costs unchanged. Again, that\u2019s not a surprise. The US central bank also reckons that the American economy is continuing to heal. The statement says: Household spending and business fixed investment have been increasing at moderate rates in recent months, and the housing sector has improved further; however, net exports have been soft and inventory investment slowed. A range of recent labor market indicators, including strong job gains, points to some additional decline in underutilization of labor resources The Federal Reserve says it is keeping a close eye on the global economy, and financial markets. In tonight\u2019s statement, is says: The Committee is closely monitoring global economic and financial developments and is assessing their implications for the labor market and inflation, and for the balance of risks to the outlook. That means the Fed is considering the impact on recent market turmoil, and the fall in the oil price, on the US economy and the path of inflation. In the least surprising news of 2016, the US central bank has left borrowing costs unchanged. The policy rate remains at 0.25% to 0.5%. OK, it\u2019s nearly time for the Federal Reserve to announce this month\u2019s monetary policy decision. Remember, it\u2019s all about the Fed\u2019s statement - Wall Street is certain that Janet Yellen isn\u2019t going to raise interest rates again..... Ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate setting meeting, and following a rise in the oil price, European shares have ended the day on a positive note. With hopes of co-operation between oil producers - notable Opec and Russia - to tackle the issue of oversupply, Brent crude has jumped 3.6% to $32.96. The rise comes despite a jump in US crude inventories. The closing scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 78.91 points or 1.33% higher at 5990.37 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.59% to 9880.82 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.54% to 4380.36 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.56% at 8741.0 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was an exception, dipping 0.4% to 18,848.03 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 34 points or 0.22% higher. Another reason for the day\u2019s strength in the oil price: Russia has said it discussed co-operation with Opec over crude prices. Reuters reports: Russia\u2019s energy ministry said possible coordination between Russia and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was discussed at a meeting with Russian oil companies on Wednesday. The ministry said the discussion was related to unfavourable oil prices. There is also talk of an emergency Opec meeting in February. Despite its share price fall, Apple is still top of the pile in value terms: Markets are moving higher on the back of the improvement in the oil price. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct said: The threat of the early sell-off for oil prices this morning failed to materialise with crude bouncing above the $30 mark and this has in turn lent a raft of support to equity markets on both sides of the Atlantic. Even what could at best be described as a mixed bag in terms of US oil inventory data has failed to knock sentiment so London\u2019s FTSE-100 is rounding off the day \u2013 where we tested highs not seen for two weeks \u2013 with a bullish tone. Next up however it\u2019s the latest Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting and anything that is interpreted as being overly hawkish here could readily unseat equity markets globally that are still clearly rattled by recent events. Elsewhere, US crude stocks rose to their highest level on record - ie back to 1930 - last week while gasoline stocks increased but inventories of distillates fell. The figure for distillates, which include heating oil, follows the cold front hitting the country in the past few days. Distillate inventories fell by 4.1m barrels compared to expectations of a near 2m fall. But crude stocks climbed by 8.4m barrels last week, well above expectations of a 3.3m increase, to 494.9m, the highest level since the Energy Information Administration began compiling records. Refinery crude runs fell by 551,000 barrels a day. Gasoline stocks climbed by 3.5m barrels compared to forecsats of a 1.5m increase. But despite the rises, Brent crude is up 0.79% at $32.05 a barrel. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: US crude oil inventories rose by the highest level since April 2015 last week, pushing overall oil in storage to near levels not seen in 80 years for this time of year. Crucially, we did see domestic production fall ever so slightly. This distinction highlights the reaction in global trade, which has seen oil prices rise off the back of seemingly bearish headline data. With sentiment driven by record output from Iraq and Russia, alongside the entry of Iran on the mainstream oil market, any news that US output is starting to turn lower is certainly welcome for oil bulls. Here\u2019s our take on the libor verdicts: Five of the six brokers were acquitted of conspiring to rig Libor, reports Reuters. The jury also reached a not guilty verdict on one count of conspiracy to defraud for former Icap broker Darrell Read, said Reuters, but it has yet to reach a verdict on a second count. The judge has asked the jury to reach a majority verdict. The six brokers on trial were Darrell Read, Danny Wilkinson and Colin Goodman from Icap, Noel Cryan from Tullett Prebon, and Jim Gilmour and Terry Farr from RP Martin. Five out of six brokers accused of manipulating libor bank rates have been acquitted of fraud at Southwark crown court. A jury is still discussing one count against one of them, but the others have been freed. The six were accused of conspiring with Tom Hayes and others in a trial brought by the Serious Fraud Office which has lasted 15 weeks. But a jury took just a day to acquit them. The Federal Reserve is holding its first meeting since December\u2019s now-contentious decision to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. The subsequent market turmoil, focused on a slowdown in China and the tumbling oil price, has made many wonder whether the Fed was a bit premature in pulling the rate trigger. The Fed is highly unlikely to change rates at this meeting, and there is no press conference for Fed chair Janet Yellen to be quizzed about her thoughts on the aftermath of last month\u2019s move. So the statement accompanying the rate decision is likely to be scrutinised for clues as to the Fed\u2019s latest thinking. It must surely acknowledge the market slump and fears of a global downturn which have increased since December, and may even hint that it no longer expects three or four more rate rises this year. The wording of its comments on the current state of the global economy will be key, but analysts are divided on what the Fed\u2019s tone will be. Simon Smith, chief economist at FXPro said: All eyes will be back on the Federal Reserve today as they make their first interest rate decision and monetary policy statement of the year but there are no economic projections or press conference this time round, which come at the next meeting in March. We\u2019ve seen a rise in risk appetite in this final week of January which so far has been a bit of a blood bath, although the recovery from lows in many indices has softened the blow for many investors. This has come as a result of a bounce in oil prices but also a growing expectation that central banks will have to do more to support the global economy. Today\u2019s Fed meeting as a result is likely to see a more dovish tone to it, especially since the market consensus is that we will see fewer rate hikes this year than the Fed is currently pencilling in. Even though we saw a higher than expected rise in US consumer confidence yesterday a big warning shot has come from one of the world\u2019s largest companies Apple which saw its first fall in revenue since 2003. But lya Spivak, currency strategist at DailyFX, said: The rate-setting FOMC committee is broadly expected to keep the benchmark lending rate unchanged this time around. Indeed, priced-in probability of an increase is a mere 14.3%. This puts the spotlight on the text of the statement accompanying the rate decision and the forward guidance contained therein. Investors appear positioned for a dovish outcome having scaled back 2016 tightening bets amid risk aversion since the beginning of the year... For its part, the Fed will have to attempt a difficult balancing act. On one hand, it will have to acknowledge recent market turmoil as well as softening US growth dynamics in the final months of 2015. On the other, it will have to re-focus investors\u2019 attention on mandate-relevant fundamentals and establish the possibility of tightening in March. This is necessary so that such a move, if deemed appropriate, does not trigger an overly violent response. On balance, the case for policy normalization remains compelling. Realized and expected inflation is firming: the latest readings on core year-on-year CPI and hourly earnings growth registered at multi-year highs while 2-3 year breakeven rates have trended upward since August. On the jobs front, the unemployment rate is at the lowest level since 2008 and nonfarm payrolls growth is running at a reasonably brisk pace, with the 12-month trend average at 220k. This means that the Fed statement will have to reassure investors that it will adjust policy if market stress infects the real economy. In the same breath, it will have to explain that as of now, the projected rate hike path has not materially changed since the first post-QE rate hike in December. The markets\u2019 subsequent reaction will depend on the degree of wishful thinking that traders are prepared to entertain. If they emphasize the first point \u2013 a possible result considering the dovish shift in expectations in spite of the aforementioned fundamental evidence \u2013 risk appetite is likely to strengthen. This will see the stocks rising alongside sentiment-geared currencies like the Australian and New Zealand Dollars while the greenback as well as the anti-risk Euro and Yen decline. A focus on the second point will probably deliver the opposite result. As investors await the latest US oil inventory figures and the outcome of this month\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting, Wall Street is on the slide again. In early trading the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen 113 points or 0.7%, partly due to Apple which is down 3.8% at $96.24 following its disappointing figures. Ahead of the start of US trading, here are some opening calls: Note Apple is quoted as falling more than 3%. Oil has come back from its worst levels of the day, on renewed hopes that Opec and other producers such as Russia would act to stem the supply glut which has hit prices. Brent crude is now down 0.8% at $31.52 a barrel having fallen to $30.83 earlier. But US inventory figures due later will undoubtedly have an impact on the price, not to mention the Federal Reserve rate setting meeting and any effect the US central bank\u2019s comments have on the dollar. Meanwhile the recovery in crude has helped support stock markets. Both the FTSE 100 and Germany\u2019s Dax are marginally in positive territory after earlier falls, while France\u2019s Cac is only narrowly down. US futures are showing a 57 point decline on the Dow Jones Industrial Average after Tuesday\u2019s 282 point surge. Apple\u2019s shares will of course be in focus after its disappointing update. Ben van Beurden is upbeat about today\u2019s vote, despite the small revolt. Shell\u2019s CEO says: \u201cI am delighted with the positive shareholder vote and the confidence that shareholders have shown in the strategic logic of the combination of Shell and BG. Our immediate focus is on the successful completion of the transaction and we now await the results of tomorrow\u2019s BG shareholder vote. Assuming BG\u2019s shareholders approve the deal (they will), Shell will become the world\u2019s biggest liquefied natural gas (LNG) trader. It\u2019s worth reiterating that 17% of Shell shareholders opposed the BG merger at today\u2019s vote. That suggests that some big City investors have reservations about the deal, despite Shell chief Ben van Beurden\u2019s best efforts to persuade them of its merits. Standard Life was the only large investor to go public - their head of equities, David Cumming, reckoned the deal only made sense when oil was over $60 per barrel, not $30ish. But Standard Life owned less than 2% of the company, so others have clearly found the deal too risky. Our financial editor, Nils Pratley, reminds me that even Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s disastrous merger with ABN Amro in October 2007 got the support of 99% of shareholders (who then suffered huge losses). So a 17% revolt may sting, a little. Thousands of workers at Shell and BG now face the axe, once the merger goes through. Shell announced last month that it will cut around 2,800 positions, or some 3% of the combined company. Newsflash from The Hague - Royal Dutch Shell shareholders have just voted in favour of its \u00a335bn merger with rival oil firm BG. That\u2019s despite pressure from some shareholders to renegotiate the tie-up, which was negotiated before the oil price slumped to just $30 per barrel. During the meeting, Shell chief executive Ben van Beurden told the meeting that the deal would be a \u201cspringboard to simplify Shell\u201d, the Evening Standard reports. Van Beurden also argued that a merger still made sense despite the cheaper oil price. The deal was approved by 83% of shareholders, with 17% opposing the plan. BG investors give their verdict tomorrow, but there\u2019s little chance that they will block the deal. RBS is helping to drag the London stock market down into the red today. As traders scoff a quick sandwich (or three courses at Gaucho), the FTSE 100 is down 22 points at 5888. RBS are the second biggest faller, down 3.8% at 251p. The only biggest faller is Anglo American, the mining company, which has shed 5.2%. Other miners are also in the red, reflecting ongoing concerns over global growth. Other European markets are also in the red, as investors wait to hear from the US Federal Reserve at 7pm GMT (when it will surely leave interest rates unchanged). Here\u2019s more reaction to RBS\u2019s latest financial woes, via Press Association: Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: \u201cIt\u2019s another bitter pill, but putting legacy issues behind it is essential if Chancellor George Osborne is going to off-load the Government\u2019s stake during this parliament.\u201d But banking analyst Gary Greenwood, at Shore Capital, said that, while \u201cdisappointing\u201d, the latest financial charges are not unexpected. Over in America, traders are expecting Apple\u2019s share price to slide after it warned that revenue will fall this quarter, for the first time in 13 years. RBS isn\u2019t the only bank counting the cost of the PPI scandal today. Santander, the Spanish financial giant, has announced it is setting aside another \u00a3450m to cover compensation to customers who were missold Payment Protection Insuranace. The move will dent profits at Santander UK. It could be the bank\u2019s final bill for the scandal, but we won\u2019t know for sure until the deadline for PPI claims in 2018. A wave of \u2018challenger banks\u2019 have sprung up since the financial crisis, hoping to win business from scandal-splattered big players such as Royal Bank of Scotland. And one of them, Metro Bank, has announced plans to float on the stock market. Metro, which is losing around \u00a310m per quarter, wants to raise \u00a3500m from shareholders. Random fact: Metro encourages dogs into its branches, and even lays on water bowls and doggie toys. If only bankers had spent more time doing that before the crisis, instead of churning out toxic debt and lumbering customers with PPI contracts.... The British public had better face the truth - we\u2019ll all be shareholders in the banks for a while longer yet. So argues Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at City firm IG. He told clients: RBS\u2019s ability to surprise investors with fresh bad news has been one of the hardy perennials of the past six years, and yet still the news keeps coming. George Osborne\u2019s decision to sell a chunk of the government\u2019s stake last August, which was derided at the time, now looks like a sound financial decision, but it does mean any further sales are essentially off the table. Coincidentally, with Lloyds down 2% this morning in sympathy, it seems the government will remain a key asset manager when it comes to UK banks. If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s Jill Treanor\u2019s news story about the latest problems at RBS: RBS takes \u00a32.5bn hit to profits as chief executive announces bank \u2018clean-up\u2019 Royal Bank of Scotland is set to report its eighth consecutive year of full-year losses after announcing a string of charges for legal bills, compensation and a pension payment. The bank, which is more than 70%-owned by the taxpayer, said it would take a \u00a32.5bn hit to profits in 2015 as a result of a clean-up exercise, driving its share price to a three-year low in Wednesday\u2019s early trading. RBS shares fell 5% to 246p \u2013 below the 330p at which George Osborne sold off the the government\u2019s first tranche of shares in August, and less than half the 502p average price at which taxpayers pumped \u00a345bn into the bank. Issuing an unscheduled trading update on Wednesday, Ross McEwan, the chief executive of RBS, said the move was part of a continued clean-up but conceded that that the bank would make another full-year loss for 2015. It has not reported a profit since 2007. \u201cI am determined to put the issues of the past behind us, and make sure RBS is a stronger, safer bank. We will now continue to move further and faster in 2016 to clean up the bank and improve our core businesses,\u201d said McEwan. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been open about the scale of past issues facing RBS and although there is clearly much more to do, this announcement is a further step towards addressing legacy issues and building a great bank for our customers and delivering long-term value for our shareholders,\u201d he added..... Here\u2019s Jill\u2019s full story: The latest problems at RBS show that bankers need keeping on a tight leash, argues campaigners for a financial transaction tax. David Hillman, spokesperson for the Robin Hood Tax campaign, says: \u201cIt\u2019s groundhog day in the City as RBS announces yet another huge provision for dodgy dealing and fleecing its customers. \u201cTry as it might, the banking sector is incapable of shaking off its past sins. The government must take note \u2014 now is not the time for it to ease up on financial sector reform.\u201d There are signs that Britain is taking a softer line with the City. An inquiry into banking culture was curiously abandoned at the end of last year, alarming campaigners. And yesterday, Bank of England deputy governor Andrew Bailey was appointed as head of the Financial Conduct Authority - and hand-picked by George Osborne for this crucial job. Citigroup analysts have warned that RBS could suffer even more legal charges this year, points out the BBC\u2019s Kamal Ahmed: \u201cWe still see significant additional litigation charges in 2016, on top of the charges that have been announced today. A quick explanation. When RBS says it is setting aside \u00a31.5bn to cover \u201cvarious US residential mortgage-backed securities (\u201cRMBS\u201d) litigation claims\u201d, it is referring to one of the more noxious elements of the 2007-08 financial crisis. In the build-up to the crisis, milions of mortgages were sold to US citizens with shaky credit histories, who could not really afford them. Those loans were repackaged by investment banks into new financial products (the RMBSs) and sold onto investors who weren\u2019t told how dangerous they might be. Cue the credit crunch, and the collapse of the subprime market. Mortgage-backed securities plunged in value, as the borrowers behind them failed to meet their payments and handed back the key to their homes. And the smaller banks, credit unions, insurers and suchlike who had been left holding them when the music stopped (and the Big Short paid out) launched waves of legal action against Wall Street. RBS had a finger in this unsavoury pie though its US subsidiary, Greenwich Capital Markets. In 2013, the SEC accused it of \u201cmisleading investors\u201d and cutting corners, by selling loans that didn\u2019t meet underwriting guidelines. Important point: The \u00a31.5bn in new US legal charges announced by RBS this morning does not cover any potential settlements with the US Department of Justice, or various US State Attorney General investigations. Ian Gordon of Investec warns that: The timing and the cost of resolving those cases remains highly uncertain. City analysts are punting out their opinions now. And Sandy Chen of Cenkos Securities isn\u2019t too alarmed by RBS\u2019s announcement. He argues that the bank is simply cleaning up the mess of previous eras (or possibly \u2018previous errors\u2019). The new \u00a31.5bn provision against US mortgage-backed security costs brings the total bill to \u00a33.8bn - \u201ccloser to the \u00a34-6bn totals that most analysts have had in mind\u201d, Chen says. And the \u00a3500m payment protection insurance top-up should be one of the last big ones, given the FCA\u2019s consultation on a 2018/19 time-bar on PPI claims, Chen adds. His conclusion: Bad news \u2013 really? More like putting their past in their behind, as Pumba said (in the Lion King). [I think Pumba actually says \u201cyou got to put your behind in your past.\u201d -- but we get the gist] The UK government currently owns almost 73% of RBS, and at today\u2019s share price I fear we\u2019re stuck with it for some time. The taxpayer paid around 502p per share when it bailed the stricken bank out in 2008. Today, RBS shares are trading at just 250p, so we would take a stonking loss if George Osborne sells another slice of the bank. Last summer, he sold \u00a32.1bn of stock at around 320p - crystallising a \u00a31bn loss for the taxpayer. That deal was criticised, but with hindsight the hedge funds who bought the stock are now sitting on a loss themselves. RSB shares have just hit their lowest level since September 2012, I reckon. That\u2019s not good news for George Osborne, as he tried to sell the bank back to the private sector. Shares in Royal Bank of Scotland have slumped by 5% at the start of trading, shedding 12.1p to 248p. That makes RBS is the biggest faller on the FTSE 100. Bad news for shareholders - which in RBS\u2019s case is every member of the UK public, as we bailed the bank out in 2008. Q: When did RBS last make a profit, asks Jill Treanor. CEO Ross McEwan sucks through his teeth and takes a stab at 2007 -- the year before Lehman Brothers failed. We told you that 2015 and 2016 was about tidying up these legacy issues, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing, McEwan adds. Q: How much has RBS paid out on PPI? The total bill is around \u00a34.3bn, says McEwan. Q: Do today\u2019s provisions mean RBS will declare a loss for 2015? Yes, McEwan replies. Some of these charges will hit the bottom line (not the pension changes, though) My colleague Jill Treanor asks whether today\u2019s \u00a3500m PPI provision is finally the end of the saga. We\u2019ve done the best we can, based on what we know today, to estimate what the final provision will be, McEwan replies. We think it is hopefully the end. People have until spring 2018 to file PPI claims. McEwan says PPI has been a long and torturous journey for many banks, and a reminder of how to treat consumers (or how not to mistreat them). RBS is briefing the media now, on a conference call. Chief Financial Officer Ewen Stevenson is telling reporters that \u201cunderneath it all we\u2019ve got a strong core bank\u201d. Will it ever end, wonder City journalists.... Is Ross McEwan is cleaning up RBS ahead of a sale, wonders the BBC\u2019s Kamal Ahmed. RBS has also told the City that it is putting \u00a34.2bn into its pension scheme, to cover an accounting deficit of \u00a33.3 billion. That\u2019s mainly an accelerated payment of existing committed future contributions. It follows changes in accounting practice, which have made RBS rethink whether or not it has an unconditional right to a refund of any surpluses in its employee pension funds. Royal Bank of Scotland has stunned the City with a fresh wave of provisions to cover bad behaviour and legal bills. In an unscheduled announcement, RBS announced a series of new charges. In a nutshell: The bank is setting aside $2.2 billion, or \u00a31.5bn, to cover litigation claims in the US relating to various residential mortgage-backed securities. That\u2019s a legacy of the subprime crisis. It is also setting aside an extra \u00a3500m to cover Payment Protection Insurance (\u201cPPI\u201d) claims. That\u2019s the long-running mis-selling scandal in which millions of consumers were sold insurance they didn\u2019t need (or even ask for, in some cases). RBS taking a goodwill impairment charge of \u00a3498m against its Private Banking business. More than seven years after being rescued by the taxpayer, RBS is still a work in progress..... CEO Ross McEwan insists that he is cleaning up the mess of the past: \u201cI am determined to put the issues of the past behind us and make sure RBS is a stronger, safer bank. We will now continue to move further and faster in 2016 to clean-up the bank and improve our core businesses. We\u2019ve always been open about the scale of past issues facing RBS and although there is clearly much more to do, this announcement is a further step towards addressing legacy issues and building a great bank for our customers and delivering long term value for our shareholders.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets the eurozone, and business. Two things dominate today -- the turmoil in the stock markets, and the first US Federal Reserve interest rate decision of 2016. Traders can\u2019t take their eye off the oil price, which is lurching around the $30 per dollar mark this week. Brent crude is currently trading around $31.42 per barrel, helped by rumours that Russia and Saudi Arabia might carve up some kind of deal to cut production. It\u2019s all a bit flaky, though. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: The symbiotic relationship between equity markets and oil prices continued yesterday as after a rocky start to trading saw a slide in oil prices below $30 drag equity markets lower, the lack of follow through saw a semblance of stability return and a sharp recovery back above the $30 level on vague chatter that senior OPEC officials were looking to open a dialogue and put together some form of deal with Russia in an effort to put a floor under prices. European markets are likely to be calm this morning, as investors await new from America\u2019s central bank. At 7pm GMT tonight, the Federal Reserve announces its decision on monetary policy. It will surely (surely!) leave interest rates unchanged, having made the first symbolic post-crisis hike last month. The Fed\u2019s statement will be scrutinised for its view on the global economy, and any signs of \u2018hikers\u2019 remorse\u2019, given the turmoil in the markets in recent weeks. Lots of companies reporting results today, although the biggie - Facebook - comes at 9pm GMT. The City will also be digesting Apple\u2019s results last night, which showed that the iPhone boom may finally be over: We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

                "bodyText":"It\u2019s been an awfully busy day, so let\u2019s wrap up with a reminder of the key points (with links to the appropriate news stories) The government has slammed the brakes on its plan to sell its stake in Lloyds Banking Group to the public. Chancellor George Osborne said it would have been \u201cfrankly quite irresponsible\u201d to press on with the sale when Lloyds shares are just 64p, compared to a break-even price of 74p. City analysts say Osborne made the right decision, but political opponents have claimed he was reckless in pushing for the sale at all. The UK economy has posted its weakest annual growth in three years. New GDP figures showed that the economy expanded by 1.9% year-on-year in the last three months of 2015. On a quarterly basis, GDP rose by 0.5%. City regulators have reopened investigations into the senior managers who ran HBOS, before its collapse in 2007. The probe could lead to former HBOS being banned from the City for mismanaging the bank, which was rescued by Lloyds - triggering a taxpayer-led bailout (and leaving George Osborne with a lot of shares to sell) The EC has proposed new rules to prevent multinational companies gaming the system and avoiding paying a fair rate of tax. Announcing the move, commissioners Pierre Moscovici vowed to \u2018name and shame\u2019 those who didn\u2019t play by the rules, but denied planning to impose a flat rate of corporation tax across the EU. He also confirmed the EU could investigate the UK\u2019s new tax deal with Google. And it\u2019s been another volatile day in the markets. Oil soared, then subsided, when rumours of OPEC supply cuts were denied. Traders were cautious, after the US Federal Reserve said last night it was watching the global economic and financial system closely. The FTSE 100 shed 1%, or 58 points, to close at 5931. And there were bigger losses across Europe, on concerns that global economic problems is hurting Europe\u2019s recovery. Conner Campbell of Spreadex has the details: The UK index has flailed about for much of the day, only just recovering from its lunch-time losses to start the US session flat. The Eurozone was a whole different story; plunging nearly 1.5% the DAX got a taste of the dramatic today, struggling in the face of Germany\u2019s weak inflation and import prices figures. This helped drag the CAC with it, though the French index was slightly less hysterical, tumbling around 35 points as the day wore on. And that is all for today. Thanks, and goodnight. GW There\u2019s also speculation that Lloyds could be planning to set even more money aside to cover Payment Protection Insurance compensation. The chancellor might want to keep the share sale off the table, until the PPI scandal is off the agenda again. Raul Sinha, banking analyst at JPMorgan Chase said: \u201cWe are estimating that Lloyds will take \u00a33bn of PPI provisions up to 2018 and the market fears that they might decide to take some of that now.\u201d Yesterday, Royal Bank of Scotland announced another \u00a3500m to cover PPI claims, while Santander put aside \u00a3450m. PPI has already cost Lloyds an eye-watering \u00a314bn, making it the biggest culprit. Susan Kramer, Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman, has criticised the chancellor for his eagerness to sell the government\u2019s remaining stake in Lloyds: She said (via the Financial Times): \u201cGeorge Osborne\u2019s dash to sell off the public\u2019s stake in Lloyds as soon as possible was already a bad idea. \u201cIt is worrying that it has taken a major collapse in global economic confidence to finally make him see sense.\u201d More volatility in the markets! Shares are diving on both sides of the Atlantic, as OPEC members rubbish today\u2019s rumour of production cuts. The FTSE 100 index of blue chip shares listed in London has now shed 97 points, or 1.6%, to 5892. Not a great environment to be launching the Lloyds retail share offering. The German DAX has slumped by 2.4%. And on Wall Street, the Dow Jones is now in the red, extending yesterday\u2019s losses. The selloff also follows some disappointing US economic data, showing a big drop in durable goods production (that machinery and long-lasting goods). Capital Economics explains: The 5.1% m/m decline in durable goods was due primarily to a sharp decline in the notoriously volatile aircraft component. Nevertheless, the details suggest that equipment investment shrank in the fourth quarter. Can\u2019t argue with this tweet..... Our financial editor, Nils Pratley, agrees that Osborne couldn\u2019t have got away with selling Lloyds to the public on the cheap. But the chancellor should consider exactly why the bank\u2019s shares have fallen so much this year. He writes: Before Osborne spends too much time congratulating himself on his \u201cresponsible\u201d move, he should ask why Lloyds\u2019 share price has fallen by a quarter since last May\u2019s election. Yes, those pesky turbulent markets are a major contributor. But Lloyds \u2013 more than any other big UK bank \u2013 is also a proxy for the market\u2019s view of the health of the UK economy. Investors sense bigger problems for the chancellor than an embarrassing delay in a \u00a32bn share-sale. City firm IG reckons that the Lloyds share sale will be a success, eventually. IG analyst Chris Beauchamp reports that there\u2019s plenty of public interest in it: \u201cResearch conducted by IG shows there is significant public appetite for the Lloyds share offer, with 43% of the UK adult population being aware of the offer and 6% likely to apply. This is the equivalent of 2.4 million people, which exceeds the government\u2019s goal of engaging 2 million investors based on them investing \u00a31000. But who are those 2 million people? I\u2019d guess that many of them will be experienced investors, who aren\u2019t daunted by the City, and who also have a spare grand to invest. Speaking of the markets... the oil price is suddenly surging. Brent crude has leapt 8% to $35 per barrel, a remarkable move, following reports that Russia and Saudi Arabia might agree a 5% production cut. However, there\u2019s nothing official yet.... Is Osborne justified in blaming \u2018market turbulence\u2019 for scuppering the Lloyd sale (at least temporarily)? I think so. The FTSE 100 has fallen by around 7% since last October, but bank shares have suffered a steeper decline - as this chart shows. And other global markets have seen bigger losses. German\u2019s DAX index has lost almost 9% since the start of this year, a period in which Japan\u2019s Nikkei is down 10%. Economic problems in China, the oil price rout, and fears of a global slowdown and rising deflation have all spooked investors this year. There\u2019s little prospect of Lloyds share price surging from 63p to the 74p break-even point anytime soon. Pausing the Lloyds float is embarrassing for the government, but it does avoid the possibility of a failed privatisation. Russ Mould, investment director at stockbrokers AJ Bell, says a Lloyds flop could have undermined the zeal for Thatcherite privatisations. He says: \u201cOsborne will clearly be looking for a better deal for the Government, to maximise returns as best he can, and he won\u2019t want any issue that was aiming for substantial involvement from private investors to be a flop. That would damage already fragile sentiment and make it harder for any future privatisations to do well. It\u2019s more than two years since the government sold off Royal Mail, prompting claims that it had sold the firm off far too cheaply. Royal Mail shares are worth 450p today, around a third higher than the 330p float price, and peaked at over \u00a36. That\u2019s the problem with flotations. If shares slide, they were a rip-off. And if they surge, then the company was sold off too cheaply. George Osborne took his mind off the Lloyds sale suspension and the Google tax tow with a trip to Airbus\u2019s factory in Filton this morning. Looks like the chancellor enjoyed himself: Banking analyst Ian Gordon says George Osborne has made the right call given the circumstances. The Press Association has the details: Lloyds shares were to be offered to retail investors at a 5% discount to the market price, with a bonus share for every 10 shares held by the investors for more than a year. \u201cIf Osborne were to have gone ahead with the sale to retail investors ... this would have produced an effective price of sub 60 pence,\u201d said Investec analyst Ian Gordon. \u201cThat would be politically and economically impossible to justify. So I think that this (decision) is perfectly sensible.\u201d A Downing Street spokesperson has also blamed the current stock market volatility for the decision to postpone the Lloyds retail offering, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s important that any share sale delivers value for money and we have to take account of current market conditions.\u201d And the market conditions aren\u2019t great today. After a calm start, the FTSE 100 has now fallen by 30 points or 0.5% to 5958. Lloyds shares have dropped by 1.5% to 63.93p -- around 10p shy of the break-even level (as explained earlier). Lloyds Banking Group has issued a statement: \u201cThe Government has already been able to progressively reduce its stake in the Group from 43% to just 9% today, returning over \u00a316 billion to taxpayers at a profit. This reflects the hard work undertaken over the last four years to transform the Group into a simple, low-risk and customer-focused bank. The timing of any future retail sale is a matter for the Government. Our focus is on moving the Group forward so that it can continue to be profitable and deliver sustainable returns to all our shareholders.\u201d Sky News also ask George Osborne if he regrets calling the \u00a3130m Google tax deal a major success (when speaking to the Guardian at the World Economic Forum in Davos last Saturday). Osborne says that his only interest as chancellor of the exchequer is to get the best deal for Britain. Google used to pay no tax, now it is paying tax. And he cites his new diverted profits tax, which is aimed at large multinationals who artificially shift their profits offshore. I regard that as a major success, he adds. Clearly there is more to do, and the ultimate solution is to create more succesful UK companies. So he\u2019s still using the \u2018major success\u2019 line, but appears to be tweaking it to cover his general action on tax avoidance, not just the Google deal. Sky News just broadcast their interview with George Osborne. In it, he says it would be \u201cfrankly quite irresponsible\u201d to embark on a major share sale when the markets are so volatile. His aim is to get the best deal for the public and the country. Q: Is the sale of Royal Bank of Scotland shares also going to be postponed? Osborne says he will continue, when it\u2019s right, to sell RBS shares to the market. \u201cMy interest is a bank that works for the British people, that\u2019s out there lending to businesses, but also ensuring that over time we do get out of that bank. We will continue to make sales to the market. Britain currently owns around 70% of Royal Bank of Scotland, whose share price is around half the break-even price of 500p. The government is aiming to sell shares to City institutions, rather than to the public. Hundreds of thousands of small investors will be disappointed by the postponement of the Lloyds shares sale, says Laith Khalaf of Hargreaves Lansdown. He points out that Osborne had promised to sell the shares at a 5% discount to the market price, so he must now hope for a recovery in markets later in the year. Market volatility in recent months has seen UK stock market values fall by around 20% since the April 2015 high, so its understandable that the share sale is being delayed. The government are committed to returning the Bank to private hands and within that had previously pledged to offer at least \u00a32 billion as a retail offering. Therefore we expect this share sale to proceed at some stage but the timescales are unknown. Sky News\u2019s Ed Conway smells a rat with the timing of the Lloyds news: For anyone just tuning in, here\u2019s our news story on the Lloyds share sale suspension: George Osborne has postponed the sale of the last taxpayer-owned tranche of Lloyds Bank shares this spring, blaming \u201cmarket turbulence\u201d. The chancellor pledged in last year\u2019s election manifesto to sell the remaining stake in the bank \u2013 just under 10% of the company \u2013 to the public this spring. However, he told Sky News and other broadcasters that he has decided to delay the sale following the sharp selloff in stock markets in recent weeks. Several indices, including London\u2019s leading share index, entered bear market territory earlier this month, pressured by the slump in oil prices coupled with concerns about China and global economic slowdown. The FTSE has recovered this week but it global equity markets remain volatile. The Lloyds share price has dropped more than 10% below the price at which the government would make a profit from the share sale. Osborne told reporters that: I want to create a share-owning democracy. It\u2019s also my responsibility to ensure economic responsibility so with these turbulent financial markets now is not the right time to have that sale. \u201cWe will sell Lloyds to the British people but we will do so when the time is right.\u201d It is yet another U-turn on a manifesto pledge, following his change of heart over tax credit cuts in the autumn statement. By announcing the postponement today, George Osborne avoids breaking the bad news in March\u2019s budget. But this is still a blow to his plans, and probably means he\u2019ll need to borrow more money to balance the books. The chancellor has billed the sale as the \u201cbiggest privatisation for 20 years\u201d. He was planning to raise \u00a32bn through the retail offering to small shareholders that has now been halted. Osborne announced the sale at the Tory party conference last October, telling activists that: Next Spring, we will make Lloyds shares available to every member of the public. They\u2019ll be offered at a discount. Small shareholders will get priority, and long-term investors will get a bonus. You can register from today. It\u2019s the biggest privatisation for more than twenty years. And every penny we raise will be used to pay off our debts. So, with the Google tax row gathering pace, this is turning into a week to forget for the chancellor. Our financial editor, Nils Pratley, warned two weeks ago that the Lloyds share sale was in trouble. He wrote: Under the drip-feed programme [sales to City firms], which has reduced the state\u2019s stake to 9%, sales are prohibited below 73.6p, the break-even price. And, if the drip-feed programme is stalled, can Osborne really go ahead with his parallel idea to exit Lloyds with a flourish this spring by selling \u00a32bn worth of discounted shares to the public? Technically, he can. But it would be highly embarrassing, politically speaking, to sell Lloyds shares to private punters at a loss to the public purse. At today\u2019s share price, the government would swallow a chunky loss if it carried on with the Lloyds sale. The break-even point, above which Osborne could boast a profit, is 73.6p. Lloyds shares are changing hands this morning at 63.9p. They haven\u2019t been above 74p since New Year\u2019s Eve 2015, before global stock markets began 2016 with hefty falls. Osborne has confirmed that the sale of Lloyds shares is off: It\u2019s all go today! Back in the UK, the chancellor has just announced that he\u2019s putting the sale of Lloyds Banking Group shares to the public on hold. He blames market turbulence. Britain acquired a 43% shareholding in Lloyds following the collapse of HBOS (now being freshly probed, of course). Osborne has managed to whittle it down to 9% 14% , and had hoped to shift the rest to the public soon. But Lloyds shares have shed a quarter of their value in the last eight months, and clearly the sale is no longer \u2018a goer\u2019. Q: These proposals still allow companies to shift profits to other EU, or non-EU countries. Won\u2019t that simply lead to a race to the bottom, as member states cut their corporation tax bills. We don\u2019t want to impose corporation tax at the national level, Pierre Moscovici reiterates. But there are also fiscal rules, public services to fund, which means countries cannot afford a race to the bottom. Q: And will you impose more punitive measures, if we don\u2019t see the \u20ac50bn-\u20ac70bn lost to tax evasion flooding into EU coffers. That\u2019s an official estimate, but we won\u2019t use it as a benchmark of success, Moscovici says. Q: Which countries are helping multinational companies avoid paying fair tax? Switzerland, perhaps? I was at Davos last week, says Moscovici. I met the new Swiss minister for finance, and we agreed that the excellent co-operation that exists between the EC and Switzerland would continue. A recent EC-Swiss agreement means that the banking secrecy no longer exists, and will aid the exchange of information, Moscovici adds. He doesn\u2019t want to point a finger at any countries, but wants to create a new system to prevent aggressive tax avoidance and boost transparency. Q: Would these EC\u2019s new proposals on tax avoidance stop legal arrangements such as Google, where the UK operations are carried out by a separate company working for Google in Dublin, who is paid a fee, to ensure the UK operations make as small a profit as possible? Moscovici says he can\u2019t talk directly about the Google deal. however. There are some measures inside our proposed directive that can address the issue. Especially exit taxation, to prevent companies relocating assets purely to avoid taxation. Q: How does this deal relate to the UK\u2019s controversial deal with Google, under which the search giant will pay \u00a3130m in back taxes? Pierre Moscovici says they aren\u2019t directly linked. The commission could investigate the UK\u2019s deal with Google, and the broad principle is that: All companies must pay their fair share of taxes, where they pay their profits. That\u2019s why we have been active in preventing member states ability to offer sweetheart deals. The measures I am announcing today will tackle the most common loopholes in international law, Moscovici insists. It should have a major impact in tackling aggressive tax planning. Q: Won\u2019t these new rules penalise countries a long way from the centre of Europe, who might struggle to attract firms without an attractive corporation ? (Ireland, perhaps) Moscovici says the EC isn\u2019t planning to set tax rates across the region. It\u2019s talking about common rules. Pierre Moscovici is taking questions now Q: How confidence is the EC that member states will accept new rules on tax? Moscovici says he expect a lively debate with national governments. He doesn\u2019t think his new plan will be accepted 100%, but he has \u201cevery confidence\u201d that new rules to combat tax avoidance will be agreed. Over in Brussels, European commissioner Pierre Moscovici is announcing a new crackdown on multinational companies\u2019 tax avoidance. Moscovici, Commissioner for economic and financial affairs, taxation and customs, is telling reporters that tax avoidance is a \u201cglobal problem\u201d. But the EC is determined to crack down on companies who play the system and cut their tax bills. It is \u201ctoo easy for companies to escape taxation by shifting assets to tax havens\u201d, Moscovici says, vowing to \u201cname and shame\u201d companies who don\u2019t play fair. The Commission is also keen to rein in member states who offer unfairly low tax rates to encourage multinationals to base their HQs there. Today we take action to put states on an equal footing, by setting legally binding rules that they must all abide by.....Member states must all apply a minimum level protection against tax avoidance. And he concludes: The days are numbered for companies who avoid paying tax at the expense of others. City regulators certainly haven\u2019t been quick-off-the mark on the HBOS scandal. Yes, HBOS bosses could potentially be banned from the City, but it\u2019s eight years since the bank was rescued by Lloyds Banking Group, who then required a massive taxpayer bailout. The decision to start investigating HBOS\u2019s former top managers is a significant moment. Until now, only one HBOS banker - Peter Cummings -- has been banned, even through a parliamentary inquiry blamed \u201ccolossal failure of management\u201d for its failure. Breaking news: Britain\u2019s City watchdogs have announced they are starting a probe into some of the top managers at HBOS, the bank which collapsed during the financial crisis. This statement just landed in my inbox: The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) have decided to start investigations into certain former HBOS senior managers. These investigations will determine whether or not any prohibition proceedings should be commenced against them. The FCA and PRA continue to review materials with a view to making further decisions regarding other former HBOS senior managers. The move comes two months after an official report into the HBOS affair was finally published. It concluded that the decision to not investigate at least 10 former executives was \u201cmaterially flawed\u201d. That list included chairman Lord Stevenson and chief executives Andy Hornby and James Crosby. Potentially, the FCA and the PRA could decide to ban former HBOS top executives from working in the City..... The GDP report shows that Britain\u2019s economy has suffered from the slump in oil prices in the last year: Britain\u2019s growth was \u201crelatively lacklustre\u201d and \u201cworryingly lopsided\u201d, warns Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight, an analyst group. It was completely dependent on the services sector, which saw output growth pick up to 0.7% quarter-on-quarter from 0.6% in the third quarter. There was marginal contraction in construction output (0.1% quarter-on-quarter) and industrial production (down 0.2%). Services is the only part of the UK economy that is larger than before 2008, when the financial crisis began. Quick clarification. Today\u2019s report shows that GDP was 1.9% higher in Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2015 compared with the same quarter a year ago. During 2015, the economy grew by 2.2%. That\u2019s a slowdown, as the UK grew by 2.6% during 2014. The chancellor tweets: Britain\u2019s economy has now posted 12 quarters of growth, and is estimated to be 6.6% higher than the pre- economic downturn peak in Q1 2008. This chart highlights how Britain relies on the service sector for growth (it does make up around 80% of the economy) Britain economy continues to rely on services company for growth, while manufacturers failed to grow. The ONS reports that: The service sector grew by 0.7% in the last quarter agriculture grew by 0.6% But the production sector shrank by 0.2%, with manufacturing output flat Construction decreased by 0.1% Here\u2019s Reuters first take on the GDP figures (they\u2019ve been in a lock-in at the Office for National Statistics): Britain\u2019s economy ended 2015 on a soft note after the annual pace of growth slowed to its weakest in nearly three years as the global economic slowdown weighed on its previously rapid expansion. Fourth-quarter gross domestic product grew by 0.5%, up slightly from 0.4% in the three months to September, the Office for National Statistics said on Thursday, and in line with economists\u2019 forecasts. Output in the three months to December was 1.9% higher than a year earlier, down from 2.1% in the third quarter and the smallest increase since early 2013. The figures are likely to ease worries that Britain is facing a sharp economic slowdown, as domestic demand appears to have remained resilient. But they suggest that the robust growth of the past two years will not return until the world economy regains strength. Breaking! The UK economy grew by 0.5% in the final three months of 2015. That\u2019s up from 0.4% in the third quarter, and in line with expectations. But annual growth has slowed to 1.9% - the slowest in three years. More to follow.... Just 10 minutes to go until the GDP figures are released. Reminder: The City is expecting UK growth of 0.5% in the last quarter, with annual growth dipping to 1.9% Gross domestic product is a blunt tool for assessing a country\u2019s economy. Although it measures activity within an economy, GDP doesn\u2019t assess the actual value of that work. Burning down a rainforest and building a new railway are seen in the same way. And it doesn\u2019t measure inequality - whether the fruits of the economic success are shared fairly. This message has finally filtered through to the global elite at Davos last week, where IMF chief Christine Lagarde called for a shake-up. Lagarde told the World Economic Forum that: \u201cWe have to go back to GDP, the calculation of productivity, the value of things \u2013 in order to assess, and probably change, the way we look at the economy.\u201d Newsflash from Japan: the economy minister, Akira Amari, has announced his resignation. It follows allegations that he had received at least 12 million yen (about \u00a370,000) from a construction company, breaching political funding law. Amari, a key player in the stimulus programme spearheaded by prime minister Sinzo Abe, had denied wrong-doing. We\u2019ll be hearing from George Osborne shortly, flags up Sky News Faisal Islam. That may be a sign that today\u2019s growth figures is OK; the chancellor has a habit of being \u2018otherwise engaged\u2019 when there\u2019s bad news to discuss.... European markets are pretty calm this morning, as investors wait for the UK growth figures in 45 minutes time. The main indices are all up, a little, and oil is hovering around $33 per barrel. But Conner Campbell of SpreadEx warns that Britain\u2019s GDP report could spoil the mood: The upward movement from Brent Crude has caused a wave of green to overcome the UK index\u2019s crucial oil and mining stocks, in turn allowing the FTSE to flirt seriously with the 6000 mark for the first time in a fortnight. However, a major spanner in the works could be thrown in if the day\u2019s first look at the UK\u2019s fourth quarter GDP disappoints. Analysts are expecting 0.5%, marginally better than the 0.4% seen back in Q3; yet there is more than a chance that the figure might underperform, with the Chinese slowdown, Brexit fears AND those weaker than hoped for Christmas retail sales all swirling around to potentially take a point or two off the reading. Here\u2019s a round-up of today\u2019s other corporate news: Transport company FirstGroup warned profits would come in lower than expected. It blamed the recent wet weather and flooding in Britain and driver shortages in the US. Drinks giant Diageo, which makes Johnnie Walker scotch and Smirnoff vodka, reported a 1.8% rise in first-half sales. It took a hit from foreign exchange rates and the sale of assets, including its wine business. Sweden\u2019s H&amp;M has also been hit by the strong dollar, which drove up its purchasing costs (it buys most of its clothes in Asia in US dollars), and warned that big markdowns on winter wear will hurt its profit margins in the first quarter. Like rivals, the world\u2019s second-biggest fashion retailer pointed to the unusually warm weather in many part of Europe and north America, which put customers off buying winter clothes. Jimmy Choo had a good 2015, as Asian shoppers snapped up its luxury shoes. It said strong demand in Asia, especially Japan, had countered the loss of Russian visitors at its European stores and the impact of the Paris terrorist attacks. Retail net revenues grew by 9% at constant exchange rates to \u00a3208m, contributing to 7% growth in overall revenues to \u00a3318m. But the price cut does not even come close to the drop in wholesale gas prices, consumer experts point out. Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis, founder of www.cheapenergyclub.co.uk, said: Baaaah. SSE has bleated and followed Eon\u2019s price cut last week, the rest of the big six sheep will likely soon follow. And again it\u2019s just a trivial 5% on gas only not electricity, nothing close to the drop in wholesale prices. Energy firms must be whooping for joy that they can get away with such small cuts and have the energy minister praising them, albeit slightly. Yet the real picture here is that even after cuts the vast majority of households in the UK are massively overpaying for their energy. E.ON and SEE customers with typical usage on their standard tariffs will be paying at least \u00a31,050, after the cuts, and those from other firms even more. Yet the market\u2019s cheapest tariffs for switchers are around \u00a3770 a year on the same usage. And indeed both E.ON and SSE offer these for those who bother to switch.\u201d SSE, one of Britain\u2019s big six energy companies, will cut its domestic gas prices by an average of 5.3% \u2013 but not until after Easter. The company said: This latest reduction will save a typical household gas customer on our standard tariff \u00a332 a year compared with existing prices.\u201d The move, which takes effect on 29 March, comes a week after rival E.On reduced its gas prices by 5.1% from 1 February. SSE said it lost 300,000 customers in the first nine months of its financial year, as customers defected to smaller utility firms \u2013 part of a wider trend. Customer accounts dropped to 8.28m by 31 December. Even so, the company stuck to its full-year adjusted earnings per share target of 115p and said it would hike its dividend at least in line with retail price inflation. Some economists fear that UK growth slowed to just 0.3% in the last quarter, due to economic problems overseas and political uncertainty back home. Others predict a healthy pick-up in GDP. My colleague Katie Allen explains: Economists forecast that the figures will show growth of 0.5% in the final three months of 2015, slightly faster than growth of 0.4% in the previous quarter, according to the consensus in a Reuters poll. But with worries about China\u2019s downturn and the wider global economy clouding the outlook, there is significant uncertainty over the UK\u2019s performance. Individual economists\u2019 forecasts range from 0.3% to 0.6%. Weak retail sales figures for the key Christmas season There have also been warnings from businesses that the looming EU referendum is hurting confidence and forcing some firms to put investment plans on hold. With polls pointing to a tight vote, the pound has fallen sharply in recent weeks. Britain\u2019s place in the world.... Good morning. We\u2019re about to find out how well, or badly, Britain\u2019s economy fared in the last three months of 2015. Fresh GDP data for the October-December period is released at 9.30am. It will show how the UK performed during a time of growing worries about the global economy, and volatility in the markets. Economists predict that the UK economy expanded by around 0.5% during the quarter. That would be a small improvement on the 0.4% growth posted in July-September, and fairly unremarkable compared with long-term averages. But in the current climate, with China suffering a somewhat bumpy slowdown, any growth is better than nothing. The figures have global significance; Britain is the first major advance economy to report fourth-quarter GDP data. As we covered in last night\u2019s blog, the US central bank has said it\u2019s watching the global economy and the markets closely. And domestically, the data are another quarterly term card report for George Osborne, and his management of the economy. It\u2019s likely that service sector firms provided most of the growth, not the industrial sector that the chancellor hoped to reinvigorate. We\u2019ll be covering the build-up to the figures at 9.30am, and instant reaction and analysis once they are released.",

The BoJ said the move to negative interest rates was intended to support Japanese business confidence and to signal its determination to get inflation moving towards the target of 2%.</p> <p>The negative rate will only apply to reserves in addition to existing deposits and those the central bank requires banks to have with it. This is designed to cushion banks\u2019 earnings so that they do not become less willing to lend. The BoJ <a href=\"http://www.boj.or.jp/en/announcements/release_2016/k160129b.pdf\">said, in a question and answer document</a>, that interest rates and asset prices in financial markets would nevertheless be set on the basis of the negative rate.</p> <h2><strong>Will it work?</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s far from clear. Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, has argued his unconventional policies \u2013 including negative rates \u2013 have helped the eurozone economy to ward off deflation. In theory the policy sounds attractive, but it could have unintended consequences. For example, banks could choose to pass on to customers the costs they incur for depositing money with the central bank through fees, or depositors could decide to keep their money under the mattress instead of in a bank.</p> <p>A negative return on parking funds with the central bank might also encourage banks to invest in riskier assets to secure a return, potentially driving new asset bubbles and more pain further down the line.</p> <p>In search of alternative investments, banks are likely to increase their purchases of government bonds. However, this has potentially serious consequences if banks are holding bonds to such an extent that government borrowing costs are artificially low. If a financial shock occurs, the banks and governments could find themselves so intertwined that they drag each other \u2013 and the economy \u2013 down.</p> <h2>Has it happened before?</h2> <p>In announcing its move, the BoJ cited examples of European central banks adopting negative interest rates. The main example is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/05/european-central-bank-cuts-deposit-rates\">the ECB\u2019s decision to pay negative interest rates from June 2014</a> in an attempt to stop the eurozone falling into a deflationary spiral. </p> <p>Switzerland also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2014/dec/18/swiss-negative-interest-rates-fed-stock-markets-rouble-live\">adopted the measure last year</a> to deter investors from buying francs, making Swiss imports uncompetitive. </p> <p>Sweden and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/05/negative-interest-rates-european-central-bank\">Denmark have also introduced negative deposit rates</a> on a temporary basis in recent years.

                "bodyText":"The Bank of Japan (BoJ) has imposed negative interest rates on banks to encourage them to lend to businesses, instead of hoarding cash, to support the flagging economy and the country\u2019s battle to break free of deflation. The Japanese central bank\u2019s board shocked markets on Friday by imposing a 0.1% fee on deposits left with it to encourage lending amid increasing uncertainty over the state of the global economy. How do negative interest rates work? Instead of earning interest on money left with the BoJ, banks are charged to park their cash. The idea is that instead of depositing money with the central bank or each other, they lend it to businesses and consumers. Banks may also cut deposit rates paid to customers, encouraging them to spend or invest instead of earning low or negative returns. Japan has been plagued by deflation \u2013 falling prices \u2013 for two decades, deterring consumer spending and business investment in the expectation that goods will become cheaper. Negative interest rates are an example of \u201cunconventional\u201d monetary policy, which also includes quantitative easing \u2013 the buying of bonds from commercial banks by central banks, leaving them with excess cash. The BoJ said the move to negative interest rates was intended to support Japanese business confidence and to signal its determination to get inflation moving towards the target of 2%. The negative rate will only apply to reserves in addition to existing deposits and those the central bank requires banks to have with it. This is designed to cushion banks\u2019 earnings so that they do not become less willing to lend. The BoJ said, in a question and answer document, that interest rates and asset prices in financial markets would nevertheless be set on the basis of the negative rate. Will it work? It\u2019s far from clear. Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, has argued his unconventional policies \u2013 including negative rates \u2013 have helped the eurozone economy to ward off deflation. In theory the policy sounds attractive, but it could have unintended consequences. For example, banks could choose to pass on to customers the costs they incur for depositing money with the central bank through fees, or depositors could decide to keep their money under the mattress instead of in a bank. A negative return on parking funds with the central bank might also encourage banks to invest in riskier assets to secure a return, potentially driving new asset bubbles and more pain further down the line. In search of alternative investments, banks are likely to increase their purchases of government bonds. However, this has potentially serious consequences if banks are holding bonds to such an extent that government borrowing costs are artificially low. If a financial shock occurs, the banks and governments could find themselves so intertwined that they drag each other \u2013 and the economy \u2013 down. Has it happened before? In announcing its move, the BoJ cited examples of European central banks adopting negative interest rates. The main example is the ECB\u2019s decision to pay negative interest rates from June 2014 in an attempt to stop the eurozone falling into a deflationary spiral. Switzerland also adopted the measure last year to deter investors from buying francs, making Swiss imports uncompetitive. Sweden and Denmark have also introduced negative deposit rates on a temporary basis in recent years. In Denmark, the aim was to cap an unwanted rise in its currency, which was pushed higher when foreign money flooded into the country as investors looked for safety outside the crisis-ridden eurozone. The move to negative deposit rates did not cause financial meltdown, with the Danish central bank issuing plenty of advance warning. Nor did it lead to a noticeable change in the interest rates charged by banks for bank loans.",
