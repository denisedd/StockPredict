                "bodyText":"Saudi Aramco, the world\u2019s biggest oil producer, is studying plans to privatise some of its subsidiaries as well as offering shares in the main business. The news follows comments made by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Thursday that he supported the trillion-dollar company being prepared for an initial public offering (IPO). If the float goes ahead it will be the world\u2019s most valuable quoted company, dwarfing Apple, Exxon and Google. The moves have astonished the oil sector and led to speculation about whether a share float would change the Saudi strategy of driving down oil prices by refusing to cut back on production. Analysts believe the world\u2019s most valuable business will attract a lot of interest from potential investors, but warn that the Saudis could underestimate western concerns about Aramco\u2019s traditional secrecy and the impact of falling oil prices. A statement from the oil group said: \u201cSaudi Aramco confirms that it has been studying various options to allow broad public participation in its equity through the listing in the capital markets of an appropriate percentage of the company\u2019s shares and/or the listing of a bundle its downstream subsidiaries. \u201cThis proposal is consistent with the broad and progressive direction pursued by the Kingdom for reforms, including privatization in various sectors of the Saudi economy and deregulation of markets.\u2019\u2019 Prince Mohammed expected a review of the business, which has reserves of 260bn barrels and 60,000 staff, to be completed within months. Any float could take place after that. The Saudis have recently introduced a raft of changes to the economy, not least has been a decision to cut subsidies on domestic energy bills and a plan to introduce VAT taxes. Both are considered risky in a conservative country with such fragile democratic credentials. Jason Tuvey, a Middle East specialist at Capital Economics, said it was difficult to value Saudi Aramco and he had come across speculative figures ranging from $1tn to $10tn. Even the lower figure means Aramco is worth three times as much as Exxon Mobil, and a 5% stake of that would easily dwarf the $25bn raised by China\u2019s Alibaba group, whose $25bn float is the largest so far. Fadel Gheit, a veteran oil analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co brokerage in New York, questioned how easy it would be for the Saudis to pull off a significant flotation given Aramco was used to a very low level of transparency. And he pointed out that Prince Mohammed had raised another issue at Aramco that could concern any potential buyers: corruption. \u201cIf western investors are to be interested in Aramco they are going to want all sorts of details and reassurances about the way the company will be run, its growth prospects and dividend policies. Will the Saudi government be willing to provide these and relinquish control? \u201cThe company may have huge oil reserves but look at what happened when Petrobras (the Brazilian state oil group) was privatised. There was a total lack of understanding of free markets and the stock dived in value.\u201d",

                "bodyText":"The world\u2019s political and business leaders, plus the usual smattering of celebrities \u2013 including Leonardo DiCaprio \u2013 are heading to Davos, the Swiss Alpine resort where the World Economic Forum\u2019s annual conference begins on Tuesday evening. The ensuing four days of debate will focus on the following themes: The rise of the robots The relentless rise of automation and ever more intelligent machines will be a key issue at the WEF. The official theme of the 2016 meeting is \u201cmastering the fourth industrial revolution\u201d. That, in WEF-speak, means the \u201cfusion of technologies that is blurring the lines between the physical, digital and biological spheres\u201d. For some Davos attendees, this means business opportunities. Top executives such as Satya Nadella of Microsoft and Facebook\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg will debate how the new industrial revolution could improve industry and society. But Davos will also look at the threat to white collar jobs, asking if the changes are \u201cfailing the middle classes\u201d. Another question is whether we are heading towards \u201ca world without work\u201d \u2013 a serious issue given that some experts reckon one in two jobs could eventually be taken by intelligent automation. More than 7m jobs are at risk in the world\u2019s largest economies over the next five years, according to a WEF report published on Monday, with women losing out more than men as they are less likely to be working in areas where the adoption of new technology will create jobs. And if the daily trudge through icy Davos does not provide enough shivers, attendees will be told the implications of smart machines going to war. Sir Roger Carr, the chairman of defence giant BAE Systems, will discuss whether robots will become soldiers and generals, along with experts such as Prof Alan Winfield of the University of the West of England. Terrorism and the migration crisis World leaders and the heads of humanitarian agencies will debate how to address the growing migration crisis and better integrate refugees into the communities who shelter them. Queen Rania of Jordon will discuss the Middle East turmoil driving millions overseas, as desperate people continue to risk the winter cold and storms by crossing the Mediterranean. The leaders of Iraq and Tunisia are also attending. The EU foreign affairs chief, Federica Mogherini, and the French minister Emmanuel Macron are to consider whether Europe has been pushed to a tipping point by the crisis and discuss recent terrorist attacks. John Kerry, the US secretary of state, is giving a keynote speech. Last year, he delivered an electrifying talk on the need to tackle violent extremism and the \u201cmonsters\u201d of Islamic State. But it is not just talk. Delegates can choose to be jolted out of their comfortable existence by spending an hour experiencing a day in the life of a refugee. This has become a regular event at Davos, with some people being moved to tears by a taste of the trauma felt by displaced people. Some former refugees are also on hand to share their stories. Angela Merkel won\u2019t be signing up, though. With criticism over her refugee policies rising by the day, the chancellor is skipping this year\u2019s event. So Germany\u2019s president, Joachim Gauck, will be carrying the black, red and gold flag instead. Market turmoil The stock market rout of 2016 has already made a small dent in the large fortunes of the Davos elite. So there will be plenty of nervous chatter about whether we are heading into a new crash \u2013 and whether it can be fended off. The big worry, of course, is China, with its slowing economy and swelling credit levels. One of the Chinese government\u2019s top market regulators, Fang Xinghai, will update the global elite on wherethe economy is heading, alongside the IMF chief, Christine Lagarde. Jack Ma, the head of Chinese online retailer Alibaba, could also be in demand for his insights. With crude prices falling below $30 per barrel, the energy ministers of the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait will talk publicly about how Arab economies can reform to handle cheap oil. Argentina\u2019s new president, Mauricio Macri, is to discuss how emerging economies could suffer from the turmoil. Macri has just experienced his own painful shock; he is nursing a cracked rib after an incident playing with his daughter. No fewer than 10 central bank governors are descending on the ski resort, a chance to consider whether they will need to do more to help the global economy this year. Climate change The WEF hopes to build on the Paris climate deal, agreed in December, by examining how governments and businesses can work together to cut carbon emissions. Its annual risk survey found that failing to deal with and prepare for climate change is the biggest single threat facing the world economy. This is the first time in more than a decade that environmental issues have topped the list of worries. A string of top scientists will be providing technical expertise on how to tackle global warming and create cleaner energy. This includes the Solar Impulse team, which broke the world record for the longest solo flight in an un-refuelled vehicle last summer. DiCaprio will also be pushing for action; his foundation helps protect threatened ecosystems and funds projects to shield wildlife from the impact of climate change. Europe Turmoil in the Middle East and in the markets has pushed the eurozone debt problems down the agenda. But it still provides hope of a verbal punch-up, when the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, and the German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, discuss the future of Europe. Memories of last summer\u2019s crisis, where Tsipras was forced into a painful third bailout deal, are still fresh. Tsipras is also expected to meet with Lagarde. On the agenda: debt relief and pension reforms. The European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, will be giving his own assessment of the eurozone economy on Friday morning, fresh from a governing council meeting the day before. David Cameron is also attending; Davos could give him an opportunity to push for EU reform ahead of Britain\u2019s referendum on membership. But he could also have his ear bent by business leaders who fear a UK exit. Inequality This annual gathering of the global elite is a perfect opportunity to remind them about wealth inequality. Oxfam already got the ball rolling before some Davos attendees had even reached the ski resort, with a new report warning that wealth is becoming increasingly concentrated in the hands of a small group of billionaires. Save the Children will warn that the fourth industrial revolution risks deepening the gap between rich and poor. That is because automation can destroy job opportunities for those with few educational qualifications, hollowing out labour markets in the developing world. Medicine The US vice-president, Joe Biden, is heading to Davos to push his \u201cmoonshot\u201d initiative to find a cure for cancer. Biden, leading a heavyweight US delegation, will meet with top scientists, doctors and data researchers in an attempt to speed up the fight against the disease which claimed his son Beau in May 2015. Last week, Biden said \u201ccancer politics\u201d were holding back progress and called for more data sharing about patient information and treatment outcomes. Davos is an opportunity to push that message. Ebola will also be on the agenda. Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance is expected to announce an agreement with pharmaceuticals company Merck to help prepare for the next outbreak. Last summer, tests showed that Merck\u2019s experimental ebola vaccine was 100% effective in providing immunity to a disease that killed more than 11,000 people last year. But the world will always face new threats: Bill Gates is to lead a discussion on how to prepare for the next pandemic. Cybercrime and civil liberties Davos will see a clash between the authorities, which want closer control of our digital communications, and campaigners, who fear privacy is being eroded. The US attorney general, Loretta Lynch, and J\u00fcrgen Stock, the head of Interpol, will be pushing for closer partnerships with companies and new laws to catch cybercriminals across the globe. Salil Shetty, the secretary general of Amnesty International, is due to talk about how privacy and secrecy has changed in a world of digital communication and new terrorist threats.",

Although the headline index (which measures the combined output of manufacturing and service sector firms) fell to a three- month low, the latest reading was higher than the 2015 average and indicative of robust, although unspectacular, growth of the German economy. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e507955d92a8ad82a510c822a240aad25ab922e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e507955d92a8ad82a510c822a240aad25ab922e/0_0_693_415/500.jpg\" alt=\"German composite PMI\" width=\"500\" height=\"299\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">German composite PMI</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Markit</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-01-22T08:56:58.063Z\">at 8.56am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-56a1ebece4b0de2cb0bfbc36\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-22T08:45:04.157Z\">8.45am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Is France\u2019s next president at Davos today?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MxSba/statuses/690454429305278464\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Davos?src=hash\">#Davos</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/flacqua\">@flacqua</a> asks <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EmmanuelMacron\">@EmmanuelMacron</a> the big question on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BloombergTV\">@BloombergTV</a> : &quot;Would you consider running for president?&quot;.

Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A sharp rebound in crude oil as well as some warm words from ECB President Mario Draghi turned out to be the perfect ingredients to prompt a sharp snapback in equity markets yesterday after Wednesday\u2019s rout, and this rebound has spilled over into the Asia session with crude oil recovering above the $30 level. The big question now is whether this marks a medium term base, or just a minor relief rally before another leg lower. Given yesterday\u2019s rebound and the subsequent positive session in Asia there now remains the very real possibility that we could well finish the week in positive territory, and if that happens it would be a remarkable turnaround after Wednesday\u2019s carnage.</p> </blockquote> <p>The opening calls for Europe from IG show an upbeat start:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/statuses/690421720482762752\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Our European opening calls:&#10;&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTSE&amp;src=ctag\">$FTSE</a> 5821 up 47&#10;$DAX\u00a09671 up 97&#10;$CAC\u00a04246 up 39&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24IBEX&amp;src=ctag\">$IBEX</a> 8515 up 71&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MIB&amp;src=ctag\">$MIB</a> 18887 up 164</p>&mdash; IGSquawk (@IGSquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/status/690421720482762752\">January 22, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-01-22T07:45:46.390Z\">at 7.45am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-56a1d156e4b0de2cb0bfba25\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/graemewearden\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-22T07:23:28.684Z\">7.23am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Davos 2016: Draghi, Kerry, Macri to speak</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Good morning from Davos, where the third day of the World Economic Forum is getting underway.</strong></p> <p>There\u2019s a big focus on geopolitics today, with US secretary of state John Kerry giving a big keynote address.</p> <p>The migration crisis is also in focus, as Europe braces for another inflow of refugees from the turmoil in the Middle East.</p> <p>Overnight, France\u2019s prime minister, Manuel Valls, has warned that the crisis is destabilising Europe.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/22/french-pm-manuel-valls-says-refugee-crisis-is-destabilising-europe\">French PM Manuel Valls says refugee crisis is 'destabilising' Europe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But there\u2019s no escape from economic worries - European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi is due to address Davos shortly.</p> <p>Investors around the world will be watching closely; yesterday, Draghi hinted that the ECB could take fresh action in March.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Brenda_Kelly/statuses/690433101676335104\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">SuperMario due to speak at the World Economic Forum, in Davos at 7.45am</p>&mdash; Brenda Kelly (@Brenda_Kelly) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Brenda_Kelly/status/690433101676335104\">January 22, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, UK prime minister David Cameron and chancellor George Osborne will be going round Davos, trying to stir British businesses into supporting them in the EU referendum.</p> <p>And Argentina\u2019s president, Mauricio Macri, is in town.

                "bodyText":"This liveblog is creaking under the weight of another day of Davos, so here\u2019s a round-up of the main events. On Migration.... ECB chief Mario Draghi has said the refugee crisis can be good for the European economy, as long as there is determination and confidence. Secretary of State John Kerry has called for a 30% boost in aid spending, and insisted that countries can resettle refugees without endangering national security. David Miliband of International Rescue has said it\u2019s vital to distinguish between refugees and economic migrants, to stop the whole system collapsing On UK matters... Chancellor George Osborne has said Britain will not panic over the turbulence in the markets. Osborne also predicted that the Brexit debate will \u201cget interesting\u201d once voters learn the different options on the table. On gender equality Canadian PM Justin Trudeau has urged delegates not to be afraid to call themselves feminists. While Facebook\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg has warned that gender bias starts in the home, when children get their first pocket money for helping out. On the global economy.... Harvard professor Ken Rogoff said 2016 will be a rough year for emerging markets The head of the WTO has told us he\u2019s optimistic about making progress on trade liberalisation. Christine Lagarde has thrown her hat into the ring to remain as IMF chief for a second term. And in the markets.... Stocks have surged back, on hopes that policymakers will deliver more stimulus if needed to keep the world economy on track. And that may well be all for tonight..... If so, we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Guet Nacht! GW Global stock markets have bounced back at the end of a tumultuous week, as oil prices recovered and the European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, raised hopes of morefurther stimulus measures. It was a week that saw panic selling in global markets, pushing several of them, including London and Japan, into bear market territory, as oil prices tumbled to fresh 13-year lows below $28 a barrel. On Friday, however, European markets rebounded, following a heavy hint from Draghi that the ECB was ready to inject fresh stimulus into the eurozone at the March meeting \u2013 sooner than many investors expected. Here is how things look at Friday\u2019s close: The FTSE 100 index in London has rallied 2.2%, or 126 points, to 5900.01. It is still down 5.5% since the start of 2016. Germany\u2019s Dax is up 2.3%, France\u2019s CAC added 3.3% and Spain\u2019s Ibex added 3.5%. Brent crude is up 7.6%, or $2.24, at $31.48 per barrel. It started the year at $37.85. On Wall Street, stock markets have followed their European counterparts higher. The Dow Jones industrial average is up 0.8% at 16,005 and the S&amp;P 500 is up 1.4% at 1,895. Draghi\u2019s hints had kicked off a \u201cfull-on relief rally\u201d said Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets. He adds: \u201cGlobal stocks rebounded strongly on Friday, capping a massive two-day about turn that erased sharp declines early in the week. The rally was aided by a surging oil price and talk of stimulus from both the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan. The FTSE 100 has seen its first weekly gain this year. The gain is all the more impressive after Britain\u2019s main stock index fell into bear market territory with a 20% decline to the lowest levels since 2012 on Wednesday.\u201d Canadian PM Justin Trudeau is living up to his reputation as a 21st century leader (complete with a gender-balanced cabinet). Trudeau tells Davos that: \u201cLet\u2019s start rewarding politicians and companies who aren\u2019t driven by a macho approach.\u201d He also says feminism isn\u2019t anything to be afraid of: Melinda Gates has told the panel session that she always made sure there were science projects for her husband Bill to do with the children on Saturdays. Their two daughters have ended up interested in maths and science. Chinese businesswomen Zhang Xin, who set up property company SOHO with her husband, says she in favour of quotas to address gender balance. She tells Davos: \u201cI think quotas are an effective way of breaking old habits and bias.\u201d Sheryl Sandberg is less convinced, pointing out that Norway introduced 40% quotes for boardrooms but only 3.4% of companies are run by women. \u201cIt\u2019s not trickling down,\u201d she said. There\u2019s a toddler wage gap in the US, and different expectations between boys and girls, Sheryl Sandberg declares. Gender inequality starts that early, she believes, because: Little boys in home do fewer chores at home and get paid more. We assign our chores to our children in the United States so that the boys are taking out the trash, it takes less time than cleaning the dishes and they get higher allowances. So we start out with different expectations in our home, and the time spent on these different tasks is incredibly important, she adds. Melinda Gates says companies need to have proper family leave policies, not just maternity leave policies. Paternity leave is a way of distributing the burden, as men who take it will spend more time at home helping with the children and the household tasks. America is particularly poor, she adds - just two states have proper family leave policies. Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook started the session on gender parity with the same polling method that she started a session earlier in the week, asking women if they had been asked whether they should be working and if had been described as being too aggressive at work. She said that women were expected to nurturing roles in the office. The irony of the boss of recruitment agency Manpower being on the panel has not be lost on the BBC reporter Lyse Doucet who has tried to convince Jonas Prising to change the name. He appears to have rejected the idea - a brand in 80 countries for 70 years, he says. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s COO, says that the big problem with gender parity is the expectations of what is appropriate for woman. Culturally we are so different around the world, but there\u2019s a really deep cultural similarity, says Sandberg, namely: Men are expected to lead, to provide, to be decision makers. And women are expected to nurture. So women end up doing the \u2018housework\u2019 in the office, and almost all of the housework at home. And we also have an expectations that women won\u2019t lead, says Sandberg. She asks the men in the audience to put their hands up if they\u2019ve ever been told they\u2019ve been too aggressive at work. A couple of hands rise. Now for the women, put your hands up if you\u2019ve ever been told you were too aggressive at work.... and a lot of hands go up: Sandberg then asks \u201cMen, have you been asked whether you should be working?\u201d I can\u2019t see many hands at all. Now the women.... Again, plenty of hands go up. That\u2019s the issue, Sandberg concludes. A debate on gender equality is kicking off in the Congress Hall now, including Melinda Gates, Facebook\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg, and Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau. You can watch it here. Jonas Prising of Manpower Group is also on the panel - the moderator jokes that he\u2019s only allowed if he promises to change the name to Humanpower Group. Melinda Gates speaks first, saying she\u2019s encouraged that women and girls are at the heart of the new sustainable development goals. We\u2019ve all come to recognise that, if you want this increase in equity, if you want this increase in GDP, you\u2019ve got to get the other half working. And politicians are learning that you need to ensure your women and girls have health, and have education. More from the UK chancellor: US manufacturing has performed more strongly than expected at the start of 2016. The Markit manufacturing PMI for January rose from 51.2 in December to 52.7 in January, better than the dip to 51.1 which had been expected. The global rally prompted by hopes of further stimulus from the European Central Bank, as well as a surge in the oil price, is continuing in the US. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has started the last day of a tumultuous week with a rise of 180 points or 1.1%. Like other markets it is now in positive territory since Monday. The S&amp;P 500 is up 1% and Nasdaq has opened 1.8% higher. Meanwhile Brent crude is now up 8% at $31.6 a barrel, helped by comments from Saudi Arabia that $30 oil is irrational and a rebound is likely, as well as the current cold spell boosting demand. In Europe the FTSE 100 is up 2%, Germany\u2019s Dax is 2.2% better and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 3.4%. Christine Lagarde has just spoken to the press, confirming that she will run for a second term as managing director of the International Monetary Fund. In a brief statement, the IMF MD says she has pushed through \u201cquite a few initiatives\u201d and \u201cmoved the institution on, together with a fantastic team of staff\u201d. And I\u2019m prepared to serve the membership longer. So I\u2019m full of energy and enthusiasm to do so. Lagarde first told French TV this morning that she would run again, having been nominated by several finance ministers including the UK\u2019s George Osborne. George Osborne says that the referendum debate in Britain will get \u201cinteresting\u201d when voters learn what the alternatives are. Answering a question after his speech in Davos on what contingency plans the Government has for Brexit, the chancellor said the civil service, the foreign office and the Treasury were currently \u201c100% focused\u201d on the negotiations.\u201d When it comes to the debate the Government will be required publish alternatives to membership of the EU and what arrangements we will have with our neighbours\u201d, Osborne says. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be one of the most interesting aspects of the referendum debate\u201d. Osborne did not spell out the choices, but they include the Norwegian, Swiss and WTO options. The Norwegian and Swiss options provide access to the European single market on payment of a fee but without any say in how the rules are made. The WTO option means Britain would get the same access to the EU market as any other country that was party to global free trade deals. The chancellor played a straight bat when asked about Brexit, saying it was important the talks succeeded and that Britain had the right sort of relationship. He placed special emphasis on how the UK would co-exist with a eurozone that was going to become more integrated due to necessity. But he seemed to be suggesting that the staying in camp would get a boost when the alternatives are laid out. The Telegraph\u2019s James Quinn helpfully tweeted some key points from the lunch too: Elsewhere in Davos, the new Canadian prime minister has been chatting to the boss of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. We hear that it might have been a lunch of economic policy leaders - with the Archbishop of Canterbury thrown in for good measure. Anyway, Christine Lagarde and entourage just breezed past at speed, and Bono came the other way, warbling happily (I don\u2019t think *he* was in this lunch). So normal service is restored. Mark Carney has now emerged from this lunchtime meeting, and we believe that George Osborne may have nipped into. We don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything particularly unusual about this gathering - probably just a chance for all the key players to catch up. It appears that some of the heavy hitters in Davos have held a lunchtime meeting. A few have just left, including Kofi Annan, Ukranian president Poroshenko, Former US vice-president Al Gore, OECD chief Angel Gurria, and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby. Japan\u2019s central bank chief, Haruhiko Kurodo, also emerged. A big crowd has gathered, to see who is next. After a weary time at Davos, UK reporters are resting their legs, tucking into a good lunch, and listening to George Osborne talk to business leaders (the things we go through for you.....) It\u2019s a typically business-friendly speech from the chancellor; he\u2019s telling CEOs that his door is always open to them. He\u2019s also sounding relaxed about the turmoil in the markets, saying that Britain won\u2019t panic because China has hit a few bumps in the road. The two countries are partners for the long term. There\u2019s a few curious quotes too: Former UK prime minister Tony Blair is also in Davos (you\u2019ll be unsurprised to hear), and has spoken about the UK\u2019s upcoming EU referendum. Blair doesn\u2019t think Brexit would be sensible - again, not a shock given the man once rather fancied being president of Europe. The big issue is how we compete with emerging markets like India and China, rather than quitting the largest commercial market and biggest political union in the world. In the end, Blair thinks, and hopes, David Cameron will get a \u201cperfectly good deal from Europe\u201d. But he also predicts that there will be \u201cmore and more uncertainty\u201d as the vote nears. A quick look at the markets, which are continuing their rebound. The FTSE 100 is now up 135 points or 2.3%, Germany\u2019s Dax has added 197 points or 2% and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 132 points or 3%. All three indices are in positive territory for what has been a tumultuous week. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is expected to open around 190 points higher. Oil is also rising again, buoyed by comments from Saudi Arabia that prices could rebound later this year and also by the recent cold snap which is expected to have lifted demand. Brent crude is now up nearly 6% at $30.95 a barrel. Secretary of state John Kerry turns to the refugee crisis, saying President Obama will host a summit at the UN this autumn to rally the world community. The aim is to: Increase by 30% the response to humanitarian funding appeals, Increase the number of humanitarian donors. To a least double the number of refugees resettled or given other safe channels. Expand by 10 the number of countries taking refugees Get a million children into school and a million people working legally. The private sector, civil society, religious groups will be called on to integrate refugees and give them access to employment. And Kerry insists that this isn\u2019t a security threat, saying: I know we can do it in a way that protects the security of our countries. That sounds like a rebuttal to Donald Trump\u2019s promise to impose a ban on Muslims from entering the US, if he become president, which caused such outrage. Last year, people were claiming that Ebola would claim a million lives by last Christmas, Kerry continues. But with international co-operation, including US soldiers sent in by President Obama, the outbreak was stemmed (it killed around 11,000 people). The US and Cuba still have differences, but we are much closer and able to discuss how to close then and \u201cmarch down his road\u201d, says Kerry. John Kerry\u2019s relentlessly upbeat message to Davos is not to give up, there is a lot of positivity in the world too. Between 1990 and 2015 - child mortality has halved. Life expectancy has increased dramatically. The number in extreme poverty has more than halved. And progress is being made on getting more girls into education. The nuclear deal with Iran is also vital, Kerry says, bringing the world back from the brink of war. We were on the cusp of confrontation. I can\u2019t tell you how many leaders, as I travelled through certain areas, told me \u2018you\u2019ve got to bomb it\u2019. Every one of Iran\u2019s pathway to a bomb is now blocked, due to the 98% cut in its uranium stocks and reductions in its ability to refine then. US secretary of state John Kerry is giving his keynote address to Davos. He reminds delegates of the terrible scenes of 2015, from the tiny boy found drowned on a Turkish beach to the Jordanian pilot burned alive by ISIS. I can\u2019t think of a time in my life when I have seen so much atrocity live, thrown at us so relentlessly. Some people wonder if we are trapped in an irreversible decline, a new normal. And if that were true, no politician could fight it. I do not believe that is where we find ourselves. We are not the victims of a pre-destined future, Kerry continues. We feel frustration, because we want to change it. People don\u2019t fly to Davos to celebrate the status quo. You\u2019ve come here to change the world for the better, and define the future. Away from Davos for a moment. Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann, a notable hawk on the European Central Bank\u2019s governing council, is thought to be one of the committee members who helped temper the bank\u2019s stimulus programme in December. The meeting disappointed markets by taking less action than analysts had expected. On Thursday ECB president Mario Draghi hinted at further measures at the bank\u2019s meeting in March, and played down suggestions of splits on the council. And there may be a sign that his dovish words could be followed through: The only time Syrian refugees smile, if you meet them in Jordon or Lebanon or Greece, is when you ask them if they\u2019ll ever go home, David Miliband continues. They say \u2018Inshallah\u2019, God Willing. I want to go home. And they\u2019re not fleeing for economic reasons, they\u2019re fleeing out of utter desperation that if Assad\u2019s barrel bombs don\u2019t get them, and ISIS don\u2019t get them, the Russians will get them. If we fail to see this as problem of monumental political failure inside Syria, we\u2019ll never get to the source of it. Miliband also hits back at suggestions that Europe could tighten its borders to stem the flow from the Middle East. \u201cLet\u2019s get real about this\u201d, the International Rescue chief says (channelling his old boss, Tony Blair?) If any of us were in Syria, or in Lebanon where the average monthly paymen for refugee is $13 per month, we would be trying to get into Europe And equally, all our experiences around the world shows that the higher you build the wall, the more you empower the smugglers. Desperate people will always get around walls - the solution must be to fix the problems in their homeland. Europe is playing catch-up, says David Miliband. The Syria war started in 2011. And you\u2019ve got to act at the source and in Europe, with a proper relocation process. Germany is showing leadership here, with its promise to screen asylum seekers. And this might sound surprising from the head of a refugee agency, Miliband adds, but: It\u2019s right not just that people are screened, but it\u2019s also right that those who don\u2019t qualify for refugee status shouldn\u2019t stay. It\u2019s absolutely vital to the integrity of the system that the distinction between a refugee, which is someone fleeing persecution, and someone on the other hand who is simply an economic immigrant, needs to be maintained. In the US, where Miliband\u2019s International Rescue charity is based, it has the geographical ability to set up a screening pipeline, and work with the UN to bring people over from the Middle East. Relocation is part of the answer in Europe, but not the whole answer, he concludes. Federica Mogherini, high representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, is arguing that Europe has now woken up to the migration crisis, after a slow start. I don\u2019t see it as a failure that we finally have less people dying at sea. In 2013, I saw the hundreds of people dying at sea in 2013, and not even one summit. Now, we have realised it is a European problem. Yes it took too long, but finally we are doing somthing Is Europe failing on migration? Federino Mogherini argues that Europe can\u2019t afford to fail. In 2015, we learned that European Union is not luxury -- not just the Erasmus student project, a single currency, free movement to go on holiday within European. Finally, the leaders and citizens of Europe have realised that without European union we would not be able to face these challenges of migration and security. So the debate moderator, Lyse Doucet, reads out a readers\u2019 comment that EU leaders are failing and need to stop unlimited entry into Europr. Who in the audience thinks Europe is taking too long to react to this crisis, Doucet asks? There\u2019s a big show of hands. The next session, on the future of Europe, is getting underway shortly. You can watch it here. Miliband (D), Macron, and Mogherini are all on the panel, discussing migration and terrorism. It sounds like today\u2019s session on the Russian economy was quite tasty, with former finance minister Alexey Kudrin clashing with deputy PM Yury Trutnev. We\u2019ll dig the quotes out shortly. In the meantime: Roberto Azev\u00eado, the director general of the World Trade Organisation is in Davos seeking to push forward with trade liberalisation in 2016. He will host a small gathering of trade ministers tomorrow but thinks the mood is positive.\u201d I have never seen talks on trade so exciting. I have never heard the words \u201cWTO\u201d and \u201curgency\u201d in the same sentence\u201d, Azev\u00eado says. That\u2019s perhaps hardly surprising given that the WTO spent the period from November 2001 until last December fruitlessly trying to conclude the Doha round - a comprehensive package that included agriculture, services, manufactured goods, the rules of trade and special help for the poorest countries. Azev\u00eado says the WTO has had to become more flexible, seeking a multilateral deal amongst all its 160-plus members but willing to negotiate coalitions of the willing when unanimity proves impossible. \u201cThe system can work. It is working. We have learned how to live with the different views and the very strong disagreements among our members.\u201d Future areas for talks include e-commerce, investment, digital trade and data flows, Azev\u00eado says. Here\u2019s the Treasury on the UK borrowing figures: Today\u2019s figures show that borrowing is down compared to last year, as a number of one-off factors that have affected the data in recent months have unwound. But there is more to do. At a time when we face a dangerous cocktail of risks from the global economy we must continue to work through our plan to deliver a surplus and provide economic security for working people. And here\u2019s the Office for National Statistics on the disappointing retail sales numbers: Promotions during the 2015 Christmas period were more spread out compared with 2014, with retailers offering discounts over a longer period of time rather than a one day event. Clothing and footwear stores struggled in December due to the milder weather. Meanwhile Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: UK retail sales figures for December always had the potential to be a banana skin for Chancellor George Osborne, and he will be disappointed to see sales slide at such a critical time for the sector. The government would have hoped to see high streets up and down the country flooded with shoppers in the run up to the festive period in a bid to boost the economy, but today\u2019s figures tell a markedly different story. All eyes will now be on the UK\u2019s GDP reading next week to see how much poor retail sales figures have affected the bigger picture. UK public borrowing - excluding state controlled banks - dropped to \u00a37.4bn in December from \u00a311.7bn in December 2014. But chancellor George Osborne - who is warning at Davos of a \u201chazardous mix\u201d of risks to the global economy - will still need a big surplus in next month if he is to reach his full year target of \u00a368.9bn as laid out in the Autumn Statement. Retail sales in the UK came in weaker than expected during the crucial Christmas period. Sales volumes fell 1% in December compared to a 1.3% rise in November - itself revised down from an initial 1.7% increase - and below analysts forecasts of a 0.5% decline. That leaves them up 2.6% year on year, again below expectations of a 3.5% rise. These were the weakest figures since September 2014. UK retail spending fell 1% in December year on year compared to a 0.9% rise in November, the biggest decline since May 2009. The eurozone economy got off to a weaker than expected start to the year, according to the latest data. The Markit composite Purchasing Managers Index - which measures services and manufacturing - fell from 54.3 in December to 53.5 in January in the initial estimates. This was the weakest growth for almost a year, and follows ECB president Mario Draghi\u2019s cautious comments on the effect of the recent oil price slump and market turbulence. Price cutting and a weak euro failed to boost demand, said Markit. But its chief economist Chris Williamson, said it would be wrong to get too worried: The cooling in the pace of growth in euro area business activity at the start of 2016 is a disappointment but not surprising given the uncertainty caused by the financial market volatility seen so far this year. It would be wrong to get too worried. The survey data are consistent with GDP rising at a steady quarterly rate of 0.3-0.4% at the start of the year. Howard Archer at IHG Global Insight said: The January purchasing managers\u2019 surveys for Eurozone manufacturing and services activity are weaker than expected -showing overall expansion moderating to an 11-month low - and raise concerns that heightened global economic uncertainty and financial market turmoil are weighing down on a relatively fragile Eurozone cyclical upturn. Global economic uncertainties and problems are clearly a significant threat to Eurozone growth prospects not only through limiting exports but also potentially weighing down appreciably on business confidence, which could affect employment and investment decisions. Further constraints to Eurozone growth comes from high debt levels in some countries and structural limitations. Nevertheless, the Eurozone January purchasing managers\u2019 surveys are far from disastrous, and they still show reasonable new business growth, rising backlogs of work and decent employment growth. Furthermore, confidence in the services sector was at the highest level since May 2011... However, there are likely to be questions about just how much extra stimulus the ECB is likely to deliver in March having been disappointed in December Here\u2019s our story on the recovery in stock markets: European and Asian stock markets bounced back at the end of a tumultuous week, as oil prices recovered and the European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, raised hopes of further stimulus measures. It was a week that involved panic selling in global markets, pushing several of them, including London and Japan, into bear market territory, as oil prices tumbled to 13-year lows below $28 a barrel and further intensified fears over the health of the global economy. On Friday, however, Japan\u2019s Nikkei rallied nearly 6%, its biggest one-day gain in four and a half months, helped by a weaker yen and speculation that the Bank of Japan could unveil new stimulus measures at its meeting next week. In Europe, Draghi hinted that the ECB was ready to inject fresh stimulus into the eurozone at the March meeting \u2013 sooner than many investors had been expecting. The comments pulled European markets off their lows on Thursday afternoon, and gave them a further boost on Friday, with the FTSE 100 index in London gaining nearly 100 points, or 1.7%, to 5872.74 in early trading. Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s CAC were both up 1.8% and Spain\u2019s Ibex rose 2%. Earlier came more signs of uncertainty in the eurozone\u2019s economy, confirming ECB president Mario Draghi\u2019s concerns. In France, the manufacturing sector stalled in January although the services sector picked up after the November terror attacks in Paris. Markit\u2019s initial reading for January showed the French manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index falling from 51.4 in December to 50 in January. But the services index rose from 49.8 to a better than expected 50.6, so the composite index - which tracks both sectors - climbed from 50.1 to 50.5 in January. Over in Germany, Markit\u2019s composite Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index fell from 55.5 in December to 54.5 in the preliminary reading for January. This was slightly below expectations. But Markit economist Oliver Kolodseike said the index still suggested growth in the country\u2019s economy, and it appeared unfazed by recent turbulence: Germany\u2019s private sector economy was largely unaffected by the recent stock market turmoil and intensifying uncertainty stemming from the so-called migrant crisis at the beginning of the year, according to latest survey results. Although the headline index (which measures the combined output of manufacturing and service sector firms) fell to a three- month low, the latest reading was higher than the 2015 average and indicative of robust, although unspectacular, growth of the German economy. Is France\u2019s next president at Davos today? Elsewhere in Davos, Harvard professor Ken Rogoff has warned that 2016 is a \u201crough year\u201d for emerging markets, due to the concentration of problems. We don\u2019t quite know what\u2019s happening in China, it\u2019s slowed down significantly. There\u2019s Russia, where the central bank governor did a \u201cwonderful job\u201d letting the ruble flow. They would have been in crisis otherwise. Then there\u2019s Brazil\u2019s huge political problems. Brazil\u2019s recession might be its worse in 100 years. I\u2019m very happy about what\u2019s happening in Argentina, though, Rogoff adds, to his fellow panelist Alfonso Prat-Gay, the new Argentina\u2019s finance minister. Prat-Gay clenches his fists in triumph. But Prat-Gay then warns that Argentina has \u201cunacceptable and immoral\u201d poverty rates of 30%, with 10 million people who cannot make ends meet. So, nothing sensational from Draghi on monetary policy -- but a level-headed argument that Europe could ride out the migration crisis, and a warning that it cannot afford to fail. Q: Is Draghi worried that the \u2018linear\u2019 push towards ever-closer European union is faltering? Draghi isn\u2019t convinced by this argument. I don\u2019t think it was ever meant to be a linear process. The founders of the EU, because they were pretty intelligent, they expected some bumps on the way. On Greece, Mario Draghi says Europe is in a much better situation than last June. The Greek government has made progress on reforms, and fiscal consolidation. Negotiations are taking place right now [between Greek officials and its creditors] There are three areas of interest: The fiscal targets for 2018-19 Pension reforms - which seems to be a \u2018key point\u2019, Draghi says. Financial sector reforms . There are still a high-level of non-performing loans in Greek banks. So we need a process by which these loans can be sold. I\u2019m pretty sure that an agreement will be found, so that the first review can be swiftly concluded, Draghi conclu The sooner it\u2019s concluded, the sooner the Greek economy can go back to normal, Draghi concludes. As ECB president Mario Draghi speaks in Davos, his comments on Thursday suggesting there may be further stimulus measures at the bank\u2019s meeting in March continue to give a boost to markets. At the open in Europe, the FTSE 100 has jumped 100 points or 1.7%, while Germany\u2019s Dax is up 1.8%, France\u2019s Cac has climbed more than 2% and Spain\u2019s Ibex is up nearly 2%. The refugees heading to Europe are a challenge and an opportunity for Europe, says Mario Draghi. Our society will be changed by this. In which direction, we can only guess. It is also premature to know how long it till take to transform this challenge into an opportunity. But if there is determination, and confidence. that\u2019s the most important thing, because the size of the challenge could actually undermine the confidence and make fear prevail over any other consideration. And the challenge is lost. Right now, we are all working to make it into an opportunity, the ECB president adds. But we mustn\u2019t underestimate the scale of the crisis - the education levels of the refugees, their age, and the willingness of the European countries themselves to invest and co-operate. Draghi says he\u2019s also confident that a way will be found to share the financial burden of the refugee crisis across Europe. Not to co-operate would be to ignore the challenge, and that would not make it disappear. Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank, is discussing the European economy now. He has warned that Euro governments will have to spend more to tackle the refugee crisis. In economic terms, that works out as a fiscal stimulus that could actually push up Europe\u2019s anaemic growth rate. Draghi is also blaming the slump in the oil price, and problems in the emerging markets, for pushing Europe\u2019s inflation outlook even lower. Having made her announcement, Christine Lagarde is now being congratulated by fellow Davos delegates while she snatches a quick breakfast. Two security guards just made it very clear that she\u2019s not speaking to the press right now. Lagarde\u2019s term of office ends in July. Yesterday, Osborne said she was an \u2018outstanding leader\u2019, who would take the world economy forward. But she does also face the prospect of trial in a French court over the Tapie Affair, so there could be a few twists in this tale yet. Breaking news from Davos- Christine Lagarde, managing director of the IMF, has said she will run for a second term. She made the announcement on French TV a few minutes ago, having already been nominated by several finance ministers, including George Osborne. Lagarde said: \u201cI am candidate to a new mandate. I was honoured to receive from the start of the process the backing of France, Britain, Germany, China, Korea.\u201d Super Mario Draghi seems to have done it again. Ahead of his speech to Davos the ECB president has lifted markets with his hints of further stimulus at the bank\u2019s March meeting. Also helping was talk from Saudi Arabia of a recovery in oil prices later this year, which has pushed Brent Crude more than 5% higher to $30.81 a barrel. So on Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped... while in Asia the Nikkei soared nearly 6% and the Hang Seng 3%. A tumultuous week looks set for a positive end. That even applies to the Shanghai Composite, which is up 1.3% on the day and 0.5% on the week - a surprising outcome given the chaos in the markets over the past few days. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: A sharp rebound in crude oil as well as some warm words from ECB President Mario Draghi turned out to be the perfect ingredients to prompt a sharp snapback in equity markets yesterday after Wednesday\u2019s rout, and this rebound has spilled over into the Asia session with crude oil recovering above the $30 level. The big question now is whether this marks a medium term base, or just a minor relief rally before another leg lower. Given yesterday\u2019s rebound and the subsequent positive session in Asia there now remains the very real possibility that we could well finish the week in positive territory, and if that happens it would be a remarkable turnaround after Wednesday\u2019s carnage. The opening calls for Europe from IG show an upbeat start: Good morning from Davos, where the third day of the World Economic Forum is getting underway. There\u2019s a big focus on geopolitics today, with US secretary of state John Kerry giving a big keynote address. The migration crisis is also in focus, as Europe braces for another inflow of refugees from the turmoil in the Middle East. Overnight, France\u2019s prime minister, Manuel Valls, has warned that the crisis is destabilising Europe. But there\u2019s no escape from economic worries - European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi is due to address Davos shortly. Investors around the world will be watching closely; yesterday, Draghi hinted that the ECB could take fresh action in March. Meanwhile, UK prime minister David Cameron and chancellor George Osborne will be going round Davos, trying to stir British businesses into supporting them in the EU referendum. And Argentina\u2019s president, Mauricio Macri, is in town. Might he mention the Falklands Islands? Here\u2019s some of the things we\u2019ll try to cover: 8.45am CET (7.45am GMT): Mario Draghi discusses the outlook for the eurozone economy 10.30am: Securing the Middle East and North Africa, with Iraqi prime minister Ha\u00efdar Al Abadi and Lebanon\u2019s Tammam Saeb Salam. 11am CET : Europe at a tipping point: with French economy Emmanuel Macron, EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini, and David Miliband, President, International Rescue Committee 11.30am CET: John Kerry\u2019s special address 1.15pm CET: Press conference with the President of Argentina, Mauricio Macri, 4.45pm CET: Preparing for the next pandemic, including Bill Gates and Jim Kim, head of the World Bank.",
