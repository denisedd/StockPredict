                "body":"<p>Three years ago, Apple boss Tim Cook was emphatic. Appearing before <a href=\"http://www.hsgac.senate.gov/subcommittees/investigations/hearings/offshore-profit-shifting-and-the-us-tax-code_-part-2\">a US senate committee</a>, the man who runs the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest company told the politicians straight: Apple had no intention of repatriating billions of dollars of profits from its international operations until the US Treasury slashed corporate taxation.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have no current plan to bring them back at the current tax rate,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Cook said.</p> <p>It was a response \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one of many \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that rankled with the committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chair, Carl Levin. Leaning forward, the tough septuagenarian senator from Michigan glared at Cook over the top of his glasses: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is not your intent to bring them home unless we reduce our tax rates? Is that correct?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Cook repeated: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have no current plan to do so at the current tax rates.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>It was a charged exchange that laid bare the impasse between corporate America and Washington. At that time, Apple had amassed about $100bn in cash \u00e2\u20ac\u201c income from its foreign operations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all of which was being carefully held outside America, beyond the reach of the US tax authorities.</p> <p>Since then, every three months, Apple has given Wall Street an update on the size of this cash pile, and each time the figure has grown by several billion. At last count, six weeks ago, the figure stood at $215bn (\u00c2\u00a3162bn).</p> <p>If Apple were to bring that money back to the US, however, it would be taxed at about 40%, one of the highest tax rates in the world. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Apple serves its shareholders by keeping these funds overseas,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the Californian technology firm told the senators.</p> <p>By using a long-standing loophole in the tax code, Apple, in common with many other multinationals, can continually defer US taxes on these offshore earnings for as long as they are kept outside America.</p> <p>This is a quirk of US law that has had a dramatic, and increasingly unsustainable, impact on the corporate world. It has meant that many of the richest firms in the US are amassing huge, untaxed offshore cash piles. In recent, years that trend has been accelerated by America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s booming leading tech firms and their worldwide success.</p> <p>According to ratings agency Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, US companies, excluding banks, had an estimated $1.2 trillion in cash overseas at the end of last year. Just over half of that sum \u00e2\u20ac\u201c $630bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is estimated to be held by Apple and other tech companies, among them Silicon Valley firms Microsoft ($96bn), Cisco ($57bn), Google ($43bn) and Oracle ($45bn).</p> <p>Barack Obama promised he would get corporate America to bring profits home, as have both the Republican and Democrat candidates vying to succeed him. Quite how to do so, however, has divided Washington for decades.</p> <p>And if the result has been intransigence, few have complained very loudly. The impasse has suited corporate America well, allowing its biggest international businesses to enjoy years of ultra-low tax bills.</p> <p>Last week, however, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/30/apple-pay-back-taxes-eu-ruling-ireland-state-aid\">dramatic intervention of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager </a>appeared to steal the reform initiative from Washington.</p> <p>In a decision that for many years tax experts would have thought unthinkable, she ruled that a significant slice of Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offshore wealth had been illegally won. The iPhone maker, Vestager found, had been benefiting from a sweetheart tax deal agreed behind closed doors with Ireland a quarter of a century ago. That deal had resulted in Apple avoiding \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn in taxes over 10 years, she said: those back taxes, plus interest, would have to be repaid.</p> <p>Cook was furious. He insisted that the income had already been taxed in Europe. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The commission is now calling to retroactively change those rules,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he protested last Tuesday. Two days later he was still raging \u00e2\u20ac\u201d calling Vestager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision \u00e2\u20ac\u0153invalid\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/01/political-crap-tim-cook-apple-tax-ruling\">crap</a>\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201d but he also had a surprise announcement. During an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/01/apple-boss-tim-cook-repatriate-billions-to-us-treasury-next-year\">interview on Irish radio,</a> he started talking about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/01/apple-boss-tim-cook-repatriate-billions-to-us-treasury-next-year\">repatriating cash held overseas </a>and paying US tax. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Right now, I would forecast that we repatriate next year,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We [have] provisioned several billion for the US for payment [of tax bills] as soon as we repatriate.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>There has been no further elaboration, but it is a marked change in tone from Cook, who now needs all the support he can muster from allies on Capitol Hill. Hints that Apple might be more willing to pay tax in America might be just the kind of message US politicians wanted to hear.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a0fc93f0c5b0cb05a2bd00d6410781ae8444c12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a0fc93f0c5b0cb05a2bd00d6410781ae8444c12/0_61_3884_2331/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Margrethe Vestager\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margrethe Vestager: demanding \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn in back taxes from Apple in Ireland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Thys/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Apple boss certainly has friends in high places. Recent months have seen him host fundraising events for both Democratic presidential candidate Hilary Clinton and Republican house speaker Paul Ryan.</p> <p>For all that, however, few US politicians have come out fighting hard to defend Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Irish tax arrangements. There have some generalised warnings from US Treasury secretary Jack Lew that the commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move could have a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153chilling effect on US-EU cross-border investment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that Washington would have to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153consider potential responses\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>But as global leaders gather in Hangzhou, China, on Sunday for the latest G20 summit, there are little signs of Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn back-taxes penalty causing a full-blown crisis.</p> <p>Behind the scenes, dissatisfaction over corporate America and its untaxed offshore cash is growing. Politicians may not yet have figured out what they intend to do about this issue, but the last 18 months have provided a few stark reminders that there is a lot at stake.</p> <p>Last November, many in Washington were surprised to see Pfizer, one of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest drug makers, unveiling plans for a record-breaking $160bn deal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/06/pfizer-allergan-tax-inversion-deal-merger\">so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tax inversion\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</a> transaction which would see it merge with a smaller, foreign rival and shift its headquarters outside the US.</p> <p>The Pfizer bid was just the latest, and largest, in a wave of such inversion deals. Such transactions are designed to allow multinationals greater freedom to use their swollen cash reserves without triggering US tax bills.</p> <p>In the end, however, the Obama administration moved quickly enough to introduce tougher rules to discourage inversion deals, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/05/pfizer-allergan-merger-tax-avoidance-rules\">thwarting Pfizer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans</a>. But it was yet another wake-up call: corporate America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s untaxed offshore cash pile was a problem that needed fixing.</p> <p>Most tax reform experts concede Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Irish tax arrangements are hard to defend as fair. Pascal Saint-Amans, head of tax at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), who last year secured unprecedented agreement on reforms to tackle tax avoidance, is among the critics.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Apple case is a great illustration of the most aggressive tax planning that is out there\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 [It produced] massive profits that ended up going taxed nowhere. It is precisely because of these types of schemes that the G20 asked us to start looking at major tax reforms [three years ago].\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>It is the OECD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work on tax reform that prompted Ireland to finally close loopholes that allowed Apple and other multinationals to use \u00e2\u20ac\u0153non-tax-resident\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Irish companies to receive billions of dollars in income that then went untaxed. As a result, Apple unwound its use of such arrangements last year.</p> <p>It now remains to be seen whether Vestager demonstrates an appetite for going after further large sums from cash-rich US corporations that have used aggressive tax structures in Europe. She already has two suspected sweetheart deals in her sights \u00e2\u20ac\u201d separate tax rulings granted by Luxembourg to McDonald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Amazon. And she has not ruled out adding more.</p> <p>Whatever the outcome, however, Washington and Wall Street have woken up to the possibility that if America is unwilling to tax the ballooning offshore cash mountains of its leading companies, others are now emboldened to do so.</p>",

By using a long-standing loophole in the tax code, Apple, in common with many other multinationals, can continually defer US taxes on these offshore earnings for as long as they are kept outside America. This is a quirk of US law that has had a dramatic, and increasingly unsustainable, impact on the corporate world. It has meant that many of the richest firms in the US are amassing huge, untaxed offshore cash piles. In recent, years that trend has been accelerated by America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s booming leading tech firms and their worldwide success. According to ratings agency Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, US companies, excluding banks, had an estimated $1.2 trillion in cash overseas at the end of last year. Just over half of that sum \u00e2\u20ac\u201c $630bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is estimated to be held by Apple and other tech companies, among them Silicon Valley firms Microsoft ($96bn), Cisco ($57bn), Google ($43bn) and Oracle ($45bn). Barack Obama promised he would get corporate America to bring profits home, as have both the Republican and Democrat candidates vying to succeed him. Quite how to do so, however, has divided Washington for decades. And if the result has been intransigence, few have complained very loudly. The impasse has suited corporate America well, allowing its biggest international businesses to enjoy years of ultra-low tax bills. Last week, however, the dramatic intervention of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager appeared to steal the reform initiative from Washington. In a decision that for many years tax experts would have thought unthinkable, she ruled that a significant slice of Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offshore wealth had been illegally won. The iPhone maker, Vestager found, had been benefiting from a sweetheart tax deal agreed behind closed doors with Ireland a quarter of a century ago. That deal had resulted in Apple avoiding \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn in taxes over 10 years, she said: those back taxes, plus interest, would have to be repaid. Cook was furious. He insisted that the income had already been taxed in Europe. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The commission is now calling to retroactively change those rules,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he protested last Tuesday. Two days later he was still raging \u00e2\u20ac\u201d calling Vestager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision \u00e2\u20ac\u0153invalid\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153crap\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201d but he also had a surprise announcement. During an interview on Irish radio, he started talking about repatriating cash held overseas and paying US tax. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Right now, I would forecast that we repatriate next year,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We [have] provisioned several billion for the US for payment [of tax bills] as soon as we repatriate.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There has been no further elaboration, but it is a marked change in tone from Cook, who now needs all the support he can muster from allies on Capitol Hill. Hints that Apple might be more willing to pay tax in America might be just the kind of message US politicians wanted to hear. The Apple boss certainly has friends in high places. Recent months have seen him host fundraising events for both Democratic presidential candidate Hilary Clinton and Republican house speaker Paul Ryan. For all that, however, few US politicians have come out fighting hard to defend Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Irish tax arrangements. There have some generalised warnings from US Treasury secretary Jack Lew that the commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move could have a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153chilling effect on US-EU cross-border investment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that Washington would have to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153consider potential responses\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But as global leaders gather in Hangzhou, China, on Sunday for the latest G20 summit, there are little signs of Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn back-taxes penalty causing a full-blown crisis. Behind the scenes, dissatisfaction over corporate America and its untaxed offshore cash is growing. Politicians may not yet have figured out what they intend to do about this issue, but the last 18 months have provided a few stark reminders that there is a lot at stake. Last November, many in Washington were surprised to see Pfizer, one of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest drug makers, unveiling plans for a record-breaking $160bn deal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tax inversion\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd transaction which would see it merge with a smaller, foreign rival and shift its headquarters outside the US. The Pfizer bid was just the latest, and largest, in a wave of such inversion deals. Such transactions are designed to allow multinationals greater freedom to use their swollen cash reserves without triggering US tax bills. In the end, however, the Obama administration moved quickly enough to introduce tougher rules to discourage inversion deals, thwarting Pfizer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans. But it was yet another wake-up call: corporate America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s untaxed offshore cash pile was a problem that needed fixing. Most tax reform experts concede Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Irish tax arrangements are hard to defend as fair. Pascal Saint-Amans, head of tax at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), who last year secured unprecedented agreement on reforms to tackle tax avoidance, is among the critics. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Apple case is a great illustration of the most aggressive tax planning that is out there\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 [It produced] massive profits that ended up going taxed nowhere. It is precisely because of these types of schemes that the G20 asked us to start looking at major tax reforms [three years ago].\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It is the OECD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work on tax reform that prompted Ireland to finally close loopholes that allowed Apple and other multinationals to use \u00e2\u20ac\u0153non-tax-resident\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Irish companies to receive billions of dollars in income that then went untaxed. As a result, Apple unwound its use of such arrangements last year. It now remains to be seen whether Vestager demonstrates an appetite for going after further large sums from cash-rich US corporations that have used aggressive tax structures in Europe. She already has two suspected sweetheart deals in her sights \u00e2\u20ac\u201d separate tax rulings granted by Luxembourg to McDonald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Amazon. And she has not ruled out adding more. Whatever the outcome, however, Washington and Wall Street have woken up to the possibility that if America is unwilling to tax the ballooning offshore cash mountains of its leading companies, others are now emboldened to do so.",

                "bodyText":"Shares in Ocado have plunged after the online grocer reported that profit margins were under pressure amid fierce competition between food retailers. Sales \u00e2\u20ac\u201c excluding its partnership with supermarket chain Morrisons \u00e2\u20ac\u201c rose 13.6% to \u00c2\u00a3314m in the 12 weeks to 7 August, Ocado said in a trading statement. Average weekly orders rose 18.9% to 226,000 but the average order size dropped 3.4% to \u00c2\u00a3107.94, largely because of price cuts implemented to keep pace with the supermarket price war. Shares in the group sank nearly 15% to 275p in morning trading as Tim Steiner, Ocado\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As the market remains very competitive, we are seeing sustained and continuing margin pressure and there is nothing to suggest that this will change in the short term.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Analysts said they expected to cut their annual profit forecasts by between 1% and nearly 3% in the light of ongoing price-cutting in the grocery market as the major supermarkets try to take on the fast-growing discounters Aldi and Lidl. Duncan Tatton-Brown, Ocado\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance director, added that a squeeze on profits from rising costs, on top of price cuts, would come through in the next few months as food retailers begin to import more food when UK harvests subside later this month. The price of buying food in Europe has risen significantly as the value of sterling against the euro has fallen by about 10% since the Brexit vote. Tatton-Brown said it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t clear whether the major grocers would put prices up to offset rising costs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve decided to follow the market leader on price and if the market is willing to let the price of goods grow then our prices will rise as well. At the moment that is not happening, the reverse is happening.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Steiner said the increase in orders was Ocado\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best volume increase in more than five years. The falling size of individual orders has been offset by a rising number of customers who are ordering more frequently. Ocado\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price has been volatile since the company floated in 2010. After dropping below the 180p offer price for almost two years, they revived after a deal was signed to distribute Morrisons\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 online orders. The agreement appeared to offer the prospect of further deals with overseas retailers without the technology for large-scale online orders but no such contract has materialised as yet. Continued disappointment that Ocado is yet to sign up a long-awaited international partner to use its technology is also putting downward pressure on the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The extended wait for details of a first international agreement does not inspire much confidence,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said James Grzinic, an analyst at Jefferies, in a note. He said the failure to sign a deal suggested Ocado\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technology offer was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not quite the finished article for its potential client base\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Fears that finding a good deal will be elusive have risen since Morrisons signed a wholesale partnership with online specialist Amazon, which has launched its own grocery delivery service in London, Ocado\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heartland. Tatton-Brown said Ocado was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not concerned\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about the launch of Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fresh service, which analysts said had not appeared to affect Ocado\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sales performance so far. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We think Amazon will add to channel shift that is already happening.

Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Both European and US markets have turned lower once more this afternoon, as the relief brought by predictably dovish comments from Fed member Brainard soon evaporated. Coming out of the summer lull, it seems volatility is back with a bang, leaving many struggling to get a handle on where exactly it has come from. Despite a perceived hawkish shift from some Fed rate setters, driving a flight out of stocks and into the dollar, September still seems too early for the next US rate increase and it is still a coin toss whether one will happen in 2016.</p> <p>Crude prices have suffered after yet another downbeat assessment of the sector, this time from the IEA which cut its demand forecasts for the year ahead. Even if OPEC and Russia manage to reach a supply freeze deal, output would still be maintained at near record highs while demand falters. There is little surprise that we are seeing the bears come back into play to take advantage of the misguided ramp up in price recently.</p> </blockquote> <p>Brent crude is currently down more than 2% at $47.25 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate has fallen 2.6% to $45.07.</p> <p>On the European markets, the final scores showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 fell 35.27 points or 0.53% to 6665.63</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 0.43% to 10,386.60</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 1.19% lower at 4387.18</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB finished 1.74% down at 16,547.75</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 1.61% at 8724.2</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.05% at 556.96</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 249 points or 1.36%.</p> <p><em>On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening.

                "bodyText":"A fall in the oil price after a report from the International Energy Agency forecast a continuing supply glut, plus renewed concerns about a US rate rise next week, sent shares lower once more after a brief attempt at revival. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Both European and US markets have turned lower once more this afternoon, as the relief brought by predictably dovish comments from Fed member Brainard soon evaporated. Coming out of the summer lull, it seems volatility is back with a bang, leaving many struggling to get a handle on where exactly it has come from. Despite a perceived hawkish shift from some Fed rate setters, driving a flight out of stocks and into the dollar, September still seems too early for the next US rate increase and it is still a coin toss whether one will happen in 2016. Crude prices have suffered after yet another downbeat assessment of the sector, this time from the IEA which cut its demand forecasts for the year ahead. Even if OPEC and Russia manage to reach a supply freeze deal, output would still be maintained at near record highs while demand falters. There is little surprise that we are seeing the bears come back into play to take advantage of the misguided ramp up in price recently. Brent crude is currently down more than 2% at $47.25 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate has fallen 2.6% to $45.07. On the European markets, the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 35.27 points or 0.53% to 6665.63 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 0.43% to 10,386.60 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 1.19% lower at 4387.18 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB finished 1.74% down at 16,547.75 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 1.61% at 8724.2 In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.05% at 556.96 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 249 points or 1.36%. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. The bounce that followed comments last night from Federal Reserve governor Lael Brainard suggesting that US interest rate rises should be kept in check has faded. Instead investors have revisited concerns that next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed meeting could after all see an increase in borrowing costs. Meanwhile a fall in crude oil prices after the International Energy Agency warned of a glut until the middle of next year has also soured sentiment. So Wall Street is sharply lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 240 points or 1.35 and sending European markets to their lowest levels of the day. There are exceptions however (or one at least): Apple is benefitting from some positive comments about the recently revealed iPhone 7, with good initial sales figures. The pound continues to decline, after UK inflation came in below expectations and made any move by the Bank of England to raise rates a more distant prospect. The Bank meets this week to decide its next move, but economists believe it is very unlikely there will be any change in its stance. Sterling has dropped more than 1% on the day to $1.3171, while against the euro it is down 1.23% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1720. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story about Sports Direct and MPs concerns about its ties with employment agency Transline. Sarah Butler writes: MPs have called on Sports Direct to end its relationship with Transline, which supplies workers for the retailer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shirebrook warehouse, over fears that the employment agency misled a parliamentary inquiry. Iain Wright, Labour MP and chair of the Commons business, innovation and skills (BIS) select committee, which published a damning report on Sports Direct in July, has written to the retailer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s founder and majority shareholder Mike Ashley saying he believed Transline was not candid about the reasons for its lack of an operating licence from the industry watchdog. The BIS committee has also warned Transline that it is considering reporting to the Commons that the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s directors are not fit to run the company because of concerns about its dealings with Gangmasters Licensing Authority (GLA). \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We ask you to think seriously about continuing to use Transline, a company that treats their workers and conducts its business in a way that is inconsistent with your own aspirations for Sports Direct to be on a par with likes of Selfridges and John Lewis,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wright wrote to Ashley, in a letter published by the BIS committee on Tuesday. He added that Sports Direct not having any formal written contract with Transline \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as revealed in a report by the retailer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lawyers published last week \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u20ac\u0153could make any decision to terminate the working relationship with Transline somewhat easier\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The BIS committee report published in July raised concerns about employment conditions at Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shirebrook warehouse, where most staff are employed through Transline and one other agency, The Best Connection. The full story is here: Earlier the Bank of England managed to successfully buy enough long-dated bonds in its weekly reverse-auction. It received offers worth more than three times the amount of bonds maturing in 15 years and more that it wanted to buy as part of its quantitative easing programme. The offer to cover ratio of 3.21 times was down, however, from 4.14 the previous week. And the Bank has run into controversy over the company bonds it will purchase as part of its corporate bond buying programme. The fall in crude oil prices in the wake of the International Energy Agency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecast of oversupply well into next year has helped push US markets lower in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 203 points or more than 1%, reinforcing the volatility surround stock markets at the moment. Over in Toronto, the head of the International Monetary Fund is calling for a new push to make globalisation work -- and attacking Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s protectionist policies. Christine Lagarde is acknowledging that the lowering of trade barriers has cost manufacturing jobs in the West. But she insists that politicians must keep working together to raise wages and improve standards of living. Lagarde says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For two decades before the 2000s, global trade regularly grew by 7%, or twice the rate of the world economy. Today, however, trade growth is below that of the global economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at about 2%. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is a growing risk of politicians seeking office by promising to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcget tough\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with foreign trade partners through punitive tariffs or other restrictions on trade. I am deeply concerned about this \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not only because I was a minister of trade, but because trade has been at the heart of the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mandate for more than 70 years.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story. The pound has weakened steadily this morning, and has now lost a whole cent to $1.3201 against the US dollar. With inflation coming in below expectations, investors may see more wriggle room for the Bank of England to stimulate the economy further. Newsflash: Sports Direct has been urged to cut ties with the agency that supplies thousands of workers to its warehouse. Iain Wright MP, who chairs the BIS committee, says the retailer must drop Transline Group, to prove its commitment to improving workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 conditions in Shirebrook. The BIS committee quizzed Transline in June, after the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Victorian\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd conditions at Sports Direct were revealed (including a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsix strikes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 policy that could see workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sacked for chatting too much, or being off sick). They heard that some workers had lost 15 minutes pay for clocking out one minute earlier, or being slightly late back from a break. They also heard that Transline had paid some workers with pre-paid debit cards, which came with a \u00c2\u00a310 one-off fee, and a monthly management fee of \u00c2\u00a310 per month. Wright says that reputable companies simply shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use such agencies: We on the Committee are very keen to see improvements to working practices at Sports Direct. Mike Ashley says he is committed to making conditions better for staff at Shirebrook. If he means what he says, he could start by cutting his ties with Transline Group who have not been candid or credible in their evidence to the Business Committee and, as we heard in our evidence sessions, have deducted money from low-paid workers without proper explanation and justification. I would expect other companies using Transline Group will want to think seriously about using a company that treats their workers and conducts its business in this way\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Neither Mike Ashley nor the RPC report into working practices last week have explained why so many people at Shirebrook are employed through agencies, and why they are employed on short-term contracts, other than to reduce costs and avoid legal responsibility for their poor working conditions. If Sports Direct are going to become the Selfridges or John Lewis-style retailer which Mike Ashley has said he aspires them to be, then he needs to fix these poor contractual terms and make a real improvement to warehouse staff working conditions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In other news... the head of the European Central Bank has urged the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s politicians to give more help to those who have lost out from Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s integration. Speaking in Italy, Mario Draghi said Europe must \u00e2\u20ac\u0153protect the single market in all its forms\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201ca hot topic, given the Brexit vote. But Draghi also chided European governments for neglecting those who have been left behind. The Europe project will founder unless it can protect its poorest from the consequences of open borders and deregulation. Draghi says: What is different from the past, however, is that today we must devote more attention to the redistributive aspects of integration, and especially to those people who have paid the highest price. I do not think there will be significant progress in terms of opening up markets and competition if Europe does not listen to the demands of those left behind by a society built on the pursuit of wealth and power; if Europe, as well as being a catalyst for integration and an arbiter of its rules, does not also moderate its outcomes. Draghi was in Trento to collect the 2016 Alcide De Gasperi Award, in memory of former Italian PM . Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full speech: Reviving the spirit of De Gasperi: working together for an effective and inclusive Union Despite the shock of the Brexit vote, UK house prices kept climbing in July. The ONS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest survey shows that property prices rose by 8.3% compared with July 2015. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lower than in June, when house price inflation hit a blistering 9.7%. But it means that the average UK house now costs \u00c2\u00a3217,000, \u00c2\u00a317,000 higher than in July 2015 and \u00c2\u00a31,000 higher than the month of the referendum. Prices rose fastest in the East of England, although London was close behind: So anyone who bought a London house after the financial crash may have actually doubled their money.... But could the boom be over? Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight predicts that prices could drop by up to 5% in 2017. He says: We believe housing market activity is likely to be limited over the coming months and prices will be increasingly pressurized as mounting uncertainty affects the economy and also constrains consumer confidence and willingness to engage in major transactions. We suspect that business and consumer uncertainty will heighten in 2017 once the UK formally launches divorce proceedings from the EU by triggering Article 50 and the negotiations increasingly come to the forefront. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our economics editor, Larry Elliott, on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation report: Cheaper hotel rooms, summer clothing bargains and cuts in the cost of alcohol helped peg the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual inflation rate at 0.6% last month. Confounding City fears of a small rise in the cost of living, the Office for National Statistics said price falls had cancelled out increases in the cost of food, air fares and smaller reductions in fuel than in August 2015. Economists had predicted that the annual inflation rate as measured by the Consumer Price Index would edge up to 0.7% or 0.8% in August due to imports becoming more expensive following the post-Brexit drop in the value of sterling. The ONS said there was some evidence that a cheaper currency was pushing up the cost of goods leaving factory gates \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an early indicator of inflationary pressure \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but this had not fed into more expensive prices for consumers.... More here: Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, explains how inflation could spike over the next few months: Forecasts suggests the drop in sterling will ultimately add around five percentage points to the Consumer Prices Index, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s as yet unclear whether that will come via a gradual uptick in the inflation rate over a couple of years, or a shorter, sharper bout of inflation over the coming months. The Bank of England forecasts consumer price inflation will hit 2% this time next year. Tom Stevenson, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International, reckons young people are experiencing a higher inflation rate than their elders. He says: Our Generational Inflation Barometer shows millennials have already had to contend with a higher inflation rate of 0.8% for the past few months, double that of older generations.* \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For the last two years it has been young people who have borne the brunt of the rising cost of living. The upward pressure comes largely from their spending on eating out, rent and bills. At the same time, they spend less on grocery shopping and eating in and therefore don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t benefit from the year-on-year drag on inflation which comes from cheaper food prices and non-alcoholic beverages.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Getting old does have its compensations.... ;) Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate is pretty low in historical terms -- CPI hit 5% twice following the financial crisis. Angela McGowan, chief economist at Danske Bank UK, warns that the fall in sterling will drive up inflation eventually.... Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics agrees: The BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Andrew Verity highlights the rise in import prices: But financial commentator Matthew Lynn reckons todays report shows that the EU referendum isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t causing financial chaos Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another new chart, showing how imported raw materials are becoming pricier. Import prices are 7% higher than in August 2015 - due to the tumble in the pound following the Brexit vote: Important point: UK companies are definitely being hit by higher import costs -- it just hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reached the high street.... It appears that UK companies are managing to absorb the impact of the weaker pound, rather than passing it onto their customers. Mike Prestwood, head of inflation at the ONS, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fuel costs falling more slowly than a year ago as well as rising food prices and air fares all pushed up CPI in August, but these were offset by hotels, wine and clothing leaving the headline rate of inflation unchanged. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Raw material costs have risen for the second month running, partly due to the falling value of the pound, though there is little sign of this feeding through to consumer prices yet. On a monthly basis, prices actually rose by 0.3% in August compared with July. The ONS attributes this to an increased in some food prices - such as bread, cereal products and meat. But mineral waters, soft drinks and juices all got cheaper during the month. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more detail from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation report: Transport: prices, overall, rose by 0.9% between July and August this year, compared with a rise of 0.1% between the same 2 months a year ago Restaurants and hotels: prices, overall, fell by 0.4%, compared with a negligible change a year ago. The main downward contribution came from accommodation services, in particular overnight hotel accommodation, for which prices fell by more than a year ago. Clothing and footwear: prices, overall, rose by 1.0% between July and August this year compared with a rise of 1.5% between the same 2 months a year ago. The downward effect came principally from garments, particularly children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outerwear. The pound has dipped, as traders react to the news that inflation was a little weaker than expected in August. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a major selloff, though: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation report says: The largest downward pull on inflation in August 2016 and for 2016 to date comes from prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages. Upward pressures come from a variety of categories, most notably restaurant and hotel bills. Transport prices provided a downward pressure during 2015 and early 2016 but this has eased during 2016 and they now have an upward effect. At 0.6%, UK inflation remains at its highest level since November 2014: BREAKING: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate has remained unchanged, despite the pressure from the weak pound. The consumer prices inflation came in at 0.6% in August, matching July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker than the 0.7% which City economists had expected More to follow... Newsflash: The world is going to be swimming in oil well into next year, according to new estimates from the top energy body. The International Energy Agency reckons that supply will outstrip demand until at least the middle of 2017, and has revised down its forecast for demand growth. That is likely to keep the oil price depressed, which could hold back inflation over the next year... The pound has lost a little ground this morning, dipping by a third of a cent to $1.3299 ahead of the inflation report. This is a busy week for UK economic data; we get unemployment on Wednesday, while Thursday brings new retail sales numbers and a Bank of England decision on interest rates. Ana Thaker, market economist at PhillipCapital UK, says the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value could fluctuate this week: Sterling remains tentative ahead of the data release and with the deluge of data out this week, we are likely to see greater volatility in the currency as markets attempt to ascertain the health of the economy The latest inflation data from the eurozone is pretty underwhelming. Prices across Germany only rose by 0.3% year-on-year, despite the massive stimulus measures unleashed by the European Central Bank recently. And Spain remains wedged in deflation, mainly due to cheaper energy prices. Elsewhere in the markets, retail chain JD Sports have jumped by 7.5% after impressing the City with a 73% jump in profits. Quite a contrast with struggling rival Sports Direct, which last week predicted that earnings might shrink by a fifth this year. Retail analyst Nick Bubb has crunched the numbers, and reports: Well, given the astonishing profits growth reported by the booming JD Sports today, you may be wondering how much bigger its market cap is now compared to the beleaguered Sports Direct and the answer is that \u00c2\u00a32.6bn plays \u00c2\u00a31.9bn\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Ocado, though, is the worst performing company on the FTSE 250 - tumbling by 9%. Analysts are disappointed that it still hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t landed any new distribution deals, to protect it from the thundering approach of Amazon. Ocado is also suffering from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sustained and continuing margin pressure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd -- which basically means the supermarket price war ain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t over yet.... The London stock market is open, and staging a very minor recovery after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp selloff. The FTSE 100 has gained 13 points (having lost 75 points yesterday). Housebuilders are among the risers, but mining stocks are dropping again. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets also reckons inflation may have risen to 0.7%, giving the Bank of England a potential headache. He writes: In the wake of the recent rebound in the UK economy shown in the recent August data, the latest inflation data looks set to show a sharp uptick as a result of the recent slide in the pound in the wake of the June Brexit vote. This could well start to act as a headwind for the UK consumer in the months ahead, and while Bank of England governor Mark Carney may feel \u00e2\u20ac\u0153serene\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent and possible future actions, UK consumers may not feel as benevolent towards him or the central bank if the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s over reaction to the recent Brexit vote causes price pressures to move sharply higher in the coming months. Even if Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate does rise this morning, it will still be significantly below the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target of 2%. As this tweet shows, most central banks are undershooting their inflation targets; although India and Brazil can only dream of such a problem.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate may push higher today, as the weaker pound drives up the cost of imported goods. Some economists predict that the Consumer Prices Index will rise to 0.7%, for August, up from July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.6%. That would indicate that retailers are making consumers share the pain following the 10% drop in sterling since the Brexit vote. James Brown, partner at consultancy firm Simon-Kucher &amp; Partners, explains: Inflation, as recorded by the consumer price index (CPI), is expected to have gone further up in August compared to July when it rose to 0.6% which was the highest level recorded since November 2014. We forecast continued growth in inflation as higher import costs from the devalued sterling find their way into consumer prices. August is only the second month where CPI numbers are based on post-referendum figures. If inflation does push higher, it might limit the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to ease monetary policy again to help Britain handle the fallout from Brexit. Having said that, most economic date since the referendum suggests the economy isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t faring too badly.... Also coming up... European stock markets are expected to recover some of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heavy losses, as investors stop fretting that US borrowing costs might be hiked next week. As we covered in last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blog, Federal Reserve governor Lael Brainard has hinted that interest rates should only rise gradually. Traders are also encouraged by overnight data from China, showing that industrial production and retail sales both grew last month. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ZEW institute will release its regular economic sentiment survey at 10am, which may show whether investors are still worried about Brexit. And on the corporate front, online supermarket Ocado and high street retailer JD Sports are reporting to the City right now:",

                "bodyText":"Across the road from the new bus station in the north Nottinghamshire town of Mansfield stands a recently erected retail and office development. The facility houses modern bars and restaurants on the ground floor, while white collar workers tap away on computers on the storeys above. For some, the zone is viewed as an uncontroversial symbol of how the town is emerging from the depression that afflicted the area following the bitter miners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 strike of the mid 1980s and the subsequent closure of the local pits. Yet inside this new facility is one of 100 regional offices of a once-obscure employment agency, which after years of operating in relative anonymity is suddenly becoming significantly better known. Transline Group supplies temporary workers to some of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best-known brands \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from Amazon to Argos. But it is its relationship with Sports Direct \u00e2\u20ac\u201c serviced from that office in Mansfield \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that has made the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name. Last year, an undercover Guardian investigation exposed how workers at Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warehouse in Shirebrook, Derbyshire were being paid less than the legal minimum wage. The expos\u00c3\u00a9 resulted in the sports retailer and its employment agencies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Transline as well as its rival, The Best Connection \u00e2\u20ac\u201c being forced into making backpay of around \u00c2\u00a31m to short-changed minimum wage workers, as well as some of the main protagonists being hauled in front of a parliamentary select committee hearing. Many of the MPs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 conclusions were contained within a damning report on the working practices at Sports Direct that was published in July. But on Tuesday the parliamentarians added that Transline had not been candid when giving evidence to the committee and that the retailer should end its relationship with the agency. In a letter to Mike Ashley, Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s majority shareholder, Iain Wright, the chairman of the Commons business, innovation and skills (BIS) select committee, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We ask you to think seriously about continuing to use Transline, a company that treats their workers and conducts its business in a way that is inconsistent with your own aspirations for Sports Direct to be on a par with likes of Selfridges and John Lewis.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The BIS committee also warned Transline that it was considering reporting to the Commons that the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s directors were not fit to run the company because of concerns about its dealings with Gangmasters Licensing Authority (GLA), which regulates agencies supplying staff to the food and drink processing sector. So what is this company and who are these directors? Transline was co-founded in 1989 by Paul Beasley, 49, and Jonathan Taylor, 48, who, along with a third director, 48-year-old sales boss Mark Elms, each own 5% of the company. The remaining 85% of the equity in the business, which is registered as Qualitycourse Ltd, is held by another director Colin Beasley, 72. The company refuses to explain what the relationship is between Paul and Colin Beasley. The group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth has been against a backdrop of many major employers outsourcing the hiring of much of their workforce, thereby eradicating costs such as having a human resources department. However, the arrangements have been heavily criticised, with workers and unions frequently complaining that they allow companies to bypass employment rights \u00e2\u20ac\u201c while workers often seem to fear instant dismissal. However, the structure appears to work well for some. Between them, the four Transline shareholders received dividends of \u00c2\u00a3100,000 in 2014 and \u00c2\u00a3117,000 in 2013, with the highest paid director \u00e2\u20ac\u201c presumably one of the joint chief executives Paul Beasley or Taylor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c earning \u00c2\u00a3177,942 in 2014 and \u00c2\u00a3575,862 in 2013. In 2014, the most recent year for which Transline accounts are available, the company made a pre-tax profit of \u00c2\u00a3675,000 on a turnover of almost \u00c2\u00a3180m. The year before, it booked profits of \u00c2\u00a31.7m on revenues of \u00c2\u00a3110m and sales appear to have risen again in 2015. At the select committee hearing in June, Transline\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s representatives told MPs that it charged Sports Direct \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in excess of \u00c2\u00a320m\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which it said accounted for about 10% of its revenues. All of which represents a decent business for Transline, based in Halifax, West Yorkshire. The accounts show that Paul Beasley had loans from the company totalling \u00c2\u00a3692,000 at the end of 2014, while Taylor was in debt to his own firm by \u00c2\u00a3448,000. But while those years look good from an accounting perspective, they were less so for the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation. It is the events of that period that have landed Transline in trouble with MPs. During the parliamentary hearings, a 2013 failure to renew its licence with the GLA was described by Transline finance director Jennifer Hardy as a voluntary move, as the company had ceased to supply the sector. The GLA disputes Hardy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s version of events, however, claiming Transline directors were not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fit and proper\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that the company had traded without a licence during 2013. Furthermore, as part of its investigations, the GLA examined the payslips of six Transline workers, whichshowed that they were paid less than the hourly national minimum wage (NMW) rate before the Sports Direct scandal was exposed. In a letter sent to Transline in March 2014, which was titled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Licence Application Decision\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the GLA said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Of these six workers on the scheme five have received under the NMW some of them significantly so.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The employment agency argues the select committee was biased against Transline and said it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153astounded and extremely saddened\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to read what it said were inaccurate critical comments about its operation and evidence. A Transline spokesperson said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have always provided accurate information to the select committee and are focused on supporting Sports Direct in reviewing and implementing recommendations and actions from the working practices report. We will continue to offer clarity and any further information necessary to the committee. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Obviously we find Iain Wright MP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statements and summary disappointing, however we will prioritise responding to the latest correspondence in a full and concise manner, within the requested timescale. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is inappropriate and unjust to make such statements [about directors not being fit and proper], which is why Transline is taking legal advice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.",

In an open letter to the leaders of the 28 European Union countries, the Business Roundtable group defended Apple over its tax dispute with the European commission. The US tech giant was ordered to pay \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn to Ireland last month, after Brussels ruled that the tax breaks it was given between 1991 and 2015 amounted to unlawful state aid. But the group of US chief executives, who between them run companies with $7tn of revenue and 16 million employees, said the decision \u00e2\u20ac\u0153must not be allowed to stand\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The precedent set by this decision, if upheld, would increase uncertainty significantly with a consequent adverse effect on foreign investment in Europe, making this decision a grievous self-inflicted wound for the European Union and its citizens.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It said that non-EU countries would interpret the ruling \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if left unchallenged \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as a signal that companies could have their assets seized by states \u00e2\u20ac\u0153seeking extra revenue or seeking to punish a successful foreign competitor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Business Roundtable said the 185 chief executives who it counts as members were particularly aggrieved by the retrospective nature of the ruling on a tax deal reached in 1991. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Commercial success is uncertain for any business endeavour but companies should have complete confidence that sovereign countries are committed to honouring their laws and have the authority to do so,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd they wrote. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The retroactive nature of the EC decision means that business can never have certainty even on its past tax liability unless or until the EC chooses to decide accordingly.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Apple chief executive, Tim Cook, has previously labelled the multibillion pound demand \u00e2\u20ac\u0153total political crap\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and warned that it could affect investment in the EU. The letter from Business Roundtable, which was also sent to senior politicians including the German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble, the European Union president, Donald Tusk, and the US secretary of state, John Kerry, echoed the threat. It said the commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions \u00e2\u20ac\u0153promote tax uncertainty \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and unless overturned they will disrupt trade and investment, with the most direct consequences to be borne directly by EU countries and their citizens\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The letter called on member states to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153put an end to the use of state aid investigations that will hamper economic growth by undermining cross-border investment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The group has previously lashed out against what it perceives as Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new and dangerous form of protectionism\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd amid tax investigations into American firms such as Starbucks, McDonald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Amazon.

Anglo American has added 25.6p to 883.2p while Rio Tinto has risen 54.5p to 2414.5p. Elsewhere information provider RELX is the biggest loser in the FTSE 100, down 17p at \u00c2\u00a314.51 as analysts at Macquarie issued an underperform rating. They said the company would find it difficult to improve operating performance further and it was time for a transformational deal. Among the mid-caps, online grocer Ocado is down 0.7p at 268.1p as Deutsche Bank cut from hold to sell. It said: While the share has fallen 17% post the third quarter, we continue to have 18% downside to our unchanged 220p target price. On more than 80 times 2016 estimated enterprise value/EBIT, Ocado continues to look expensive relative to Amazon on 72 times.",

Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s said it was not able to provide detail on how Argos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sales had improved so dramatically and Coupe said his view of the merger had not changed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have never not been confident about the deal. Customers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 habits are changing, shopping habits are changing very rapidly, driven by the rise of digital. Customers demand more utility and more speed, and Argos gives us the ability to serve customers in an increasingly rapidly changing world,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Coupe said. Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s convenience store sales rose by 7% over the quarter as it opened nine new outlets, while online sales were up by 8%.",
