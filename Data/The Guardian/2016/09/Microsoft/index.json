Leaning forward, the tough septuagenarian senator from Michigan glared at Cook over the top of his glasses: \u201cIt is not your intent to bring them home unless we reduce our tax rates? Is that correct?\u201d</p> <p>Cook repeated: \u201cI have no current plan to do so at the current tax rates.\u201d</p> <p>It was a charged exchange that laid bare the impasse between corporate America and Washington. At that time, Apple had amassed about $100bn in cash \u2013 income from its foreign operations \u2013 all of which was being carefully held outside America, beyond the reach of the US tax authorities.</p> <p>Since then, every three months, Apple has given Wall Street an update on the size of this cash pile, and each time the figure has grown by several billion.

In recent, years that trend has been accelerated by America\u2019s booming leading tech firms and their worldwide success.</p> <p>According to ratings agency Moody\u2019s, US companies, excluding banks, had an estimated $1.2 trillion in cash overseas at the end of last year. Just over half of that sum \u2013 $630bn \u2013 is estimated to be held by Apple and other tech companies, among them Silicon Valley firms Microsoft ($96bn), Cisco ($57bn), Google ($43bn) and Oracle ($45bn).</p> <p>Barack Obama promised he would get corporate America to bring profits home, as have both the Republican and Democrat candidates vying to succeed him.
