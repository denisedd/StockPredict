It comes in the wake of the landmark ruling of the European commission to order Apple to pay back up to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn (\u00c2\u00a311bn) in taxes to Ireland. The government accepted the amendment on Monday evening, said Flint, a member of the public accounts committee, which has criticised the tax affairs of companies including Google. Flint said she was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153delighted that the government and the Commons has accepted the principle of public country-by-country reporting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today is a victory for fairer taxation. A victory for openness, and a clear message to those global corporations that shift profits to low tax havens, that we expect them to play by the same rules as every other business.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Among the MPs to back the amendment was the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, the current and former chairs of the public accounts committee, Meg Hillier and Margaret Hodge, and Conservative members of the committee. During her campaign to become leader of the Conservatives, Theresa May had promised to be tough on tax evasion and avoidance. Other MPs supporting the amendment include members of the Scottish National party, the Ulster Unionist party, the Social Democratic and Labour party, Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats. The amendment was first introduced by Flint in March under the Ten Minute Rule, a form of private member\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bill which allows individual MPs to propose their own legislation. This was followed by a formal amendment while the finance bill was at the committee stage in the Commons which proposed that multinationals based in the UK or with a large presence there should make public information about the size of their profits, where they were made and what taxes they paid. They already provide this information to tax authorities, but the idea of the amendment is that making this public could help put pressure on corporations to change their behaviour. Flint said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK government now has yet another tool to use in the campaign against profit shifting that undermines our country and many others, not least some of the poorest in the world.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd",

                "bodyText":"It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a good day for Sports Direct investors, as well as for workers who can wave goodbye to that hated Six-Strikes list of offences. Shares in the company just closed, up 5% today at 349p -- a level not seen since the Brexit vote -- as the City welcomes today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report into the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcserious shortcomings\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 at the sports retailer. That means Sports Direct is now worth \u00c2\u00a32.083bn, by my calculations, up from \u00c2\u00a31.98bn last night. And 55% of that increase has gone to Mike Ashley, who still owns more than half the company. The rally appears to be driven by optimism that Ashley is (belatedly) tackling its corporate governance failures, and put some of the Shirebrook scandal behind it. But that might be too optimistic; as we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been covering through the day, unions, lawyers and commentators all fear that Sports Direct isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going far enough. We have to wait another year for the new 360-degree assessment, announced today, to see how sweeping the company will be will be. In the meantime, the Shirebook agency workers will still be stuck on their old zero-hour contracts, meaning Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dream of retail excellence is someway over the horizon. Wednesday will be another big day for Sports Direct, as it faces shareholders at its AGM. Will chairman Keith Hellawell be forced out? Will the media get some proper answers from Ashley (he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got a certain reputation for reticence with the press pack)? Tune in tomorrow to find out..... Our financial editor Nils Pratley has spoken - today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report is simply \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctoo tame\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and lets Mike Ashley off too easily. Nils writes: Welcome news: Sports Direct and Mike Ashley have decided they will no longer defend the indefensible. The company acknowledges \u00e2\u20ac\u0153serious shortcomings\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in working practices at its Shirebrook warehouse that it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deeply regrets and apologises for\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

In stores, staff will be offered the chance to switch from zero-hours contracts to ones that guarantee 12 hours of employment a week. And Sports Direct is not saying the matter is closed: a fuller review of working practices and corporate governance will follow. Jolly good, but let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not pretend that this report is independent. It was written by one of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legal advisers Reynolds Porter Chamberlain, and sections and phrases read almost as if they were dictated by Ashley.... More here: Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mark Kleinman has an interesting story -- one of Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s landlords has insisted that the retailer commits to obey Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anti-slavery laws! Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the details: One of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest commercial property landlords has begun inserting anti-slavery clauses in tenancy contracts amid growing scrutiny of working practices at retailers including Sports Direct International. Sky News has learnt that Hermes Real Estate, an \u00c2\u00a38.2bn property group which is part of Hermes Investment Management, recently told Sports Direct of its anger at working conditions for the chain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warehouse and shop-floor staff. Hermes Real Estate has also asked lawyers to include anti-slavery clauses in all new lease management contracts - although the provisions do not apply to existing tenancy agreements, according to people close to the situation.

Instead, the inquiry restricts itself to rather bland reminders that the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s founder (and driving force) can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be expected to know everything that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on. For example, this section paints Ashley as a man with a commitment to excellence: Where there is rapid growth in lean structures and fast moving markets there is a greater strain placed on the business when it is trying to comply with its moral and legal obligations to its staff and the community. Growth businesses need to work harder to ensure that their working environment is and remains a healthy and productive one and even more so if it aspires to be one of the best places to work in retail, as stated by Mr Ashley. A fine aspiration, of course. But can you imagine John Lewis, Marks &amp; Spencer or Selfridges penalising staff for being ill or having to queue up and flash their underwear so guards can check they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve not nicked anything? That screeching noise you can hear is the pound hitting its highest level against the US dollar since the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote. Sterling has jumped over $1.34, a seven week high, after new data showed an alarming slowdown in America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector. The US services PMI (which measure activity in the sector) slumped to 51.4, which means the slowest growth rate in six years. Economists expected a robust reading around 55.5, on a scale where 50 = stagnation. Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ace Jamie McGeever has the details: Legal firm Leigh Day is worried that the thousands of agency workers up in Shirebrook may still suffer unacceptable working practices, despite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledges. Partner Emma Satyamurti says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Having raised issues arising from the use of Zero Hours contracts in previous litigation against Sports Direct, we are pleased that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report suggests the company has finally realised that its use of these types of contracts is problematic. However it remains to be seen when and how this new commitment will be implemented, and whether historic injustices will be addressed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We remain concerned about the agency workers at Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shirebrook warehouse, as this group do not appear to benefit from the guaranteed hours commitment made in Sport Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s media campaign launched ahead of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AGM \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this pledge appears to be limited to staff directly employed by Sports Direct. Leigh Day is already fighting a court case for Sports Direct workers who were excluded from its staff bonus scheme as they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hold permanent contracts, as Satyamurti explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We continue to represent 188 Sports Direct staff and ex-employees who missed out on bonuses because they were on zero hours contracts. Our clients, many of whom are long serving, worked hard to generate the large profits from which Sports Direct has benefited, yet were excluded from the bonus scheme run by the multi-billion pound company.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Pressure continues to mount on Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top brass. Leon Kamhi, head of responsibility at Hermes Investment Management (a SPD investor) has told Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s The World at One that a new chairman is needed. Kamhi says Keith Hellawell should be replaced by a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong, credible individual with experience of chairing a FTSE company\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, Dave Forsey, cops plenty of flak in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report. For example, Forsey is criticised for not ensuring that the company actually has a proper contract with the agencies supplying thousands of workers.... During the oral evidence of Mr Ashley before the [BIS] Committee [ he was asked about whether he should know more about the contracts between Sports Direct and the Agencies. He observed that he couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know everything about every contract. These agreements were ultimately the responsibility of Dave Forsey (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mr Forsey\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) as Chief Executive and others in the Retail Team who dealt with the Agencies on a day to day basis. In fact on investigation there appears to be no formal signed contract in place for either Agency. Effectively the terms and conditions are based on custom and practice and/or unsigned terms. Forsey is also blasted for allowing workers to be paid less than the national minimum wage (as they hang around to be searched at the end of their shift): At the management level Mr Forsey had failed to inform the Board (or Mr Ashley) of some of the issues namely the progress of the NMW issue in a timely or effective manner over the course of a year or so. Warning signs that had been given off by the media and to a lesser extent the Unions regarding NMW issues had not been heeded properly or adequately and so some points were not escalated. These sound like career-limiting mistakes for a CEO. But not, apparently, at Sports Direct -- Forsey is still in his role, but has been ordered to give up his \u00c2\u00a33.6m bonus. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hope this is right.... It certainly makes a change from seeing a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price rise when it announces job cuts. But as flagged earlier, investors are also cheered by the prospect that SPD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corporate governance problems might be addressed.... The Breaking Views team at Reuters reckon today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s changes won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t satisfy City critics -- meaning tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sports Direct AGM will be unmissable... The dire working practices at Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warehouse have been a cause c\u00c3\u00a9l\u00c3\u00a8bre for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unions. And two of the biggest unions aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t prepared to drop their concerns, just because the company has apologised and pledged to mend its ways. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady has echoed Labour, by pushing for zero-hours contracts to be canned. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153An apology is always a good start, but this is too little, too late. What we really need is an independent investigation, as called for by the trade union resolution at tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sports Direct AGM. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A report written by a law firm which previously represented Mike Ashley and management simply won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cut it. Sports Direct cannot be allowed to mark their own homework. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Cases like this show why the government must act to end the abuse of zero-hours contracts, and get serious on enforcing employment rights. The Unite union, which played a major role in uncovering the Sports Direct scandal, also wants Mike Ashley and co to do more - starting by curbing its use of agency staff. Assistant general secretary Steve Turner explains: Unite still has concerns over the use of the two employment agencies, The Best Connection and Transline, which supply over 3,400 workers to the Sports Direct Shirebrook warehouse. For Unite it has been their behaviour and the lack of oversight that has been the cause of so many of the abuses at Shirebrook. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We therefore call on Sports Direct to reconsider its proposal to only move 10 agency workers a month onto direct, permanent contracts. At that rate it will take over 340 months or 28 years for the whole of the agency workforce at Shirebrook to be moved on to secure, direct contracts. My colleague Simon Goodley is concerned that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report neglects some serious issues. And he should know, having worked undercover at Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warehouse last year. One key blindspot is that the report doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really question why SPD employs so many agency workers at all (rather than putting them on staff -- and guaranteeing them more rights). Simon writes: Sports Direct has never given a proper justification as to why it needs to employ the vast majority of warehouse staff on temporary contracts all year round. Some workers have been there for years on these \u00e2\u20ac\u0153temporary\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd arrangements, which even the report acknowledges are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153arguably a form of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153zero-hours contracts\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his full verdict: Every silver lining has a cloud..... The jump in Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares also shows the City welcomes its new review of corporate governance issues. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been prompted by the build-up of criticism of chairman Keith Hellawell, who will face calls to resign at tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AGM. Bloomberg has a good take: The company is trying to assuage concerns of investors, who are running out of patience with the embattled company and its billionaire founder Mike Ashley. On Monday, Royal London Asset Management called for Hellawell to resign, saying that it will again oppose the reappointment of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-executive directors. That followed public criticism by a group speaking for more than a quarter of independent shareholders. Hellawell has already enjoyed a dramatic career -- he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the former chief constable of West Yorkshire police, and also served as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153drugs czar\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the last Labour government. Shares in Sports Direct have jumped sharply this morning after the company announced it will improve its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153serious shortcomings\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. They are up 6% at 352p, putting them near the top of the FTSE 250 risers. That suggests City investors like the decision to end the six strikes policy, offer permanent contracts to its retail staff, pay staff above the minimum wage, and keep reviewing its working practices. The shares are now at their highest points since the Brexit vote in June, valuing SPD at just over \u00c2\u00a32bn. However, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still barely half their value last December (the month in which the Guardian exposed life in the Shirebrook \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgulag\u00e2\u20ac\u2122). The company fell out of the prestigious FTSE 100 index earlier this year, after hitting investors with a profit warning in January. The scandal of Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s working conditions are proof that zero hours contracts to be outlawed altogether, says the Labour Party. Jon Trickett, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Business Secretary, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These are good steps forward from a company whose Dickensian working practices have shocked the country. I hope this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the last word from Mr Ashley, and that we can look forward to further such announcements in coming weeks, particularly regarding warehouse staff. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But we cannot rely on bad publicity to stamp out every instance of employers mistreating their staff. The Tory Government need to follow Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead and commit to banning zero hours contracts and other exploitative practices in the workplace. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Surely modern employers value their workforce as their most important asset. We have launched Workplace 2020 because we believe that profitable and efficient enterprises in the 21st Century can and should have up-to-date personnel practices including the right for the workforce to join a union.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more details on Workplace 2020, which Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn outlined in May. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to remember that Sports Direct isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t abolishing zero hours contracts for agency workers at its Shirebrook warehouse [today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer of permanent contracts only applies to casual staff at its shops]. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s significant, as most staff in Derbyshire are employed by agencies, not SPD itself. The Resolution Foundation says we still need better protections for agency workers [who are often on the lowest wages with the least benefits]. Their policy analyst Conor D\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Arcy says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report into working practices at Sports Direct highlights the pernicious effect of job insecurity on people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lives. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The move to offer guaranteed hours to staff on zero hours contracts is welcome and one that government should consider more widely, especially for those who have been on ZHCs for long periods of time. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, the fact that most staff at the Shirebrook warehouse are actually on agency books shows that there are many forms of employment contract at the bottom end of the British labour market that need closer scrutiny.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report may not take the heat off Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman, Keith Hellawell. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expected to face calls to resign tomorrow, when the company holds its annual shareholder meeting. Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Charlotte Lomas predicts a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfiery\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 encounter with investors. The government wants Sports Direct to crack on and implement today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report. A Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesperson says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Everybody deserves to be treated with dignity and respect at work. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As its own report has recommended the company must now resolve its working practice issues as quickly as possible.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report is packed with changes to improve conditions at Sports Direct. Some of them sound pretty basic, frankly, for a \u00c2\u00a32bn company that was recently in the FTSE 100. They include: No longer banning staff from wearing 800 different brands of sports wear (instead, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll only be banned from wearing 30) A new confidential hotline for staff to report bullying and sexual harrassment A new review of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s HR operations Appointing a full time nurse from 8am to 4pm (helpful for the next time anyone goes into labour onside), and a Welfare Officer Closer engagement with the unions, to help Sports Direct become an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exemplary employer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the spirit, guys) Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our full breakdown of the report: BIS committee chair Iain Wright MP has now told the Today Programme that Sports Direct needs to go further to get its house fully in order: Wright said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a whitewash in terms of a report. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are questions over the independence of the people who have done it, because it is Mike Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lawyers who have published the report. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It has gone a long way but not far enough.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hopefully Wright\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns will be addressed by the new review which SPD announced today. Sports Direct has also admitted that its policy of sacking staff who racked up six \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstrikes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 was flawed, and could allow workplace bullying. The board say: The business acknowledges that the six strikes policy in place as operated has serious shortcomings. It is a blunt instrument that can leave too much subjectivity in the hands of a few \u00e2\u20ac\u201c contributing to a hierarchical and potentially oppressive model. The list of potential offences did include some measures to prevent accidents - to discourage workers from climbing up the warehouse racks or not wearing safety kit. But it also penalised staff who reported in sick, took too many toilet breaks, or were absent without permission. That meant staff were afraid to take time off when their children were ill, and led to one worker going into labour on site. Now, the SPD board want a new, fair system that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153balances treating staff with dignity, respect and fairness and ensuring the business can deliver for its customers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd So no more of this.... Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board are promising to change the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcworkforce balance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 at its Shirebook warehouse, which is currently dominated by agency workers on contracts that only guarantee 336 hours work a year. It will run a test scheme to offer contracts to 10 agency staff each month (up from 2-per-month today). And it also wants its agencies to review those 336-hours-a-year contracts. Jonathan Bartley, the co-leader of the Green Party, has issued a statement welcoming Sports Directs decision to offer guaranteed hours to its casual retail staff. Bartley says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m delighted to hear that Sports Direct, who I named and shamed in my speech to Green Party conference last week, are ending their use of zero-hour contracts and will now pay their staff a better wage - although we will have to wait and see whether the working conditions in warehouses improve too. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This kind of brutal employment practise exposes the razor sharp edges of the so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgig economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and this decision has not come a moment too soon.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.... Bartley also hopes that other companies, whose working practices have been recently criticised, will follow Sports Direct. He singles out two firms facing protests from their drivers over new pay structures which could leave them receiving below the minimum wage: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for companies like Deliveroo and Uber to follow suit by ending their use of bogus self-employment contracts and guaranteeing staff decent pay, sick leave and job security.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Iain Wright MP, who chairs the Business, Innovation and Skills Select Committee (which quizzed Mike Ashley in June), has given today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report a cautious thumbs up: Labour MPs Angela Rayner and David Lammy are also upbeat: My colleague Sean Farrell is analysing the Sports Direct report, and says: The report said Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, Dave Forsey, did not tell the board or Mike Ashley, the retailer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s founder, about the potential for Sports Direct to pay below the national minimum wage, which was also uncovered by the Guardian. It said Ashley, who was hauled before MPs over conditions at the warehouse, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153takes ultimate responsibility for any aspects of the working practices that were unsatisfactory\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his news story: Big news this morning -- Sports Direct has just published a report into working conditions at its warehouse in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, following a Guardian investigation. And the review, by City law firm Reynolds Porter Chamberlain, has confirmed that the site fell far below acceptable standards. As the report puts it, there are: Serious shortcomings identified in working practices in warehouse which the Board deeply regrets and apologises for. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no surprise to anyone whose followed this story, or saw founder Mike Ashley accused of running a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Victorian Warehouse\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. And the company is now promising to clean up its act. For starters...Sports Direct has requested that the notorious \u00e2\u20ac\u0153six strikes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd policy operated by the agencies who supply warehouse staff is suspended \u00e2\u20ac\u0153with immediate effect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. (that policy meant staff could incur \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstrikes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for breaking petty rules, including taking too many toilet breaks or chatting too much). In another significant move, SPD will offer all its casual retail staff guaranteed hours instead of keeping them on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dczero hours\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. That doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear to apply to warehouse staff, though -- who are usually employed via agencies. Also, it is committing to ensure that all warehouse staff are paid above National Minimum Wage. That was prompted by the revelation that workers endured security searches after their paid hours had finished. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all -- Sports Direct is also launching a new inquiry into working conditions, to build on the findings released today. It says: This Report is to act as a benchmark for a further 360-degree 12-month Comprehensive Review to be put before shareholders in 2017. The full report is online here. It looks like a pretty significant reaction to the litany of problems exposed at Shirebrook. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pull together some reaction now.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It looks like another day dominated by concerns over the health of the global economy, and the impact of Brexit on UK growth. Overnight, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) has revealed that retail sales shrank last month. That suggests consumers are anxious; but actually it might be wrong to blame the EU vote, as Katie Allen explains: Olympics on the TV and sunshine outside kept shoppers away from the high street in August and knocked retail sales, according to new industry data. The latest snapshot of takings for shops, online stores and supermarkets from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) showed sales dropped 0.9% on a year earlier, in like-for-like terms. That contrasted with growth of 1.1% in July and was the weakest performance since April. But there were some bright spots for retailers as the warm weather boosted sales of barbecues and wine. Internationally, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll chew through the latest German factory orders, updated eurozone growth figures (at 10am), plus US service sector PMIs this afternoon. And on the corporate side, UK housebuilders Redrow and Berkeley Group and cars-to-bikes chain Halfords are reporting results. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main developments through the day....",

                "bodyText":"Before closing up for the day, here is a summary of events on what has been a busy day. The main event was the Eurogroup meeting in Bratislava, where eurozone finance ministers gathered to discuss Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s progress on reform. Athens is hoping to secure a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.8bn tranche of bailout money, but it is dependent on a programme of 15 reforms. With only two of the 15 reforms complete, ministers urged the Greek government to hurry up. The message was this: Athens still has time but it must work faster. Other developments today: In Athens itself, the Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras hosted fellow leaders of southern European countries, at a summit designed to find common ground and identify a unified position. A surprise fall in German exports dragged the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus lower and raised concerns about the strength of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy. The weak figures from Germany, as well as a failure by the ECB to announce more eurozone stimulus on Thursday, weighed on European stocks, with all major indices down. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600 is currently down 0.7%, while the FTSE 100 is off 0.8% or 58 points. In the UK, the Serious Fraud Office revealed it has charged three former senior executives of Tesco with fraud, in relation to a \u00c2\u00a3263m-plus accounting scandal at the supermarket chain. There was better than expected data from the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction sector, where output was flat in July. It suggested the sector was not sent into a shock downward spiral following the Brexit vote. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit narrowed in July to \u00c2\u00a311.8bn after exports rose but imports fell. The data suggested the sharp drop in the pound since the Brexit vote could be starting to feed through to increased exports. Sir Philip Green, founder of collapsed retailer BHS, issued a statement to reject the idea that he is dragging his feet over reaching a settlement for the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 20,000 pensioners. He insisted he is working on a solution every day. Thank you for reading the blog today, and for all your comments. Have a great weekend, and please join us again on Monday.

Prices have also been boosted over the week by the International Energy Agency, which said oil demand should finally exceed supply in the third quarter of 2016, meaning global stockpiles could start to fall. The Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras has been addressing leaders of southern European countries who are in Athens for a (Club Med) summit: Our countries have in recent years been disproportionately affected by the economic crisis... and are on the front line of migratory flows. We were on the front line of the parallel crises which have tested Europe. He added in an interview with the EurActiv news website: In such a debate, Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mediterranean countries can and must raise their voice. The way to have a bigger say is to seek a common approach and common positions. Here in the UK, the Eurosceptic chairman of the Wetherspoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pub chain has blasted Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s establishment stance over the Brexit vote. Tim Martin, who also founded Wetherspoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, said those predicting doom had been proved wrong: In the run-up to, and the aftermath of, the recent referendum, the overwhelming majority of FTSE 100 companies, the employers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 organisation CBI, the IMF, the OECD, the Treasury, the leaders of all the main political parties and almost all representatives of British universities forecast trouble, often in lurid terms, for the economy, in the event of the leave vote. City voices such as PwC and Goldman Sachs, and the great preponderance of banks and other institutions, also leant weight to this negative view. Martin added there was no need for anxiety over a UK trade deal with the EU: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcScare Story 2\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is that failure to agree on a trade deal with the EU will have devastating consequences. Common sense suggests that the worst approach for the UK is to insist on the necessity of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdeal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need one and the fact that EU countries sell us twice as much as we sell them creates a hugely powerful negotiating position.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The party continues in Bratislava, where the Eurogroup meeting has ended but the broader Ecofin meeting of EU finance ministers is underway. Top of the agenda is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the future of the EU economic policies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Ministers will assess whether the existing framework is sufficient for the current unprecedented challenges such as migration, Brexit or security challenges. Peter Ka\u00c5\u00beim\u00c3\u00adr, Slovakia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister and Ecofin host, adds: The aim is to draw a lesson from previous mistakes and gradually design tools enabling us to avoid or at least to mitigate possible future crises. Eurogroup has published a list of its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153main results\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, here. Specifically on Greece, it says: The institutions and the Greek minister for finance, Euclid Tsakalotos, briefed the Eurogroup on the state of play of the implementation of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic adjustment programme. The Greek authorities intend to complete the milestones, agreed in the context of the programme\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first review in a timely manner. These include 15 measures relating to privatisation, energy sector reform, bank governance and the establishment of the revenue agency. The achievement of these milestones is a condition for a disbursement of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.8 billion by the European Stability Mechanism Representatives of the institutions will be travelling to Athens shortly to prepare for the start of the second review of the programme. Markets in Europe are still in gloomy mood, with all major indices down this afternoon: FTSE 100: -0.4% at 6,832 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -0.3% at 10,640 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -0.5% at 4,520 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -0.6% at 17,278 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.2% at 9,084 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: -0.4% at 348 Tesco has commented since the news broke that the SFO has charged three former executives with fraud. The retailer said in a statement: We note the decision of the SFO to bring a prosecution against former colleagues in relation to historic issues and acknowledge the investigation into the company is ongoing. Tesco continues to cooperate with the SFO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investigation. The last two years have seen an extensive programme of change at Tesco, but given this is an ongoing legal matter, we are unable to provide any further comment at this time. As a reminder, here is the background to the Serious Fraud Office investigation into accounting practices at Tesco, which led to a \u00c2\u00a3263m profit overstatement: The basic message today from eurozone finance ministers in Bratislava to Greece: i.e. HURRY UP. Please. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Serious Fraud Office has charged three senior former executives at Tesco with fraud, as part of its investigation into an accounting scandal at the supermarket chain. The SFO said it had charged Carl Rogberg, 49, Christopher Bush, 50, and John Scouler, 48, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153with one count of fraud by abuse of position, contrary to section 1 and 4 of the Fraud Act 2006 and one count of false accounting contrary to s17 Theft Act 1968.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The SFO added: The alleged activity occurred between February 2014 and September 2014. The above-named individuals have been requisitioned to appear at Westminster Magistrates\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Court on 22 September 2016. The investigation into Tesco PLC remains ongoing. Bush was managing director of Tesco UK, Rogberg was UK finance director, and Scouler was UK food commercial director. All three were suspended over the scandal. More soon. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime minister Alexis Tsipras is meeting French president Francois Hollande, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Matteo Renzi and the leaders of Portugal, Malta and Cyprus in Athens today for a four-hour conclave aimed at winning backing for a southern European pushback against austerity. Tsipras wants a joint stance on the need to ease fiscal rules with Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other six Mediterranean countries \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s acting PM, Mario Rajoy, was invited but is too busy trying to form a government at home \u00e2\u20ac\u201c ahead of the EU summit on 16 September (without Britain) in Bratislava. Tsipras has long argued that the fiscal straitjacket favoured by Germany will never allow weak economies such as Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to recover, and said in an interview with Le Monde on Thursday that the EU stability pact \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whose budget deficit limits have already been tested by France, Italy, Spain and Portugal, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is not the word of God\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We want to promote a common approach among the countries \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 which, objectively, were the most affected by the crisis,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told the paper. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we do not give priority to employment, Europe risks decomposition. It is true Greece has been the black sheep for quite a while. But I think our partners have understood that the Greek experiment should not be made elsewhere in Europe.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd German MPs warned the putative \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Euro-Med\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd bloc, which will be joined for the meeting by ECB head Mario Draghi, against taking any action that might damage the EU, saying a strong and stable union was more essential than ever following the Brexit vote. Conservative MP Markus Ferber told newspaper Die Welt he was concerned the southern countries could form a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153coalition of redistributors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that would threaten Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stability: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153After Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure, the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcClub Med\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 will have a blocking minority that can prevent all kinds of laws that it does not like,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Away from Bratislava and in Athens itself, the Greek Prime Minister is hosting a meeting of leaders from Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other Mediterranean countries, aimed at finding common ground. Pierre Moscovici, European commissioner for economic and financial affairs is giving a bit more detail on Greek reforms. He says that ministers are satisfied that two out of 15 agreed \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmilestones\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 have been achieved by Greece: The 13 others are not on track or underway. There is progress, but this needs to be completed. [We] insist that the job is done, it is necessary. And the Greek authorities must know that we are waiting for them, for the matter of trust and efficiency. It is true too that we have lost some time, but I think we must balance that judgement by other considerations. The first one is that we can see an acceleration of work in the last days. The second point of balance is that it is still feasible to reach the completion of the milestones on time, and that is clearly what [the Greek finance minister] Euclid Tsakalotos said in the meeting. So we have to tell them clearly that they need to stick to their commitments and be really demanding, but at the same time let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not dramatise. We are still in capacity to reach this agreement. We all want it, there is a political will. The European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Beno\u00c3\u00aet C\u00c5\u201cur\u00c3\u00a9 is pitching in. He is going over the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision on Thursday not to introduce more monetary stimulus at this time. [Nothing new here.] Here is the official statement from the Eurogroup meeting, which is focused on spending reviews and public finances across eurozone countries. Dijsselbloem says there was a general signal from ministers that Greece must speed up progress on reforms: Today we discussed first of all the state of affairs in Greece. We took stock of the progress. There are number of milestones still pending to fully complete the first review and coupled with those are further disbursements. So we took stock of those and heard a little about the issues at stake. There was a general feeling that we must not lose time - the time scale that was drawn up and agreed in May 2016 - so more progress is needed and we strongly encouraged the Greek government as a whole to speed up the implementation of the remaining milestones. That of course could also help in ensuring a timely start and completion of the second review. The work on that will have to start very soon also. Against this background, we were happy to hear from our Greek colleague his commitment to do that work very quickly. We will be following that closely in the coming weeks. Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem kicks off by saying there are positive signs in the eurozone: There are many challenges ahead. The economic recovery is progressing, growth returned to almost all of our countries and there are positive signs throughout the eurozone. The Eurogroup press conference is coming up here... The proportion of British people who think the Bank of England will raise interest rates over the next year has fallen to a record low. The Bank said 21% of people surveyed in August expected it to raise interest rates in the next 12 months, down sharply from 41% in May. It was the lowest level since the survey began in 1999. Mark Carney and his colleagues on the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Monetary Policy Committee cut rates to a record low of 0.25% on 4 August, in a bid to limit the potential negative impact of the Brexit vote. The MPC has signalled more action will follow if the economic data deems it necessary. The poll of 2,177 people aged 16 and over was conducted on 8-9 August, a few days after the rate cut. Sir Philip Green, the former owner of collapsed retailer BHS, has denied dragging his feet over reaching a settlement for the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 20,000 pensioners. He has also denied putting pressure on the Pensions Regulator over a potential deal. Green sold BHS for \u00c2\u00a31 a little more than a year before it collapsed in April, leaving an estimated pensions black hole of \u00c2\u00a3571m. Green has issued a statement today, in response to allegations by Frank Field MP, chairman of the work and pensions committee. Green said: Mr Field suggested in the House of Commons on Wednesday there was a lack of willingness on my part to reach a settlement with regard to the pension fund. This is untrue, totally inaccurate and unhelpful in solving this issue. There have also been suggestions in the press that I have tried to pressurise the regulator, or, as was stated on the front page of one newspaper, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcblackmail\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 it. This is wholly untrue. I am not in control of the process. I am following the process which has been set down by the regulator. I would like to apologise sincerely to all the BHS people involved in this sorry affair. Contrary to all the coverage I have been working on this issue on a daily basis, and will continue to do so with my best efforts to achieve a satisfactory outcome for all involved as soon as possible. Sticking with Dijsselbloem, he has given the best soundbite on Greece from Bratislava so far today: The pressure is back on. The summer is over. Pack up the camping gear, get back to work. The deal was that Greece would implement 15 reforms in September - including privatisation plans and energy sector changes - in exchange for a final \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.8bn tranche of emergency funding. Wolfgang Schaeuble, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, said there was still time for Greece to come good on its side of the bargain: Today is 9 September, so there is still time for Greece. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not new that, with Greece, we see the implementation of the measures that have been agreed towards the final phase of the agreed time frame. Hopefully we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be able to glean more on the mood of the meeting at the press conference which is due to start in a about 20 minutes or so. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the group of eurozone finance ministers has offered some thoughts on the Brexit thoughts. Speaking in Bratislava before ministers got down to business on Greek bailout talks, he said Britain must make up its mind on the start of formal divorce proceedings: For the Brexit process, it really is up to the British to make up their minds, in terms of when to start and how to get it on the road. I think, in the end, it will be the British economy that is damaged most, which I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hope for but, I mean, this is my concern. Here is our full story on Sports Direct, whose biggest investors have met with the board and are demanding an independent review of working practices and governance: Construction output was steady in July, faring better than expected a month after the Brexit vote. A zero rise in output in July followed a 1% drop in June, easily beating expectations of a 0.8% fall. It lowered the annual rate of contraction in output to 1.5% from 2.2% in June. Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics, says the construction figures form the ONS are the latest to suggest the economy held up better than expected following the EU referendum: The latest post-referendum official figures indicated that the construction sector held up better than expected in July, and the trade deficit narrowed, continuing the recent trend of relatively upbeat data. The upshot is that while it is still early days, the latest figures give us little reason to alter our view that the immediate impact of the vote to leave the EU will be less severe than many had anticipated. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade in goods deficit narrowed to \u00c2\u00a311.8bn in July, down \u00c2\u00a31.2bn compared with a year earlier. Exports increased by \u00c2\u00a3800m to \u00c2\u00a328.4bn, while imports fell \u00c2\u00a3300m to \u00c2\u00a336.6bn. The figures from the Office for National Statistics were roughly in line with expectations. This is the first full month of trade data since the Brexit vote on 23 June sent the pound sharply lower. Given a weaker pound makes British goods cheaper abroad, are we seeing a boost in these numbers? Figures published in Germany earlier revealed a surprise fall in exports in July, brining down the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus. Exports fell by 2.6% over the month, following a downwardly revised 0.2% increase in June. It was the sharpest fall in almost and year, and well below economists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations of a 0.25% increase. Imports also fell unexpectedly, by 0.7%. Economists had predicted a 0.8% rise. It brought Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus down to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac19.4bn in July from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac21.4bn in June. Carsten Brzeski, ING\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist for Germany and Austria, said the figures would add to concerns about growth in Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy: Forget July. The month of July was clearly not a good month for Germany. Not only did July see the German national soccer team leave the European Championships after the semi-final, it saw industrial and trade data taking a deep nosedive. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data confirm the picture already painted by earlier industrial data: the former powerful engine of the German economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201cindustry \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is stuttering. Either the entire industry took an early and long summer break, or Brexit and a general weakness in Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main export partners left another mark on the economy. A further cooling of the economy in the months ahead should give more support to just-started discussions about fiscal stimulus. Right now, the discussions only focus on minor tax cuts but they could easily grow into a general debate on more fiscal support for investment to increase the German economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s potential growth rate. The pound is up against both the dollar and the euro this morning, as we await the latest official UK data on trade and construction. The pound is up just a touch (0.02%) against the dollar at $1.3298, and 0.1% against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.273. Data out shortly is expected to show Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit with the rest of the world was \u00c2\u00a311.75bn in July. The government will be hoping that a weaker pound since the Brexit vote will drive exports up in the coming months and the trade deficit down. Construction data is expected to show that output on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s building sites fell 0.8% in July, following a 0.9% drop in June. There will be a press conference from Bratislava at 12pm local time (11am UK time). There should be a live stream here. The heat is on Athens: Investors are in a downbeat mood this morning, disappointed by Mario Draghi who failed to unleash any further monetary ammunition on Thursday. The FTSE 100 is down 13 points or 0.2%. FTSE 100: -0.2% at 6,846 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -0.3% at 10,644 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -0.2% at 4,533 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -0.1% at 17,361 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: +0.1% at 9,113 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: -0.3% at 348 Sports Direct, the under pressure retailer founded by Mike Ashley, has met with shareholder pressure group the Investor Forum about a way forward. The company is facing intense scrutiny over poor working practices and corporate governance, culminating on Wednesday with a fiery annual meeting. An emphatic 53% of independent investors voted against the re-election of chairman Keith Hellawell, who claimed he could regain their trust over the next 12 months but resign if he failed. The Investor Forum has now revealed that following the AGM it chaired a meeting between major shareholders and the Sports Direct board, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to discuss how trust can be re-built in the company and board.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Andy Griffiths, executive director of the Investor Forum: Independent shareholders have sent a clear message to the Board of Sports Direct through their votes at the AGM and in their public statements. We are encouraged by Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent open approach, publishing the working practices report and hosting an open day. These, however, are only the first steps in a long journey towards rebuilding trust and shareholder value. Our focus in the coming weeks will be on identifying key milestones to achieve this goal and, in particular, reaching agreement regarding the specific nature, remit and timing of the 360 and governance reviews. Facilitating a constructive dialogue on this will take on heightened importance over the next three months before the General Meeting required to re-elect the Chairman. The agenda for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurogroup meeting can be found here. Here is the outline for discussion on Greece: Greece \u00e2\u20ac\u201c state of play The Eurogroup will discuss the state of play of the macroeconomic adjustment programme to Greece. In particular, the Ministers are expected to be informed by the institutions and the Greek authorities on the implementation of the milestones and progress with arrears clearance, as defined in the Eurogroup statement on Greece of 25 May, as well as the next steps for the second review. The Eurogroup statement of 25 May indicates that the additional disbursement after the summer under the second tranche will be subject to the completion of milestones related to privatization, including the new Privatization and Investment Fund, bank governance, revenue agency and energy sector reforms as well as progress in clearing of net arrears. The tough words have begun in Bratislava, with a declaration Austria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister Hans J\u00c3\u00b6rg Schelling that Athens has not fulfilled its side of the bargain: Oil prices are also likely to influence equities this morning according to the Jasper Lawler from CMC Markets: Stocks in Europe look set for a lower open as investors continue to digest disappointment from the latest ECB meeting while a big drawdown in US oil inventories has sent Brent crude back towards $50 per barrel. Oil prices gained nearly 5% in 24 hours in response to American Petroleum Institute and Department of Energy inventory weekly figures. Storms Gaston and Hermene prevented imports coming in from Africa and the Middle East on the East Coast and its estimated US oil output may have dropped over 10% as rigs closed down. The huge two-day rebound in oil prices has been to a large extent ignored by stock markets and could play a bigger role on Friday, whether there is less corporate and economic data. Brent crude is down 1.2% at the moment however, at $49.35 a barrel. European markets are expected to open lower this morning. Investors were disappointed that Mario Draghi and his colleagues at the European Central Bank failed to announce more stimulus for the eurozone economy when they met yesterday. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. All eyes are on Greece again as eurozone finance ministers meet to discuss whether or not to hand over to Athens the next trance of emergency funding. Back in May, ministers agreed a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10.3bn funding package for Greece, with \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7.5bn handed over immediately. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurogroup meeting in Bratislava will be focused on whether or not to release the remaining \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.8bn. This is not necessarily going to be straightforward, given recent reports that Athens has met only two of the 15 reform measures agreed on with its eurozone partners. Stick with us for developments in Bratislava.",

Helena Smith reports from Athens:</p> <blockquote> <p>It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s September. The summer is over and the auditors are back. There is, and has always been, a cyclical quality to Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-running debt crisis but six years on it is a sense of d\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00a0 vu that comes against a background of poverty and immiseration made worse by the passage of time. Talks resumed today with inspectors focusing on accelerating the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-delayed privatisation program and rooting out corruption \u00e2\u20ac\u201c endemic and, as such, a major curse for the economy. </p> <p>Once again Athens has been told in no uncertain terms that the heat is on: failure to implement 15 major prior actions, or reforms, will result in non-disbursement of the next tranche of aid, at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.8bn vital for the debt-stricken economy. Publicly, the leftist-led government is keen to complete what will amount to a second review of the economy in the 13 months since it signed up to a third, \u00e2\u201a\u00ac86bn bailout as soon as possible. Finance ministry sources speak of September 29, when the next Euro working group is held, as a deadline.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7d7bb839be19359b56966624f131465e79a0312\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7d7bb839be19359b56966624f131465e79a0312/0_117_2554_1533/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alexis Tsipras.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alexis Tsipras.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexandros Avramidis/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>Creditors have also made clear that debt relief negotiations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c central for real economic recovery to even begin \u00e2\u20ac\u201c can only be countenanced once further austerity is enforced. Such policies would include abolishment of protection laws against mass lay-offs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a huge red line for the ruling Syriza party.</p> <p>And prime minister Alexis Tsipras, once the pin-up for anti-austerians Europe-wide, is feeling the heat. Latest polls have repeatedly shown the leftists to be trailing the main opposition centre right New Democracy party with approval ratings for Tsipras himself plummeting. One recent survey showed only 19% of Greeks viewed the leader favorably with a massive 85% dissatisfied with a government they had initially voted in to dismantle policies blamed for run-away unemployment and soaring impoverishment. The leftists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 penchant for replacing cuts with taxes has exacerbated the disgruntlement.

Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>US stock markets have managed to regain their composure this afternoon, bouncing off the lows for the time being. What has been widely heralded as a result of hawkish comments from the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rosengren seems to have had as much to do about the implications of finally breaking out of a two month lull in US indices. Volumes and thus volatility seem to be back, much to the joy of traders worldwide.</p> <p>Given that Rosengren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech signified a no more divisive message than we have already heard from him and other Fed members, it seems the key is in the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s willingness to run with it as the curtains fall on the holiday season. This afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech from Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brainard represents the final appearance before the pre-meeting blackout period.

                "bodyText":"Federal Reserve governor Lael Brainard, a noted dove at the central bank, has hinted that it should not raise interest rates too quickly. In the last scheduled speech from a Fed official before the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate setting committee meets next week, she set a notably more cautious tone about the economy. This contrasts with recent comments from other Fed members suggesting a possible rate rise at next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank meeting, which were partly responsible for volatile stock market movements in the last couple of days. Speaking in Chicago, Brainard said the Fed must be careful not to remove its monetary stimulus too quickly because of potential weakness in the jobs market and the risk of foreign economic downturns. Saying the jobs market might be further from full strength than some economists believe, which meant \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the caste to tighten policy pre-emptively is less compelling.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Her comments are being live-streamed here and her speech is here. The dollar has lost more than 1% against the yen and is down 0.4% against the pound after her comments were released, while on Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 118 points or 0.64%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Over in Greece, mission chiefs representing international creditors have returned to the country to begin what is likely to be another contentious review of the economy. Helena Smith reports from Athens: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s September. The summer is over and the auditors are back. There is, and has always been, a cyclical quality to Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-running debt crisis but six years on it is a sense of d\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00a0 vu that comes against a background of poverty and immiseration made worse by the passage of time. Talks resumed today with inspectors focusing on accelerating the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-delayed privatisation program and rooting out corruption \u00e2\u20ac\u201c endemic and, as such, a major curse for the economy. Once again Athens has been told in no uncertain terms that the heat is on: failure to implement 15 major prior actions, or reforms, will result in non-disbursement of the next tranche of aid, at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.8bn vital for the debt-stricken economy. Publicly, the leftist-led government is keen to complete what will amount to a second review of the economy in the 13 months since it signed up to a third, \u00e2\u201a\u00ac86bn bailout as soon as possible. Finance ministry sources speak of September 29, when the next Euro working group is held, as a deadline. Creditors have also made clear that debt relief negotiations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c central for real economic recovery to even begin \u00e2\u20ac\u201c can only be countenanced once further austerity is enforced. Such policies would include abolishment of protection laws against mass lay-offs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a huge red line for the ruling Syriza party. And prime minister Alexis Tsipras, once the pin-up for anti-austerians Europe-wide, is feeling the heat. Latest polls have repeatedly shown the leftists to be trailing the main opposition centre right New Democracy party with approval ratings for Tsipras himself plummeting. One recent survey showed only 19% of Greeks viewed the leader favorably with a massive 85% dissatisfied with a government they had initially voted in to dismantle policies blamed for run-away unemployment and soaring impoverishment. The leftists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 penchant for replacing cuts with taxes has exacerbated the disgruntlement. All of which is why few believe this latest chapter will end anytime soon - with ever growing numbers believing that Greece will only regain competitiveness when it eventually leaves the eurozone. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 76.05 points or 1.12% at 6700.90, its lowest level since the start of August Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax was down 1.34% at 10,431.77 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 1.15% lower at 4439.80 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 1.84% to 16,840.28 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 1.76% lower at 8866.6 In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.68% to 557.25 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 63 points or 0.36%. After early plunges this morning, European markets have recovered from their worst levels. For much of the day the FTSE 100 was suffering its worst day since the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote in June, with a similar story on the Dax. Much of the falls came after Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments from Federal Reserve members suggesting a US rate rise was possible next week, with the news of Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s illness adding to the uncertainty. But Wall Street regained its poise and in turn gave a lift to European markets. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: US stock markets have managed to regain their composure this afternoon, bouncing off the lows for the time being. What has been widely heralded as a result of hawkish comments from the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rosengren seems to have had as much to do about the implications of finally breaking out of a two month lull in US indices. Volumes and thus volatility seem to be back, much to the joy of traders worldwide. Given that Rosengren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech signified a no more divisive message than we have already heard from him and other Fed members, it seems the key is in the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s willingness to run with it as the curtains fall on the holiday season. This afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech from Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brainard represents the final appearance before the pre-meeting blackout period. The noted dove is expected to temper fears sparked by Rosengren, yet with market sensitivity heightened, any shift in tone could set markets on their way once more. As part of its economic stimulus measures, the Bank of England has announced it will start buying \u00c2\u00a310bn worth of corporate bonds on September 27. It will hold three reverse auctions a week and will spread the purchases over 18 months. It said the bonds would need to be issued by companies that make a significant contribution to the economy, and were not part of the financial services sector. In the corporate world, Marks &amp; Spencer has just announced that executive director Laura Wade-Gery will not return to the retailer following her maternity leave. She will step down from the board immediately and leave the company at the end of this month. Wall Street has recovered some ground ahead of a speech by US Federal Reserve governor Lael Brainard in Chicago. This is scheduled to be the last major Fed speech before next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting of the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate setting committee, so will be scrutinised for clues as to whether a rate rise is likely or not. With Brainard being notably dovish on Fed policy, any change in her tone could be significant. But investors seem to have calmed down after Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talk of a rate rise sent global markets tumbling. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now up 50 points or 0.28%, while the FTSE 100 has come off its worst levels. The UK index is down 81 points, hovering near its worst level since the immediate post-Brexit decline. Oil prices are under pressure again as hopes of an agreement by major producers to stablise the market faded once more. The falls came after OPEC said output from producers outside the organisation was stronger than expected. It forecast a fall in non-OPEC production of 610,000 barrels a day this year, which is 180,000 barrels less than previously expected, after American output held up despite lower prices. And OPEC raised its predictions for next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s production from non-member counties. Reuters reports: OPEC raised its forecast of oil supplies from non-member countries in 2017 as new fields come online and U.S. shale drillers prove more resilient than expected to cheap crude, pointing to a larger surplus in the market next year. Demand for crude from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will average 32.48 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2017, OPEC said in a monthly report on Monday. That is down from the previous forecast of 33.01 million bpd. The prospect of a larger surplus than expected adds to the challenge of OPEC and non-members such as Russia, who are making a renewed attempt to restrain supplies. Oil is trading at $47 a barrel, half its level of mid-2014, as a supply glut that OPEC hoped cheap oil would banish sticks around. OPEC revised up its 2016 and 2017 non-OPEC supply forecasts, citing factors including the start up of Kazakhstan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kashagan oilfield and a lower-than-expected decline in U.S. shale output, and said the immediate outlook was for more production. So Brent crude is currently down 1.17% at $47.45 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - has fallen 1.29% to $45.29. The global market slump which began on Friday with Wall Street and moved to Asia and Europe has continued with the re-opening of the US market after the weekend break. After renewed concerns about a US rate rise next week, came the news of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s illness which added to the uncertain mood for investors. But the opening fall was not as bad as initial estimates had suggested. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 34 points or 0.19% after talk of a three digit decline. Not everyone is convinced that Fed board member Dennis Lockhart is right about wage growth accelerating: After six hours of lively trading, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is still heading for its worst day since the end of June. The FTSE 100 is down 102 points right now, a drop of over 1.5%, at 6673. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stocks are deeper in the red, as investors continue to worry that central bankers might be running out of ammunition. The big speech of the day, from the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Lael Brainard isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t due until 6.15pm, when European markets will have closed. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx says: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of those days where it is hard to pluck any nuance from the blanket market movements. The FTSE, DAX and CAC are all haemorrhaging points to the tune of 1.6%, 2% and 2.1% respectively, marking an aggressive intensification of the losses each index saw at the start of the day. Part of the problem is that these rate hike worries have really hit the commodity sector, with UK oil and mining stocks especially clogging up the morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losers list. Despite most of the blame being pinned on the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed fears the Dow Jones futures are currently signalling a US open that isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite as bad as what is going on in Europe. Newsflash: Federal Reserve policymaker Dennis Lockhart has just calmed some nerves about a rate hike next week. Lockhart, the president of the Atlanta Fed, told an audience that there should be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153serious discussion\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about raising interest rates. But he also cautioned that wage growth doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be feeding through to the inflation rate; a hint that rates don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to go up yet? That may protect Wall Street from heavy losses when the market opens in 45 minutes. Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari has moved swiftly to rebut Donald Trump. Kashkari insists that the Fed is independent of the White House, and sets monetary policy on the economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s merits. He told CNBC that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Politics simply does not come up. We look at the economic data and ... everyone around the table is committed to achieving our dual mandate.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has just weighed in - warning Americans that interest rates won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay at their near record-lows forever. Speaking on CNBC, Trump reminded the nation that US interest rates once hit 21% under Jimmy Carter. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to happen when interest rates could go up? And they could go up.... We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re living like there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no interest rates, because we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re paying almost no interest. In a typically rumbustious performance, Trump also claimed that the Federal Reserve \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even close to being independent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Fed chair Janet Yellen should be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ashamed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to have kept interest rates so low to assist Barack Obama, he added. Shares in Associated British Foods have now slumped by 11%, as the City slams it for a disappointing trading update today. The Brexit vote is partly to blame; the fall in the pound will drive up costs at its Primark operation next year. But it has also suffered weaker sales, which it blames on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (predictably) unpredictable climate (basically it was too warm before Christmas, and then too cold in early spring). Celebrities and top politicians are trying their hand at City trading today, as part of the annual BGC charity day. This is the 12th time that BGC Partners and Cantor Fitzgerald have held the event, to remember the loss of 700 employees in the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centre. All today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revenues go to various charities; and actress Joanna Lumley, London Mayor Sadiq Khan , TV presented Davina McCall and top cyclist Mark Cavendish have already done their bit. Traders in New York are waking up to the news that Asian and European markets have fallen back today. Wall Street started this selloff on Friday, when the Dow fell by 2%, or almost 400 points. The futures market is predicting that the Dow will shed another 112 points, or 0.6%, when trading begins in two and a half hours. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about Samsung, whose valuation slumped by $14bn today thanks to its problem with exploding smartphones: Credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has urged us not to get carried away by recent encouraging UK economic data. In a new report, just released, S&amp;P warn that July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s encouraging inflation, retail sales and unemployment figures might just be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mirage\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, not an accurate signal. S&amp;P analyst Sophie Tahiri says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The uncertainty surrounding the U.K\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future outside of the E.U. and the associated economic risks, which we think are pronounced and predominantly skewed to the downside, will gradually take its toll, particularly on investment, as businesses start dealing with the new Brexit reality\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We get updated economic data on the UK this week (inflation on Tuesday, unemployment on Wenesday), which will show how August played out. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mid-cap index, which includes companies too small for the FTSE 100, is also falling sharply today. The FTSE 250 has fallen by 1.5%, or 256 points, this morning. Challenger bank Aldermore is down 5.2%, while oil consultancy firm Amec Foster has lost 4.6%. Again, speculation that the US Federal Reserve might whip away the punchbowl by raising interest rates soon is being blamed. Chris Beauchamp of City firm IG, says this afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech from Fed official Lael Brainard is looming over the markets (reminder, she speaks at 6.15pm BST). Investors are terribly worried that she might hint at a rate hike. The blame has been pinned on the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eric Rosengren, but he hardly said anything novel on Friday, warning as he did that rates would probably rise gradually. With so little on the calendar for today the speech by Fed member Lael Brainard has acquired a greater degree of importance, with any departure from her previous dovish stance likely to occasion some degree of additional panic. The term \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sea of red\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd can be abused, but today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market action certainly deserves it. As the tweet below show: Shares are down, with some markets shedding 2% Most currencies have fallen against the US dollar, most government bond prices have fallen, pushing up yields The cost of insuring government debt through a credit default is rising And oil and metal prices are dropping. I mentioned earlier that the Greek debt crisis was bubbling up again, after prime minister Tsipras attacked the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors. And we now have fresh signs that Europe is losing patience with Athens. Brussels officials are briefing that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re unhappy about the slow pace of reforms, and warning that the next slice of bailout funds (worth \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.8bn) won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be handed over until the situation improves. Here are the newswire snaps: The Athens stock market is already the worst-performing European market today, down by 3.2%. Minouche Shafik\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprise resignation means the Bank of England must hand someone else the job of unwinding its quantitative easing stimulus programme (this was one of her key responsibilities). The Brexit vote, though, means exiting QE has fallen down the agenda -- there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more chance of the BoE expanding the scheme, if it fears we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re heading into recession.... Newsflash: Bank of England deputy governor Nemat \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Minouche\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shafik is leaving the BoE next February. Shafik, who only joined the BoE two years ago, will move to the London School of Economics, to become its next director (the top role at the LSE). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a surprise move -- Minouche became one of the most powerful women in UK finance when she became the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first deputy governor, on a five-year term. She currently oversees banking and markets at the central bank. Governor Mark Carney says : We will say farewell to Minouche with gratitude and regret. She helped drive vital reforms on the domestic and international stages, perhaps most prominently in the successful completion of the Fair and Effective Markets Review which she co-chaired. Central bank stimulus packages have been a massive factor in driving up asset prices since the financial crisis; today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff show investors are worrying that the party is over. Conor Deering of City firm Clear Treasury explains: There are several factors at play here, the key one of course being the continued uncertainty around whether the Fed will act on lifting US interest rates as early as next week. The other more recent matter being the ECB and their decision not to extend QE at last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy meeting. We have also had some disappointments from the Bank of Japan, with no sign of helicopter money or the 100 year bond, policies which had been eagerly anticipated. The question now is, have central banks started to change their tune on fiscal stimulus and its effectiveness? There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an old market mantra that when shares fall, bonds should rise. The logic is that as investors abandon risky equity, they put their money in safe-haven government debt instead. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not happening today - instead, shares AND bonds are falling, in sync. That suggests that the City is particularly nervous today, as it ponders whether central banks can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be relied on to push prices ever higher. Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market had a particularly bad day, closing 3.3% lower, with every share dropping. Commodity prices are also taking a beating this morning. Copper and iron have both hit its lowest level since June, while the oil price has shed 1.7% to $47.40 per barrel. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a consequence of the US dollar rallying, on the back of talk of an interest rate hike soon. Niv Dagan, executive director at Peak Asset Management LLC in Melbourne, told Bloomberg Radio that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Central banks are reluctant to add additional stimulus and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s causing a lot of concern.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We expect additional downside in the near term. You want to wait and see and remain cautious. After an hour of volatile trading, the FTSE 100 is down 107 points at 6669, a five-week low. Asian shareholders are nursing some bruises tonight: It was particularly bloody in South Korea, where Samsung\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares tumbled over 6% after it warned that its flagship Note 7 phone might catch fire. Customers have been told to turn the devices off and get a replacement.... European stock markets aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a pretty picture this morning, as they head for their biggest one-day loss since late June. Virtually every share on the FTSE 100 index is falling this morning. That has dragged the blue-chip index down to a five-week low, as it suffers its biggest fall since the EU referendum results. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the damage: Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct blames a cocktail of worries: Markets finished last week with a rather tumultuous backdrop of rising oil inventories and the resurgent prospect of a US rate hike. This certainly rattled sentiments, but as the new week gets underway there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already another factor investors are having to contend with as questions are asked over the health of Hilary Clinton, just as the US Presidential campaign reaches a critical point. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wave of risk aversion\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd gripping markets today could be the start of a serious correction, warns FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga: Global stocks may be poised for steeper losses if the combination of central bank caution and fading optimism towards the effectiveness of stimulus measures forces investors to scatter from riskier assets. With concerns still elevated over the health of the global economy and the oversupply woes ensuring oil prices remain depressed, stock markets could be set for a heavy selloff. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re off! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index of blue chip shares has fallen by 89 points at the start of trading, a drop of 1.3%. The City is following the selloff in Asia, driven by fears that central banks may be running out of ammunition with which to stimulate the global economy. Mining companies are leading the rout, with BHP Billiton down 4.4% and Anglo American losing 4.3%. They might suffer if US interest rates are raised next week, as a stronger dollar might hurt growth in emerging markets. And there are biggest losses in Europe, with the Frankfurt exchange leading the way down... German DAX: -1.9% France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -1.6% Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX : -1.9% Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -1.6% Concerns over Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health are also hitting shares today, after the Democratic presidential nominee was diagnosed with pneumonia. Mike Van Dulken of Accendo Markets says Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s illnesss may alarm Wall Street, and prompt \u00e2\u20ac\u0153further pessimistic trading from our counterparts across the Atlantic today\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Government bonds are also suffering a selloff this morning, driving prices down their lowest levels in three months. That also shows angst that central banks may soon rein in their stimulus levels. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-year bond yield (the interest rate on the debt) has jumped to 0.03% - up from 0.016% on Friday. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still an astonishingly low rate, but perhaps the long bull market in bonds is turning a corner? Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi helped spark the selloff; last week, Draghi dampened expectations that the ECB might boost its QE bond-buying programme. Bondholders suddenly didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like the idea of holding onto a negative-yielding asset which could fall in price if there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no central banking buying alongside them. Stock market volatility has also spiked this morning, showing that investors are more nervous: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest report on the Asian market selloff: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Summer is over, folks. Global stock markets are falling today as investors fret that central banks may end the stimulus measures that have bathed them in cheap money for years. Anxiety that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve may raise interest rates next week is driving shares down, after several weeks of market calm. And there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also lingering disappointment that the European Central Bank didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even discuss extending its quantitative easing programme last Thursday. That has already prompted significant falls in Asia, where Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei shed 1.7% and the Australian market lost more than 2%. And European markets are expected to follow suit when trading begins at 8am BST, extending Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. IG are predicting that the FTSE 100 will fall by almost 100 points at the open. That would put it on track for its biggest loss since the aftermath of the EU referendum in June. Shareholders are looking nervously at America, for signs that the Fed might hike borrowing costs for the first time this year at its September 21 meeting. One policymaker, Lail Brainard, is giving a speech tonight...and may show her hand. Brainard is a dovish member of the Fed, so any hint of an imminent rate hike could cause alarm on Wall Street. Elsa Lignos, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets, says: Brainard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech today takes on undue importance, as the timing of a speech by the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most noted dove, just ahead of the FOMC blackout period, is too much of a coincidence for some.... Brainard speaks at 1.15pm Washington time, or 6.15pm in the UK. Investors are also getting jittery about Greece again, after eurozone finance ministers told Athens to get serious about implementing reforms. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras hit back last night, claiming that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153constant clashes and disagreements\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd between Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors are holding the country back. On the corporate front, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting results from Associated British Foods (which owns fashion chain Primark) and infrastructure group John Laing. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no much economic data in the diary, though, to distract investors from worrying about those central banks....",

                "bodyText":"It was another nervous day for investors, albeit with rather less dramatic market moves than they have endured recently. The usual concerns remained, including whether or not the US Federal Reserve would indeed raise interest rates next week, and a continuing slide in the oil price despite an unexpected fall in US oil stocks. UK unemployment figures did little to rock the boat ahead of the latest Bank of England meeting on Thursday (where rates and its quantitative easing programme are expected to remain unchanged.) But London shares snapped out of a three day losing streak - just - with some support from mining groups after positive economic signs from key commodities consumer China. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 edged up 7.68 points or 0.12% to 6673.31 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.08% to 10,378.40 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.39% at 4370.26 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.05% to 16,539.90 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.25% at 8702.4 In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.15% to 556.13 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 38 points or 0.21% higher. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Over in Greece, and there are further tensions between the government and its creditors. Reuters reports: Greece will tell its creditors it cannot comply with labour reforms demanded by the International Monetary Fund as a condition of its support for the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third bailout, its labour minister told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday. The leftist government considers the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demand as a ban on the right of workers to negotiate wages and conditions on a collective basis. A breakdown with the IMF on the issue could jeopardise its financing of the 86 billion euro ($96 billion) bailout and could undermine overall confidence in the deal. Labour Minister George Katrougalos, speaking a few hours before meeting with the heads of an EU-IMF mission on labour issues, said Athens would fight to revive collective bargaining and described the IMF as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an extreme player\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We want to reinstate collective bargaining because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the core of the European social model,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Katrougalos said. Under previous bailouts, collective bargaining has been weakened. Both the IMF and the EU say an inflexible labour force has helped to make Greece uncompetitive, contributing to its economic malaise. Katrougalos also said the minimum wage in Greece, now at 586 euros, should be determined by social partners - workers and employers - and not by the state, as demanded by the lenders. Other issues that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors have put on the negotiating table include relaxing laws on mass dismissals and allowing employers to shut down their businesses and lock out workers in the event of industrial action, he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These are measures which employers have already rejected in Greece,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Katrougalos said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve reached a point where we can no longer tolerate the deterioration of Greek workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 status.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Still on oil Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: The price of oil erased early gains as traders resumed bearish bets on speculation that Libya will soon be in a position to begin exports again. The losses come after the American Petroleum Institute reported a build in weekly oil inventories. The price did have a brief rally after DOE data showed a surprise draw, but within half-an-hour of the data made new lows of the day. All indications are that the biggest drawdown in 17 years seen in last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inventory figures was an aberration. Oil prices continued their slide despite US crude inventories showing a surprise fall last week. According to the Energy Information Administration, crude stocks fell by 559,000 barrels compared with expectations of a 3.8m increase. But gasoline stocks rose by a more than expected 567,000, compared to forecasts of a 343,000 gain. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, were also much higher than expected, rising by 4.6m barrels instead of the forecast 1.5m barrel increase. After an initial rebound as the figures came out, Brent crude is now down 1.32% at $46.48 while West Texas Intermediate is 1.43% lower at $44.26. In case you missed it, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of England governor Mark Carney testing the durability of the new \u00c2\u00a35 note: After Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off on the US market, Wall Street has opened marginally higher in early trading. But with continuing nervousness over the prospect of a US rate rise next week, along with weakness in the oil price, it is hardly a convincing move: the Dow Jones Industrial Average has edged up just 11 points or 0.07%. For the Star Wars fans: Ahead of the latest US oil inventory figures, crude prices are on the slide once more. Brent is down 0.74% at $46.75 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - has fallen 0.65% to $44.61 on continuing concerns about oversupply amid falling demand. Earlier prices had been supported by a report overnight from the American Petroleum Institute that crude stocks had risen by a lower than expected 1.4m barrels last week, compared to estimates of a 3.8m increase. Oanda senior market analyst Jeffrey Halley told Reuters: Long suffering oil bulls will now turn nervously to the US Energy Information Administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commercial crude inventory numbers. It was an unexpected undershoot in these numbers last week that set off the rally in crude last week. Elsewhere in the markets, the pound is bobbing around the $1.319 mark. Traders are waiting for the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next monetary policy decision, tomorrow, although few fireworks are expected. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decent jobs survey, following a shock-free inflation report yesterday, means the BoE will surely leave things unchanged. Last month it slashed interest rates to a fresh record low of 0.25%, and boosted its QE programme by up to \u00c2\u00a360bn. A growing number of experts believe the baton is being passed back from central bankers to national governments, who could boost spending to encourage growth. Ranjiv Mann, head of economic research at Rogge Global Partners, says the BoE is looking to Westminster for a fiscal response to the Brexit vote. But does chancellor Phillip Hammond have much flexibility? Mann says: The question is how much the government is willing to do in the short term? With debt levels at historic highs, there are constraints from both a credibility and fiscal perspective. The government knows it must proceed with caution and address concerns about how it will balance the budget over the medium term. Just how loose UK fiscal policy becomes will play a key role in determining the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s longer term actions. Even if the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Autumn statement delivers a much looser fiscal stance sufficient to reduce some growth worries, the BoE is set to maintain its dovish policy stance for years to come. In the meantime, Mark Carney can enjoy the launch of the new plastic \u00c2\u00a35 note (which he saw fit to dip into a bubbling pot of curry yesterday): Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment report has helped to push shares higher in London. The FTSE 100 had gained 37 points, or 0.55%, to 6073, outpacing European markets (Germany is up a bit, and France is flat). City investors are reassured that the unemployment total fell in the last quarter, and that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no sign that firms are cutting hiring. Obviously it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still early days. And Neil Wilson, markets analyst at ETX Capital, says investors will reserve judgement until more data emerges. Vacancies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a critical gauge of employer intentions and confidence - remained high, rising slightly to 752,000. Wage growth slipped a tad but remained pretty solid and above the average of recent years. On the downside, a big jump in self-employed numbers could be a cause for concern and the total number of hours worked didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rise much. But the official figures seem to contradict some of the anecdotal evidence following the June vote. CEB had found that number of jobs vacancies slumped by 700,000 in the week after Brexit, while the REC reported a sharp deterioration in the jobs market in July. So far these downcast assessments have not been backed up by the official data, but we will need a bit longer to get a clearer picture of how the labour market has been hit. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about the unemployment report: Although most of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report is pretty decent, the slowdown in pay growth is a significant worry. The big fear is that inflation spikes, as firms pass on higher import costs, meaning real wages (adjusted for inflation) are eroded. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady says the government must make \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a real effort\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to push wages up. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need investment now to create more decent, well-paid jobs, and an end to the public sector pay cap. And the government should stick by its promise to give the lowest paid a pay rise, with increases in the national living wage.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Resolution Foundation have sent over two charts, showing how real wages haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reached their pre-crisis levels: Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job recovery is rolling on... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unemployment is falling, jobs are being created and earnings are heading up. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobless rate is half that of the euro area.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Encouragingly, UK firms are actually advertising MORE jobs than a month ago. Kallum Pickering of German bank Berenberg says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good news: After the Brexit vote, we had expected firms to exercise a greater level of caution, implying a fall in vacancies. Most surprisingly, the number of job vacancies rose modestly to 752k in August. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Labour Market report jobs report shows \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no immediate impact\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum. But he also emphasises that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early days -- if there is a Brexit shock, the jobs market won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t show it first. Hawksworth explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Overall, the latest labour market data suggest some cooling down of the rapid pace of UK jobs growth seen in the period before the referendum, but with no indication yet of a significant rise in unemployment. This is consistent with other broadly reassuring economic data for the post-referendum period, which point to a moderation of growth rather than a recession. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, unemployment tends to be a lagging indicator, as companies will take time to adjust their hiring plans to the post-referendum world. So it will be some months before we can reach firm conclusions on the labour market impact of the Brexit vote.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public sector has shrunk again. The Office for National Statistics reports that there were 5.33 million people employed in the public sector for June 2016. This was: 13,000 fewer than for March 2016 20,000 fewer than for a year earlier the lowest since comparable records began in 1999 The public sector is now just 16.8% of the total workforce; again, the lowest since at least 1999. Professor Geraint Johnes, Director of Research at The Work Foundation, says more people are returning to the labour force. That means employers haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t had to offer wage hikes to attract new staff. He explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There have been substantial gains in the numbers of workers in full-time jobs, be they employees or self-employed. Much of this gain comes from a reduction in the number of economically inactive people, a trend that looks set to continue. It is still therefore the case that expansion continues without imposing significant wage pressures.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This chart shows how UK wage growth has been bobbing around the 2%-2.3% zone for some time. The Department of Work and Pensions have tweeted some key points from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report (which is online here) The fall in unemployment between May and July suggests British firms weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spooked by the results of the EU referendum on June 23. Joshua Raymond at City firm XTB.com says we should still be cautious. With no immediate negative change in jobless circumstances, it seems UK business held fire from making immediate and sharp changes in hiring and firing [after the Brexit vote]. The UK employment rate remains the highest since records began, at 74.5%. However, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth reminding that this data only shows the knee jerk reaction from the Brexit vote, not Brexit itself. Any positive data over the past month in reaction to Brexit should be considered a mirage and not a vote of confidence in the UK itself despite Brexit, at least just yet. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also concerned by the decline in wage growth: UK average earnings slowed sharper than expected to 2.1% from 2.3%, which could become troublesome if UK inflation continues to rise due to the weak pound, and could create a contraction in real earnings.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd City experts are concerned that wage growth has slowed to just 2.1% (ex bonuses). The Resolution Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Duncan Weldon fears that real wages will be eroded by inflation in the coming months, as the weak pound drives up import costs. Economist Rupert Seggins shows how wages are slowing (blue) just as inflation rises (in red) UK inflation remained at 0.6% in August, but some experts predict it will jump in the months ahead. The unemployment report also shows that wage growth has slowed. Average earnings, excluding bonuses, rose by just 2.1% in the three months to July, down from 2.3% a month ago. And if you include bonuses, earnings rose by 2.3% during the quarter - down from 2.5%. Breaking! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment report shows little evidence that the Brexit vote has hurt the economy (yet, anyway). The number of people out of work fell by 39,000 in the three months to July, which means the unemployment rate remains at 4.9%. The employment total has jumped again too -- by an impressive 174,000 -- taking the total to 31.77 million. But the number of people signing on for unemployment benefit has gone up, by 2,000, to 771,000. More to follow. Significant news from China: the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks made 948bn yuan (\u00c2\u00a3107bn) worth of new loans in August, twice as much as in July. That suggests Beijing is keeping its economy stimulated, and preventing a credit crunch gripping its banking sector. One fund manager tweets: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment report, due in under 30 minutes, may show a worrying squeeze in take home pay. Ana Thaker, market economist at PhillipCapital UK, says: UK Unemployment data is set to show the labour market has remained resilient with unemployment steady at +4.9%. This will be welcomed by the Bank of England but the expected drop in average earnings to +2.1% could be a cause for concern. Average earnings, and a dip in them, could have real consequences on impending retail sales data and consumer expenditure figures, adversely affecting growth in the long term. The Bank of England prioritises average earnings figures, and we could see them act if it looks like a downtrend could prevail. Two luxury goods groups have sent a shiver through the markets this morning. Herm\u00c3\u00a8s International has abandoned its annual sales growth target, blaming \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 a lot of uncertainty around the world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Shares in the French high fashion chain, which makes perfume, handbags, shoes, etc have slumped by 6% in early trading. Richemont, the owner of watch brand Cartier, is also suffering. It hit shareholders with a profits warning this morning, after suffering a 14% slide in sales in the last five months. Its shares are down 4%, as traders fear that the luxury market is cooling. Bloomberg says the warnings reflecting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the challenges facing luxury-goods companies from weaker demand in Asia and a decline in tourism in Europe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Rising sharply, then plunging with stomach-churning speed, and occasionally ending up in a nasty crash. No, not the global stock markets. This is drone racing, in which enthusiasts fly small aerial vehicles around a track as fast as they dare, dodging obstacles on the way. And this new sport has just received a dose of cash from Sky, which has told the City its investing $1m (\u00c2\u00a3770,000) in the Drone Racing League. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll broadcast action from five races, climaxing in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a winner-take-all world championship to crown the best drone pilot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also promising a new race, at an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153iconic venue in London\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (fingers crossed for the House of Commons). And if you couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell Drone Racing from the Drones Club, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some action: Asian stock markets have slipped to six-week lows this morning, knocking 0.6% off the Chinese and Japanese indices. And bond prices are also slipping, having recently soared to record highs. Reuters explains why: Bond markets have come under pressure in recent days from unease about a possible U.S. rate hike this month, news that theBank of Japan is studying ways to steepen the bond yield curve and disappointment at the lack of clear forward-action plan by the European Central Bank at last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. (yields, or interest rates, rise when prices fall). Financial traders are getting edgy because they fear the US central bank might raise interest rates soon, even though the global economy looks fragile. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, explains that next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve meeting is on everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mind. Lower global demand has made investors uncomfortable with the idea that the Fed is still gritty to increase the interest rate. The fact is that investors do not mind if the Fed is going to hike up the interest rate, as this was the situation a few months ago. What is making them wary is that the economic data has started to deteriorate and the Fed has very solid stance with respect to a rate hike. And there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of bearish chatter in the markets this morning, as experts worry that central banks may be running out of firepower. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kit Juckes of Societe Generale: And Jamie McGeever of Reuters: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Once again, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be squinting at the economic tealeaves for signs that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has either shrugged off June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote, or been dragged down by it. At 9.30am, the latest UK unemployment report will how how many people signed on for jobseeker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s allowance in August. It will also show whether the unemployment rate remained at just 4.9%, in the three months to July, and whether real wages kept rising. This is the first jobs report to fully cover the dramatic weeks after the EU referendum. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably too early to see any significant impact -- but there may be some early signals.... Analysts at RBC Capital Markets explain: Although employment gains are set to slow markedly in coming months on this occasion even if the level holds flat with that seen in June it would result in increased employment of over 150k in the last three months. We look for the unemployment rate to hold at 4.9% and for average earnings growth to slow a little; the including bonus measure should come at 2%, year-on-year, and the ex-bonus measure at 2.1%. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets reckons the jobless rate could actually fall, to 4.8%,. He points out that last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report showed a surprise fall in people \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsigning on\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for unemployment benefit. Given the decline in jobless claims in July this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ILO unemployment number for July is likely to remain unchanged at 4.9%, and could even improve to 4.8% at a pinch, which would suggest for now little evidence of a negative spill over. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a lot of angst in the financial markets today. Investors are fretting about central bank policymaking, with the US Federal Reserve making a decision on interest rates next week. Oil is also a concern, with predictions of an energy glut until mid-2017. So shares have dropped in Asia overnight, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expecting a quietish morning in Europe.",

Earlier this month new data also showed there has been a 20% rise in the number of people employed on zero-hour contracts, to 900,000, over the last year.</p> <p>Stefan Stern, director of the High Pay Centre said bonuses had their uses but must be handled with care and he highlighted the return to levels last seen when the financial crisis struck in 2008.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153On the one hand, you could see why some employers would want to recognise people and reward them and say \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWe are through the worst of it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. But on the other hand, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a worry that bad habits could return \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I think small bonuses are perhaps a good idea but big bonuses are potentially very dangerous if they encourage people to take excessive risks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd<br></p> <p>David Hillman, with the Robin Hood Tax campaign, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Once again these figures show that financial sector bonuses are way out of kilter with the rest of the economy. There is a long way to go before the excess of the City is curbed and this huge gulf in rewards between bankers and the public sector is addressed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>The City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual bonus round was a feature of the boom years in the early part of the 2000s, but the credit crunch, job losses and a clampdown on some of the riskier activities produced a sharp reduction in the payouts made by banks and other financial companies. The EU also introduced rules designed to limit City bonuses, although the rules actually resulted in many workers demanding higher basic pay. <br></p> <p>But bonus payments have gradually picked up again.</p> <p>The ONS data shows that finance and insurance remained the biggest contributor to the total. Employers in the sector handed out bonuses of \u00c2\u00a313.9bn to their staff last year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an increase of 2.2% from a year earlier. But other sectors, such as IT and communication services \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including marketing, advertising and PR \u00e2\u20ac\u201c contributed more to growth as bonuses at non-financial companies rose 5.4% to \u00c2\u00a330.4bn.<br></p> <p>The rewards on offer in the communications business were highlighted when WPP, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest advertising company, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/08/sir-martin-sorrell-pay-deal-faces-investor-revolt-at-wpp-agm\">paid its founder and boss Sir Martin Sorrell almost \u00c2\u00a367m in bonuses</a> for last year. WPP suffered a shareholder rebellion, but approved the payout.

                "bodyText":"Eight years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers sparked a global financial crisis, the spread of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bonus culture from the bankers of the City to the hi-tech startups of London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shoreditch has seen pay top-ups leap to a new record level. While regular pay growth has remained modest for most UK workers, generous bonuses at firms outside the financial sector have pushed bonuses above their previous pre-financial crisis peak. Total bonus payouts in the year to the end of March rose 4.4% to \u00c2\u00a344.3bn, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with the biggest cash payments still going to the financial services sector. The total in cash terms beat the record of \u00c2\u00a342.5bn that had stood for the past eight years \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and threatens to reignite controversy about how key staff are remunerated. Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153UK workers have suffered the biggest fall in wages of any developed country apart from Greece. They are still paying the price for the financial crash. For millions of hard-pressed families, these figures will just add fresh salt to the wounds. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Theresa May says she wants a Britain that works for the many, not just the privileged few. What better way to show she means business than by clamping down on mega bonuses and excessive pay at the top.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The new prime minister has made tackling inequality a key pledge after the Brexit vote highlighted the scale of public anger at the growing gap between rich and poor. May has promised to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reform capitalism so that it works for everyone, not just the privileged few\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and also criticised fat cat pay. The new prime minister wants companies to publish the ratio between the chief executive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay and the average company worker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay, and it has emerged that the powerful Commons business committee will on Friday launch a wide-ranging inquiry into the make-up of company boards and executive pay. Latest official figures show that regular earnings growth has slowed since the EU referendum and in a sign of continued insecurity in the workplace. Earlier this month new data also showed there has been a 20% rise in the number of people employed on zero-hour contracts, to 900,000, over the last year. Stefan Stern, director of the High Pay Centre said bonuses had their uses but must be handled with care and he highlighted the return to levels last seen when the financial crisis struck in 2008. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153On the one hand, you could see why some employers would want to recognise people and reward them and say \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWe are through the worst of it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. But on the other hand, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a worry that bad habits could return \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I think small bonuses are perhaps a good idea but big bonuses are potentially very dangerous if they encourage people to take excessive risks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd David Hillman, with the Robin Hood Tax campaign, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Once again these figures show that financial sector bonuses are way out of kilter with the rest of the economy. There is a long way to go before the excess of the City is curbed and this huge gulf in rewards between bankers and the public sector is addressed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual bonus round was a feature of the boom years in the early part of the 2000s, but the credit crunch, job losses and a clampdown on some of the riskier activities produced a sharp reduction in the payouts made by banks and other financial companies. The EU also introduced rules designed to limit City bonuses, although the rules actually resulted in many workers demanding higher basic pay. But bonus payments have gradually picked up again. The ONS data shows that finance and insurance remained the biggest contributor to the total. Employers in the sector handed out bonuses of \u00c2\u00a313.9bn to their staff last year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an increase of 2.2% from a year earlier. But other sectors, such as IT and communication services \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including marketing, advertising and PR \u00e2\u20ac\u201c contributed more to growth as bonuses at non-financial companies rose 5.4% to \u00c2\u00a330.4bn. The rewards on offer in the communications business were highlighted when WPP, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest advertising company, paid its founder and boss Sir Martin Sorrell almost \u00c2\u00a367m in bonuses for last year. WPP suffered a shareholder rebellion, but approved the payout. At BP, a majority of shareholders opposed chief executive Bob Dudley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bonus-fuelled \u00c2\u00a314m pay deal. But the vote is only advisory and the rewards were still handed over. Nick Palmer, a statistician at the ONS, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Although the finance and insurance industry retains the largest share of the total, other industries, particularly among professional and hi-tech business services, have been the biggest drivers of growth since 2008.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bonuses are spreading beyond the City, even as evidence mounts that the payouts are not good for companies in the long run. A Cornell Law School study found in 2014 that a company performs worse the more it pays its chief executive and that bonuses promote selfishness and opportunism. Neil Woodford, one of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top fund managers, has recently scrapped bonuses for his employees, arguing they are ineffective and can encourage bad behaviour. Finance and insurance workers received the highest average bonus at \u00c2\u00a313,400 per employee. Health and social workers got virtually nothing. Almost all the total for last year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00c2\u00a343.7bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was in the private sector with few bonuses in the public sector. Civil servants, teachers and hospitality workers were also near the bottom of the rankings. Though the cash value of bonuses was a record last year, the peak year for bonuses as a proportion of total pay was in 2008, when they accounted for 7.1% compared with 6% last year.

                "bodyText":"And finally.... there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no let- up on the anxiety in the banking sector this afternoon. Deutsche Bank shares are hitting new lows, down almost 9% in late trading, in its worst day since Britain voted to leave the EU. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The decline in DB shares was the biggest since the day after the Brexit vote. The fine would be to settle an investigation into the mis-selling of US mortgage backed securities. The $14bn would be about 80% of Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market cap and may dissuade employees from following CEO John Cryan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent advice to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153be more daring.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Royal Bank of Scotland has shed 5% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c pushed down by fears that it could incur a whopping fine from the DoJ too (as explained this morning). Many other European banks have shed two or three percent, in a new bout of jitteriness about the banking sector. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today, and indeed this week. Have a good weekend, and see you on Monday! GW Grexit is no more!! Wall Street firm Citi has told clients today that it no longer thinks Greece will leave the eurozone in the next three years. Despite the latest tensions between Athens and its creditors, they reckon its bailout programme will remain intact. Readers may remember that Citi actually dreamed up the term Grexit in 2012, when chief economist William Buiter said there was a 90% chance the country would leave the eurozone. That prediction proved incorrect; will today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recantation come back to bite them? The German newspaper Handelsblatt describes the proposed $14bn settlement as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cold shower\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for Deutsche Bank. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Such a large sum would amount to a minor catastrophe: if the bank had to raise the fine out of its capital, it would shrink its equity ratio to single digits, perhaps eight percent. For a bank of this calibre and complexity, this would be unacceptable and would practically force a capital increase\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has a glimmer of good news for Deutsche Bank - it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t planning to downgrade its credit rating, despite the threat of a $14bn settlement with the DoJ. S&amp;P currently rates Deutsche Bank as BBB+ with a negative outlook, and says this is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not immediately affected by reports that it is negotiating a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. S&amp;P also expects that Deutsche will end up paying more than it has currently set aside to cover litigation costs, even if it avoids the full $14bn bill. Deutsche Bank held \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5.5 billion of litigation reserves on June 30, 2016, and identified a further \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.7 billion of unreserved contingent litigation liabilities. The latter are defined as obligations that can be estimated and where a loss is considered less than probable, but more than remote. Our capital and earnings forecasts anticipate the crystallization of this contingent liability, with additional charges on top. The Brexit vote is cast a shadow over London Fashion Week, where top designers fear being frozen out of the European market. Caroline Rush, chief executive of the British Fashion Council, says its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vitally important\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that Britain maintains access to the single market. Rush says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need to ensure that our changing relationship with the EU will not impact on the creativity of London, our access to new talent overseas or the ongoing education and training programmes we support.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The EU referendum has delivered some benefits to the industry, though - sales to tourists should rise thanks to the weak pound. The US Federal Reserve is still unlikely to raise rates at its meeting next week, despite this pickup in inflation. But FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga reckons the Fed could easily hike in December: Dollar bulls were offered a lifeline on Friday following the impressive US inflation data which rekindled optimism over the Federal Reserve raising US rates this year. CPI for August printed at 0.2% while Core CPI ticked higher at +0.3% simply elevating sentiment towards the US economy. With inflationary pressures building up gradually in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy, the Fed may have been provided a compelling reason to act before year end. Although expectations have withered over September being a live meeting to pull the trigger, the hope of December being a possibility to act could keep the Dollar buoyed. The US dollar is strengthening following the rise in US inflation, as investors calculate that it makes interest rate rises a little more likely. This means the pound has now lost a whole cent, to $1.313. And the euro has lost half a cent, to $1.118. Just in: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate has risen by more than expected, reigniting the debate on whether US interest rates should rise. Consumer prices rose by 0.2% month-on-month in August, higher than the 0.1% economists expected. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also an increase on July, when prices were unchanged during the month. Although fuel prices fell, rents and healthcare costs pushed up the cost of living. The annual rate of inflation also picked up, giving ammunition to those who think the Federal Reserve should raise interest rates. On an annual basis, prices rose by 1.1% last month - up from 0.8% in July. And core inflation, which strips out volatile elements like fuel and food, rose to 2.3%. The German government has now weighed in over the Deutsche Bank issue, saying it expects its largest bank to be treated \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fairly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by US authorities. Finance Ministry spokeswoman Friederike von Tiesenhausen also flagged up that the settlement process isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t over, even though the DoJ want Deutsche to pay a $14bn settlement. She told reporters that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government is aware that the U.S. authorities have agreed similar settlement payments with other credit institutions. The government expects that at the end of this process a fair result will be achieved on the basis of equal treatment. (thanks to Reuters for the quote) Meanwhile Deutsche executives have been trying to reassure investors that it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be forced to raise fresh capital: While Mark Carney was being quizzed about Brexit, Scotland and Skepta, the pound was losing ground in the foreign exchange market. Sterling has lost around 0.5% this morning, to $1.317 against the US dollar. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on track for its worst week in over a month. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tempting to suggest that the markets have lost faith in Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s authority, now he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been outvoted over his household pet. But instead, fellow Bank policymaker Kristin Forbes has done the damage. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s told a conference in Paris that a weak pound should help fix Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current account deficit. Forbes said (via Reuters): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s depreciation should improve the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s net foreign asset position by over 20 percent of GDP. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big improvement in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s net international asset position and that should alleviate concerns by international investors about the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to pay on its net foreign asset position.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash from Moscow: Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has cut interest rates in an attempt to stimulate its economy. Borrowing costs have been slashed from 10.5% to 10%, with the central bank citing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the inflation slowdown...decrease in inflation expectations and unstable economic activity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the second Russia rate cut this year, as the central bank tries to nurse the economy back to health without weakening the rouble. Mark \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCarnage\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grilling at Whitley Academy in Coventry concludes with a few quick-fire questions. Q: What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s your dream job? Ice-hockey goalie in the NHL. Q: What TV programme is your guilty pleasure? Bake-Off (Bet he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cross about Mel and Sue leaving) Q: Most expensive luxury you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever bought? Carney can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think of one. Q: What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s your favourite film? Gallipoli. Q: Favourite food? Pizza. Q: How much money do you have on you right now? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a new five pound note, says the Governor proudly, plus \u00c2\u00a340 in my bag. Q: Spender or saver? At the moment, Saver, says Carney, after a nanosecond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pause Q: Cats or dogs? Dogs, but I have a cat  . It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m outvoted in the household, Carney explains. Q: Football or ice hockey? Football - because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to understand the personalities in sport. And finally, a popular music question: Q: Skepta or Craig David? The governor looks baffled. Classic stuff. You can watch a replay here (scroll back to 10.18am) Another ace question for Mark Carney, from schoolboy Jay: Q: Who is easier to work with, David Cameron or Theresa May? Carney diplomatically ducks this poser, though, saying: They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve both very professional, very easy to work with, and focused on making the country better. Q: Could Scotland still use the pound if it becomes independent? Carney says there would need to be some fiscal sharing between governments. You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be fully independent and have a stable currency union. The children in Coventry are asking Mark Carney some excellent questions, with many focusing on the EU referendum. Carney says his toughest day on the job was the night of the Brexit vote, and the morning afterwards. Q: How did you become aware of the Brexit result, and what was your first thought? Carney says he had a two-hour nap, and then activated the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit plan once the results showed that the Leave campaign had won. Carney says: My reaction was to make sure that the big fat plan that we had in place was being activated - and that everyone was doing what they should do. He also gave more thought to what he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say to the nation at 8am. Q: Which countries outside the EU will be Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best trade allies after Brexit? Carney says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confident that many countries will want to have deeper trade relationships with the UK, which has a lot of strong exporters. Pressed on which country would be best - he plumps for Canada, his homeland. Carney is then asked, by Caitlin, what advice he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d give his younger self. And the governor says he should have shown better financial discipline in his youth - saving more money and investing it in equity funds (not just into a savings account). He says he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always shop around for the best deals on mortgages and loan. A classic moment, as Mark Carney reveals that one of his childhood nicknames was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153carnage\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be handy, the next time we have heavy losses in the financial markets. Q: What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the best and worst part of your job? Carney says the best part is events like today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s - meeting schools and businesses around the country. The overseas travel is the toughest part -- he spends one in three weekends away at international events. But no-one should feel sorry for him, he adds. Q: If you could spend all the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s money on anything, what would you buy? Carney says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d buy a few things (launching a little lecture into the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdiminishing marginal utility\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 law). He picks lot of Dairy Milk chocolate, football tickets to Everton, and lots of music, old records. From the audience, Amy says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvery good decision\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, is facing a grilling from schoolchildren in Coventry now. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tried to butter them up, by promising a new plastic \u00c2\u00a35 to anyone who asks a nice question. But his audience won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be bought off easily. Spencer asks the governor to account for his ultraloose monetary policy, asking: Q: Why should we save money in a bank when interest rate are so low? Carney explains that people put money aside for a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbig purchase\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, such as a Wii console or a bike. Banks are a secure place to place money. And the Bank is also trying to give people incentives to spend, or invest in riskier assets. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s live on BBC News now.... Financial commentator Frances Coppola reckons that the DoJ may be unwilling to lower Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed $14bn settlement, based on recent history. She reminds us that Bank of America has to pay $16.6bn in August 2014, to settle its own history of packaging up toxic loans and selling them onto investors. Banking analyst Tomas Kinmonth of ABN Amro is concerned that Deutsche Bank could end up defaulting on certain bonds. Those \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcconvertible capital\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, or CoCo, bonds, are designed as a safety net for banks - and will convert into equity if a bank cannot pay the interest (or coupon) on the debt. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also known as additional tier 1 capital (AT1 bonds). According to Kinmonth, Deutche is close to the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctrigger point\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on its AT1s, when it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have enough capital to repay investors. A big fine could push it over the line. He says: Not only are clouds over their profitability still above them, but the fine announcement will come as very unwanted news indeed. Financial statements show that Deutsche Bank has a distance to the MDA trigger at the end of Q2 was 1.40%, which equates to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5.65bn. These values indicate that DB AT1 coupon payments could be at real risk, if the fine is over \u00e2\u201a\u00ac11bn. This is because the company has provisions set aside for litigation costs at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5.5bn. However, the ADI values will be a focus now for the bank. DB reported for 2016 an AT1 payment capacity of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1bn for the year. This was sufficient to pay the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac350mn of AT1 coupons on 30 April 2016, however the capacity for DB to make payments can come under threat from this fine. The FT reports that Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CoCo bonds are falling in value this morning, suggesting the City believes they are riskier. Hat-tip to the Wall Street Journal for breaking the Deutsche Bank story last night: They wrote: The U.S. Justice Department proposed that Deutsche Bank AG pay $14 billion to settle a set of high-profile mortgage-securities probes stemming from the financial crisis, according to people familiar with the matter, a number that would rank among the largest of what other banks have paid to resolve similar claims and is well above what investors have been expecting. The figure is described by people close to the negotiations between Deutsche Bank and the government as preliminary, and they said it came up in discussions between the bank and government lawyers in recent days. It hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been previously disclosed. Deutsche Bank is expected to push back strongly against it, the people said, and it is far from clear what the final outcome will be. Neil Wilson, markets analyst at ETX Capital, is also concerned that Royal Bank of Scotland could face a stinging fine from the US authorities: RBS could have to pay up to $13bn to settle the claims. Even a third of this figure which deliver a crippling blow to the lender, making its return to profitability even further off. It would also derail plans to return the bank to private ownership any time soon. After its latest loss, RBS has notched up \u00c2\u00a350bn in losses since the financial crisis \u00e2\u20ac\u201c more than the \u00c2\u00a345bn stumped up by taxpayers to save the bank. The cost of insuring against Deutsche Bank defaulting on its bonds has risen this morning, as investors fret about its ability to pay billions to the DoJ: Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Market, says the size of Deutsche\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine has shocked investors, sparking today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout. This claim has not appeared out of blue, it was expected, but the number is nearly four-fold higher what analysts were anticipating and this is putting the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share under immense pressure. He also fears that US authorities could come down hard on other banks: But our concern is that this could be just a start and other European banks could face a similar fate and this why investors are leaving the boat with respect to the banking sector. If the Department of Justice will negotiate the number, that is a different question, because both Bank of America and Goldman Sachs have paid very hefty fines. Almost $1.5bn has been knocked off Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market capitalisation (or value) this morning. That means the bank is only valued at below $19bn, worryingly close to the $14bn which the DoJ wants to fine it. That may actually strengthen Deutsche\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hand as it tried to negotiate a smaller penalty from the US authorities. Dominic Elliott of Reuters reckons Deutsche could only manage a $7.5bn bill. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turning into a bad morning for the banks.... Royal Bank of Scotland has been caught up the prospects of a hefty fine on Deutsche Bank for mis-selling mortgage bonds in the run up to the banking crisis. Its shares have fallen almost 4% to 187p, well below the 502p at which taxpayers break even on the stake they acquired bailing RBS out in 2008. The 73% taxpayer owned bank has been warning for two years that it faces penalties over so-called RMBS - residential mortgage backed securities - and only this week its finance director Ewen Stevenson was telling analysts that it might well need to take extra provisions. Analysts estimates for scale of the charges range from \u00c2\u00a34bn to \u00c2\u00a39bn. While RBS had hoped to have agreed a deal with the US authorities last year, talks are not now expected until 2017. So far RBS has taken a $5.6bn provision to deal with RMBS but the bulk of this is to deal with the FHFA regulator and the not the department of justice which has now turned its sights on Deutsche, The timing of the Deutsche Bank fine is fascinating. For a start, it mark the eight anniversary of Lehman Brothers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 collapse - the iconic symbol of the financial crisis. It also follows the huge tax bill which the EU slapped on Apple in August, enraging the US establishment. As the Financial Times puts it: Coming only days after the EU stirred up angry reactions from US politicians by ordering Apple to pay \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn of back taxes in Ireland, there is a strong suspicion in financial circles that Deutsche could be the victim of the US taking revenge on Europe. Banking shares across Europe are being thumped, as investors are spooked by Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $14bn fine. Deutsche Bank are leading the rout, slumping by 8% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac12.06 as a wave of selling grips the Frankfurt exchange. But the damage doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop there. The news that the DoJ is taking such a hard line with Deutsche has hit the whole sector. In London, Royal Bank of Scotland has shed almost 4%, making it the worst-performing member of the FTSE 100. RBS is currently being investigated by the DoJ over its mortgage-backed securities business - the same area that got Deutsche into such trouble.... Standard Chartered, Barclays and Lloyds are also suffering.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Shakespeare once reminded us that: When sorrows come, they come not single spies, but in battalions. And the Bard of Avon would have made a decent banking analyst. Because Deutsche Bank is facing another serious problem today \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a massive $14bn fine for mis-selling mortgage-backed financial products in the US in the run-up to the 2008 crisis. Shares in Deutche Bank have plunged by 8% in early trading in Frankfurt, after it emerged overnight that the Department of Justice wants to impose the $14bn penalty. This would be one of the biggest fines ever levied on a bank, exceed the $13bn which JP Morgan paid in 2013 to settle allegations that it misled investors. Deutsche is fighting back, saying this morning that it hopes to haggle the DoJ down. In a statement, the bank declared: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Deutsche Bank has no intent to settle these potential civil claims anywhere near the number cited.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The negotiations are only just beginning. The bank expects that they will lead to an outcome similar to those of peer banks which have settled at materially lower amounts.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Deutsche Bank already had enough headaches. Record low eurozone interest rates are eating into its profitability, some analysts think it needs more capital, and any Brexit-related downturn could trigger more bad debts. Also coming up today... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a quietish Friday, but we do get the latest US inflation figures at 1.30pm BST. That could shed new light on whether America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank might raise interest rates soon (just as the Bank of England moves towards cutting borrowing costs to fresh record lows). Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s MPs are expected to launch a new crackdown on bosses pay: And a major row is brewing in Greece. Last night, investigators raided the home of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank governor, Yannis Stournaras, and his wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s company, in a corruption probe. Coincidentally (or perhaps not?), the Bank of Greece has just rejected the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed candidates to run Attica Bank, a state-backed lender. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

Many are questioning Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to do more stimulus given the size of their programs over the past four years; although in that last Bank of Japan press conference [governor Haruhiko] Kuroda addressed this head on, sharing his view that the BoJ hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet hit the limits of monetary expansion.</p> <p>But there are some very big peripheral questions to be answered by the BoJ in this review, as in what are they going to do about the 2% target that they announced in April 2013 that they said they expected to hit in 2 years? That was April of 2015, or approximately 17 months ago, and yet we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still very far away from that target being realistically met. Also at issue are negative rates...would they dare to do more here given that results have been non-existent? And in terms of asset purchases: The BoJ has been buying \u00c2\u00a580 Trillion a year in assets for a few years now. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re already cornering their own government bond market. Does the BoJ dare do more after four years have shown little hope of actually kick-starting inflation?</p> <p>So, nobody really knows what the BoJ will say during this review to be released tonight. This could lead to hazardous conditions if trading around the Yen as markets are appearing to approach tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s event rather tepidly under the same guise of uncertainty that we are.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"441ab4dd8034baa79a7e513e2158ba34ecb2499a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/441ab4dd8034baa79a7e513e2158ba34ecb2499a/0_0_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kazuhiro Nogi/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Simon MacAdam at Capital Economics said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We expect the BoJ to cut its policy rate deeper into negative territory today which, according to the Overnight Index Swap market, does not appear to be expected until early next year.</p> <p>Admittedly, it is more difficult to gauge where we sit relative to the market on the prospects for further unconventional policy easing in Japan. But we suspect that we are more dovish.</p> <p>[There has been] speculation that there will be a policy shift away from asset purchases. Indeed, the yield curve has steepened recently in anticipation of the BoJ adopting this stance: long-dated yields have hit six-month highs this month.</p> <p>We believe, though, that the BoJ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Comprehensive Policy Review will throw open the door to innovative policy measures.

Investors are also nervous ahead of the forthcoming Bank of Japan meeting.</p> <p>Currency markets are also unnerved by the prospect that Donald Trump may win the forthcoming US election. Neil Wilson, markets analyst at ETX Capital, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The pound seems to be a victim of some skittishness ahead the major central bank meetings this week in Japan and the US. Markets anticipate the Fed will keep rates on hold but a hike is not being ruled out, which may be rattling traders.</p> <p>Moreover, even if the US central bank holds fire, traders seem primed for a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchawkish hold\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 where the Fed would effectively give the green light for the fed funds rate to increase later this year, probably in December. All eyes are on whether long-time dove Boston Fed president Eric Rosengren shifts his stance and votes for a hike, as some have speculated he might.</p> <p>Despite talk of a Brexit bounce, the pound has come under pressure of late. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now trading close to 5 cents off its high of September 6<sup>th</sup>. The pace of the sell-off picked up markedly after the Bank of England said last week that it still expects to cut rates again this year. If UK data continues to remain solid, the Bank might have row back on that prediction, which could be positive for the pound.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T15:11:46.765Z\">at 4.11pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57e1474fe4b02abd56c3f627\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T14:27:59.392Z\">3.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a neat explanation of why the Federal Reserve has struggled to raise interest rates:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/KeithAkre/status/778237604160385025\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">New <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordOfTheDay?src=hash\">#WordOfTheDay</a> courtesy of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BenEisen\">@BenEisen</a> of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WSJ\">@wsj</a>.

                "bodyText":"Michael Saunders, the newest member of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee, voted to keep interest rates on hold last week. But in an interview with the Financial Times he said he was ready to call for a cut if unemployment picked up. He said: At the moment I think the economy still has some slack left in the labour market, you can see that in the subdued pace of pay growth. If the jobless rate were to rise, increasing labour market slack further, then that would be an argument in favour of lower interest rates. On the other hand he believed the UK economy was set for a less severe slowdown than most economists expect. He said: In the near term, the next year or two, I think the economy will slow, but perhaps not slow as much as the consensus has been expecting. This is partly because of the support from loose financial conditions, partly because of the underlying advantages - including supply side flexibility - of the UK economy. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back again tomorrow for a day of central bank rate decisions. With investors unsure what lies in store on Wednesday from the Bank of Japan and US Federal Reserve interest rate meetings, European markets have lost some of their early gains and ended in rather a mixed fashion. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 17.24 points or 0.25% at 6830.79 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax edged up 0.19% to 10,393.86 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.13% at 4388.60 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 1.17% to 16,207.10 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.34% at 8686.1 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.56% to 560.59 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 32 points or 0.18%. Ahead of the US Federal Reserve decision comes the latest from the Bank of Japan, with the results of its comprehensive review of monetary policy expected. Analysts are uncertain what this might bring in practise, whether it be a further push into negative rate territory or further economic stimulus. But most believe there will be no change to the Bank of Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation target of 2%. James Stanley, currency analyst at DailyFX, said: The big question is whether this review will lead-in to more stimulus or an introduction of monetary prudence. Many are questioning Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to do more stimulus given the size of their programs over the past four years; although in that last Bank of Japan press conference [governor Haruhiko] Kuroda addressed this head on, sharing his view that the BoJ hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet hit the limits of monetary expansion. But there are some very big peripheral questions to be answered by the BoJ in this review, as in what are they going to do about the 2% target that they announced in April 2013 that they said they expected to hit in 2 years? That was April of 2015, or approximately 17 months ago, and yet we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still very far away from that target being realistically met. Also at issue are negative rates...would they dare to do more here given that results have been non-existent? And in terms of asset purchases: The BoJ has been buying \u00c2\u00a580 Trillion a year in assets for a few years now. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re already cornering their own government bond market. Does the BoJ dare do more after four years have shown little hope of actually kick-starting inflation? So, nobody really knows what the BoJ will say during this review to be released tonight. This could lead to hazardous conditions if trading around the Yen as markets are appearing to approach tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s event rather tepidly under the same guise of uncertainty that we are. Simon MacAdam at Capital Economics said: We expect the BoJ to cut its policy rate deeper into negative territory today which, according to the Overnight Index Swap market, does not appear to be expected until early next year. Admittedly, it is more difficult to gauge where we sit relative to the market on the prospects for further unconventional policy easing in Japan. But we suspect that we are more dovish. [There has been] speculation that there will be a policy shift away from asset purchases. Indeed, the yield curve has steepened recently in anticipation of the BoJ adopting this stance: long-dated yields have hit six-month highs this month. We believe, though, that the BoJ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Comprehensive Policy Review will throw open the door to innovative policy measures. Rather than scale back its asset purchases, we think that the Bank may increase them and is more likely to find other ways to support systemically-important institutions, such as lending to commercial banks at negative interest rates. The pound has hit a five year low against the dollar, weighed down by concerns about the economic risks of Brexit. Sterling fell as low as $1.2948 and is currently down 0.55% at $1.2950 amid worries about the outcome of talks about Britain leaving the European Union, especially with some EU members promising there would be no easy ride. The strength of the dollar is also a factor, with the outside chance of a US rate rise at this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve meeting. Investors are also nervous ahead of the forthcoming Bank of Japan meeting. Currency markets are also unnerved by the prospect that Donald Trump may win the forthcoming US election. Neil Wilson, markets analyst at ETX Capital, said: The pound seems to be a victim of some skittishness ahead the major central bank meetings this week in Japan and the US. Markets anticipate the Fed will keep rates on hold but a hike is not being ruled out, which may be rattling traders. Moreover, even if the US central bank holds fire, traders seem primed for a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchawkish hold\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 where the Fed would effectively give the green light for the fed funds rate to increase later this year, probably in December. All eyes are on whether long-time dove Boston Fed president Eric Rosengren shifts his stance and votes for a hike, as some have speculated he might. Despite talk of a Brexit bounce, the pound has come under pressure of late. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now trading close to 5 cents off its high of September 6th. The pace of the sell-off picked up markedly after the Bank of England said last week that it still expects to cut rates again this year. If UK data continues to remain solid, the Bank might have row back on that prediction, which could be positive for the pound. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a neat explanation of why the Federal Reserve has struggled to raise interest rates: Back in the UK, the Bank of England has bought up \u00c2\u00a31.17bn of long-dated government bonds from investors. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s part of its plan to support the UK economy following the EU referendum - pushing down the interest rate on these gilts, and encouraging riskier lending. What a difference nine months, some weak economic data, and a Brexit vote makes... But not everyone on Wall Street expects the Fed to hold interest rates. BNP Paribas and Barclays are both predicting that policymakers will take the plunge, and raise borrowing costs. Laura Rosner, senior U.S. economist in New York at BNP, argues that economic conditions are good enough to justify a hike. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is no perfect time -- there will always be some uncertainties in the data,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite a multitude of shocks through the last nine months, which have delayed the Fed, hiring has continued to be robust. There is a window of opportunity for the Fed to continue normalizing, and we think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll take it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd US interest rates have been on hold since last December, at just 0.25%-0.5%. The Fed initially expected to manage four rate hikes this year - now, one hike looks like their limit. So the normalisation process is taking an awfully long time, as Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Jamie McGeever points out: Ding ding! The Wall Street opening bell has been rung for the last full trading session before America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank sets monetary policy. And shares are rallying in New York, and in Europe, as investors wager that the US Federal Reserve will decide not to raise interest rates tomorrow. The Dow Jones industrial average has gained 104 points, or 0.6%, in early trading to 18,224. Nearly every company on the index has risen. The broader S&amp;P 500 index has gained 0.5%. European markets have also had a good day (apart from Italy, where fears over its banking sector have pushed shares down). London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has gained 40 points, on top of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 103-point jump. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak-looking US housing data has left many traders concluding that the Fed won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t risk a shock hike tomorrow. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets explain why: The September FOMC meeting is finally upon us. It has been the subject of considerable speculation along the way, especially in late August when various Fed speakers were signaling a desire to raise rates. However, U.S. economic data has since cooled as twin ISM numbers printed weakly and a sprinkling of other measures also disappointed expectations. Accordingly, market expectations have drifted down to around a 20% chance of a rate increase from the current 0.375% level at this meeting. Historically, the Fed has never raised rates unless the market has assigned a likelihood of 60% or higher. As such, a rate hike is now quite unlikely for September. However... a couple of Wall Street dealers believe the Fed could defy expectations, and vote to raise interest rates..... Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget that the Bank of Japan also holds a crucial monetary policy meeting overnight. But investors are genuinely baffled about what the BoJ might do - and how the markets might react. Newsflash from America: The number of new house-building projects slumped by 5.8% in August. And the number of permits for new properties shrank by 0.4%, following an 0.8% decline in July. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important, because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another reason for the US central bank, the Fed, not to raise interest rates at its meeting on Wednesday. When Mike Ashley described himself as a PR nightmare, this may be what he had in mind: Theresa May made some bold promises about improving labour rights on her swift march to Downing Street, including putting workers on company boards [which Sports Direct will now do]. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not too surprising that that Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has welcomed the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to change. A spokeswoman says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Government is clear that everybody deserves to be treated with respect and employers have a responsibility to ensure that pay is fair no matter who you are or what you do. Both the Business Select Committee report and Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s review into their own working practices detailed some concerning findings, so it is right that they take decisive action to resolve these internal issues as quickly as possible.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Breaking away from Sports Direct.... there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of chat about the impact of the Brexit vote on Ireland today. Our correspondent Henry McDonald reports: Ireland should woo UK firms who want to remain trading in the EU to relocate to cities like Dublin, Cork and Limerick, the British-Irish Chamber of Commerce said today. The Anglo-Irish trade body\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Director General John McGrane said the Republic should follow the lead of other EU states and cities that were seeking to persuade UK firms to set up bases within the Eurozone post-Brexit. McGrane also warned that Ireland \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with its land border with Northern Ireland and the fact that its single biggest trading partner is the UK \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is the most exposed EU country to Brexit. He was speaking a seminar on Brexit and Ireland organised by the main opposition party in the Dail, Fianna Fail, in Carlow today. Accepting and respecting the UK vote on Brexit, McGrade told the think-in: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Enterprises think about multi-location and so Ireland should rightly be the natural first choice for UK employers looking for a guaranteed EU base and equally Irish firms looking to secure trade with the UK should consider a UK base. With other EU cities encouraging migration of UK firms, we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be shy to lay out our own advantages and to encourage investment in Ireland from anyone looking to trade inside the EU.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He also called on the Irish government to implement a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153National Brexit Strategy Plan\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to cope with the shocks of the UK outside the EU. Meanwhile in Belfast, Ryanair boss Michael O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary has warned that investment will suffer while the Brexit drama plays out. Relations between Sports Direct and the unions have long been fraught. But Janet Williamson, chair of the Trade Union Share Owners, suggests that the new independent review is a good opportunity for a fresh start. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is good news for Sports Direct workers, especially young workers who make up a large part of their staff but too often get a poor deal at work. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The board should now consult both shareholders and trade unions in finalising the plans for the independent review. Trade unions representing workers at Sports Direct stand ready to work with the company to ensure a successful future that is fair for its staff.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Unions will presumably be pushing Ashley to offer permanent contracts to the 4,000-ish agency workers, who are employed at Shirebrook on effectively zero-hours contracts. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t often find the City singing from the same hymn sheet as Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unions. But the two sides are united today. After putting pressure on Ashley for months, investors are generally welcoming the decision to hold a properly independent review of Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s operations. Paul Lee, head of corporate governance at Aberdeen Asset Management, called it a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good start\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: The fact that the review will now be undertaken by an independent party provides comfort and I am sure all shareholders will welcome the opportunity to offer constructive thoughts on the remit of the review. There is much more work to be done but hopefully today is the first step on the long journey to rebuild investor trust and to rectify the problems at SportsDirect. All shareholders want a well governed, sustainable business.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Andy Griffiths, executive director of the Investor Forum, is also pleased: Our Members believe this is an opportunity to bring about meaningful and lasting change, and are committed to working constructively with the Board and the independent reviewer to ensure it can be a turning point in rebuilding trust.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Relations between Mike Ashley and the City hit a nadir this month when investors voted against chairman Keith Hellawell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reappointment. They are also unhappy that Mike Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brother has a deal to deliver Sports Direct products abroad. Eyebrows have also been raised over the appointment of Michael Murray, boyfriend of Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s elder daughter Anna, as a property consultant. The Unite union reckon Mike Ashley has now \u00e2\u20ac\u0153grasped\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the need to tackle the employment problems at Sports Direct. They are also pushing the government to outlaw zero-hours contracts (reminder: Ashley is offering permanent contracts to all workers at his retail shops, but not to agency staff at the retailer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Derbyshire warehouse). Unite assistant general secretary Steve Turner says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Increasingly businesses are recognising that they have no place in the modern workplace and are bad for workers, bad for business and bad for the economy. The government should now show leadership and follow the lead of government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like New Zealand and ban zero-hours contracts.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jon Tricket, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow business secretary, has criticised Mike Ashley for dragging his feet over allowing an independent review of Sports Direct. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153News that Sports Direct is finally responding to its shareholder wishes and agreeing to an independent review of its working practices and corporate governance is a step in the right direction towards ridding the company of its exploitative practices once and for all. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Apparent resistance by Mr Ashley has made this process harder than it needed to be. Labour are looking at ways to improve corporate governance to avoid such scandals in the future, and to ensure that the highest standards apply in British industry.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Press Association has a good write-up of Mike Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s TV performance, by Aine Fox. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPR NIGHTMARE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 MIKE ASHLEY DEFENDS FLYING TO WORK BY HELICOPTER Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley said he is being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153real\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when he chooses to travel by helicopter, and disclosed that a cleaning lady at the company was paid an \u00c2\u00a380,000 bonus. Speaking after the firm announced it would have an independent review of its working practices and corporate governance, he reiterated his apology for things that had gone wrong but insisted there have also been positives at the retailer. He defended his expensive method of travel, and said the government is responsible for workers being paid the minimum wage, not him. He told BBC Breakfast: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I do fly to work by helicopter, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reality. So when people say, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOh be real\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how I travel.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People will say, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHow can you have a plane when your workers are on minimum wage?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I said, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBut I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t set the minimum wage.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 If the minimum wage would be the living wage, then the government who set the rules should set it at the living wage. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s as I look at it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mr Ashley put the poor practices discovered at the business down to a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rotten apple in the barrel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and said there are a lot of good things about the firm. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I can tell you in the last five years Sports Direct will have paid out over 200 million in bonuses. So I can tell you the cleaning lady got an \u00c2\u00a380,000 bonus on top of her normal pay. Nobody in the UK has done that. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got to do is focus on getting the bits we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got wrong, to the extreme highs of the bits we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got right. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And paying out that kind of money doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re allowed to get these bits wrong, where clearly I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve taken my eye off the ball. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve said sorry, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve said I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to fix it, and I will.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Describing himself as a bit of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153PR nightmare\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he referred to the moment he joked that he had been to the casino after he pulled a wad of cash from his pocket when he was showing investors and journalists around the Shirebrook warehouse earlier this month. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The one thing people didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say to me was, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcMike, have you checked how much money you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got in your pocket?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 And of course nobody thought to ask me whether or not I had genuinely been to the casino a few days earlier.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Joey Barton, the oft-banned footballer, has given us an insight into Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s treatment of his workers (and that helicopter). Our sports writer Donald McRae explains: Barton skewers Mike Ashley, Newcastle United\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s owner, with a simple story. When Barton was released from prison on bail he was placed in the care of Peter Kay in Southampton \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and only allowed out between 7am and 7pm. Kay had convinced the judge that, while he would counsel Barton, the footballer would be more balanced if he played the game he loved. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ashley offered me his helicopter,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Barton remembers, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as my curfew meant Pete and I needed to fly to and from training in Newcastle. It seemed really generous until I got an eye\u00e2\u20ac\u2018boggling invoice. It was business after all.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Green party hopes Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s U-turn signals a fundamental shift towards workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rights. They are pushing the government to breathe new life into a review of working conditions, which stalled two years ago. Recent problems at Deliveroo and Uber show that workers are still being exploited, the party argues. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jonathan Bartley, the co-leader: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sports Direct has continually dragged its feet and tried to avoid the fully independent review into working practices that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so desperately needed, so this announcement is as welcome as it is overdue. This is only the beginning of a process which must see the end of exploitation at Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest sports firm. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Slowly but surely we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing trade unions, shareholders and campaigners force big firms to address the profound injustice being faced by so many workers in Britain. Only time will tell whether working conditions in Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shirebrook warehouse \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which has been compared to a Victorian workhouse \u00e2\u20ac\u201c will really improve in practice. Our focus must then broaden to root out the many other firms who are reaping the benefits from the so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgig economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 at the expense of workers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government must now reopen the Employment Review launched in 2014 [1], which could clarify and strengthen the employment status of up to a million British workers. It should also act quickly to crack down on employers like Sports Direct. Ending zero-hour contracts, guaranteeing trade union access to all workplaces and introducing a genuine living wage are just a few steps which would make a huge difference to millions of working people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lives.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Reaction to Mike Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interview, and the new independent inquiry into his company, is still coming in. Lecturer and consultant Hayley Lewis says the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd defence simply isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t acceptable. (Although Ashley isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually the chief executive, he does in effect run the company and owns a majority stake). Retail analyst Paul Mitchell is more positive: And the Daily Mail\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Henry Deedes provides the fashion angle \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Ashley has produced a new tie for his big day: The City has welcomed Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to get an independent review of its working practices. Shares in the company have risen by 2% this morning, making it one of the best-performing companies on the London stock market. Labour MP Angela Rayner isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed by Mike Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defence for only paying the bare minimum to his workers: James Wilmore of Retail Week thinks Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rotten apple defence smells fishy. PR consultant Julie Fuge reckons Ashley had been coached before his ordeal on the red sofa, but he couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stick to the script: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Helen Cahill of City AM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s verdict: Mike Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that a few \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bad apples\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd caused the problems at Sports Direct doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really add up. Two weeks ago, his own lawyers concluded that there had been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153serious shortcomings\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in working practices at its warehouse, for which the company apologised. That included the notorious \u00e2\u20ac\u0153six strikes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which its agencies operated \u00e2\u20ac\u201c meaning the army of casual staff at Shirebrook risked being sanctioned if they chatted too much, wore the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wrong\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd branded clothes, or were simply off ill. And a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bad apple\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd can hardly be blamed for the laborious search operations that meant staff in effect received less than the minimum wage. Ashley admitted this morning that he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a firm grip on HR issues \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a structural failing, not a few rogue employees. Mike Ashley used to have a reputation as a particularly secretive business chief (before surprisingly buying Newcastle United in 2007). So today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outing on the BBC Breakfast sofas was a rare experience. But what did we actually learn? Ashley is sticking to his position that he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how workers were being mistreated across his empire. Clearly, any competent boss should have known, or at least cared, about how their main warehouse operated. But Ashley can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be fired, as he owns more than half of Sports Direct; he can just promise to do better. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trying to buy himself a lot of time. Phrases like: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll still need fixing when I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m dead,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd suggest that Sports Direct is a kind of retailing Forth Bridge, forever dogged by peeling paint and a neverending fight against decay. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s playing for public support. Ashley claims to be a PR nightmare \u00e2\u20ac\u201c then tantalises the audience by revealing that he paid a cleaning lady an \u00c2\u00a380k bonus. What a decent chap, eh? But the mask did slip\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Ashley was on his very best behaviour (unlike at this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AGM when he lashed out at the unions). But towards the end of the interview, he basically claimed it was the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fault that Sports Direct paid its workers so little, as they set the minimum wage. Someone should probably remind Mike that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s allowed to pay more than the legal minimum \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Q: Are you confident that, five years down the line, Sports Direct will be a very different place to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Victorian workhouse\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd conditions workers have suffered? Ashley: In the last five years, Sports Direct have paid out more than \u00c2\u00a3200m in bonuses. The cleaning lady got an \u00c2\u00a380,000 bonus on top of her normal pay. No ne in the UK has done that. We need to get the bits we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got wrong up to the level of the extreme bits we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got right, Ashley adds. And he concludes with a pledge to get the job done: Clearly I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve taken my eye off the ball. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve said sorry, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve said I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to fix it and I will. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the end of the BBC interview. Ashley then defends his use of private planes and helicopters to do business, saying it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wrong to compare his lifestyle to an ordinary worker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get paid a salary, but I do like to go by private plane \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it saves a lot of time and is very efficient. Then people say: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHow can you have a plane when your workers are on minimum wage?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t set the minimum wage, Ashley adds, arguing that if the minimum wage should be the living wage, then the government should set it at that level. Now on to Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public relations gaffe last week, when he produced a massive wad of \u00c2\u00a350 notes during a security search at his factory. Q: Wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that a massive PR disaster? That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never tried to do PR, Ashley grins. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a nightmare for PR. He explains that no one asked me to check his pockets \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in case I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d just been to the casino\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, before he had to empty his pockets in front of a crowd of journalists. Now we move on to Mike Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future at the company he founded. Q: Your reputation is on the line here \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so how long are you giving yourself to turn Sports Direct around? Ashley says that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trying to improve Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stores, and also fix the problems on the personnel side. We want a culture of being One Sports Direct family. Q: So if you haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t done that in a year, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll go? Ashley rebuffs this timescale, insisting that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a year is too soon\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to fix everything that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wrong. Instead, it sounds like a neverending task. Ashley says: You get to the top of a mountain and then you see there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another mountain. It will never stop. Even when I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m dead it will never stop. With hindsight, I should have done a better job overseeing corporate governance and HR issues, Mike Ashley admits. Q: How can you make serious changes, though, when you have exactly the same board in place? Ashley says that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now taking a more hands-on role. He insists the board is absolutely serious about turning the company around, pointing out that CEO Dave Forsey lost a bonus worth almost \u00c2\u00a34m last year. Q: Why are you only offering workers just 12 hours\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 work a week (rather than a zero-hours contract)? People who already work a full working week will continue to do so if they take a new contract, Ashley promises. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re trying to get people into two categories \u00e2\u20ac\u201c those who want a minimum guarantee each week and those who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, he adds. Q: So were you appalled when you heard what was happening? My initial reaction was that these things couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be happening at Sports Direct, Mike Ashley says. He argues that Sports Direct has suffered from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153odd isolated instances\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rotten apple in the barrel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which needs to be dug out. Q: Isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t your reputation in tatters? Askley repeats his line that a few \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rotten apples\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are to blame Mike Ashley is speaking on BBC One now, being interviewed by Dan Walker. Q: Isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it incredibly damaging that MPs have decribed your warehouse conditions as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Victorian\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd? Undoubtedly yes, says Mike Ashley. There were definitely some things we had to fix \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve fixed some over the first 90 days, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more to fix, and some things that will always need fixing. Q: You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re the founder of this company \u00e2\u20ac\u201c didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you know what was going on? You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be surprised how little I knew \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where the failing was, says Ashley. He explains that he can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t watch every night shift, or see what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening at his company during the weekend. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lots of hours in the week when I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not there, he adds. Should I known more, yes? Did I know what was happening? Absolutely not. Sports Direct says it has already fixed some of the serious problems at Shirebrook, such as the security searches conducted after workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 paid shifts have ended. But the independent team will want to check whether the other problems, which led to Shirebook being labelled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the gulag\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are being addressed: Sports Direct\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision is being welcomed as a major win for shareholders and campaigners. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ian Smith of Investors Chronicle: Deirdre Hipwell of the Times says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a major climbdown by Mike Ashley: Antonia Bance, head of campaigns at the TUC union, is also pleased: Big news from Sports Direct this morning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the retailer has agreed to hold an independent review of its working practices and corporate governance. This looks like a U-turn from founder Mike Ashley. He had originally planned to use his own lawyers, RPC, to conduct the inquiry, but has been pressured by large shareholders to get a fully independent team involved instead. Today the company bowed to that pressure, telling shareholders that: Sports Direct today announces that the forthcoming \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc360-degree\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 review of working practices and corporate governance which was announced on 6 September 2016 and which was to be led by RPC will now be led by an independent party other than RPC. RPC has already conducted one review of Sports Direct, which concluded there were serious deficiencies in the way its workers were treated. Ashley has promised to put things right, after seeing a major City backlash against his chairman following the revelations. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expecting to hear from Mike Ashley shortly, on the BBC 1 Breakfast show\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Newsflash: the City is getting another female chief executive. Pharmaceuticals giant GlaxoSmithKline has promoted Emma Walmsley, currently the head of its Consumer Healthcare division, to replace Andrew Witty as CEO. It makes her the most powerful woman in the City, I reckon \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at \u00c2\u00a380bn, GSK is the sixth-largest company on the FTSE 100. Walmsley says: I am delighted and honoured to be appointed GSK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next CEO. GSK is a company that leads both in science and in the way it does business. We have momentum in the group and as the demand for medical innovation and trusted healthcare products continues to rise, we have the opportunity and the potential to create meaningful benefits for patients, consumers and our shareholders. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m looking forward to working with Andrew and other leaders over the next few months to ensure a smooth handover and to develop plans for 2017 and beyond. There are currently just five women running FTSE 100 companies, I reckon. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction from the GSK workforce: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally, Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets look remarkably subdued this morning. Investors are waiting nervously for tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s splurge of central bank news, with the Bank of Japan and the US Federal Reserve setting monetary policy. The markets reckon there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a 20% chance that the Fed will hike interest rates, but a shock can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be ruled out. And no one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really confident about which way the Bank of Japan might jump. Analysts at Danske Bank predict that Japan will shake up its stimulus programme a little: We do not expect the BoJ to ease monetary policy as such but expect it to adjust its policy framework by (1) changing its wording on when it expects to achieve its 2% inflation target and (2) adding some flexibility to its government bond purchase programme while maintaining its negative interest rate policy. Due to those pesky timezones, most of Europe will be tucked up in bed when the BoJ does its thing. So trades have an edgy day ahead\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Also coming up today.... UK companies Kingfisher (which runs that B&amp;Q DIY chain) and French Connection are reporting to the City. On the economic front, the latest German producer prices figures are out \u00e2\u20ac\u201c showing that factories charged less for their goods last month. That suggests eurozone inflation remains subdued. And at 1.30pm BST, we get the latest US housing starts data, showing the health of the American building sector.",

If anything, [today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of Japan] announcement of new easing measures could even further discourage a Fed move, but as it already stands, there are very few market participants that are betting on such a move to higher interest rates, at least for this particular Fed meeting. Key Fed speakers and major US economic data releases have alternately shifted the discussion from one side to another in the past few weeks. Some members advocated a rate hike this year, even citing the possibility of one occurring in September, while others, like Fed Governor Lael Brainard, cautioned against raising interest rates too quickly.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eac6e61ee921b5970f39ae3a4112c3b31fbe56d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eac6e61ee921b5970f39ae3a4112c3b31fbe56d3/0_0_2723_1634/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Federal Reserve board member Lael Brainard.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Federal Reserve board member Lael Brainard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>Additionally, September has thus far seen a general deterioration of US economic data in the form of substantially worse-than-expected releases regarding employment (NFP), both the manufacturing and services industries (PMI), retail sales, and housing, that were all significantly worse than expected. The one potentially brighter spot for the Fed was the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation reading for August, which showed that both headline and core prices increased by more than expected. Despite this more buoyant view of inflation, however, it is still unlikely to be enough to sway the Fed into action today.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Amidst all of these economic data releases and Fed member speeches, the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view of the implied probability of a rate hike today has continued to hover in the low-to-high teens. Of course, there could always be a surprise move, but the much more likely scenario will be a characteristically unmovable Fed.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad4d6875ec8a084a78a2ef359396ac1ae251fd2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad4d6875ec8a084a78a2ef359396ac1ae251fd2a/414_0_4091_2455/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fed expected to keep rates on hold\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fed expected to keep rates on hold</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>Therefore, the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focus, as has consistently been the case from the beginning of the year, will be concentrated on the words emanating from the Fed statement as it relates to the indication of a possible rate hike in December and the potential pace of tightening going forward. The current market probability of a December hike remains around 60%.</p> <p>The key markets to watch today, as always, will be US equity markets, gold, and the US dollar, particularly US dollar/Japanese yen due the earlier Bank of Japan announcement. A more hawkish Fed today could lead to a rebound for the dollar/yen while a more dovish statement could lead to a further drop for dollar/yen towards the key 100.00 mark and below.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-21T15:55:13.267Z\">at 4.55pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57e2a2a2e4b05d653ca5f46d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-21T15:14:36.055Z\">4.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Predictions of the economic gloom which would follow the Brexit vote seem to be wide of the mark, according to a new Guardian project tracking the state of play as Britain prepares to leave the European Union.</p> <p>As a reminder, the UK Treasury for one forecast dire consequences in the immediate wake of the vote:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NobleFrancis/status/778608821027700737\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EdConwaySky\">@EdConwaySky</a> The HM Treasury document is clear &amp; specific.

                "bodyText":"Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve meeting wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a shocker. But nor was it a complete damp squib. Instead, we saw a central bank inching towards raising interest rates, and running out of excuses for leaving them on hold today. Yellen gave an encouraging view of the US economy, saying economic activity has picked up, with solid job creation. But yet... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The economy has a little more room to run than might have been previously thought. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good news....We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see the economy is overheating now.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yellen even raised the risk of the US being dragged into recession, to justify laying it safe today Crucially, three policymakers think today was the day to move, and it seems likely that a majority will take the plunge in December. Indeed, November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting will be fascinating, if any more hawks emerge. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference also reflected the political battle raging outside. Yellen found herself forced to defend the Fed against Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claims that political pressure has influenced monetary policy. She declared: We do not discuss politics at our meetings, and we do not take politics into account in our decisions. That could be a foretaste of the turmoil if Trump wins in November.... And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for tonight. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW. Ding Ding! The closing bell is being rung at the New York stock exchange. And shares have rallied pretty strongly, after the Fed left interest rates on hold and gave a fairly upbeat view of the US economy. The Dow Jones and the S&amp;P 500 have both gained almost 1%, as traders welcome the decision not to hike borrowing costs today. Tony Bedikian, Head of Global Markets at Citizens Bank, explains why: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision by the Fed was not a surprise. It was the outcome that many market followers expected, but we are still seeing a bounce in equities because now the question has been answered. It was interesting to see the split vote with three members of the policy committee willing to break ranks and support raising rates. Fed policy makers have said all along that their decisions will be data dependent and their statement today indicates that the majority of committee members still don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel the data is strong enough to tighten yet.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Nancy Curtin, Chief Investment Officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, also predicts a rate rise before Christmas. But today, though, the economic picture simply wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t good enough. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Any expectation of a Fed rate rise in September unwound following weak economic performance in the third quarter. Stumbling growth in the economy, particularly in industrial production, was a significant counterbalance to the more hawkish sentiment displayed by certain members of the Fed earlier in the month. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Fed is highly pragmatic though, and if wider data, including inflation, begins to mirror the strength of the labour market then they may be able to raise interest rates again before the year is up. In the meantime, as in the UK, investors continue to keep their eye on fiscal policy and carefully watch how this will develop as the cornerstone to long-term economic recovery.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Reaction to the Federal Reserve meeting is coming in now... Neil Wilson, markets analyst at ETX Capital, says the US central bank has pulled off a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hawkish hold\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd today. With three policymakers voting to hike, as December rise looks likely. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That was about as hawkish a hold as you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re ever likely to get from the Fed. Three dissenting voices is highly unusual for the US central bank policy team, and indicates just how close the FOMC is to raising rates. The fact that Mester, George and Rosengren all want to raise rates also points to some division and potentially a question mark over the authority of Janet Yellen. Interestingly she said the decision not to hike this month does not reflect a lack of faith in the US economy. Instead it looks like the Fed is simply being very cautious as it has a bit of slack in the labour market and inflation is not yet at target. Q: And finally.... when is America actually going to see some meaningful wage growth? Yellen offers some hope to hard-pressed workers. The Fed does expect the unemployment rate to decline, she says, and the labour market to improve. So: My hope and expectation is that we will see a pick-up in wage growth, that is broadly beneficial to US household. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the end of the press conference. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pull a short summary together shortly. Some reaction to that last question: Asked about inflation expectations, Yellen says the Fed must be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153forward looking\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. No-one at the FOMC wants to allow inflation to overshoot badly. But we must also look at Japan as a reminder that inflation expectations can become un-anchored. Another question about Wells Fargo - what is the Fed going do to clean it up? Yellen says the Fed wants all banks, not just Wells, to have robust risk management systems to protect customers. Asked about leverage risks, Yellen says she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153worried\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that bubbles could form in the US economy. But no-one knows for sure when a valuation turns into a bubble, she argues. Q: Does the Wells Fargo scandal imply that some banks are simply too big to manage and should be broken up? Janet Yellen says no - the key is that banks need to be run properly. Q: Has the Fed launched an investigation into the scandal at Wells Fargo? Yellen says this is a matter for other regulators (as it affected consumers, who were wrongly given phoney bank accounts and credit cards). But the Fed will be watching Wells Fargo closely, to ensure its top managers are obeying compliance rules. We have been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153distressed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to see these kinds of problems, she adds; banks need to ensure that their staff are acting ethically and protecting customers. Donald Trump is looming over today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference... Q: Are you worried that Trump could go back through the meetings of Fed meeting for signs that politics has influenced your decisions? No, Yellen replies, insisting again that politics does not play a role. Q: Is there a risk in leaving interest rates too low for too long? Yes, Yellen replies. But the bigger risk is to raise rates too soon. We could cause a recession in the process - that isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t something that I and my colleagues want to be responsible for. Q: Why did the Fed cite the Brexit vote as a key risk back in June, but hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cited the November elections as a risk today? Yellen won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be tempted with this curveball, saying simply that she won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on the US election. Two political questions... Q: Is political uncertainty weighing on US growth, in the run-up to November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election? Yellen says that investment spending has been weak recently, but she isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly sure why. Consumer sentiment is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153perfectly solid\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, though. Q: Does the Fed want government spending to take more of the strain? There are ways that fiscal policy could help, Yellen replies, especially though \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcautomatic stabilisers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 which would kick in during a slowdown. Q: Could interest rates rise at the next meeting, in November? Yellen confirms that the November meeting is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. A zinger of a question: Q: Donald Trump claims that the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates artifially low for political reasons. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s your response? Yellen tries to sweeps the Republican presidential nominee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism aside. I can say emphatically that political issues play no part in the path of monetary policy, she insists. We do not discuss politics at our meetings, and we do not take politics into account in our decisions. Q: Is the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credibility being hurt by the different briefings we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve heard from policymakers, with some hinting at rate hikes and others much more dovish? Yellen says there is less disagreement within the FOMC than you might think from recent speeches and comments. We do not suffer from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153group think\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, she adds; we are debating the issues around when to raise interest rates. Yellen is repeating her line about how there is a bit more \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrunning room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 left in the economy, but an interest rate rise will probably soon be appropriate. Onto questions... Q: Aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you just looking for excuses not to raise interest rates? We are pleased about the state of the US economy, Janet Yellen replies, citing the steady job creation in recent months. But people are still coming back into the labour market, she repeats, so there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no sign of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153overheating\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd So.... The economy has a little more room to run than might have been previously thought. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see the economy overheating now. Yellen argues that US monetary policy stance is currently only \u00e2\u20ac\u0153modestly accommodative\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. So there is little danger of dropping behind the curve by leaving interest rates on hold today. Policy is not on a pre-set course, she adds. And then she argues that by not raising rates too soon, the Fed cuts the risk of having to cut rates in the future. Yellen asks the question on everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lips - if the US economy is improving, why didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t they raise the federal fund rate? She insists that the Fed isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worried about an economic slowdown. Instead, there is still \u00e2\u20ac\u0153scope for further improvement in the labour market\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. So with inflation below target, the Fed decided to leave rates unchanged and let more data flow in ... The Fed still expects inflation to rise to 2% in the next two-to-three years, Yellen continues. But the Fed can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take it for granted that long-term inflation expectations will remain well-anchored (ie, that American citizens will believe that inflation is actually heading back to target) Recent employment data shows that more people are coming back to the labour market looking for jobs, says Yellen. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very encouraging sign - but also means there is still some slack to mop up. Janet Yellen is giving a press conference right now! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being streamed live here. The Fed chair confirms that the Fed believes the economy has strengthened, but left rates on hold. She says household spending has driven growth up, but business investment remains \u00e2\u20ac\u0153soft\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Some snap reaction and analysis: Alhough the Federal Reserve resisted hiking rates, the US central bank does believe that the economic conditions are improving. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement suggests that the economy is in decent-enough shape, but inflation is still too low to justify higher borrowing costs. The Fed says: (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve bolded-up some parts) Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in July indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and growth of economic activity has picked up from the modest pace seen in the first half of this year. Although the unemployment rate is little changed in recent months, job gains have been solid, on average. Household spending has been growing strongly but business fixed investment has remained soft. Inflation has continued to run below the Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months. But... Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further. Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced. The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments. Wall Street has taken today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision in its stride - shares are a little higher, and the dollar has dipped a little. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing serious. The Federal Reserve has also cut its interest rate expectations - now only expecting 1 rate hike this year (down from two in June). The Fed also expects rates to rise more gradually in 2017 and 2018, and cut its longer-run interest rate forecast to 2.9 percent from 3.0 percent. But yet....the Fed said the near-term risks for the economic outlook \u00e2\u20ac\u0153appear roughly balanced.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This new dot chart shows how the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policymakers expect rates to change of the next few years: The Fed has dropped a clear hint that it is close to raising interest rates - just not today. In today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement, it says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. And 14 of the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 17 policymakers expect at least one hike by the end of this year. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t unanimous! Three Federal Reserve policymakers voted to raise borrowing costs today. They are: Kansas City Fed President Esther George, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren. BREAKING: The Federal Reserve has left interest rates unchanged at 0.25% to 0.5%. More to follow..... OK, nearly time for the most eagerly anticipated Central Bank decision since the Bank of Japan shook up its stimulus programme this morning :) We get the decision at the top of the hour, along with new economic forecasts. Then 30 minutes later, Fed chair Janet Yellen holds a press conference. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a nervous few hours on the New York stock market. The Dow opened higher, then slid into negative territory as Fed jitters gnawed away at traders. And now it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s back where it started, up just 0.07%. This chart also shows how investors are positioning themselves for rates to be higher in three month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. Anticipation is growing.... Just 30 minutes to go! And the markets reckon there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s less than a one-in-four chance that the Fed will raise interest rates. Wall Street isnt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 always right, of course. So you can expect some wild movements if Janet Yellen produces a surprise at 2pm Eastern Time (7pm in the UK). This chart shows how a September hike is a 22% chance, while rising to 31% in November, and then 59% for December. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a look at various probabilities for the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions and comments, courtesy of John Kicklighter, chief strategist at DailyFX: Ahead of the Federal Reserve press conference due in just under an hour and a half, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the link to watch it live. After the Bank of Japan caught some observers by surprise with its new stimulus measures and boosted European markets, some of the gloss came off during the course of the day ahead of the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate decision. As we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve covered, most people believe the Fed will leave rates on hold, although there is still a chance it might catch markets on the hop with a surprise increase. And even if rates are left unchanged, investors will be looking for any hints from US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen about when borrowing costs might rise. In Europe the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished virtually unchanged, up just 3.98 points or 0.06% at 6834.77 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.41% to 10,436.49 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac climbed 0.48% to 4409.55 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB closed up 0.88% at 16,349.82 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.83% at 8758.5 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.27% to 562.12 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently pretty flat, up just 2 points. Markets are betting on a no-change statement from the Federal Reserve on US interest rates but will be keen to hear the tone of the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments, says strategist James Chen at City Index: Not much has changed from the past several weeks in terms of the very low expectations for a rate hike. If anything, [today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of Japan] announcement of new easing measures could even further discourage a Fed move, but as it already stands, there are very few market participants that are betting on such a move to higher interest rates, at least for this particular Fed meeting. Key Fed speakers and major US economic data releases have alternately shifted the discussion from one side to another in the past few weeks. Some members advocated a rate hike this year, even citing the possibility of one occurring in September, while others, like Fed Governor Lael Brainard, cautioned against raising interest rates too quickly. Additionally, September has thus far seen a general deterioration of US economic data in the form of substantially worse-than-expected releases regarding employment (NFP), both the manufacturing and services industries (PMI), retail sales, and housing, that were all significantly worse than expected. The one potentially brighter spot for the Fed was the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation reading for August, which showed that both headline and core prices increased by more than expected. Despite this more buoyant view of inflation, however, it is still unlikely to be enough to sway the Fed into action today. Amidst all of these economic data releases and Fed member speeches, the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view of the implied probability of a rate hike today has continued to hover in the low-to-high teens. Of course, there could always be a surprise move, but the much more likely scenario will be a characteristically unmovable Fed. Therefore, the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focus, as has consistently been the case from the beginning of the year, will be concentrated on the words emanating from the Fed statement as it relates to the indication of a possible rate hike in December and the potential pace of tightening going forward. The current market probability of a December hike remains around 60%. The key markets to watch today, as always, will be US equity markets, gold, and the US dollar, particularly US dollar/Japanese yen due the earlier Bank of Japan announcement. A more hawkish Fed today could lead to a rebound for the dollar/yen while a more dovish statement could lead to a further drop for dollar/yen towards the key 100.00 mark and below. Predictions of the economic gloom which would follow the Brexit vote seem to be wide of the mark, according to a new Guardian project tracking the state of play as Britain prepares to leave the European Union. As a reminder, the UK Treasury for one forecast dire consequences in the immediate wake of the vote: Unveiling the new Guardian project, Katie Allen writes: Fears that Britain will slide into a post-referendum recession have been allayed after a Guardian analysis showed the latest news on the economy has confounded analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 gloomy expectations, with consumer spending strong, unemployment low and the housing market holding steady. The finding comes as a leading thinktank toned down its earlier dire warnings of economic turmoil for the UK and its neighbours in the event of a leave vote. The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said prompt action by the Bank of England to cut interest rates had cushioned the blow from June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote but it still believes the UK will suffer a sharp slowdown next year amid heightened uncertainty. Official figures on the state of the public finances, released on Wednesday, also showed little impact from the vote to leave the EU. Government borrowing was a touch higher than economists had expected in August, but was lower than a year ago in a boost to the chancellor, Philip Hammond, as he prepares to give his maiden autumn statement in November. Following the historic 23 June vote to leave the EU, analysts were quick to predict the UK economy would grind to a halt or even shrink. They warned businesses and households would stop spending because of job cuts, political uncertainty and a squeeze on living standards as the weak pound stoked inflation. But since the Bank stepped in with a package of measures to shore up the economy, much of the economic news has defied expectations and many analysts have toned down their post-referendum gloom. Now the picture of early resilience is bolstered in the first snapshot of post-referendum Britain in a new Guardian project that will track the economy as the Brexit talks begin and progress, and as more data on the economy becomes available. The first report is here: US crude stocks fell unexpectedly last week as producers reduced their output, helping oil prices extend their early gains. Crude inventories dropped by 6.2m barrels, according to the Energy Information Administration, compared to expectations of an increase of 3.4m barrels. Gasoline stocks fell by a larger than expected 3.2m barrels, with analysts forecasting a 567,000 decline according to Reuters. But stocks of distillates - which include diesel and heating oil - increased by 2.2m barrels compared to forecasts of a 250,000 rise. Brent crude is now 1.35% higher at $46.50 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is up 1.95% at $44.91. Christopher Vecchio, currency analyst at DailyFX, said: Here we go again: What once was a much heralded and anticipated rate decision, the September FOMC meeting seems all but wrapped up at this point. The Federal Reserve will keep its main rate on hold at 0.25-0.50%, citing near-term, weak economic developments, yet insisting that enough progress has been made to warrant a rate hike at one of the upcoming meetings (hint: December, when the next SEPs are released). The key for the US Dollar today, however, is to what degree of confidence the FOMC has in the US economy, or simply, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchow quickly does the Fed think it will be able to raise rates next?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ...In actuality, rate expectations are completely muted for today and are sitting on the fence for 2016. This is the main source of risk for markets today. Should the FOMC choose to be headstrong and tear down conventional wisdom - a small possibility with two prime dealers coming out and calling for a rate hike - global markets will be shocked. But assuming the Fed plays it safe as it usually does, a lack of a rate hike may not hurt the US Dollar significantly. By suggesting that a rate hike is still \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on the table\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the near-term, and by laying out an interest rate glide path for next year calling for multiple rate hikes, then the Fed could help insulate the US dollar, plain and simple. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s starting to feel like a September-December 2015 redux. So what are the chances of a US rate rise? Ahead of the Federal Reserve interest rate decision, US markets are moving higher. Most investors expect the Fed to leave rates on hold, but this is by no means guaranteed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 76 points or 0.4% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.36% higher and the Nasdaq composite was up 0.4% initially. European markets are holding onto their gains - albeit off their best levels - with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac both climbing 0.6%. But the FTSE 100 is up just 0.15% or 10 points. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The FTSE has seen its gains roughly halve as the day has gone on, the early Bank of Japan stimulus excitement gradually waning as more and more analysts voiced their scepticism about the effectiveness of the measures Kuroda and co. announced this morning. The same thing has happened in the Eurozone, the DAX and CAC now both up around half a percent having surged by as much as 1% after the bell. Larry Summers, the former US Treasury secretary, has fired an epic Tweetstorm towards the Federal Reserve, explaining why they shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hike. He argues that the US labour market is far from overheating, and that the Fed should be comfortable with inflation running over its 2% target for some time, following the current underrun (inflation is currently 1.1%). He also fears that a surprise hike tonight might unbalance the economy at a crucial moment, sending the dollar too high, and creating a mess the Fed can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fix.... Over in America, policymakers at the Federal Reserve have just begun today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy meeting. In five hours time, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll announce whether they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve raised US interest rates for the first time this year. The financial markets are widely expecting the Fed to sit elegantly on its hands tonight - but perhaps drop a big hint to expect a December rate hike. But some investors, such as hedge fund manager Dan Loeb, fear that the markets are hopelessly addicted to easy money.... Some City cynicism about the BoJ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bold pledge to get inflation above target: Royal London Asset Management have kindly sent over their full reaction to the Bank of Japan (as flagged earlier). Trevor Greetham, their head of multi asset investing, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is helicopter money in all but name and it is supportive of our overweight stance in Japanese equities. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Japan has been suffering from excessive debt and deflationary pressure for longer than any other developed market, so we should watch new policy developments in Tokyo with interest. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement makes it clear that the authorities are going down the route of explicit financial repression, boosting nominal growth while keeping interest rates near zero at all maturities. The idea is to transfer wealth from savers to borrowers, the government included, to reduce debt burdens and wipe the slate clean. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Monetary policy didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ease today, as the muted market reaction shows, but the economy isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t weak enough to merit it. If growth turns downwards, the new framework allows Japan to make short rates more negative, increase the monetary base and expand government spending without needing to worry about the markets.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The markets are still digesting today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement, which sent the Tokyo stock market up by 2%. The yen, though, has reversed its initial selloff and is now at a four-week high against the US dollar. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not what the BoJ wants to see.... Lord Livermore (a former top strategist for Gordon Brown and Tony Blair) cautions against complacency over the EU referendum effect. City experts have now had a few hours to digest the Bank of Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new stimulus plan. And opinion is still split. Duncan Weldon of Resolution Group reckons that the BoJ is paving the way for the Japanese government to boost its spending, turning monetary stimulus into fiscal muscle. He explains: The BOJ is effectively pledging to hold ten year borrowing costs at around zero (the yield curve target) and to do this for quite some time (the inflation overshoot pledge). That is a strong signal that the government should follow through with fiscal stimulus \u00e2\u20ac\u201d stimulus that effectively comes with no borrowing costs. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not quite a monetary financing but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a step closer. A pledge to overshoot a target you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve consistently failed to hit isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t especially credible. The macro impact of that pledge through expectations is unlikely to be large. But a pledge to finance government spending at zero per cent for the coming years could be a much bigger deal \u00e2\u20ac\u201d even if it is only making explciit what has been implicit in Japan for quite some time. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full piece: Nick Gartside of JP Morgan Asset Management says the BoJ have been pretty creative, defying those who thought central banks were out of ammunition. By adopting the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcyield curve control concept\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, which is designed to steepen the Japanese yield curve by targeting a 10 year JGB yield of 0%, the Bank of Japan showed that central bankers still have a few tricks up their sleeves. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a creative and imaginative policy and markets have reacted favourably. The policy, which also commits to expanding the monetary base until inflation reaches 2% on a sustainable basis, is a form of long range forward guidance. Royal London Asset Management reckon the BoJ will be flooding Japan with money for some time -- which should pump share prices higher. Bur Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit fears the BoJ may be firing blanks. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK public finances.... Every cloud has a darker cloud behind it.... In a busy morning for Brexity data, the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regional agents have reported that UK firms have cut back on investment intentions, and hiring plans, since the Referendum. But there are signs of a pick-up in August. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key points: More here: Economist Rupert Seggins has helpfully charted today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data: Property transaction figures from HMRC out today show that there hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been the market crash that many feared following the Brexit vote in June. Residential property transactions were broadly flat between July and August, albeit down 6.1% from a year ago. The provisional figures show that 97,660 homes were bought in August, only slightly lower than the 97,710 that changed hands in July. (These are seasonally adjusted figures.) Commercial deals picked up again, after a drop in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote to 10,010 in July from 10,630 in June. Non-residential transactions totalled 10,620 in August, up 6.1% from July and 8% higher than a year ago. David Brown, chief executive of London estate agents Marsh &amp; Parsons, said of the residential figures: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The total numbers for Q1 and Q2 of 2016 were astronomically high compared to the corresponding period last year. Consequently the market is still levelling after the frenzy we saw as people clambered to meet the April Stamp Duty deadline. This, along with the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to curb Buy-to-let mortgages, caused such an enormous spike in activity, that even if we had not had the referendum vote, we would have expected to spend a good few months seeing the market recover to some level of normality. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At Marsh &amp; Parsons we are certainly seeing good levels of activity, and it is particularly pleasing to see a number of enquiries resurfacing from people who had put their property searches on hold a couple of months ago. We are feeling optimistic about the remainder of the year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Financial Times also reckons Britain is going to miss its borrowing target this year: The old targets may be academic, though, if Philip Hammond does tear up George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal targets in two months time.... This chart shows how the OECD have just halved their forecast for UK growth next year, from 2% to 1%. But Britain is one of the few countries whose 2016 growth has been revised UP (by 0.1% to 1.8%): Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, has responded to the OECD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that UK growth be robust this year, but slow in 2017. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The underlying strength in the UK economy will support growth this year, and we have seen that in the labour market where employment is at a record high. The OECD highlights uncertainty in their outlook, and while I recognise that there may be some difficult times ahead, I am confident that we have the tools necessary to support the economy as we adjust to a new relationship with the EU and take advantage of the opportunities that it offers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That reference to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctools\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 suggests Hammond is planning to use November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Autumn Statement to reset the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal plan - perhaps through additional infrastructure spending funded by more borrowing? Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finance figures show that Britain has borrowed \u00c2\u00a35bn less this financial year, compared with a year ago. Encouraging...but not enough to hit this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit targets. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It may still be very difficult for the Chancellor to meet the March Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast for 2016/17, which envisaged public borrowing being \u00c2\u00a321 billion lower than the latest estimate for 2015/16. We expect that the OBR will revise up its borrowing projections materially in November and the Chancellor is unlikely to seek to offset this at a time when the priority is to support the economy in the uncertain period following the Brexit vote. Speaking of Brexit...The west\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading economic thinktank has backtracked on its warning that the UK would suffer instant damage if the public voted to leave the European Union. In a new report, the OECD has thrown its weight behind plans by Theresa May to provide fresh post-referendum support to growth in November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s autumn statement. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, reports: Until recently a staunch supporter of George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s austerity plan, the OECD said it was appropriate for the new chancellor, Philip Hammond, to increase public spending in his first major policy statement later this year. The thinktank said it was still predicting a sharp slowdown in the economy, but that this would not happen until 2017. It said that the expected negative effects on the rest of the global economy of Brexit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c compared in June to the equivalent of a hard landing for China \u00e2\u20ac\u201c had also been delayed. The OECD now expects the UK to grow by 1.8% this year, a small increase on its old forecast. But this will fall to 1% in 2017, they fear. The OECD also cut its growth forecasts for the global economy; world GDP is now expected to rise by 3.2% in 2017, down from the 3.3% previously. Suren Thiru, Head of Economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), fears that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances will deteriorate in the months ahead: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Although government borrowing fell in August, it was by less than many had expected. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the UK economy slows as we expect, cutting the deficit is likely to become increasingly problematic as materially weaker growth will make it more difficult to generate tax revenue. ONS chief economist Joe Grice says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data confirms that Britain hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t suffered a severe Brexit shock. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As the available information grows, the referendum result appears, so far, not to have had a major effect on the UK economy. So it hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fallen at the first fence but longer-term effects remain to be seen.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Of course, Britain hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even triggered Article 50 yet -- and no-one knows what kind of Soft Brexit, or Hard Brexit, we will end up with. The 8% improvement in August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK public finances isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough to get the British government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficit reduction plan back on track. So says Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s encouraged that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no sign of a Brexit-induced meltdown, but fears the economy will slow in 2017 as negotiations with the European Union intensify. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his snap take: Mixed news for Chancellor Phillip Hammond as the public finances saw a modestly reduced year-on-year shortfall in August and July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surplus was revised up slightly. On the positive side, this adds to the evidence that the economy has been resilient so far following June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote, with tax receipts holding up relatively well overall. Nevertheless, the public finances are still off track to meet the March budget target, which highlights the fact that the Chancellor really has limited ability to provide a boost to the economy in November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Autumn Statement if he is to maintain a semblance of fiscal discipline. Newsflash from London: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly deficit shrank by 8% in August, despite the shock of June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum. The Office for National Statistics reports that the UK borrowed \u00c2\u00a310.546bn to balance the books last month, down from \u00c2\u00a311.47bn in August 2015 [that excludes the impact of our stakes in Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group]. However, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than expected - the City had forecast a monthly deficit of \u00c2\u00a310.0bn. So the government may still be struggling to hit this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borrowing target: Importantly, the ONS says there are no clear signs of any impact on the public finances, following the Brexit vote. They report that income tax receipts were strong in August, but VAT receipts grew at their slowest pace since March 2015. More to follow.... Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jonathan Ferro smells a rat.... Oh dear... the early yen selloff has faded: Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda has put down the jam knife, and faced the press to explain the new stimulus measures agreed today. He insists that the BoJ could launch more stimulus measures, if needed, including cutting interest rates deeper into negative. Kuroda says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hesitate to adjust monetary policy with an eye on economic and price developments. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will ease further when necessary. We can cut short-term rates, lower the long-term rate target, buy more assets or if conditions warrant, accelerate the pace of expansion in monetary base. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s room to ease further with the three dimensions of quantity and quality of assets as well as interest rates.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kuroda also conceded that his stimulus package hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet delivered the goods, since it was launched in 2013. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true that more than three years have passed. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s absolutely no change to our commitment to achieve 2 percent (inflation) at the earliest date possible. And he also claimed that the BoJ will be able to manage the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcyield curve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (which tracks the interest rate on shorter and longer-dated bonds) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say we can fully control long-term rates like the way we control short-term rates. But central banks have already been taking steps to directly influence long-term rates. The BOJ has done so too and clearly has been successful.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (thanks to Reuters for the quotes) Kit Juckes, currency expert at Societe Generale, reckons governor Kuroda has scraped together whatever he could find: Some City investors are wondering whether to bet against the central bank... There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing like the smell of more easy money to get bank shares rallying... European stock markets are rallying in early trading, led by the banking sector. The FTSE 100 has jumped by 35 points, or 0.5%, to 6867, as investors give an early thumbs-up to the BoJ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement. Barclays (+4%) is the top riser in London, with Lloyds Banking Group (+2.5%) and Standard Chartered (2.2%).close behind Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX index has jumped by 1%, while the French CAC is up by 1.2%. That follows the strong trading in Asia, where Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market jumped by 2%. Traders are welcoming the new that central banks can still find ways to stimulate their economies (even though we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if it will work. Mike van Dulken &amp; Henry Croft at Accendo Markets explain: The positive start comes after a markets welcomed the Bank of Japan (BoJ) leaving its already negative interest rates unchanged overnight and tweaking its existing stimulus programme. This buys governor Kuroda some time and leaves the door open for more rate cuts/policy easing which has seen the Yen weaken to the benefit of Nikkei exporters and helped financials rally. As expected, the BoJ has offered an interesting policy update for markets to digest and is a good effort at dispelling uncertainty about global central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losing potency and running out of ammo. And while the Fed is unlikely to make any policy change tonight, its message and sure-fire subtle hints certainly could, especially in light of fresh Yen weakness sending the US dollar basket to September highs. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s measures are being dubbed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153QQEYCC\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153quantitative and qualitative monetary easing with yield curve control\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Yield curve control? Well, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the new commitment to keep the yield, or interest rates, on Japanese 10-year bonds at zero. Peter Wells of FastFT has done a nice explanation: If there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one thing we can be sure of, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that the Bank of Japan has added to its alphabet ramen of policy terms. Markets will now be served a piping hot bowl of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153quantitative and qualitative monetary easing with yield curve control\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Yield curve control\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that part of the auto-pilot function in a Tesla? It may well be, but in the context of the Bank of Japan it means policymakers are making a renewed effort to keep borrowing costs low in an effort to spur growth. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s broad agreement that the Bank of Japan has taken monetary policy into new territory today, despite leaving interest rates on hold. But while some financial experts welcome the changes to the BoJ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus package, others fear that it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. Takashi Miura, banking analyst at Credit Suisse, says the new measure are a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153positive surprise\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s positive for banks. The BOJ did not deepen the negative rate, so there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no impact on banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 lending rates. Furthermore, I think the BOJ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new target to keep 10-year yields hovering around zero percent means the central bank effectively won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deepen the negative rate. That is a positive for banks. Divya Devesh of Standard Chartered says the key news is the BoJ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new commitment to overshoot the 2percent inflation target: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s committing to continue easing for longer than previously expected. Also hinting that the balance sheet will remain large for a long time. We think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dollar/yen positive. Also, markets are a bit relieved given no further cuts to interest rates.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However.... Nick Kounis of ABN Amro isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s measures go far enough. This is from Ilya Spivak of DailyFX.com Duncan Weldon of the Resolution Group argues that Tokyo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government needs to boost spending too: The Bank of Japan will be pleased to see that the yen is weakening. The Japanese currency has fallen by 1% against the US dollar, from \u00c2\u00a5101 to \u00c2\u00a5102. Lower is better, if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re trying to get inflation higher #CurrencyWars The Tokyo stock market has rallied strongly, as investors welcome the Bank of Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new commitment to overshoot its inflation target. The Nikkei has jumped by almost 2%, or 315 points, while the wider Topix index gained 2.7%. Bank shares are leading the rally; on relief that the BoJ didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t slash interest rates deeper into negative territory. Good morning. Central bankers have fired a lot of ammunition into the financial system, in the eight years since the crisis blew up. And the Bank of Japan has just shown that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not out of firepower yet. The BoJ has rebooted its stimulus programme overnight, announcing a cocktail of new targets and measures. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a new bid to drive inflation and growth, and weaken the yen. But it also resisted slashing interest rates; instead, it has adjusted its bond-buying efforts, and reasserted its commitment to getting inflation back to 2%. At its eagerly awaited policy meeting today, the BoJ: Left interest rates at their current record low of minus 0.1%. Promised to keep intervening until inflation \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exceeds the price stability target of 2 per cent and stays above the target in a stable manner\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Vowed to maintain its existing its government bond buying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more or less in line with the current pace\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of \u00c2\u00a580tn a year. But it will buy fewer very long-dated bonds, which should push up long-term interest rates and help banks make profits. Announced a pledge to cap 10-year government bond yields at zero per cent. That means the BoJ must keep intervening in the markets to prevent borrowing costs rising, and to ensure Tokyo can borrow for a decade for free. It all adds up to another commitment to do \u00e2\u20ac\u0153whatever it takes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to drag Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy out of its ever-lengthening period of weak growth and soggy inflation. The Financial Times are calling it an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unprecedented new kind of monetary easing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We should hear more from Japanese central bank chief Haruhiko Kuroda shortly. And it sets the tone for a big day in central banking. At 7pm BST, the US Federal Reserve will announce whether it has taken the plunge and raised interest rates for the first time this year. The markets are expecting the Fed to leave rates on hold, probably until December. But as the BoJ showed today, you never quite know where you are with central banks....",

                "bodyText":"Ding ding ding.... the closing bell on the New York stock exchange has been rung. And the US stock market has lost almost 1%, as investors brace for tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clash between the two candidates to become US president. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 166 points, or 0.91%, with almost every component dropping. Banks were the big fallers (who caught a cold from the troubles at Deutsche Bank). The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq both dropped by 0.8%, following heavier losses in Europe with Britain suffering its worst day since late June. And as we covered earlier, Analysts are predicting further losses if Trump outperforms in the debate the VIX fear index has hit a two week high. Investors are betting against the Mexican Peso - anticipating a Trump victory And US, German and UK government bonds have jumped, as traders scramble for safety tonight. But now, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing more that investors can do. They must just wait to see how the first presidential debate plays out. And with the polls so close, it could be a real classic.... My colleagues will be live-blogging all the action here: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back in the morning to see how the markets react. Until then, good nght and thanks for reading and commenting. GW Donald Trump hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t released a massive amount of detail about his policy platform if he becomes president. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one reason the markets are nervous about the presidential race. But despite that, City firm Columbia Threadneedle have taken a stab at the potential impact of a Trump victory. They reckon infrastructure providers should benefit, if Trump does launch a massive programme of building more roads, bridges, and the like. But that means more borrowing, which could get expensive. Mark Burgess of Columbia explains: Trump has made some disconcerting comments regarding a lack of commitment to debt repayments. If a substantial global event like the financial crisis were to occur again, this may mean domestic debt is paid while foreign debt remains outstanding. Could this deter investors? This would be particularly unfortunate as Treasury issuance is likely to increase significantly in order to fund the various costly proposals as the US racks up larger deficits. Richard Scalone, co-head of foreign exchange at TJM Brokerage in Chicago, says US election uncertainty isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helping the dollar. He told Reuters that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Most market participants are waiting to see what comes out of the debate tonight and will take their cue from there.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd US Treasuries (American government debt) have rallied today, on nervousness ahead of tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debate. This has pushed the yield (or interest rates) on 10-year Treasury bonds down to 1.587%, from 1.6% on Friday. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another sign that investors are looking for safety tonight. As Kim Rupert, managing director for fixed income at Action Economics in San Francisco, put it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A lot of the gains in Treasuries are safe-haven trades....Stocks are also looking pretty weak with a lot of concerns about financials with Deutsche Bank.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hillary Clinton has a five point lead over Donald Trump, according to the latest weekly tracking poll from NBC News. But that follows a Bloomberg poll this morning putting the two candidates level (and Trump ahead, in a four-way fight). And polling expert Nate Silver believes it is too close to call: Stocks are still down on Wall Street, with just under an hour to go until the closing bell. The Dow is currently off 159 points, or 0.8%, at 18101 -- a level it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been hovering around for most of the day, really. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq are showing similar losses. Bank shares continue to get a kicking; Goldman and JP Morgan are both down 2.5% (due to the worries over Deutsche Bank). Walt Disney is now among the fallers too, down 1.7%, following a report it might bid for Twitter. CNN aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pulling their punches -- they predict that stock markets will probably tumble on Tuesday if Trump wins tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debate. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: Wall Street doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want a President Trump (with the exception of a few hedge fund managers and Trump supporters, like Carl Icahn). As the old saying goes, the market loves good news, it can deal with bad news, but it hates uncertainty. And Trump is the motherlode of uncertainty. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The typical investor just can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t contemplate the possibility of a Trump victory,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Cary Leahey, chief U.S. economist at Decision Economics.... So the closer the race gets, the more worried investors become.... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If for some reason Trump puts on a presidential showing...and Clinton stumbles for whatever reason, then the market may take another reassessment,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Leahey. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the polite way of saying, stocks are likely to fall. More here: Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s protectionist rhetoric is a particular worry for Wall Street. CNBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Elizabeth Gurdus reports that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think neither candidate has super market-friendly policies,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dean Curnutt, CEO of Macro Risk Advisors, said on CNBC. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Both have been reasonably anti-trade. Clinton was pulled pretty far left by Bernie Sanders. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies really resemble very little of what we typically associate with free-market Republicanism.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attacks on Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen add another dollop of instability to the pot. If he wins in November, Yellen might not bank on getting a second term. Mexico\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturers might want to raise a glass to Donald Trump; by weakening the peso, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s made their exports much more competitive: The US dollar is already dropping against the yen, even before the two nominees take to the stage in New York. One dollar now gets you 100.29 yen in the FX market, down 0.7% compared to Friday, when your greenback was worth 101.1 yen. That won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t amuse the Tokyo government much; Japan wants to weaken its currency to push inflation up. The US, Canada, Brazil and Mexico stock markets are all down today, following losses across Europe. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more of an adjustment than a rout, though - with Wall Street losing less than 1% so far. Most European market shed less than 2% (they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re all closed now) There could be a surge of money into safe-havens if Donald Trump outperforms expectations on tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debate, City experts say. Chris Beauchamp of IG predicts that the Japanese Yen and US government bonds (Treasuries) could both benefit: Tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US presidential election debate is a major event for financial markets, with risky assets likely to see significant volatility, should Trump manage to further build on the gains he has made over recent weeks. Despite significant movements towards Trump in recent polls, IG clients perceive there still to be a 62% chance of a Clinton win, according to the IG binary market. That being said, Hilary remains a somewhat uninspiring personality and there is a distinct risk that tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debate could see the polls tighten even further, thus driving investors towards havens such as the yen and Treasuries. Some investors are looking at the Presidential Race as a serious chance to make money. The rest are just worried about losing what they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already got. But how do you trade, say, a Donald Trump victory? Well, Mexico\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency has emerged as a surprise proxy for the Upset To End All Upsets. When Trump does well, or Hillary Clinton has a bad day, the Mexicon peso often takes a pasting. This chart shows how the peso has weakened since April, from 17 to the $1 to almost 20/$1 today. And the pressure is getting worse -- bets against the poor old Peso have hit a record high and the cost of insuring against future losses has spiked. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vow to build a wall on the Mexican border means the country is at \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the sharp end of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTrump risk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Nicholas Spiro a partner at London-based Lauressa Advisory Ltd. More here: Mexican Peso Shorts at Record Ahead of U.S. Election Debate Volatility is also rising on Wall Street today as the race to the White House hots up. The CBOE Market Volatility index, or VIX (commonly known as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fear gauge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) is up 1.9% today - the biggest rise in a fortnight. Reuters has more details: With just over six weeks until Election Day, some investors see a toss-up contest creating volatility in certain sectors, including health insurers, drugmakers and industrials. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Investors are acting extremely nervous with regards to the debate ... and it highlights the fact that the markets are not focusing on the health of the economy, interest rates and geopolitical events,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth. Wall Street banks Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan are the biggest fallers on the Dow Jones industrial average today. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re both down around 1.8%, as financial stocks suffer from worries over the health of Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Deutsche Bank. Consumer group Procter &amp; Gamble and tech giant Apple are among the few risers, but most stocks have dropped as investors await for tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debate (in just under 8 hours time). Over in Greece the former deputy premier Evangelos Venizelos has warned the country faces political, social and economic disintegration as financial indicators worsen and the government scrambles to push through long overdue reforms. Helena Smith reports from Athens: Venizelos, finance minister at the height of the Greek debt crisis, issued a withering assessment of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance in office. In a speech to businessmen on the future of Greece at the Thessaloniki chamber of commerce and industry the politician said the country was in danger of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153institutional, economic and social collapse\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd because the leftist-led coalition lacked a strategic plan to exit its long-running debt crisis. Instead, he claimed, ministers were working to the slogan \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we are doing well and will do better\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and were turning a blind eye to real problems as the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s real economy plummeted. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government is making out as if it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand how critical things are. Its theory \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwe are doing well and will do better\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is a spring that will pop up.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Venizelos, whose Pasok socialist party was in office with the main opposition conservatives until being ejected by Syriza, the radical left group led by prime minister Alexis Tsipras, spoke as the government prepared to push more creditor-mandated reforms through parliament tomorrow. Some \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.8bn worth of aid is at stake. After a summer of little progress, the aim is for parliament to legislate on the 15 milestone actions by the time the Euro Working Group meets on Thursday. The reforms, which include appointment of officials to a new privatisation fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supervisory board, are expedient if a second bailout review is to begin and debt relief talks officially opened. Earlier on Monday the European Commission Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis said the thrice-bailed out nation had been forced to endure more punitive austerity than otherwise necessary because of Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 populist pledge to end the policies when he assumed power in January 2015. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Populism doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t solve problems. Populism creates problems,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told a conference in Riga. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We could see that in the \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 classical example of Greece. A new government came with a populist stance, that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwe don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need any austerity regimes, we will spend as much as we want\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and, in fact, Greece now implements tougher austerity measures than it would have been necessary if [reforms] of the previous government were continued at the time.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Meanwhile: Britain will get no favours in the Brexit discussions, ECB president Mario Draghi hinted in his testimony to the European parliament. In his opening speech Draghi - the latest to suggest Europe will take a tough line in the negotiations - said: Regardless of the type of relationship that emerges between the European Union and the United Kingdom, it is of utmost importance that the integrity of the single market is respected. Any outcome should ensure that all participants are subject to the same rules. He added (as quoted by Bloomberg): It is very hard to imagine that any agreement that will be perceived as discriminatory against some subjects or in favor of other subjects could be a source of stability for the future of our EU. A cocktail of concerns - from the forthcoming US presidential debate to worries about Brexit to uncertainty over the outcome of the current oil producers meeting in Algeria to a new drop in Deutsch Bank shares - combined to send European markets sharply lower at the start of the trading week. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 91.39 points or 1.32% - its biggest one day percentage fall since the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote - at 6818.04 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 2.19% to 10,393.71 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 1.8% lower at 4407.85 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 1.58% to 16,192.48 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 1.27% at 8711.4 In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.82% to 563.59 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 143 points or 0.78%. Bookmaker Ladbrokes has sent its buzzword bingo odds for the presidential debate, and here they are: 1/10 Make America Great Again 1/5 Commander In Chief 1/2 Lying 1/2 Putin 4/6 Crooked Evens Pneumonia Evens Pennsylvania Evens Terrific 5/4 Mexico\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Gonna Pay For It 6/4 Unbelievable 6/4 Reagan 6/4 Basket Of Deplorables 2/1 Racist 2/1 Founding Fathers 2/1 You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re Fired 3/1 Washington Bubble 4/1 Total Loser 5/1 Brexit 5/1 Give Me A Break 10/1 Monica Lewinsky 20/1 How the Hell Should I Know 20/1 How\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Your Cold 33/1 You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re No Jack Kennedy Some good news for Hillary and the reverse for Trump: Back with the race to become US president, and the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reaction ahead of the head-to-head debate, Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: Stocks in the US opened lower. A number of forecasters have raised their odds of a Donald Trump presidency ahead of the first of the presidential debates Monday evening. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Clinton the Wall Street darling versus Trump the Wall-builder. With shares near highs of the year, it seems fair to say that markets have so far discounted the probability of a Donald Trump victory. Mrs Clinton is seen as a continuation of the status quo, which hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly provided stellar growth and economic opportunity for America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poorest in the last decade. Donald Trump wants to shake up the status quo, from a market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perspective that necessarily means uncertainty. Meanwhile IG still reckons Hillary Clinton is still more likely to win the election. IG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market analyst Joshua Mahony said: Tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US presidential election debate is a major event for financial markets, with risky assets likely to see significant volatility, should Trump manage to further build on the gains he has made over recent weeks. Despite significant movements towards Trump in recent polls, IG clients perceive there still to be a 62% chance of a Clinton win, according to the IG binary market. That being said, Hilary remains a somewhat uninspiring personality and there is a distinct risk that tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debate could see the polls tighten even further, thus driving investors towards havens such as the yen and Treasuries. Asked about Deutsche Bank - whose shares have fallen sharply today - Draghi refuses to comment. And on Brexit, he says the ECB does not have an official role in the negotiations but may work in an advisory capacity. In questions Draghi repeats this theme: It is clear other policies should complement monetary policy action to reap all the benefits of the present monetary policy stance. He adds that if other policies are in place, the time for monetary policy stance to be successful would be shorter. And he admits that having low interest rates for longer would have side effects on financial stability. In his conclusion Draghi again suggests the ECB needs others - politicians particularly - to step up and do their bit for the EU: For the euro area to thrive, actions by national governments are needed to unleash growth, reduce unemployment and empower individuals, while offering essential protections for the most vulnerable.... The political commitment underpinning our single currency has been strongly reaffirmed during the crisis. Important efforts have been made. But widespread feelings of insecurity, including economic insecurity, remain a major concern. We cannot simply wait for better times: we need to renew our efforts to ensure that Economic and Monetary Union offers protection and prosperity. The ECB will do its part. On the effect of low (and indeed negative) interest rates, he said: Low rates are a symptom of the underlying economic situation. They reflect weak long-term growth trends and the protracted macroeconomic slump that has resulted from the crisis. The ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy has provided significant accommodation to limit the negative effects of the global and euro area-specific shocks on the economy, thereby mitigating their disinflationary impact. Nevertheless, monetary policy cannot determine the sustainable level of real interest rates in the long run, as they in turn depend on long-term growth prospects. This means that other policy actors need to do their part, pursuing fiscal and structural policies which will contribute to a self-sustaining recovery and increase the economic growth potential of the euro area, as I discussed with you in June. Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening remarks to the European Parliament have been released, and the European Central Bank president said that so far the European economy has stood up to the challenge of Brexit, so far: The recovery in the euro area is expected to continue at a moderate and steady pace, but with slightly less momentum than envisaged in June. On the positive side, incoming information continues to point to the euro area economy being resilient to global and political uncertainty, notably following the UK referendum outcome. The initial impact of the vote has been contained and the strong financial market reactions, such as equity price falls, have largely reversed.... The extent to which the economic outlook will be affected depends on the timing, development and final outcome of the upcoming negotiations. So far, the euro area economy has been resilient, but due to this uncertainty our baseline scenario remains subject to downside risks. Regardless of the type of relationship that emerges between the European Union and the United Kingdom, it is of utmost importance that the integrity of the single market is respected. Any outcome should ensure that all participants are subject to the same rules. The full speech is here. A bit of US economic news, and new home sales fell less than expected in August. The Commerce Department said sales of single family homes fell 7.6% to 609,000 compared to expectations of a decline to 600,000. July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure was revised up by 5,000 units to 659,000. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our US live blog of latest developments in the presidential race ahead of the Clinton-Trump debate: Back with the US debate, and Robert Shapiro of advisory firm Sonecon has looked at the economic prospects under the two candidates: Trump says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll restore 4% annual growth, or double our current rate. But his plan to achieve it is a deceit that would actually slow growth by deporting part of the labor force and ignoring everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s productivity. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no silver bullet, but Hillary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s program would help. Her path to citizenship and commitments to pay equity, child care assistance, universal health coverage, and more would expand the labor force. Furthermore, her pledges for tuition-free college, more support for R&amp;D, and more access to loans for young businesses would all help raise productivity. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an easy choice. His full post is here. Elsewhere Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank, is due to make his regular appearance before the European Parliament within the next half hour or so. He normally reads out his last governing council statement before being quizzed by MEPs, with Brexit of course high on the agenda. The session should be available here. As expected US markets are falling in early trading, ahead of the presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Investors are also jittery as oil producers meet in Algeria, with few expecting any positive decisions to curb the slump in the crude price although some are at least hoping for guidance that something may be done at Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s November meeting. The uncertainty over Brexit is not helping, nor is concern about Deutsche Bank after its shares fell sharply. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 105 points or 0.5%, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite opened down a similar amount. You can get psyched up for tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential debate by reading Dan Robert\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s list of 10 awkward question for the two candidates. Hillary Clinton should be ready for probing questions on globalisation, her counter-terrorism strategy and secrecy issues, while Donald Trump will need answers on his Middle East strategy, his suitability (or otherwise) for the most powerful job in the world, and whether he regrets anything he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s said during this most remarkable campaign. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a bad morning on Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets, with Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems and the looming presidential debate both hitting investor confidence. The FTSE 100 index of leading shares in London is still down around 1.25%; banks, builders and mining stocks are all leading the selloff. And European markets are deeper in the red: The news that Donald Trump is closing the gap with Hillary Clinton, ahead of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sure-to-be bruising debate has worried investors. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments about protectionist trade policies aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t terribly popular in the City, while suggestions that NATO members should pay for the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s protection have caused angst. And the closer the race looks, the more nervous markets will get. There could still be one big shock lurking in 2016\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s locker. Peter Rosenstreich, head of market strategy at Swissquote Bank, says traders are worrying about the impact of a Trump victory. Risk appetite has faded with many analysts pointing to the tightening of the US presidential elections and uncertainty around tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debates as the primary catalysts. Rosenstreich believes a Trump presidency could also help \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfringe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 political groups in Europe. Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s track record of supporting anti-establishment issues and candidates, such as Brexit and Russian President Putin, will legitimize Eurosceptic groups. With the EU questioning its post-Brexit future and elections in France, Spain and Germany, empowered fringe parties could potentially redefine the geopolitical landscape. Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are still at their lowest level since the 1980s, down 6%, despite repeatedly pledging that it hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been seeking help from the Berlin government. Chris Beauchamp of IG Index says Deutsche Bank is causing much alarm today. The new week has started with a bang, as the parlous state of Deutsche Bank explodes onto everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s radar once again. The bank has been limping along for months now, but reports that Angela Merkel may not step in to rescue the bank have sent the shares tumbling, dragging banks across the UK and Europe lower as a result. The gut feeling of most investors is that Berlin would be forced to act to avoid the loss of a key institution, but gut feelings do not always make the best trades. Wall Street is expected to fall when it opens in around 75 minutes. Here are the pre-open calls (via CMC Markets): S&amp;P 500: 9 points lower at 2,155 Dow Jones: 77 points lower at 18,184 Nasdaq 100: 28 points lower at 4,830 Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of communication, Joerg Eigendorf, has just told CNBC that the bank \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strongly intends\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to resolve its problems. Eigendorf denied that CEO John Cryan had appealed, in vain, to Angela Merkel,and reiterated that Deutsche does not need to raise fresh capital (despite the threat of a $14bn fine in the US). Here are the key points: Q: So Mr. Cryan was allegedly in Berlin and has asked for help at the Chancellery. JE: This is just wrong. At no moment of time. No point of time, John Cryan has asked the Chancellor for support in the negotiations with the Department of Justice and he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t intend to do that. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very strong in that position. Q: In Berlin, some who have been speculating about the fact that you are too big to fail. There are rumours all across the capital that Deutsche Bank is just too big. So what are you answering? JE: Just look, I mean yes the share price is low. But that is not what is worrying us and that is not what we are really looking. What is really important to us is Our credit story which is very strong. Its fundamentally strong and a lot of those in the market understand if they analyse the basics and the fundamentals that we are quite strong. Look at our credit story, value add risk very low, our credit portfolio very strong, liquidity position very strong, very comfortable and the third quarter is almost over. And I can tell you today is where we are finding very comfortable. Q: Berlin is not willing to bail you guys out. So does that put you in an insecure situation? JE: Again that is pure speculation. And for us it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just not a question. Deutsche Bank strongly intends to solve its problems or its challenges by itself and we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think about anything else. We do our homework here. We are structure of the bank. We try to get the litigation issues out of the way because this is creating this uncertainty. A lot that is out there in the market right now. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just pure speculation and uncertainty that was created by this and this is what we try to do. And by doing our homework, we will get this. This uncertainty out of the market again. Q: And looking at the markets though they are betting against you had the share price hit a new record low. How confident are you that you have enough time actually to do your homework? JE: We are very committed and we are doing our job. We are we are out there today and doing our homework. And the speculations, again, this is as if we need something today. We are fulfilling all capital requirements comfortably right now and that is not that is just speculation for the future and we have said time and once we got through the Canadian litigation issue all of the way once we get that restructuring done, the operative strengths of the bank will be seen again and once it is seen people will then these speculations will hopefully end. Q: Just one last question. Would you exclude the capital increase in the short to medium term now? JE: Again this is just not a question for us right now. We fulfil the capital requirements. We have time to fulfil future capital requirements and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what we are working on. The pound is on track to hit a five-week low, amid speculation that the UK could be heading for a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Sterling has fallen by half a cent to $1.293, which would be the lowest closing level since mid-August. Paresh Davdra, CEO and Co-Founder of RationalFX, blames a lack of communication about the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans for Brexit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The recent news reports that a so called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 seems the more likely strategy for the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU departure and this has had a dramatic impact on the pound, with sterling falling to a five week low. Despite the lost ground, the pound had regained last week in reaction to unchanged interest rates from the Fed, but has slumped as comments from the Ministers in charge of Brexit suggest that the UK would push to become a part of the World Trade Organisation \u00e2\u20ac\u201cthe strongest indication yet of divorce proceedings that forgoes prolonged negotiations for single market access with the EU. This echoes the front page of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Times, that City figures are increasingly fearful of a Hard Brexit John McFarlane, chairman of Barclays and TheCityUK lobby group summed up the mood to the FT: The danger of hard talk now is that it increases uncertainty, reduces confidence and will result in businesses triggering their exit plans from the UK. And yesterday, several business leaders including Ryanair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michael O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Leary criticised the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s handling of the issue. Trump and Clinton are now neck-and-neck in the race for the presidency, according to a new poll from Bloomberg. The pair are both claiming around 46% of the vote, in this latest Bloomberg Politics national poll which was conducted last week. And if two smaller parties are also included, the Republican nominee has a small leader over his Democrat rival. This suggests Trump has gained ground on Clinton in the last week, making tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debate, at Hofstra University in New York, even more dramatic. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some detail: Among likely voters under 35 years old, Clinton gets 50 percent to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 40 percent, down from her 29-point margin in August in the two-way race and from her 26-point margin in June in the three-way race. The poll\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 points for top-line numbers, with 1,002 likely voters interviewed, and is higher among subgroups. It was taken Wednesday through Saturday, after Clinton took political heat for calling half of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supporters \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deplorables\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and for disclosing she had pneumonia after a video caught her falling ill at a Sept. 11 ceremony. More here: Trump, Clinton Deadlocked in Bloomberg Poll Before Key Debate The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bryce Elder has explained how Deutsche Bank has been a poor investment for a long time.... (this is from the always excellent daily live chat on Alphaville) Back in the UK...the number of new mortgage approved by lenders has shrunk by 20%. The British Bankers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Association reports that 36,997 new home loans were approve in August, the lowest level since 2015. Mortgage approvals can be a good leading indicator of the direction of the housing market, so this may show that the Brexit vote has cooled demand. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: The German government is trying to slap down speculation that Deutsche Bank might need state aid (following those reports that Angela Merkel has declined to help). Steffen Seibert, Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokesman, insists that there is no reason to speculate about this issue at all. He told reporters that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is no reason for such speculation as presented there and the federal government doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t engage in such speculation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Deutsche Bank has insists that it can tackle its current problems without tapping shareholders for fresh capital, in response to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. A spokesman for the bank also denied that CEO John Cryan had asked chancellor Angela Merkel for help, to tackle the threatened $14bn fine from the DoJ. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the quote (via Reuters). John Cryan at no point asked the German Chancellor for the government to intervene in the U.S. Justice Department\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mortgages case. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Deutsche Bank is determined to resolve its challenges on its own.... There is currently no question of a capital increase. We are meeting all regulatory requirements.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This is helping Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares to recover some of their earlier losses -- when they hit a record low (according to my Reuters terminal...although other data show they were lower in the 1980s) Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is in a spin this morning, after Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downgraded the country to Junk status on Friday night. The BIST 100 index of leading shares has shed 4% this morning, with almost every company losing ground. Banking shares are leading the rout, dropping by around 6%. The Turkish lira has been hit, and government bond prices are also weakening - driving up the yield (or interest rate) on debt issued by Ankara. Mike van Dulken, Head of Research at Accendo Markets, says a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nasty cocktail\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of worries and threats are hitting shares this morning. They are: last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dovish central bank inspired rally having run its course; jitters about tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Trump v Clinton debate; waning faith in this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Algiers Oil meeting yielding anything whatsoever; German Chancellor Merkel saying no backstop for troubled Deutsche Bank (trading all-time lows), increasing sector contagion risk; City fears of a hard Brexit. He adds: Risk assets like Banks, Housebuilders and Miners are bearing the brunt of it this morning. Geopolitics appears to dominate. The financial pages of the UK newspapers are packed with Brexit stories. In the Guardian, AkzoNobel, one of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest industrial companies, is calling for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153quick clarity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd over the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future relationship with the EU. CEO Ton B\u00c3\u00bcchner says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As a CEO, what you prefer in situations like this is quick clarity, quick stability so everybody knows the rules, everybody can adapt to the situation on the ground. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As long as the situation on the ground is unclear people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know exactly whether big decisions are going to be right or wrong, so you get postponements [of decisions]. So for us that could be with our customers and it could be with our suppliers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Financial Times splash on City worries that Britain is heading for a hard Brexit, and losing access to the single market. That could force more businesses to start relocating from London, to other EU cities, to maintain access to the bloc. But the Telegraph is more upbeat, reporting that City economists have upgraded their growth forecasts for this year. They say: Panic has faded rapidly among the dozens of independent economists consulted by the Treasury as strong data in the three months since the vote reassured the analysts that any shock from the vote was far less severe than first feared. Forecasts for 2016\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP growth had been chopped to 1.5pc immediately after the 23 June ballot, but economists have reversed those downgrades and now expect growth of 1.8pc - exactly the same as they predicted before the vote. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also raised next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts, but still expect a serious slowdown: In July the average prediction was for growth of 0.5pc in 2017, but now it almost doubled to 0.9pc \u00e2\u20ac\u201c though it remains below the 2.1pc average forecast before the vote. An early rally in the oil price has fizzled out. Brent crude had jumped by 1% early doors, having shed over 3% on Friday. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now down slightly at $45.80 per barrel. Investors are (once again) facing the prospect that Opec fails to agree to curb production during their meeting in Algeria. Algerian energy minister Noureddine Bouterfa raised hopes yesterday, declaring that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will not come out of the meeting empty-handed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Around \u00c2\u00a322bn has now been wiped off the FTSE 100 this morning, with the blue-chip index currently down 88 points or 1.2%. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Matthew Campbell is also worried about Deutsche Bank: Shares in Deutsche Bank have now hit their lowest level in over 24 years. This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff appears to be triggered by reports that chancellor Angela Merkel won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide any state assistance for the troubles lender. Focus Magazine also reported that Merkel has declined to lobby the US Department of Justice over that $14bn fine for misconduct. That may worry investors, as Deutsche only set aside around $6bn. Newsflash from Berlin: German business morale has hit its highest level in over two years. The IFO institute says its business climate index rose to 109.5 this month, much higher than expectations of 106.4. Ifo head Clemens Fuest says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Companies are clearly more optimistic about the months ahead. They are also more satisfied with their current business situation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The German economy is expecting a golden autumn.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That suggests that Brexit fears have ebbed away; just in time for the US presidency to jump up the agenda... Money is flowing out of shares and into safe-haven assets this morning. This is driving up the value of German, US and UK government bonds, as investors hunker down ahead of the presidential debate. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx explains: Despite months and months of political drama one could make a fairly convincing argument for today being the real Day Zero for the US election. The first televised debate marks the point where Trump vs Clinton will be even more unavoidable than it already is, and therefore has reminded the market that the Brexit, US interest rates and China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic slowdown aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only macro-issues out there to worry about. In other words, the markets have been reminded this morning that a Donald Trump presidency is still more than possible, sparking a sharp decline roughly on par with the gradual gains managed last week. The FTSE dropped 80 points to duck under 6850, while the DAX and CAC fell 1.6% and 1.8% respectively. European banking stocks are getting pummelled this morning. Deutsche Bank is worst hit, shedding 6.6% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10.65. It is dogged by the threat of a $14bn fine from US authorities for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities before the 2008 crash. Lloyds Banking Group has dropped by 3%, after being downgraded to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by Goldman Sachs. Wall Street bank Citi has raise the possibility of a Trump victory in November to 40%, up from 35%. With the polls \u00e2\u20ac\u0153starting to tighten\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Citi is predicting much volatility in the foreign currency markets and precious metals prices if the Republican candidate triumphs. Citi also fears that the world economy will be hurt by the presidential race: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Citi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s base case is for a Clinton victory and mostly continuity in policies, which would leave U.S. and global growth expectations relatively unchanged... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But a Trump victory is a wild card and Citi expects this, among lingering uncertainties from Brexit and elsewhere, may cap the prospects for global growth to pick up in the remainder of the year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 2016 has been a year of shocks, but could November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential election be the biggest one yet? Mike Bell of JP Morgan reckons Trump is a stronger candidate than many people believe: Kit Juckes of Societe Generale says that the debate also sent shares down in Asia (where the Tokyo market shed 1%) We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re starting the week in a slight risk-off mood, with Asian equities soggy, currency markets quiet, 10-year Treasury yields down a bit at 1.62% (the average of the month so far) and oil slightly higher ahead of the informal oil producers meeting. FXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed says investors are wondering how to prepare for the election on November 8th. Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US presidential debate will probably break a new record, not in the S&amp;P 500, but the number of viewers which according to media analyst could reach over 100 million Americans, surpassing Carter-Reagan debate in 1980 which attracted 80.6 million viewers. With Donald Trump closing the gap with Hillary Clinton in latest polls, the debate is becoming more interesting than any other TV show. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s direction, achieving prosperity and securing America are the three major topics at the first presidential debate. Investors are becoming increasingly concerned on how to tweak their portfolios before November 8. Nasaq\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Biotech index plunged 4.5% in two days (24-25 Aug) in one tweet from Hillary Clinton criticising the recent price hikes on EpiPens, which suggest that investors and portfolio managers are seriously considering having different asset allocation strategies on the outcome of the election. However, I still believe that a Trump win will be perceived as a negative factor to the overall market. European stock markets are falling in early trading, as the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attention turns to the looming clash between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. In London, the FTSE 100 index shed 1% at the open, and is now down 80 points at 6829 (updated). The French and German markets are showing similar losses, amid signs that the presidential debate could be particularly brutal. The presidential election is now the biggest worry in the financial markets, with investors wonder whether 2016 will end with Trump preparing to succeed Barack Obama. The polls still put Clinton ahead, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s real uncertainty about the outcome. It became clear last night that both sides are preparing for a dirty fight tonight, when the bell rings at 9pm in New York. The Queensberry Rules don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t carry much weight when the White House is up for grabs, as my colleague David Smith explains: Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign manager did not rule out the prospect of the nominee getting personal onstage at Hofstra University in New York by summoning the ghosts of Bill Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sex life, insisting that the Republican candidate had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a right to defend himself\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The two camps traded threats over who would be in the debate audience. After Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team confirmed that it had offered a front row seat to billionaire Trump critic Mark Cuban, Trump responded that he might invite Gennifer Flowers, a former model who had an extramarital encounter with Bill Clinton in the 1980s. On Sunday, Clinton campaign chair John Podesta described Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reaction as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to dive in the sewer and go for a swim\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, although the Republican candidate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s running mate, Mike Pence, denied that Flowers would be present. Bob Schieffer, a venerable broadcaster who has moderated presidential debates, commented on CBS: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Those kinds of things are beneath the dignity of the office that these two people are running for. I think they both would do well to think about that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit reckons Trump could do better than expected.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There are three key questions in the City this morning; could oil producers agree an output deal soon? could Donald Trump become US president? What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening with Brexit? Over in Algeria, energy ministers are gathering for a two-day meeting of the International Energy Forum. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an opportunity for Opec members to have a behind-the-scenes chat about a potential deal to cut, or at least freeze output. Few observers expect a breakthrough this week, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the possibility of building towards an agreement at the next Opec meeting, in November. European investors are also bracing for the first US presidential election debate, which kicks off on Monday night in the US (so 2am Tuesday in the UK). Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will trade blows before a massive global audience, on issues such as national security, healthcare, immigration...and each other\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to carry out the most powerful job in the world. It could be a truly decisive moment in the race to the White House, as Bloomberg explains: The first of three debates promises to be a national sensation, contrasting two vastly different New Yorkers who are recognized around the world. Clinton, known for her extensive experience in government, is more comfortable discussing substantive issues than pitching her candidacy, and Trump excels as a self-promoter and an unsparing critic of his adversaries. Meanwhile back home, Brexit still means Brexit..... which means everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still wondering what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actually going on. This lack of clarity is now hurting Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial services industry, as the threat of losing \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpassporting rights\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to the EU lingers. My colleague Angela Monaghan explains: Optimism dropped for the third consecutive quarter in the three months to September, according to the research jointly produced by the CBI business lobby group and the accountancy firm PwC. It marked the longest run of deteriorating sentiment since the first quarter of 2009, when the global financial system was in the midst of a deep and prolonged crisis. The biggest drop in confidence was among finance houses, building societies and investment managers, and less so among banks. Optimism was broadly stable among life and general insurance providers. Also coming up... Mario Draghi, ECB president, is testifying at the European Parliament this afternoon (at 3pm BST). We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

The consultancy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s David Rees writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Mexican peso appreciated by more than 2% against the US dollar shortly after the Democrat candidate, Hillary Clinton, appeared to prevail in the first US presidential debate on Monday.</p> <p>The fortunes of the peso in recent months have been closely tied with the likelihood that the Republican candidate, Donald Trump, will triumph in the upcoming presidential election. That is hardly surprising, given that Mr. Trump has taken a particularly bellicose stance towards Mexico. And he has repeatedly talked about pursuing more protectionist trade policies, which would be bad news for Mexico\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s open and US-dependent economy.</p> <p>In the first instance, a victory for Mr. Trump on 8th November would probably cause the peso \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and indeed most emerging market (EM) currencies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to weaken against the US dollar. And uncertainty regarding future trade policy, including a possible re-negotiation of the NAFTA trade accord, could weigh on the Mexican currency and ensure that it remains volatile.</p> <p>But we do not believe that the worse fears of protectionism will be borne out...And once the dust settles on the US election and a probable Fed rate hike in December, we would not be surprised to see the peso stage something of a comeback in the next couple of years, as prior structural reforms help economic growth to finally build momentum. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ea8c6be4b04cbd30bc3a55\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T15:12:59.937Z\">4.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And maybe there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t an oil deal after all:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/HermsTheWord/status/780783664393314304\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Iran&#39;s Zanganeh emerges from meeting with Russia&#39;s Novak.

Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The price of oil dropped on Tuesday, leaving the price of Brent crude within the $46-$48 range it has been in for the last week in the lead-up to the meeting in Algiers. The drop came as Iranian oil minister Zanganeh indicated that Iran was not willing to freeze oil output at current levels. More interestingly Zanganeh said Iran is targeting its pre-sanctions oil market share of 12-13%.</p> <p>The assumption had been that Iran was targeting 4m barrel per day, but 12-13% of a higher OPEC total output since Iran was sanctioned implies a higher figure.

Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The service sector sent mixed signals in September, with faster growth of activity during the month offset by gloomy forward-looking indicators. Although business activity showed the largest monthly rise since April, inflows of new business slowed and employment growth was the weakest for three-and-a-half years. A drop in optimism about the year ahead to a near post-crisis low meanwhile cast a shadow over the outlook.</p> <p>What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, even with the latest uptick in activity, the overall rate of economic growth remains subdued. Add these service sector results to the manufacturing data and the PMI surveys suggest that the economy is growing at an annualised rate of only around 1% again in the third quarter.</p> <p>The slowdown in hiring means the survey results are consistent with a 120,000 rise in non-farm payrolls in September, which is a solid rate of expansion but somewhat disappointing compared to the gains seen earlier in the year.</p> <p>The slowdown in hiring is perhaps a natural symptom of the economy reaching full employment, but companies also reported a reduced appetite to hire and job losses due to weaker inflows of new business and worries about the outlook.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"531855a6a86e79d451b3227c4afa6c1efb9c2062\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/531855a6a86e79d451b3227c4afa6c1efb9c2062/0_0_736_558/500.jpg\" alt=\"US service sector\" width=\"500\" height=\"379\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US service sector</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: IHS Markit</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T14:03:57.641Z\">at 3.03pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57ea79f8e4b091b7fa2b5a06\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T13:58:06.056Z\">2.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Back with the US, and more better than expected economic data.</strong></p> <p>Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s initial purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index for the service sector in September came in at 51.9, higher than the forecast 51.1 and August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final reading of 51.</p> <p>The composite index was up from 51.5 last month to 52.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Danske_Research/status/780767223510134784\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">According to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarkitEconomics\">@MarkitEconomics</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/US?src=hash\">#US</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GDP?src=hash\">#GDP</a> only grew around 1% q/q AR in Q3 supporting our view that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fed?src=hash\">#Fed</a> will not hike this year <a href=\"https://t.co/zCRXavmbDT\">pic.twitter.com/zCRXavmbDT</a></p>&mdash; Danske Bank Research (@Danske_Research) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Danske_Research/status/780767223510134784\">September 27, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ea77e1e4b091b7fa2b59fc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T13:53:53.529Z\">2.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The outlook for Deutsche Bank continues to be uncertain, analysts reckon. Carlo Mareels, a credit analyst at MUFG Securities, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see any immediate catalysts that could change the uncertain outlook on Deutsche Bank and the weakness in Deutsche Bank spreads is hard to reverse in the absence of proper constructive news on the capital story. Profitability will remain challenging but capital is certainly the most pressing factor right now.</p> <p>We believe that the sub and senior will be subject to volatility but that they are essentially money good. On the AT1s [CoCo bonds] our central scenario is that they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t switch off coupons, but it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be ruled out. We still see risk as significant and that needs to be priced in. However, if the Department of Justice\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine is in the area of $6bn or higher, our view is that a capital raise will become necessary (which would most likely be very beneficial to the AT1s). </p> </blockquote> <p>ABN Amro analysts believe significant restructuring is required:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Equity investors are fearful they will have to be called upon to support the capital position of the ailing Deutsche Bank (DB), as equity prices are down 64% since October 2015....</p> <p> Crucially, despite restructuring, continual low and even negative net income quarters are draining the ability DB has to naturally increase its capital position. Their capital position needs to be improved, and the ability of it to achieve this naturally is being severely questioned. Significant restructuring, including major asset sales, will likely be needed if DB wishes to achieve an increased capital position without calling on shareholders.</p> <p> The delayed sale of DB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stake in Hua Xia will be vital to help facilitate a suitable capital position for this year end. However, this is not a silver bullet and would only add a temporary \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.6bn uplift to [its Tier 1 capital ratio]. So more is needed...</p> <p>The payment request from the DoJ is just the tip of the iceberg of issues surrounding DB, as a number of other litigation suits remain open. The potential fines dwarf the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5.5bn DB have set aside for litigation. </p> <p>AT1 coupons are potentially at risk dependent on the timing/amount of the recent DoJ fine. Anything over \u00e2\u201a\u00ac6bn will cause real problems for the payments. At present, we believe, the bank could weather short term capital issues for AT1 write-downs not to be an issue...

                "bodyText":"Worries about Deutsche Bank vied with an attempted rally after Hillary Clinton was deemed by many pundits to have won the first presidential debate, leaving European markets in an uncertain mood. For most of the day the concerns about the banking sector won out, but a revival in Deutache Bank itself - which ended the day unchanged - helped produce a mini-recovery. US markets did better, helped by a strong set of consumer confidence figures. And then there was the oil price, which fell sharply as the chances of a deal to curb output at this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s producers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 meeting seemed to recede. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: European markets have confounded the initial enthusiasm generated off the back of the US presidential debate...This pessimistic continuation of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp losses says a lot about the expectations ahead of the oil-producers meeting conclusion. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses also say a lot about the wary nature of markets as we head into the business end of this election race, for we have seen before Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to defy any bumps along the way. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 10.37 points or 0.15% at 6807.67 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 0.31% to 10,361.48 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.21% at 4398.68 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.36% to 16,134.71 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.27% to 8688.2 In Athens the Greek market lost 0.21% to 562.40 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 132 points or 0.7%. Meanwhile in the oil market, Brent crude is down 3.2% at $45.79 while West Texas Intermediate has lost 3.4% to $44.36. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, recently said there were too many banks in Europe, and now he has backing from a member of the Bundesbank: As we reported earlier, the Mexican currency bounced back from record lows in the immediate aftermath of the US presidential debate, with Hillary Clinton deemed by many to have won the day. And it could recover further, reckon Capital Economics. The consultancy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s David Rees writes: The Mexican peso appreciated by more than 2% against the US dollar shortly after the Democrat candidate, Hillary Clinton, appeared to prevail in the first US presidential debate on Monday. The fortunes of the peso in recent months have been closely tied with the likelihood that the Republican candidate, Donald Trump, will triumph in the upcoming presidential election. That is hardly surprising, given that Mr. Trump has taken a particularly bellicose stance towards Mexico. And he has repeatedly talked about pursuing more protectionist trade policies, which would be bad news for Mexico\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s open and US-dependent economy. In the first instance, a victory for Mr. Trump on 8th November would probably cause the peso \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and indeed most emerging market (EM) currencies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to weaken against the US dollar. And uncertainty regarding future trade policy, including a possible re-negotiation of the NAFTA trade accord, could weigh on the Mexican currency and ensure that it remains volatile. But we do not believe that the worse fears of protectionism will be borne out...And once the dust settles on the US election and a probable Fed rate hike in December, we would not be surprised to see the peso stage something of a comeback in the next couple of years, as prior structural reforms help economic growth to finally build momentum. And maybe there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t an oil deal after all: The oil price continues to slide as the prospect of any deal to curb output at this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s producers meeting in Algeria recedes. Despite the reported proposal to cut production by 1m barrels a day - to be discussed on Wednesday - it seems unlikely Iran will agree, keen as it is to return output to the levels it enjoyed before the economic sanctions on the country. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: The price of oil dropped on Tuesday, leaving the price of Brent crude within the $46-$48 range it has been in for the last week in the lead-up to the meeting in Algiers. The drop came as Iranian oil minister Zanganeh indicated that Iran was not willing to freeze oil output at current levels. More interestingly Zanganeh said Iran is targeting its pre-sanctions oil market share of 12-13%. The assumption had been that Iran was targeting 4m barrel per day, but 12-13% of a higher OPEC total output since Iran was sanctioned implies a higher figure. Iran could be targeting something closer to 4.5-5m barrels per day in output, making a freeze agreement unlikely this year. Brent crude is down 2.8% at $46.02 while West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, has lost 2.94% to $44.58. Returning to the positive US consumer confidence figures, which seem to give more ammunition to the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: Fed Chair Janet Yellen will be delighted to see an above-expectations rise in consumer confidence for September, which follows on from an already strong August. Yellen was singled out for criticism by Donald Trump during last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential debate, with the presidential hopeful accusing Yellen of keeping interest rates low for political reasons. The question now is whether Yellen pulls the trigger on a rate hike at the next Fed meeting \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which happens to take place just days before the polls open and America votes for its next president. Back with oil, and the producers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 meeting in Algeria. The Wall Street Journal is reporting a deal would be put on the table involving an output cut of 1m barrels a day, but it is unlikely to be agreed tomorrow: The positive US data seems to have help inspire Wall Street, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now up 67 points or 0.37%. American consumers are not being put off by worries about the global economy, oil prices, Brexit or the forthcoming election, to judge from the latest Conference Board figures. The consumer confidence index came in at 104.1, higher than the 99 reading analysts had expected and better than August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 101.8. This is the best level since August 2007. Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at The Conference Board, said: Consumer confidence increased in September for a second consecutive month and is now at its highest level since the recession. Consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 assessment of present-day conditions improved, primarily the result of a more positive view of the labor market. Looking ahead, consumers are more upbeat about the short-term employment outlook, but somewhat neutral about business conditions and income prospects. Overall, consumers continue to rate current conditions favorably and foresee moderate economic expansion in the months ahead. The Markit survey may have shown an improvement in September but the outlook is not all rosy. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: The service sector sent mixed signals in September, with faster growth of activity during the month offset by gloomy forward-looking indicators. Although business activity showed the largest monthly rise since April, inflows of new business slowed and employment growth was the weakest for three-and-a-half years. A drop in optimism about the year ahead to a near post-crisis low meanwhile cast a shadow over the outlook. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, even with the latest uptick in activity, the overall rate of economic growth remains subdued. Add these service sector results to the manufacturing data and the PMI surveys suggest that the economy is growing at an annualised rate of only around 1% again in the third quarter. The slowdown in hiring means the survey results are consistent with a 120,000 rise in non-farm payrolls in September, which is a solid rate of expansion but somewhat disappointing compared to the gains seen earlier in the year. The slowdown in hiring is perhaps a natural symptom of the economy reaching full employment, but companies also reported a reduced appetite to hire and job losses due to weaker inflows of new business and worries about the outlook. Back with the US, and more better than expected economic data. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s initial purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index for the service sector in September came in at 51.9, higher than the forecast 51.1 and August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final reading of 51. The composite index was up from 51.5 last month to 52. The outlook for Deutsche Bank continues to be uncertain, analysts reckon. Carlo Mareels, a credit analyst at MUFG Securities, said: We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see any immediate catalysts that could change the uncertain outlook on Deutsche Bank and the weakness in Deutsche Bank spreads is hard to reverse in the absence of proper constructive news on the capital story. Profitability will remain challenging but capital is certainly the most pressing factor right now. We believe that the sub and senior will be subject to volatility but that they are essentially money good. On the AT1s [CoCo bonds] our central scenario is that they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t switch off coupons, but it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be ruled out. We still see risk as significant and that needs to be priced in. However, if the Department of Justice\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine is in the area of $6bn or higher, our view is that a capital raise will become necessary (which would most likely be very beneficial to the AT1s). ABN Amro analysts believe significant restructuring is required: Equity investors are fearful they will have to be called upon to support the capital position of the ailing Deutsche Bank (DB), as equity prices are down 64% since October 2015.... Crucially, despite restructuring, continual low and even negative net income quarters are draining the ability DB has to naturally increase its capital position. Their capital position needs to be improved, and the ability of it to achieve this naturally is being severely questioned. Significant restructuring, including major asset sales, will likely be needed if DB wishes to achieve an increased capital position without calling on shareholders. The delayed sale of DB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stake in Hua Xia will be vital to help facilitate a suitable capital position for this year end. However, this is not a silver bullet and would only add a temporary \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.6bn uplift to [its Tier 1 capital ratio]. So more is needed... The payment request from the DoJ is just the tip of the iceberg of issues surrounding DB, as a number of other litigation suits remain open. The potential fines dwarf the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5.5bn DB have set aside for litigation. AT1 coupons are potentially at risk dependent on the timing/amount of the recent DoJ fine. Anything over \u00e2\u201a\u00ac6bn will cause real problems for the payments. At present, we believe, the bank could weather short term capital issues for AT1 write-downs not to be an issue... In February DB were adamant in protecting their AT1 investors, but it is something that may not be so happy with going forward as already embattled equity holders would get stung for providing this benefit. The going concern for the company should be maintained provided the payment of the litigation charges is not demanded in the short term. We see a demand for the fines to be paid urgently as an unlikely scenario. It is both in the interest, of the bank to continue to function, and of the authorities to receive payment. More on Deutsche Bank and the repercussions if there was to be state aid from Germany, with some saying the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister Wolfgang Scha\u00c3\u00bcble will be the key player: Meanwhile Thomas Oppermann of the Social Democratic Party has weighed in: As has Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem: The Clinton rally in US markets has fizzled out before it even began. Banks - in the wake of Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price fall - and Brexit continue to weigh on investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 minds, while a fall in the oil price is also undermining confidence. With fading expectations of a deal to support the price at this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting of oil producers, Brent crude is down 2.66% at $46.09. In early trading the Dow Jones Industrial Average has edged up just 5 points while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq have opened slightly lower. US house prices have continued to rise sharply, perhaps dangerously so, according to the latest Case-Shiller index. Prices rose by 5% year-on-year in July, slightly lower than June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 5.1%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than twice as fast as consumer price inflation. And David Blitzer of S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, which produces the report, reckons it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t last. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Given that the overall inflation is a bit below 2%, the pace is probably not sustainable over the long term.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wall Street is expecting the next few weeks to be pretty fraught, in the run-up to the election on November 8th. Art Hogan, chief market strategistat Wunderlich Equity Capital Markets, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Volatility is going to be the norm, not the exception over the next several weeks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd At one stage, we expected the US stock market to jump by around 0.7% at the open. But now we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re heading towards a flat start. Reuters has now published the full quotes from Angela Merkel about the Deutsche Bank crisis: German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed hope on Tuesday that problems at Deutsche Bank could be solved after the lender made clear it needed no state aid with a $14 billion U.S. demand to settle claims it missold mortgage-backed securities. Asked during a news conference if Berlin was concerned about Deutsche Bank and was considering assistance for the lender, Merkel said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I only want to say that Deutsche Bank is a part of the German banking and financial sector. And of course we hope that all companies, also if they face temporary problems, can develop in the right direction.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to comment beyond that,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she added. Deutsche Bank said on Monday it had no need for German government help. Wall Street is expected to open a little higher in an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time, after New York has digested last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debate. Court news.... A rogue trader who scammed investors out of millions of pounds to fuel a hedonistic lifestyle of nightclubs and champagne has been sentenced to an extra 603 days imprisonment. Alex Hope, who was jailed for 7 years in 2015, incurred the extra penalty for failing to obey a confiscation order made against him. He had been ordered to repay \u00c2\u00a3166,696, but has actually only handed over \u00c2\u00a31,00 so far. FCA director Mark Stewart says: As a result of the work of the FCA, almost \u00c2\u00a32.65 million was identified and frozen in accounts controlled by Mr Hope, which was returned to investors earlier this year. Mr Hope spent a significant proportion of the remainder of the funds on a lavish lifestyle, including gifts to family and friends. Under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, the value of tainted gifts can be recovered and Mr Hope was ordered to pay a sum equal to the value of the gifts he made to friends and family. Hope\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outstanding penalty is accruing \u00c2\u00a336 interest per day, and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll still owe the full amount once released. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hope back in January 2015 - he originally hit the headlines for running up a huge bar bill. German chancellor Angela Merkel has told reporters in Berlin that she hopes the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctemporary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 problems at Deutsche Bank can be solved. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s holding a press conference with Malaysia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PM, Najib Razak. But she doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to have said much about the possible need for state aid to recapitalise the bank (something Deutsche insists isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t needed). Never work with animals, children, or the Scottish weather. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the lesson from Grangemouth this morning, where energy company Ineos is celebrating the first arrival of its first shipment of US shale gas. My colleague Rob Davies has raced to see the big moment, but reports that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too blustery for the boat to dock! Rob\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still doing his best to keep us entertained, though: The World Trade Organisation has added to the gloom this morning, by slashing its forecast for trade growth this year to just 1.7%, down from 2.8%. That would be the first time since 2001 that trade has grown slower than the world economy. Royal Bank of Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are getting a hoofing, down 4% today. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being hit by the worries over Deutsche Bank; RBS is also facing the prospect of a large penalty from the DoJ, for mis-selling toxic mortgage securities. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx says: The German bank is now down another 3%, and is threatening to drop under \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10 for the first time in around 30 years. This has sparked another round of losses in the European banking sector, with Barclays, HSBC and Societe Generale all seeing notable declines. Royal Bank of Scotland actually surpassed Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s morning drop, percentage-wise at least, with investors fearful that the same kind of fine could hit RBS when its settlement with the US Department of Justice is finally revealed. That rally in the Mexican peso is fizzling out too, as the Clinton debate bounce comes to a halt: The sudden swings in the markets this morning show that volatility is back with a bang. With the US presidential election still up for grabs, and Deutsche Bank still troubled, this could be a wild autumn. FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga is concerned that this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcClinton bounce\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t last: Stock markets received a slight welcome boost on Tuesday with most major arena\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s swinging back into gains as talks of Hillary Clinton winning the first US presidential debate renewed risk appetite. Although Asian equities managed to charge into green territory post-debate, gains were swiftly relinquished in Europe amid the heavy losses in banks and carmakers. Wall Street could be exposed to steeper losses if the bearish domino effect from Europe provides a solid foundation for sellers to attack. It is becoming increasingly clear that the short term gains observed in stocks are becoming unsustainable with the ingredients of bear market potentially leaving stock markets exposed to heavy losses in the future. If this selloff continues, Deutsche Bank shares will fall below the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10 mark for the first time in three decades: The Financial Times is reporting that one of Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s smaller banks has cancelled a bond sale, in a sign of edginess in the markets. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: A regional German bank has pulled a bond sale citing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153market conditions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as Deutsche Bank shares have tumbled to fresh multi-decade lows. NordLB was due to sell a seven-year senior unsecured bond, but informed investors they would not proceed on Tuesday morning, report Thomas Hale in London and James Shotter in Frankfurt. The senior unsecured bond was initially expected to price around mid-swaps plus 90 basis points. The pulled Landesbank bond comes after Lufthansa also cancelled a debt sale on Monday, also pointing to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pricing achievable in the current market\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Oh dear, this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market rally is fizzling out -- before some Europeans have fully caught up with the drama in America. Deutsche Bank is to blame -- its shares have slipped to fresh record lows in the last few minutes. Currently down 2.65% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10.29, a level not seen since the 1980s. This has send Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market down 1% into the red, and erased the early gains in London too. Worries about Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial strength are, well, trumping any relief following last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debate. Other European banks are also falling, with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Commerzbank down 2.9%. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains: Declines in prominent German and Swiss banks have revived fears of a European banking crisis. Stocks had opened moderately higher in a small nod to establishment candidate Hilary Clinton winning the US presidential debate. As explained earlier, investors are worried that Angela Merkel might not step in to protect Deutsche from the possibility of a $14bn fine from US authorities. Deutsche\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market value is now just $16bn, meaning it could struggle to raise enough capital to pay off the fine. Writing in the Telegraph today, Matthew Lynn argues that the situation is terribly serious: If the German government does not stand behind the bank, then inevitably all its counter-parties \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the other banks and institutions it deals with \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are going to start feeling very nervous about trading with it. As we know from 2008, once confidence starts to evaporate, a bank is in big, big trouble. In fact, if Deutsche does go down, it is looking increasingly likely that it will take Merkel with it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and quite possibly the euro as well. More here: The Deutsche Bank crisis could take Angela Merkel down \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the Euro The surge in the Mexican peso shows that investors are pleased with Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance, says Ana Thaker, market economist at PhillipCapital UK. She says: A vote for Clinton is considered a vote for the status quo and markets will welcome sustained accommodating monetary policy under her administration. City investors have been backing Hillary Clinton to win November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election, according to IG: Gambling firm Betway have also cut the odds of a Clinton victory, to just 2/5: Betway\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alan Alger, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Donald Trump was forced to backtrack and defend himself against Hillary Clinton for much of last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debate. The betting now firmly suggests the Democrat candidate has stretched her lead in the race to the White House. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Clinton may have appeared weak during her bout of ill health earlier this month, but punters think she looked strong last night and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve cut here odds from 4/6 to 2/5. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Those that think the Donald can talk his way back into the election battle can take 15/8 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the longest his odds have been in over a fortnight.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However... we have been here before, in June, when the betting markets suggested Britain would remain in the EU. Back to last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debate... and Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit argues that Donald Trump didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do too badly: But The Economist itself reckons the Republican gaffed over his tax bill: FT editor Lionel Barber also calls it for Clinton: And polling expert Nate Silver shows how Trump kept shoving his oar in: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bad morning for British workers at building supplies firm Wolseley. It has announced plans to close 80 UK stores, with the loss of 800 jobs, as part of a major restructuring. It hopes to redeploy some workers, but the axe could fall heavily at its distribution centre in Worcester. Wolseley shares have slumped by 3.8% this morning, after it also missed profit expectations. In other news....Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are becalmed this morning, up just 0.1% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10.31, after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 7.5% tumble. Investors were rattled on Monday, following reports that German chancellor Angela Merkel was refusing to provide state aid to the lender. Deutsche Bank insists that it hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even asked for help, but with a $14bn fine looming \u00e2\u20ac\u201c close to Deutsche\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market value \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the situation is tough. City veteran David Buik says the uncertainty over Deutsche is worrying: I feel sorry for CEO John Cryan who inherited a hospital pass, when he stepped up to the plate in June 2016. These shares have lost significant value \u00e2\u20ac\u201c down from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac39 in January 2014 and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac23.51 a year ago to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10.64 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c down 71% and 54% respectively. Just to put some meat on the bone in July 2007 Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price was \u00e2\u201a\u00ac99.60! What markets cannot cope with is uncertainty and that sensation is there in spades, with John Cryan, probably very frustrated in being able to say very little. You can catch up with all the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coverage of the debate here: US Election 2016 Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our expert panel verdict: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s David Smith\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s account of how Clinton scored points against her rival: Hillary Clinton called Donald Trump to order on Monday night in probably the most watched \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and certainly the weirdest and wildest \u00e2\u20ac\u201c presidential debate in American history. She demanded explanations over his tax returns, his treatment of workers, his temperament as the man with his finger on the nuclear trigger. As he ducked and dived with incoherent excuses, she stared at him with thinly veiled contempt. Then, right at the end, like a long-suffering, frosty school principal, she decided to expel the ranting, sniffling, whining 70-year-old schoolboy who had not done his homework. Trump had said she did not have the stamina to be president. Icy and deadly, Clinton replied: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a ceasefire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Canadian dollar has also strengthened, in another sign that Clinton performed better last night (in the markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 view, anyway). Arnaud Masset, analyst at Swissquote Bank, explains: The foreign exchange market reacted sharply to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first US presidential debate. Emerging market currencies were broadly better bid, especially the Mexican peso but it was the Canadian dollar, which appreciated the most as experts concurred that Hillary Clinton had won this first round. The Canadian dollar was also in demand after the debate with USD/CAD falling back below the 1.32 threshold, down to 1.3166. Here are some video clips of last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debate, for those European readers who weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t awake in the middle of the night FXTM Chief Market Strategist Hussein Sayed says the markets have awarded last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debate to the Democratic candidate, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all over.... Round one of the U.S. presidential debate is over and as expected big punches were exchanged from both sides, but clearly no knockout blows were landed. Although polls were showing different outcomes of who won the debate, financial markets obviously declared Clinton as the winner. Asian shares recovered some of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses and European stocks opened higher, meanwhile U.S. futures are also indicating a positive open. However, the best financial asset proxy to the U.S. presidential race is the Mexican Peso which rose by more than 1.5% against the U.S. dollar after declining to a new record low yesterday. The higher the Mexican currency goes suggests higher probability for Clinton reaching the White House as Trump repeatedly raged against globalisation and free trade agreements. The Aussie, Kiwi and Yen also supported the opinion that Hillary Clinton won the first presidential debate. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale agrees: A snap poll by CNN/ORC has found that Hillary Clinton won last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debate, pretty conclusively. They report that: Hillary Clinton was deemed the winner of Monday night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debate by 62% of voters who tuned in to watch, while just 27% said they thought Donald Trump had the better night, according to a CNN/ORC Poll of voters who watched the debate. That drubbing is similar to Mitt Romney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dominant performance over President Barack Obama in the first 2012 presidential debate. Voters who watched said Clinton expressed her views more clearly than Trump and had a better understanding of the issues by a margin of more than 2-to-1. Clinton also was seen as having done a better job addressing concerns voters might have about her potential presidency by a 57% to 35% margin, and as the stronger leader by a 56% to 39% margin. If you want a clear sign of which candidate won last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debate, in investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 eyes, then look at the Mexican currency. The Mexican peso has surged overnight, gaining 1.5% against the US dollar. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a decent recovery from the record low it plumbed yesterday. That means $1 is worth 19.575 peso, down from 19.9 peso before the debate began. The peso has become the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preferred measure of tracking the chances of a Trump victory, given his attacks on free trade and his pledge to build a wall on the US-Mexico border. Asian stock markets also rose overnight, as Trump and Clinton swapped blows over everything from the Trans-Pacific Partnership to the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBirther row\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 over Barack Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s origins. Tokyo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei jumped 1%, the Hong Kong Hang Seng gained 1.3%, and China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main markets closed 0.6% higher. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s feeding through to Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s markets this morning, as this graphic shows: Shares are rallying across Europe this morning, as investors digest the first US presidential debate (which took place while most of them were asleep). In London, the FTSE 100 index has gained 26 points or 0.4% in early trading. European markets are showing bigger gains, with the Paris market up by 0.7%. Traders appear to be taking the view that Hillary Clinton came out best yesterday, after a 90 minute battle in which Donald Trump lost his cool more than once. Although Clinton didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deliver a knock-out blow, the Democratic candidate did seem more sure-footed on the key issues. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx points out that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve not recovered all of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses yet: With Clinton seemingly stumping Trump in the first presidential debate a semblance of calm has returned to the markets. Yesterday saw a series of market-wide declines prompted, among other things, by the reminder that come November Donald Trump could be the new President of the United States of America. This morning, however, the European indices have taken anywhere between 0.6% and 0.8% back, arguably thanks to Hilary Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better received performance at last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debate. Whether or not that translates to a boost in the polls, especially given the contrarian, disenfranchised mind-set of many of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supporters, is unclear (perhaps explaining why the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good mood isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as good as its bad mood was bad on Monday). For now, however, the European indices are rebounding and, considering Brent Crude is flat and Deutsche Bank is still effectively at all-time lows, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard not to pin the turnaround on the results of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential nominee showdown. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors have a lot to think about today, both in the financial markets and the world of politics. Firstly, the US presidential race has gathered steam overnight after a bruising clash between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. The two candidates to take control of the White House traded blows over economic policy, trade, and climate change. Personal issues, including Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coyness to release his tax returns and Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deleted emails, added extra spice to the battle. Listening under the duvet in Britain, the Democratic candidate appeared to outshine her rival. But here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what my US colleagues thought: Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s freewheeling approach spun wildly out of control in the first presidential debate as he was forced on the defensive during a chaotic clash with Hillary Clinton. Goaded by Clinton and pressed hard by moderator Lester Holt, the Republican nominee angrily defended his record against charges of racism, sexism and tax avoidance for much of the 90-minute clash at Hofstra University, outside New York. Trump hit Clinton on trade and her political record \u00e2\u20ac\u201c issues that have helped him draw level in recent polls and may yet dominate the election \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but the property tycoon appeared thin-skinned and under-prepared as he sniffled his way through the debate. Clinton shows strength over Trump in one of history\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weirdest, wildest debatesRead more \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all words, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all soundbites,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he retorted after a particularly one-sided exchange, adding that Clinton was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153typical politician: all talk, no action\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. More here: And here: Closer to home, traders are watching Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest bank with growing concern. Yesterday, Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares hit their lowest level in a generation as it fought to persuade investors that it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to be bailed out by the Berlin government. But Deutsche Bank still faces the threat of a $14bn fine for mis-selling US mortgage securities, so concerns over its future aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going away. And then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the oil price; energy ministers are expected to hold an informal Opec meeting on Wednesday to discuss a potential deal to cap production. Brent crude rallied late last night, on hopes Also coming up today Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business leaders are gathering for the Institute of Directors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 annual convention. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expecting to hear a lot about Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the European Union, after fears of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sent the pound down to a five-week low yesterday. At 11am BST, the CBI publishes its retail sales figures for September. That will show if consumers kept spending despite Brexit uncertainty. The latest US house prices figures are due at 2pm BST (9am in New York), followed an hour latest by the consumer confidence stats. And in the City, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting results from holiday group Thomas Cook and building supplies firm Wolseley.",

Deutsche Bank is trading at a record low level. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s real worry about whether it has enough capital. Have you spoken to Chancellor Merkel about Deutsche Bank and the needs of the German banking sector?</p> <p><strong>Lagarde</strong>: Well, we completed back in June, actually, a financial sector assessment of the German banking system. And it is a system that is critically important with some systemic players. Deutsche Bank is certainly one of them. So I think we all have a stake in making sure that this situation is addressed, that the right measures are taken, that we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fall into over dramatisation either. But I trust that these measures will be taken.</p> <p><strong>Eisen</strong>: Do you trust that the German government would step in if capital is necessary?</p> <p><strong>Lagarde</strong>: You know, this is something that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to debate amongst themselves. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see...</p> <p><strong>Eisen</strong>: Would you recommend it?</p> <p><strong>Lagarde</strong>: I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see that particular institution as - at a stage where state intervention is absolutely called for at the moment. And I would hope that the right measure are taken internally so that the whole financial sector in Germany is solid and that systemic players [are] strengthened. It has recovered a bit today, by the way.</p> <p><strong>Eisen</strong>: Yes, it has. But do you see it as a global systemic risk?</p> <p><strong>Lagarde</strong>: Deutsche Bank is a systemic player.

While some banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 business models may indeed need to adapt to the current low interest rate environment, they also need to address their own structural issues, such as overcapacity, the stock of non-performing loans and the potential impact of technological innovation.

But, on balance, savers, employees, entrepreneurs, pensioners and taxpayers across the euro area, including in Germany, are better off because of our actions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c today and tomorrow.</p> <p>Finally, I will talk about <em>what else</em> is needed. The ECB does not operate in a vacuum: other economic policies are essential to complement our monetary policy. Without them there will be no strong and sustainable recovery. These other policies are a precondition for interest rates to rise again.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T13:34:32.998Z\">at 2.34pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57ebc468e4b01b56deffc3e9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T13:29:27.765Z\">2.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>History may be on Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s side, at least where negotiations with the US authorities are concerned.</strong></p> <p><strong>Reuters columnist Dominic Elliott </strong>has totted up the fines paid by other big banks for mis-selling toxic loans in the run-up to the 2008 crisis, and argues that a $14bn penalty for Deutsche is unfair.</p> <p>Instead, something in the $5bn (or lower) ballpark might be appropriate.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.breakingviews.com/considered-view/past-mortgage-fines-give-deutsche-room-for-hope/\">He writes</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Deutsche Bank can take some heart from previous U.S. mortgage fines. Shares in Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest bank by assets have dropped almost a fifth since it confirmed that the United States Department of Justice wants it to pay $14 billion to settle charges of mis-selling mortgage-backed securities. Final bills paid by other banks suggest Deutsche will hand over a fraction of that amount.</p> <p>Calculating penalties is an inexact science. But one way to assess how much Deutsche might pay is to look at the fine as a proportion of the mortgage-backed securities it issued. Bank of America, for example, settled on a sum worth just over 2 percent of the instruments it underwrote, says KBW. Citigroup was the hardest hit so far, with fines totaling 11 percent of its issuance, according to Goldman Sachs analysts.</p> <p>Apply that range to the estimated $67 billion of securities that Deutsche underwrote \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and deduct the $1.9 billion it has already forked out to the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the remaining fine could be anything from $200 million to $5.5 billion. That might not be all hard cash, either. Settlement bills can include so-called consumer relief \u00e2\u20ac\u201c loan forgiveness or extra credit offered to borrowers over defined periods.</p> </blockquote> <h2>More here: <a href=\"http://www.breakingviews.com/considered-view/past-mortgage-fines-give-deutsche-room-for-hope/\">Another fine mess</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DominicElliott/status/781099707946917889\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I calculate range of &quot;fair&quot; U.S. Justice Department fine for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DeutscheBank\">@DeutscheBank</a> based on what other banks have paid as between $200m and $5.5bn <a href=\"https://t.co/TJ8F58HUc1\">https://t.co/TJ8F58HUc1</a></p>&mdash; Dominic Elliott (@DominicElliott) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DominicElliott/status/781099707946917889\">September 28, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ebc07be4b049b74e4caf0d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T13:22:54.257Z\">2.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2eff76dc43e736487554f4a44242260e19dd183b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2eff76dc43e736487554f4a44242260e19dd183b/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Deutsche Bank logo adorns a wall at the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headquarters in Frankfurt, Germany.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Although Deutsche Bank clearly has problems, some analysts argue that its troubles are being overstated.</strong></p> <p>Reaching an agreement with the Department of Justice to pay <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/16/deutsche-bank-14bn-dollar-fine-doj-q-and-a\">rather less than $14bn for misselling mortgage-backed securities</a> would remove one dark cloud, and free it up to raise fresh capital if needed.</p> <p><strong>Neil Wilson</strong>, analyst at <strong>ETX Capital,</strong> explains how Deutsche has some firepower left:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At the end of June, its core tier one capital ratio stood at 10.8% - well above the minimum required by regulators since the financial crisis, albeit below its main peers.</p> <p>Deutsche is pretty well capitalised and it could raise fresh capital \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this would hit the share price but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the end of the world. And it has plenty of assets it can sell quickly to raise the ratio if required.

These exposures are netted out and hedged so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not like Deutsche could lose the trillions of dollars as is sometimes hinted at. Nevertheless, these derivatives are hard to value, particularly post-Brexit, and therefore pose a risk, while there is a worry is that a lower credit rating will make it harder to deal in these derivatives, hitting earnings.</p> </blockquote> <p>But that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that Deutsche Bank isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in a fix:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Deutsche\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problem is not capitalisation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just that its costs have soared (mainly through litigation and fines) and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not that profitable any more. That is a much longer-term question about its future than whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in need of a bailout to boost some arbitrary capital requirement.

According to Die Zeit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s research, shared with The Guardian ahead of publication, the German government is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153debating a state takeover of as much as 25 per cent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the bank.</p> <p>One advantage of such a solution is that such an intervention would allow the German government to push Deutsche Bank towards a fusion with Commerzbank, of which around 15% are already state-owned.</p> <p>However, a state-sponsored bailout for Deutsche Bank would provide much embarrassment for a lender whose former boss Josef Ackerman said in 2008 that he would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ashamed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to take money from the state \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as well as a German government which has been insisting on limiting state aid for ailing banks in southern Europe.</p> <p>The bailout would also come with considerable economic risk. Under a new rule put into force across the EU at the start of the year, no bank can be bailed out with public money until creditors accounting for at least 8 per cent of the lender\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liabilities have contributed towards footing the bill. Deutsche Bank would thus potentially have to become a high-profile test case for this new \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bail-in\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd regime.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57eb9337e4b01b56deffc2b0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T10:15:59.209Z\">11.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Read the Die Zeit story on Deutsche Bank here</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Die Zeit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s story about a secret rescue plan for Deutsche Bank is now online, here:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.zeit.de/wirtschaft/2016-09/deutsche-bank-rettungsplan-finanzaufsichtsbehoerde?utm_campaign=Zeit.de-Wirtschaft&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter\">Bundesregierung bereitet Notfallplan f\u00c3\u00bcr Deutsche Bank vor</a></h2> <p>I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve skimmed through it, and....</p> <p><strong>It says that German Federal Government and the supervisory authorities are preparing an emergency plan for Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest lender, according to officials in Berlin, Brussels and Frankfurt.</strong></p> <p>It would be triggered if Deutsche Bank needed to raise additional capital to resolve its disputes with the US justice department, and can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t raise it from the markets.</p> <p>Under the plan, Deutsche could sell some assets to other banks -- possibly with some form of government guarantee attached.</p> <p>And there has also been talk of the government taking a 25% stake in Deutche.

Meanwhile in the oil market, Brent crude is 2.65% better at $47.19 on optimism that oil producers in Algeria will lay the foundations for a deal to curb production at November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Opec meeting. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Here are the quotes from Christine Lagarde\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments on Deutsche Bank in her CNBC interview with Sara Eisen. Eisen: There are renewed concerns about the health of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking sector. Deutsche Bank is trading at a record low level. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s real worry about whether it has enough capital. Have you spoken to Chancellor Merkel about Deutsche Bank and the needs of the German banking sector? Lagarde: Well, we completed back in June, actually, a financial sector assessment of the German banking system. And it is a system that is critically important with some systemic players. Deutsche Bank is certainly one of them. So I think we all have a stake in making sure that this situation is addressed, that the right measures are taken, that we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fall into over dramatisation either. But I trust that these measures will be taken. Eisen: Do you trust that the German government would step in if capital is necessary? Lagarde: You know, this is something that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to debate amongst themselves. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see... Eisen: Would you recommend it? Lagarde: I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see that particular institution as - at a stage where state intervention is absolutely called for at the moment. And I would hope that the right measure are taken internally so that the whole financial sector in Germany is solid and that systemic players [are] strengthened. It has recovered a bit today, by the way. Eisen: Yes, it has. But do you see it as a global systemic risk? Lagarde: Deutsche Bank is a systemic player. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s face it. Because it has a lot of relationship with many other banks around the world. And it is an international player as well. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important that it be consolidated and, you know, it has a solid base. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also be realistic. But it needs measures. Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, has said she does not believe Deutsche Bank needs state aid at the moment, in comments to CNBC: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a suggestion of a unexpected rescuer for Deutsche Bank: Bloomberg reports: Yigit Bulut, a chief adviser to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said the country must consider using a new wealth fund or a group of state-owned banks to buy the Frankfurt-based company. Bulut made the proposal on Tuesday via his Twitter account, saying Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest lender should be made into a Turkish bank. The stock of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest investment bank has slumped by more than 50 percent over the past year, falling to a record low on Tuesday, over concerns about its weakening financial position and penalties in the U.S. tied to mortgage-backed securities. Bulut\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments come after Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Investors Service on Sept. 23 cut Turkey to junk, citing slowing economic growth and deteriorating credit fundamentals. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For months on TV programs, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been calling on Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private and public capital: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSome very good companies in the EU are going to fall into trouble and we need to be ready to buy a controlling stake in them,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bulut wrote on Twitter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you be happy to make Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest bank into Turkish Bank!!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And back with Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen: Asked about whether the German government should rescue Deutsche Bank he said he does not comment on individual banks. But: More from ECB president Mario Draghi who is speaking after his appearance at the German parliament.He paints a rosy picture of his session before the MPs: (ZIRP is the zero interest rate policy instigated by central banks such as the ECB) And one German response: A bigger than expected rise in US weekly gasoline stocks has offset a surprise fall in crude stocks to take the shine off oil prices. Gasoline stocks rose by 2m barrels, compared to expectations of a 178,000 increase. Crude stocks however fell by 1.9m barrel rather than the 3m barrel rise forecast by analysts. Oil prices have been volatile in recent days as key producers meet in Algeria, with hopes that the outline of a deal on reducing output could be agreed for the next Opec meeting in November. After early gains on hopes of a deal, crude prices have come off their best levels on the US data. Brent crude is currently up just 0.2% at $46.06 a barrel having climbed as high at $47.19, while West Texas Intermediate is 0.13% lower at $44.61. Although the congressional session is mostly focused on regulation, Yellen did comment on interest rates. She said there was no fixed timetable for raising rates, but most Fed members believed it was appropriate to move if the economy remained on track. So December then? US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments on supervision and regulation of financial institutions, being delivered to a congressional committee, can be read here. She said the Fed had implemented standards designed to limit the financial stability risks posed by the largest banks, in the wake of the global financial crisis. But she said they must endure small and medium sized banks did not face undue regulatory burdens. And she adds: Looking forward, we must continue to monitor for the emergence of new risks, since another key lesson from the crisis is that financial stability threats change over time. She concludes: Our post-crisis approach to regulation and supervision is both forward-looking and tailored to the level of risk that firms pose to financial stability and the broader economy. Standards for the largest, most complex banking organisations are now significantly more stringent than standards for small and medium-sized banks, which is appropriate given the impact that the failure or distress of those firms could have on the economy...We anticipate taking additional actions in the near term to further tailor our regulatory and supervisory framework. Yet even as we finalize the major elements of post-crisis reform, our work is not complete. We must carefully monitor the impact of the regulatory changes we have made and remain vigilant regarding the potential emergence of new risks to financial stability. We must stand ready to adjust our regulatory approach where changes are warranted. The work we do to ensure the financial system remains strong and stable is designed to protect and support the real economy that sustains the businesses and jobs on which American households rely. US markets have moved ahead in early trading, with oil prices on the rise as producers meet in Algeria. Meanwhile investors are also awaiting a testimony from US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen before a congressional committee. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 38 points or 0.2%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.16% higher and the Nasdaq composite up 0.12%. And Draghi concluded by repeating his calls for policy makers to implement structural reforms: For long-term interest rates to rise in the future we therefore need more investment and structural reforms to lift growth and productivity. As Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble said in this house a couple of weeks ago [when he presented the budget for 2017]: we will only get out of this phase of low interest rates if we have more sustainable growth in Europe... At the height of the crisis, all Member States and citizens showed an enormous commitment to keeping the euro area together when the critics were already talking about the euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demise. But we cannot stop here: we need to make sure not only that the euro survives, but that our Economic and Monetary Union thrives. If we want to succeed, we will need to find common solutions for the problems that we all face... If we want savers to benefit from higher interest rates in the future, we will need to create investment opportunities to put these savings to a productive use. This is about raising productivity and employment. This is about structural reforms that are a necessary complement to our monetary policy. And Member States have to do their part. And with some blaming the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negative rate policy for - at least in part -Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes, Draghi said: We should also consider the full effect of low interest rates on banks. Those who blame ECB policy for the mixed performance of certain German financial firms have been very vocal. But what has been forgotten is that many banks have been able to more than offset declining interest revenues with higher lending volumes, improved loan performance and lower interest expenses, all of which are beneficial to both the banks and their customers. The ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy is not the main factor for the low profitability of banks. While some banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 business models may indeed need to adapt to the current low interest rate environment, they also need to address their own structural issues, such as overcapacity, the stock of non-performing loans and the potential impact of technological innovation. Low profitability is closely linked to low operational efficiency. In Germany cost to income ratios are on average relatively high compared to other jurisdictions. Let us be clear, however, there is no one size fits all banking model and we have different types of banks that are successfully operating in Germany and in the euro area. Draghi has previously commented that he thinks there are too many banks in Europe. Draghi: We should also not forget that people in your constituencies are affected in different ways by our measures. They are affected as savers, borrowers or taxpayers, and in many cases as all three. What a household may lose in terms of little interest on their bank account, it might save in lower mortgage payments for their home. And it might benefit from rising bond and stock prices in their retirement fund. In fact, evidence shows that between 2008 and 2015 interest payments by households in Germany, as a percentage of gross disposable income, fell more sharply than interest earnings. And the low financing costs for government bonds help to balance the budget and reduce debt at a considerable speed. This is good news for the Finance Ministry - and thus for taxpayers - which saved in 2015 alone approximately EUR 28 billion on lower than expected interest payments. On savers, he says: Yes, the current low interest rate environment reduces the nominal return on saving accounts. But what counts for savers is not the nominal interest rate but the real interest rate, which is the nominal interest rate minus inflation. Real rates are also low, but there have been many episodes of low, or even negative real interest rates in Germany well before the introduction of the euro, as a recent Bundesbank study has shown. Moreover, savers can on average still earn satisfactory rates of return from diversifying their assets, even when interest rates on deposit and savings accounts are very low. This has also been the case in Germany according to another recent Bundesbank study. But most importantly, whatever financial assets savers hold, they will benefit from a recovery of the economy. So the interest of all of us, including German savers, is the highest possible sustainable growth in Germany and the euro area. Draghi continues: Our measures have delivered. We estimate that they will raise the inflation rate by more than half a percentage point, on average, over 2016 and 2017. They will also contribute to increasing real euro area GDP growth by more than one and a half percentage points cumulatively between 2015 and 2018, which will support job creation. ECB president Mario Draghi is defending the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions, including negative interest rates, to the German parliament, at a time when savers in particular are unhappy at the effect on their nest eggs. In his speech released by the ECB, he says: First, I want to explain why we are pursuing our policies. I want to show how our monetary policy has maintained price stability and countered the threat of a new \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Great Depression\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Our measures are working: they are contributing to keeping the recovery on track, thus creating jobs and ensuring a recovery that ultimately also benefit savers and pensioners in Germany and the euro area as a whole. But I do understand that people have concerns. We take these concerns seriously. I will therefore discuss in more detail \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and this is my second point \u00e2\u20ac\u201c how our measures affect people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finances and welfare. As with any monetary policy decision, our measures have distributional effects on citizens. But, on balance, savers, employees, entrepreneurs, pensioners and taxpayers across the euro area, including in Germany, are better off because of our actions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c today and tomorrow. Finally, I will talk about what else is needed. The ECB does not operate in a vacuum: other economic policies are essential to complement our monetary policy. Without them there will be no strong and sustainable recovery. These other policies are a precondition for interest rates to rise again. History may be on Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s side, at least where negotiations with the US authorities are concerned. Reuters columnist Dominic Elliott has totted up the fines paid by other big banks for mis-selling toxic loans in the run-up to the 2008 crisis, and argues that a $14bn penalty for Deutsche is unfair. Instead, something in the $5bn (or lower) ballpark might be appropriate. He writes: Deutsche Bank can take some heart from previous U.S. mortgage fines. Shares in Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest bank by assets have dropped almost a fifth since it confirmed that the United States Department of Justice wants it to pay $14 billion to settle charges of mis-selling mortgage-backed securities. Final bills paid by other banks suggest Deutsche will hand over a fraction of that amount. Calculating penalties is an inexact science. But one way to assess how much Deutsche might pay is to look at the fine as a proportion of the mortgage-backed securities it issued. Bank of America, for example, settled on a sum worth just over 2 percent of the instruments it underwrote, says KBW. Citigroup was the hardest hit so far, with fines totaling 11 percent of its issuance, according to Goldman Sachs analysts. Apply that range to the estimated $67 billion of securities that Deutsche underwrote \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and deduct the $1.9 billion it has already forked out to the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the remaining fine could be anything from $200 million to $5.5 billion. That might not be all hard cash, either. Settlement bills can include so-called consumer relief \u00e2\u20ac\u201c loan forgiveness or extra credit offered to borrowers over defined periods. More here: Another fine mess Although Deutsche Bank clearly has problems, some analysts argue that its troubles are being overstated. Reaching an agreement with the Department of Justice to pay rather less than $14bn for misselling mortgage-backed securities would remove one dark cloud, and free it up to raise fresh capital if needed. Neil Wilson, analyst at ETX Capital, explains how Deutsche has some firepower left: At the end of June, its core tier one capital ratio stood at 10.8% - well above the minimum required by regulators since the financial crisis, albeit below its main peers. Deutsche is pretty well capitalised and it could raise fresh capital \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this would hit the share price but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the end of the world. And it has plenty of assets it can sell quickly to raise the ratio if required. Selling the asset management arm might be required, although this would be negative for earnings growth going forward. He also argues that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not facing a repeat of the 2008 crisis (as UBS chairman Axel Weber said this morning). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a Lehmans moment in the offing. Banks are generally better capitalised and able to cope with adverse shocks. And Deutsche\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s derivatives exposure can be overstated. These exposures are netted out and hedged so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not like Deutsche could lose the trillions of dollars as is sometimes hinted at. Nevertheless, these derivatives are hard to value, particularly post-Brexit, and therefore pose a risk, while there is a worry is that a lower credit rating will make it harder to deal in these derivatives, hitting earnings. But that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that Deutsche Bank isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in a fix: Deutsche\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problem is not capitalisation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just that its costs have soared (mainly through litigation and fines) and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not that profitable any more. That is a much longer-term question about its future than whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in need of a bailout to boost some arbitrary capital requirement. Deutsche has to face down the short hedgies first and then look to raise capital. In that sense a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwhatever it takes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 kind of nod from Berlin may help.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd How things change... Back in London, tech giant Apple has just announced plans to build a new headquarters at Battersea Power Station. The new \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Apple Campus\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, on the south of the River Thames, will take up all six floors of office space at the former power plant, currently being redeveloped. Around 1,400 Apple staff from across London will move to the new site. Battersea Power Station is one of the biggest brick-built structures in the world, and a rare example of something that can be truly called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dciconic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. It stopped generating electricity in 1983, and stood derelict for decades before a Malaysian consortium bought it in 2012. A spokesperson for the German finance ministry has officially denied Die Zeit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report that the government was preparing an emergency rescue plan for Deutsche Bank. Martin J\u00c3\u00a4ger just told a government press conference in Berlin: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The German government is not preparing a rescue plan, and there is no reason for such speculations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd J\u00c3\u00a4ger also declined to comment on whether there had been any meetings to discuss the situation at Deutsche Bank. And asked if Deutsche Bank is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsystemically important\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, he replies that everyone knows the importance of the company. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been quite a dramatic morning. Tara Cunningham of the Daily Telegraph sums up the twists and turns so far.... Optimism that Deutsche Bank can ride out the crisis has pushed shares higher across Europe this morning. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX index is leading the way, up almost 1%. with Deutsche Bank (+1.8%) leading the charge. In London, the FTSE 100 index is up 52 points, or 0.8%, at 6860. John Cryan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s insistence that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not seeking help from Angela Merkel has calmed the markets, despite the threat of a huge fine from the DoJ. Joshua Mahony, Market Analyst at IG, says fears of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153banking meltdown\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are easing, for now. The bank is faced with a $14bn that is roughly the equivalent to the current \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15 billion market cap. With the government clearly unwilling to bail out the bank, it instead falls upon the firm to start negotiating down the bill and selling off assets, as we have already seen with today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sale of Abbey Life insurance group to Phoenix Life. However, there is an argument to be had that the decision from US Department of Justice to completely destabilise the European banking system as retribution for Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role in the disruption of the US financial system is far from helpful. The size of the bill seems excessive at best and without the ability to negotiate down the amount, we could see one of the biggest banks in mainland Europe split up. Just in: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance ministry is telling reporters that Die Zeit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s story about a rescue is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153false\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. They insist that a rescue plan is not being prepared, and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no reason to speculate about this. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our Berlin correspondent, Philip Oltermann, on Die Zeit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim of a rescue plan: The German government is working on an emergency rescue plan for Deutsche Bank in spite of the struggling bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boss claims that state aid is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153out of the question\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, according to information obtained by weekly Die Zeit. Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government is preparing a two-stage plan for the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153worst-case scenario\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd whereby the US justice department sticks to a threatened $14 billion legal settlement to close out mortgage-securities probes, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest lenders fails to raise enough capital to pay the fine, the newspaper claims in an article published tomorrow. The first stage would involve attempting to find a solution whereby Deutsche Bank sells parts of its business to a German or foreign company, while the state would issue guarantees for potential losses. The second stage, which would only apply if such a private solution was to fail, would involve a state-sponsored bailout. According to Die Zeit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s research, shared with The Guardian ahead of publication, the German government is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153debating a state takeover of as much as 25 per cent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the bank. One advantage of such a solution is that such an intervention would allow the German government to push Deutsche Bank towards a fusion with Commerzbank, of which around 15% are already state-owned. However, a state-sponsored bailout for Deutsche Bank would provide much embarrassment for a lender whose former boss Josef Ackerman said in 2008 that he would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ashamed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to take money from the state \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as well as a German government which has been insisting on limiting state aid for ailing banks in southern Europe. The bailout would also come with considerable economic risk. Under a new rule put into force across the EU at the start of the year, no bank can be bailed out with public money until creditors accounting for at least 8 per cent of the lender\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liabilities have contributed towards footing the bill. Deutsche Bank would thus potentially have to become a high-profile test case for this new \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bail-in\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd regime. Die Zeit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s story about a secret rescue plan for Deutsche Bank is now online, here: Bundesregierung bereitet Notfallplan f\u00c3\u00bcr Deutsche Bank vor I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve skimmed through it, and.... It says that German Federal Government and the supervisory authorities are preparing an emergency plan for Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest lender, according to officials in Berlin, Brussels and Frankfurt. It would be triggered if Deutsche Bank needed to raise additional capital to resolve its disputes with the US justice department, and can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t raise it from the markets. Under the plan, Deutsche could sell some assets to other banks -- possibly with some form of government guarantee attached. And there has also been talk of the government taking a 25% stake in Deutche. However, the government continues to hope that this won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be needed. Importantly, some government officials favour leaving Deutsche Bank to the EU resolution mechanism - under which creditors and customers are bailed-in. However, that could lead to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new unrest in the financial markets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Die Zeit adds. Some breaking news from the aviation industry quickly, as British Airways owner IAG announces a partnership with Qatar Airways that will see them co-operate on a route network covering 70 destinations. The two carriers said the tie-up would give passengers a wider choice of flights, a broader range of fares and more benefits for members of their frequent flyer programmes. The agreement involves code-sharing - where airlines sell each other\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seats on certain flights - on all non-stop flights between UK and Doha, allowing the firms to expand their roster of destinations. Willie Walsh, IAG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This agreement will benefit customers by giving them access to more destinations through Qatar Airways\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 extensive network. It will also allow us to provide easier journeys with better aligned schedules, more frequencies and improved flight transfers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The agreements comes into force on 30 October. Deutsche Bank shares are losing some of their early gains, as investors digest today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s twists and turns. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re currently up 1.85% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10.745, having hit their lowest level in 30 years on Tuesday. Reuters is reporting that Bafin, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial watchdog, is not working on a rescue plan for Deutsche. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the snap: Die Zeit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report of a contingency plan for Deutsche Bank has caused a frisson of excitement. Laura Noonan, the Financial Times\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 investment banking correspondent, tweets: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Holger Zschaepitz of Welt: Steve Hawkes of The Sun takes a broader view: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s analyst Gary Jenkins: NEWSFLASH: German newspaper Die Zeit is reporting that Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government is drawing up a contingency plan for Deutsche Bank. Bloomberg and Reuters have the details: This plan would be triggered if Deutsche Bank needed fresh capital, and couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t raise it in the markets. In the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcworst case scenario\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, this would see the German government take a 25% stake in the bank. However, the German government hopes that Deutsche won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need support. Minouche Shafik, deputy governor of the Bank of England, also argues that this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a Lehman moment.... The Wall Street Journal reckon that Angela Merkel has four options to help Deutsche Bank. They are.... 1) Drive that $14bn fine down. Put pressure on the lender to negotiate a smaller settlement with the Justice Department, while using back channels between Berlin and Washington to push for leniency 2) Bend the rules. Berlin could use a loophole in the bank-rescue legislation that allows a precautionary state recapitalization of a bank that has failed a stress test. The finance ministry could try to persuade the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supervisor to test Deutsche\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capital cushion, allowing the government to step in with a capital injection should the bank fail the test. 3) Push Deutsche Bank to raise funds. The government could seek to engineer private-sector backing for Deutsche Bank or encourage it to divest its trophy asset-management unit, DWS, potentially worth several billions of euros\u00e2\u20ac\u201da scenario bankers and Deutsche Bank staff have speculated about internally\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t involve tapping public coffers. 4) Merge Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second largest lender. Analysts said this in itself wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t magically improve the quality of the merged entity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s balance sheet. But because the government holds a 15.6% stake in Commerzbank, a legacy of a 2009 bailout, such a deal could be used as a backdoor to inject capital into Deutsche Bank without appearing to do so. Full details here: Deutsche Bank Puts Germany in a Bailout Bind Deutsche Bank is leading the top risers on the Frankfurt stock exchange, following Cryan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interview and the near-\u00c2\u00a31bn sale of Abbey Life this morning. Axel Weber, the chairman of Swiss bank UBS, insists that Deutsche Bank won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cause a repeat of the Lehman Brothers crisis that rocked the world economy eight years ago. Speaking on Bloomberg TV this morning, Weber says banks have a lot more capital than before the last crisis, and regulators have made the linkages between individual banks much safer. Weber (a former president of the Bundesbank), says: Banks have raised capital by 7 times, some by 10 times, relative to pre-crisis. The system itself, with all the re-regulation, is much more stable, and so are the individual players. The interlinkages between banks have largely been reduced to a sustainable level. In my view, the system is much more stable now. Q: So, this is not a Lehman moment? No, we are very far in terms of how solid banks are now, from where we were in 2007- 2008, Weber replies. Worried about Deutsche Bank? Confused about how Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest lender got into such a gro\u00c3\u0178 pickle? Wondering if Angela Merkel might have to step in? Our Q&amp;A has everything you need to know: Shares in Deutsche Bank have jumped by 3.3% at the start of trading in Frankfurt. They have risen to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10.89, up from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10.50 last night. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still barely half their value a year ago. Even two weeks ago, they were worth \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn - before the DoJ hit Deutsche with the threat of a $14bn fine. Investors may be reassured by John Cryan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promise that Deutsche Bank hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t asked chancellor Merkel for help, and his optimism that US regulators will compromise. Newsflash: Deutsche Bank has just agreed to sell Abbey Life, its UK life assurance group, to \u00c2\u00a3935m. Deutsche are selling the business to Phoenix Group, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest owner of life assurance funds. This should give Deutsche some much-needed extra capital, to help pay that US fine. However, the deal will also trigger a \u00c2\u00a3800m pre-tax loss (due to goodwill impairment). Deutsche Bank are tweeting the key points from CEO John Cryan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interview to Bild: The boss of Deutsche Bank has insisted that his company will not need government help, as the crisis swirling around Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest lender intensifies. John Cryan used an interview with Bild, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest newspaper, to reject reports that Deutsche may need state aid. He firmly denied reports that he had asked Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, for assistance. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At no point did I ask the chancellor for support. Neither did I suggest anything like that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Accepting government support is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153out of the question for us\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Cryan insisted, adding that raising new capital is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is currently not an issue.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He also argued that Deutsche has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fewer risks in the book than before\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153comfortably equipped with free liquidity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full interview: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Staats-Hilfen sind kein Thema\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (translation: State Aid is Not an Issue). Fears over Deutsche Bank have been growing, since it emerged this month that the Department for Justice is planning to fine the bank $14bn for mis-selling toxic mortgage securities in the run-up to the financial crisis. Cryan, though, is confident that the DoJ can be haggled down, telling Bild that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was clear from the beginning that we would not pay this sum. The Department of Justice will treat us with the same fairness as American banks that have already agreed on a compromise.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true that regulators can be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchaggled down\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. However, banking analysts fear that Deutsche would struggle to pay a fine larger than $6bn or so. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. On the agenda today.... Investors around the globe are watching Deutsche Bank closely, after the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares hit a 30+-year low yesterday (more on that shortly). Royal Bank of Scotland is also in focus, after paying a \u00c2\u00a3846m fine to US regulators for misselling mortgage bonds to credit unions a decade ago. Further fines are expected.... Opec energy ministers are due to hold an informal meeting in Algeria this afternoon; could they make noises about a proper deal to freeze production soon? European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi is heading to Berlin for a grilling from German MPs over monetary policy.

Arguably despite this deal, supply will continue to outstrip demand, while US production will likely fill the gap with increased output as price rises. However, the key takeaway is that by ditching the market-based pricing mechanism of recent years, Saudi Arabia have re-established the relevance of OPEC, with the price of oil once more being manipulated by the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest cartel.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ed4248e4b035c40686bb56\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-29T16:38:56.289Z\">5.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The House Committee now hear reports that Wells Fargo staff targeted African-American churches for false cross-selling, and referred to sub-prime loans as ghetto loans.</p> <p>Stumpf says this would be totally unacceptable.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ed3f55e4b0c38a12e711e1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-29T16:24:06.264Z\">5.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Could a dairy farmer find that he can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get credit because his credit score has been \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdinged\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by his bank opening accounts?</em></p> <p>Stumpf confirms that this is how credit scores work.</p> <p><em>So, two million people have been dinged?</em></p> <p>No, says Stumpf.

CNBC took the mood on Wall Street: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When you look at what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on in the Deutsche Bank options, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing a lot of puts being bought,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Daniel Deming, managing director at KKM Financial. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting some concerns that this could turn into something bigger.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd So, why are any hedge funds taking money out of Deutsche Bank, when the bank insists it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need government support, and is adequately capitalised? Chris Wheeler, a financial analyst with Atlantic Equities LLP in London, has told Bloomberg that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The issue here is now one of confidence,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on here. The thinking is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcDeutsche Bank is fine, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a slim chance it might not be, so why leave my money in there?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd So that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why New York-listed shares in DB are down over 7%, and the Dow Jones industrial average has shed 177 points or 1%. Government bonds are rallying too, which is usually a sign of anxiety as investors look for a safe place to put their money. The selloff is getting worse: Over on Wall Street, Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have just tumbled by 5%. This is triggered by a Bloomberg report that around 10 hedge funds who clear derivatives trades with Deutsche Bank have cut their exposure by withdrawing some excess cash, and cutting positions held at the bank. This is a sign of counterparties\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mounting concerns about doing business with Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest investment bank\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the Bloomberg report says. However, the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vast majority\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the 200 clients who clear their derivatives through Deutsche have made no changes. In a statement, Deutsche Bank insisted that it was in a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstable financial position\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and making progress: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our trading clients are amongst the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most sophisticated investors. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are confident that the vast majority of them have a full understanding of our stable financial position, the current macroeconomic environment, the litigation process in the U.S. and the progress we are making with our strategy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The report has also sent the New York stock market into the red; the Dow is now down by 162 points, or almost 1%. Back in the markets, the London stock market has closed at its highest level since mid-August. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index gained 70 points, or 1%, to close at 6919. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being driven by hopes that Opec members will follow through on their pledge to cut production by up to 700,000 barrels per day in November. Oil companies led the rally, with Royal Dutch Shell jumping 6.6%, BP up 4.3%, and Tullow Oil gaining almost 10%. Capita slumped by 26%, though, following this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profits warning. Although analysts have warned that the deal will be hard to agree and enforce, the oil price is now rising this afternoon. Brent crude has now gained almost 2% to $49.55, up 90 cents today. And US crude has gained 2.3% to $48.13. Joshua Mahony, Market Analyst at IG, says the Opec deal shows that Saudi Arabia has changed its approach to the oil market. But will it work?.... While the news of a production cut is a welcome surprise, the deal will be treated with a degree of scepticism owing to the notoriously unreliable nature of OPEC discussions. Most notably, the meeting goes to show that Saudi Arabia and Iran can work together, despite public spats between the two nations. Arguably despite this deal, supply will continue to outstrip demand, while US production will likely fill the gap with increased output as price rises. However, the key takeaway is that by ditching the market-based pricing mechanism of recent years, Saudi Arabia have re-established the relevance of OPEC, with the price of oil once more being manipulated by the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest cartel. The House Committee now hear reports that Wells Fargo staff targeted African-American churches for false cross-selling, and referred to sub-prime loans as ghetto loans. Stumpf says this would be totally unacceptable. Could a dairy farmer find that he can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get credit because his credit score has been \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdinged\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by his bank opening accounts? Stumpf confirms that this is how credit scores work. So, two million people have been dinged? No, says Stumpf. There were 565,000 credit cards involved - we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve contacted 20,000 people, and only 25% say they were mis-sold. My instruction is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmake it right\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, he insists. This is a quality company that made some mistakes, pleads Stumpf as he faces more sustained criticism. Both sides of the House committee are united in criticising Stumpf: Stumpf is asked about reports that staff were fired for whistleblowing about the problems at Wells Fargo. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re taking that very seriously, he replies. We have a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnon-retaliation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 policy. Quote of the day: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reference to last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session, where Elizabeth Warren told Stumpf he should resign and be criminally investigated. Incidentally, Public Citizen have produced a detailed guide into Wells Fargo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cross-selling practices: The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153King of Cross-Sell\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and the Race to Eight Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: Cross-selling amounts to selling a new product to an existing customer. For example, if a customer only has a savings account with Wells Fargo, an employee may try to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cross-sell\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that customer a checking, credit card, or other type of account. According to Wells Fargo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chairman and CEO, John G. Stumpf, cross-selling \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is the result of serving our customers extraordinarily well, understanding their financial needs and goals over their lifetimes, and ensuring we innovate our products, services, and channels so that we earn more of their business and help them succeed financially.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Los Angeles (LA) City Attorney found the exact opposite \u00e2\u20ac\u201c fining Wells Fargo $185 million for engaging in fraudulent cross-selling practices. The CFPB described these as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Improper Sales Practices;\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the OCC described these as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unsafe or unsound practices in the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s risk management and oversight of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sales practices;\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and the Los Angeles City Attorney wrote in its complaint that Wells Fargo imposed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an ambitious and strictly enforced sales quota system\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in which \u00e2\u20ac\u0153those failing to meet sales quotas are approached by management, and often reprimanded and/or told to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdo whatever it takes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to meet their individual sales quotas.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Los Angeles City Attorney also wrote: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Managers constantly hound, berate, demean and threaten employees to meet these unreachable quotas.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Stumpf says there is no evidence that any ethnic group was disproportionately affected by the practice of creating fake accounts. Asked if seniors were targeted, Stumpf says that young people actually suffered more. John Stumpf is told to submit his resignation, rather than hang on because he has the board\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s support. Congressman Steve Pearce tells Stumpf that he failed to tackle the problems at Wells Fargo back in 2011 or 2013. You have proved that you did not show leadership\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I think you should submit a resignation. Stumpf replies that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we did take accountability\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and invested in things to address the problems with cross-selling financial products. What you did didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work, Pearce shoots back. Democratic congressman David Scott says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s never seen such dreadful behaviour by a bank boss, misselling accounts to customers. Stumpf insists he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mis-sell these accounts personally, and is cleaning the affair up. This won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t satisfy Scott, who tells Stumpf: You should be downright ashamed of yourself, and you should apologies.... for the rancid example that you are setting, and the damage that you have done to the banking industry. Stumpf says that he is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deeply sorry\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and committed to resolving the problems. Q: Do you think what you did was criminal? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not a lawyer, I led the company with courage, Stumpf replies. Stumpf is asked whether he understands the damage that Wells Fargo has done to the industry. Stumpf replies that he grew up on a small farm, and understands proper values. I stand with the people who are doing the right thing, he pledges. Democratic member Gregory Meeks spoke for many critics, telling John Stumpf that Wells Fargo was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153criminal enterprise\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, that has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153given the entire financial services industry a black eye.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He also suggested that the entire board may have to go. And now, the House committee moves onto exactly why Wells Fargo urged its staff to cross-sell eight financial products to each customer. It was a rallying cry, John Stumpf says. The average American family has 14 financial products... But Congressman Ed Royce isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced. He points out that Wells Fargo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price rose steadily as the cross-selling gathered pace [partly because some workers were creating fraudulent sales] Democratic member Mike Capuano compares Stumpf and his board to a bank robber who recently stole from a Wells branch. At the least, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud, conspiracy to commit identity theft.....and at least another dozen crimes, Capuano declares. He also tells Stumpf that his problems will really start when prosecutors get hold of him. Republican Sean Duffy then lays into Stumpf, for not stopping the account mis-selling scandal earlier. Duffy says Wells Fargo fired 1000 people in one year, another thousand the next, without the problem being stopped. And all the time you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re stealing from people. If any bank in my community were stealing from people, then we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d fire and fix the problem. Stumpf agrees that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in some cases\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wells Fargo staff had stolen from customers. Duffy accuses Stumpf of allowing the scandal to rumble on: I think Wells Fargo was making a lot of money out of what you were doing, and you were hoping you wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get caught. Stumpf denies this, saying that fraudulent accounts cost $10m to fix. Wells Fargo loses out if a customer doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually use a new product, he promises John Stumpf is now accused of putting unsustainable pressure on workers, by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bragging\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about the amount of new bank accounts, credit cards, etc that Wells Fargo was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cross-selling\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to customers. Congressman Brad Sherman says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You fired 5,300 people, you took 5,300 good Americans and turned them into felons with a system that you created, benefited from and drove your stock price up by bragging about your levels of new accounts.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And while thousands of staff were fired for misconduct, nothing was done to fix the underlying problems, Sherman adds. Blaine Luetkemeyer, Republican representative, then slams Stumpf for saying that Wells has sacked 1,000 staff each year for misconduct. That only happens if there is a culture that allows that to happen, Luetkemeyer insists. He also blames regulators for not spotting problems. Stumpf denies that there is a cultural problem at Wells, but he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s facing more calls to step aside over this scandal. John Stumpf also tells the House committee that Wells Fargo is working on a new sales incentive scheme, and fully reviewing its control practices, going back several years. But the politicians aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed. Nydia Vel\u00c3\u00a1zquez, Democratic member, challenges Stumpf over the lot salaries paid to its staff: I know you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not aware of this, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very hard for someone to live in this country with a $25,000 salary. The CEO of Wells Fargo, John Stumpf, has returned to Capitol Hill for a second grilling. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being quizzed by the House Financial Services Committee over the mis-selling scandal that saw 2 million unauthorized credit card and deposit accounts ordered for customers without permission. Republican member Carolyn Maloney has challenged Stumpf for selling $13m of Wells Fargo stock in 2013, immediately after he heard about the fake account scandal. Maloney says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very suspicious that your largest stock sale was after your $1.8 trillion bank was turned into a school for scoundrels.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Stumpf says he owns much more stock than he is legally obliged to. He doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deny selling the stock, but insists it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t triggered by problems at the bank. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also been challenged for not resigning over the scandal. Republican Patrick McHenry tells Stumpf that his bank has broken the law, and hurt customers. So what ethical standards is he holding himself up to? Stumpf insists that Wells Fargo is committed to fully investigating the issue, and whether any staff were fired for missing sales targets. Back in Frankfurt, Commerzbank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have fallen by over 2% after it announced 9,600 job cuts and a dividend freeze. But the flurry around Deutsche Bank has calmed a little. Its shares are up 0.7% today, after the Berlin government insisted yesterday that it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t drawing up a rescue plan. Mujtaba Rahman, managing director at Eurasia Group, argues that Berlin is unlikely to bail out Deutsche Bank, for a couple of reasons. First, it might drive more voters towards the populist Alternative for Deutschland party. Secondly - EU rules insist that bond-holders are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbailed in\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, before taxpayers are tapped up. And that should provide enough fresh capital if needed. He says: According to reports, Deutsche has set aside \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5.5bn for potential fines and legal costs related to its ongoing discussions with the US Department of Justice. Given leaks the DoJ is seeking a much higher fine \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in the order of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac14bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that means the banks maximum capital loss would be around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac8.5bn. But Deutsche has approximately \u00e2\u201a\u00ac12bn of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Cocos\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c financial instruments that are designed to be converted to shares if the bank were to enter a formal resolution procedure or undergo a precautionary recapitalisation. As such, these should easily cover any capital shortfall and obviate the need for taxpayer money from Berlin. More American data just hit the wires, but this is less positive than the growth figures. The number of contracts signed to buy a US home dipped by 2.4% last month, down to the lowest level since January. That implies that US consumer demand/confidence is weak. But analysts also blame a lack of supply; there simply aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough homes coming onto the market. Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, explains: In most other areas, an increased number of prospective buyers appear to be either wavering at the steeper home prices pushed up by inventory shortages or disheartened by the competition for the miniscule number of affordable listings.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Energy analyst Joe McMonigle of The Abraham Group suggests Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal is looking less impressive, now the various hurdles have been examined: This muted reaction on Wall Street shows that Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a major shift for global oil market (yet, anyway). But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still a start. as Sebastien Marlier, commodities analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, explains: Given how divided OPEC members appeared only a few days ago, this joint agreement is a victory for the group. The pain caused by two years of low oil prices has prompted the cartel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s members to look past their differences. But uncertainties abound and a much clearer message will be needed in November if prices are to move decisively higher. He also sees several hurdles: OPEC still needs to decide how the production cuts will be shared; the Saudi-Iran rivalry could re-emerge as a hurdle here. OPEC also needs to determine for how long it wants these quotas to stay in place; only a lasting cut will have a significant impact on the global supply-demand balance. Even if OPEC agrees on these details, implementation and compliance issues are likely to arise; Iran, Libya, Nigeria, Venezuela and Iraq, which could all make a case for being exempt from the cut, could be tempted to cheat. It is also worth noting that Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s output usually ebbs after the domestic peak in demand in the summer, so a production cut may have little impact on the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exports. A final risk for OPEC is that higher prices, if sustained, risk incentivising production outside OPEC, notably in the US. This would defeat the whole purpose of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement. Over in New York, Wall Street has just opened for business with the usual bell-ringing and confetti. Shares are dipping a little, with the Dow Jones down 0.1% or 17 points at 18,321. But the US oil price is picking up, a little - gaining 20 cents per barrel to $47.25. That shows the markets haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t completely lost faith in Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to cut production by up to 700,000 barrels per day (to as low as 32.5m) The London stock market hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been moved by the flurry of data from the US and Germany. The FTSE 100 is still up 1% at 6916, which would be a six-week closing high. Oil and energy stocks continue to power ahead, with Shell up 5.7% and BP up 4%. But outsourcing group Capita remains on track for its biggest one-day slump ever, down 26%. That follows this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit warning, from a company which runs the London congestion charge and provides service to the NHS and many private businesses. Fellow outsourcing group Mitie issued its own profits warning 10 day ago, blaming the EU referendum vote. Gary Paulin, Head of Global Equities for Northern Trust Capital Markets, sees a clear pattern: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Check out post-referendum performance of Mitie (warned), Capita (warned) and Babcock. Different underlying businesses and Babcock is well run we think, but similar in that they all depend on customers renewing long term contracts. And on that front, the common theme emerging from the two warnings is that amidst Brexit uncertainty UK businesses are delaying decision-making on long term spending. That could have a meaningful impact on earnings momentum for support services companies with a mostly UK client base. And Babcock may be experiencing the same.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The number of Americans filing new unemployment benefit claims rose by 3,000 last month, to 254,000. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still comfortably below the 300,000 mark, which denotes a healthy economy. And the wider labour market looks solid too; the number of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccontinuing claims\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 has dropped to 2.062m, from 2.108m. Another newsflash: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew faster than first thought in the second quarter of 2016. US GDP increased at an annualised rate of 1.4%, new figures show, up from 1.1%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the equivalent of a quarterly rate of 0.35%. Wall Street had expected the annualised rate to inch up to 1.2%. This is the final estimate of US GDP, and it shows that business spending and exports were better than thought, helping the economy pick up pace. Highlights include: Business investment grew by 1.0%, compared with an earlier estimate of a 0.9% decline. Business spending on structures shank by 2.1%, not by 8.4% Business spending on equipment fell by 2.9%, not by 3.7% Business spending on intellectual property and software jumped by 9%, up from 8.6% Exports rose by 1.8%, not 1.2% as first thought. Imports rose by 0.2%, down from 0.3% Consumer spending grew by 4.3%, down from a first estimate of 4.4% This suggests the US economy was stronger than we thought in the spring, and may have picked up pace over the summer. Just in.. Prices in Germany have risen at the fastest pace since May 2015. The annual Consumer Prices index has risen to 0.7% this month, up from 0.4% in August. Energy prices were less of a drag on inflation, while food, services and rental costs all rose. This should please the European Central Bank, as it keeps interest rates on record lows and pumps tens of billions of new euros into the system each month to ward off deflation. Brent crude is still declining to rally today, having surged last when the Opec deal came. Having inched over the $49/barrel point in early trading, it is now down by 0.5% at $48.45. Ranko Beric of foreign exchange firm Monex Europe says that shows how the markets aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced by Opec: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement to cut production came as a complete surprise to markets last night, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interesting that Brent has failed to breach the $50/barrel level that has acted as resistance in recent months... It appears that market participants remain sceptical of OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mettle, and if the cuts announced will be sufficient to clear the current supply glut in crude.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Capital Economics are also in the sceptical camp. They have issued a note called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153OPEC deal not a game-changer for oil markets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which questions whether output will really be cut at all. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why: Iran, Libya and Nigeria will be allowed to increase production to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153maximum levels that make sense\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Given that these three countries are aiming to increase cumulative output by about 1.5m bpd by the end of the year this implies that either the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153real\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd OPEC output quota is closer to 34.5m bpd or that the rest of OPEC are willing to cut output by enough to offset these increases. In practice, most of the burden of cuts would fall on Saudi Arabia, which we doubt will be altruistic enough to substantially cut its own output to benefit the rest of the group. As such, we suspect that the actual OPEC production ceiling will turn out to be considerably higher than 32.5m - 33m bpd. Even assuming no increase in output from Libya and Nigeria, the seasonal decline in Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s production from summer to winter (about 350,000 bpd last year) would be enough to bring the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s output within its target range. As a result, supply would be no lower than it otherwise would have been. The Financial Times explains how disagreements between Iran and Saudi Arabia could knock the Opec deal off course: Delegates from Iran say they have secured a production number close to 4m barrels a day \u00e2\u20ac\u201d their stated post-sanctions target \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and representatives from Gulf countries say there is an expectation that Iran caps production at this level. However, that is not yet set in stone and negotiations are still ongoing. With Saudi and Iran still fighting proxy battles from Yemen to Syria, renewed disagreement before Vienna cannot be ruled out. Other hurdles includes: Getting every Opec member to commit to the deal. That could be crucial in getting production down by the full 700,000 barrels per day, to 32.5m per day. Otherwise, Opec might only achieve the high end of its target, 33m, which is more of a freeze than a cut (see earlier chart) Persuading Russia (not an Opec member) to make a contribution. The long-term threat from US shale. Companies which survived the last couple of years are now pretty competitive, and can probably make a profit at a lower oil price than before. More here: FT: Opec agreement faces array of hurdles Energy journalist Ben Winkley has been tracking analyst reaction to the Opec deal, and found plenty of scepticism. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: All very valid points. On the other hand, few analysts expected anything to be agreed in Algiers yesterday. So Opec could still deliver in November. The boss of Swiss bank UBS has warned it could start charging more customers for banking services, due to the impact of negative rates. The headline Swiss deposit rate is currently minus 0.75%, and chief executive Sergio Ermotti says UBS - the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest money manager \u00e2\u20ac\u201c can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t absorb this indefinitely. The problem is that negative rates eat into a bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profitability, by narrowing the gap between the cost of its liabilities (ie, deposits) and what it can earn from lending. Reuters has the details: UBS has already upped fees for corporate and institutional clients as well as raising mortgage rates by 50 basis points and accepting a smaller share of the market, but Ermotti cautioned this might not be enough if negative rates persisted. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We may need to start to think about how to pass more negative rates to a broader client base than being able to reprice the asset side of the equation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ermotti said at a Bank of America Merrill Lynch conference in London. Should people worry that the oil price is going to spike, pushing up transport and heating costs? Marino Valensise, head of multi-asset at Barings, says not, and sees a ceiling at around $60 per barrel. He explains that the global oil industry is producing an extra 1.5 million barrels more than needed each day, partly due to the US shale gas industry. A 700,000 bpd cut won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eliminate that glut. Shale producers also suffered from low oil prices over the last couple of years, but Valensise is confident they can boost production if needed. Low prices mean budgetary challenges for a lot of oil producers, hence the cuts we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen today. Once confirmed, one might expect that the oil price could go higher, but the cap that we see on the price of oil is between USD $55 and USD $60. At those levels, share producers in the States will inevitably increase production and there will be no potential through that price level. That price level is coming down by the day because the cost of extraction in the US is going down a couple of dollars per year as technology improves. This graph, from energy analyst John Kemp, puts Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s production cut into context: If Opec manages the full 700,000 barrels-per-day cut, then output would be higher than in spring. And a smaller cut, from 33.2m to 33.0m per day, is more like a freeze at this summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s levels. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial watchdog, the FCA, has charged a former portfolio manager at asset management group Blackrock with insider trading. Mark Alexander Lyttleton faces three counts of insider dealing, relating to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153trading in equities and a call option between 2 October 2011 and 16 December 2011.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here. Optimism within the eurozone has risen this month, according to the European Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest data. The EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic sentiment measure rose to 104.9 in September, from 103.5 in August. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the highest since January, with retailers and industrial firms both less pessimistic. And the consumer sentiment index remained negative, but improved to -8.2 from -8.5 last month. It looks like another sign that anxiety following the EU referendum three months ago has eased. Energy companies are still rallying strongly in London, thanks to the Opec news. Royal Dutch Shell (the largest company on the Footsie) and BT (5th largest) have driven the market up. The FTSE 100 is currently up by 77 points to 6926, a gain of 1.1%, despite Capita tumbling following its profits warning. Chris Beauchamp of City firm IG says energy stocks suddenly look good value, if Opec delivers on its promises. Expectations of a bigger cut to oil output later on in the year, ideally with Saudi Arabia and Russia, the two biggest players, doing their bit, could see oil reverse its traditionally weak performance in the fourth quarter and push higher. It turns out that OPEC members can agree, and no doubt oil companies and their investors will be hoping that this outbreak of amity continues into the end of 2016. The oil price continues to dip as traders wonder if Opec will really cut production in November. Brent crude is now down 1.1% at $48.15 per barrel, so still clinging onto most of last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 6% jump. Arnaud Masset, market analyst at Swissquote Bank, explains why the City may still be sceptical: Even if it is a good news for oil prices, this is just a pre-agreement in which OPEC members agree to trim production without actually specifying who will take the cut or how it will be divided. Therefore, we remain cautious concerning the effects of an actual trim in production, especially in view of the OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history of consistently failing to reach a consensus. And this charts hows how oil demand (light blue) hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t taken off this year, helping to force Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hand. Commerzbank, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second largest bank, has announced plans to cut 9,600 jobs in a restructuring plan. The cuts represent around a fifth of Commerzbank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total workforce, and will probably include forced layoffs. Commerzbank is also suspending its dividend payments for this year, as it tries to protect its profitability. The cuts are part of a new strategy drawn up by chief executive Martin Zielke, called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Commerzbank 4.0\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which has just been announced. This includes focusing on two areas - \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcprivate and small business customers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccorporate clients\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153digitalising around 80% of relevent processes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Reuters reports). It also hopes to create 2,300 new jobs. There were rumours this week that Zielke was planning a deep overhaul of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s operations, after reporting a drop in earnings back in August. Like most banks, Commerszbank has suffered from record low interest rates - which restrict its ability to make profits. Newsflash: The number of mortgage loans granted in the UK has hit its lowest level in 21 months, down by almost 900 to 60,058 in August. But consumers credit is growing, with the public borrowing \u00c2\u00a31.574bn last month, up from \u00c2\u00a31.191bn in July. Reuters has the details: British mortgage approvals fell to their lowest level since November 2014 last month as the housing market continued to slow after June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote to leave the European Union, Bank of England data showed on Thursday. But the BoE figures also showed lending to consumers continued to grow rapidly, expanding at a rate close to the 10-year highs seen in previous months. Mortgage approvals for house purchases numbered 60,058 in August, down from 60,925 in July. Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast 60,150 mortgage approvals for August. More City reaction to the Opec agreement: Bloomberg have a good explanation about Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to cut output to push prices higher. They point out that the kingdom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil minister, Khalid Al-Falih, has reversed his predecessor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy of letting the market set the oil without interference. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why: In 2014, when Saudi Arabia led OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pump-at-will policy, Riyadh calculated that if it reduced output, prices wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rise enough to compensate. This time is different. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Saudi Arabia is betting that a small cut will pay for itself through higher oil prices and hence higher revenues,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Jamie Webster, a fellow at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University in New York. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not as if the pump-at-will policy hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t had its moments. Saudi Arabia has achieved some of its objectives. Low prices tossed water on the U.S. oil boom, and energy companies have cut as much as $1 trillion in new projects, creating a possible supply hole in the next decade. The kingdom has also scared investors who are now more likely to think twice before plunging money into risky oil ventures. And from the U.S. to China, sales of gas-guzzling cars have soared, bolstering demand. For all the justifications, the last two years haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t panned out as Riyadh thought they would. At home, the kingdom has burned through more than $150 billion of foreign-exchange reserves, government contractors have gone unpaid, and this week the king announced unprecedented pay cuts for civil servants. More here: In U-Turn, Saudis Choose Higher Prices Over Free Oil Markets Another interesting chart, from Morgan Stanley, showing how Opec can struggle to stick to its production targets (the blue line): Goldman Sachs aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t terribly impressed with the Opec deal either, and aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t changing their oil price forecasts. Goldman analysts still expect US crude oil (or West Texas Intermediate (WTI) ) to hover around $43 a barrel for the end of this year and $53 a barrel in 2017. They told clients that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If this proposed cut is strictly enforced and supports prices, we would expect it to prove self-defeating medium term with a large drilling response around the world.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also no guarantee that Opec members will stick to the script, as: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Compliance to quotas is historically poor, especially when oil demand is not weak.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd CNBC has more details: Just in... Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate remains at a healthy 6.1% this month. The Federal Labour Office reports that the seasonally adjusted jobless total rose by 1,000 to 2.680 million in September. Analysts had expected a fall of 5,000. But strip out seasonal adjustments, and the unemployment total actually fell to 2.608m, from 2.684m, underlining the health of the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy. Separate data shows that German industrial orders rose by 2% in August, having been weak earlier in the summer. Domestic demand was strong. This chart shows how many Opec members are pumping at almost maximum capacity, as they try to pull in as much revenue as possible. For last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal to work, at least some members have to agree to cut - and we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know who. Plus, other producers will surely turn their taps back up if Opec succeed in pushing the oil price higher. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, says: There is also no guarantee that a cut triggers a meaningful increase in price of course. Nigeria is looking to bring on around a million barrels per day soon \u00e2\u20ac\u201c roughly what analysts expect will be the sum total of these cuts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whilst you had better believe that shale operators in the US and elsewhere will be looking forward to getting their wild cat operations. Marc Ostwald, analyst at ADM Investor Services, is also a little sceptical, telling clients: There is of course the OPEC \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcproduction deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to digest, which it has to be said looks to be of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwe must agree something, however vague and lacking in specific detail\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, with the fear that downward seasonal pressures would send oil prices into a renewed downward spiral the clear motivating factor. Interestingly, the oil price is now dipping a little, having surged late last night. Brent crude has dropped by 0.4%, or 20 cents per barrel, to $48.50. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still almost three dollars higher than yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lows. But it suggests the markets are looking for more details about this Opec deal to cut production by 700,000 barrels per day. As explained earlier, we simply don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the full details - except that apparently Iran won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to freeze production. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains A committee has been set up to deal with that [who freezes production] and is likely to be a tall order if history is any guide. Ultimately the proof of the pudding will be in the eating and if history is any judge, the detail will fall short. If anything this looks like another attempt to keep a floor under prices without actually having to do anything. For now it seems to be working, the ultimate in jaw-jaw. In addition the full details won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be known until the full OPEC meeting at the end of November, which means another two months of capacity output, of over 33m barrels per day. There is also the not insignificant matter of persuading non OPEC members like Russia, who are not party to the deal, to come on board. Good luck with that one! Setting Capita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes aside, European stock markets are all rallying as investors move money into riskier assets. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all thanks to the oil production deal, say Mike van Dulken &amp; Henry Croft at Accendo Markets: The positive open come almost entirely courtesy of last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprise OPEC production cut agreement. The news sent oil prices sharply higher and has helped Energy names overnight while buoying sentiment in the general commodity space. Shares in Capita, the outsourcing and professional services group, have plunged by 22% at the start of trading. The company has issued a profits warning this morning, saying that clients have been delaying spending decisions following the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote to leave the EU in June. Capita cut its profit forecast for this year to between \u00c2\u00a3535m and \u00c2\u00a3555m, compared to analyst forecasts of a \u00c2\u00a3614m profit. It told the City that: Our performance in the second half of the year to date has been below expectations, as a result of a slow-down in specific trading businesses, one-off costs incurred on the Transport for London (TfL) congestion charging contract and continued delays in client decision making. That sent its shares sliding to their lowest level since November 2012, and on track for their worst daily fall ever. Shares in major oil producers have jumped at the start of trading in London. Royal Dutch Shell are up 5%, with BP gaining 4.3%. Mining groups Anglo American and BHP Billiton are also in the top risers, gaining almost 5%. That has sent the FTSE 100 index of leading blue-chip shares up 75 points, or 1.1%, to 6925. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a one-week high; and would be its highest closing level since mid-August. Smaller producers are gaining too. Hunting, which supplies equipment to the oil industry, has leapt by 13%. Tullow Oil, which finds oil in Africa and the margins of the Atlantic, has gained 11%. The big surprise is that Saudi Arabia has reversed its approach to managing the oil market. Saudi is the biggest producer in Opec, and had appeared happy to push the oil price down to hurt rival producers (particularly the new shale industry). But a lower oil price has hurt Saudi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy too; it is expected to run a deficit of 13.5% of GDP this year, and is imposing wage cuts as part of an austerity drive. So the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpump-at-will\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 policy appears to have been scrapped. As Bill Blain of Mint Partners puts it on Bloomberg TV: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They are hoping to turn around a world where they were trying to work the price down and keep new producers out, to a new world where they can wok the price up again.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a tricky task - if the oil price jumps, American producers will return to the market. John Kilduff, founding partner at Again Capital, told CNBC that Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s old policy of letting the market set the oil price had backfired. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The big takeaway is how into a corner the Saudis have backed themselves. This whole plan has backfired on them. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to be bearing most of the cutback if they pull it off, and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had to really kowtow to the Iranians in this whole thing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It appears that Iran won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually cut production itself, but will rein in its ambitions. Associated Press reports: According to Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal, Iran will be allowed to increase production to 3.7 million barrels a day, according to Algerian participants at the meeting. It is currently estimated to be pumping around 3.6 million but had been aiming for 4 million per day. Sanctions on Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil industry were lifted in January, and it has been aiming to boost production. Stock markets in Asia have jumped on the back of Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprise deal to cut output, even though details are limited. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei led the way, jumping by nearly 1.4%. A higher oil price would please Japanese policymakers, as they strive for higher inflation. The other major indices are all up too, as energy stocks benefit: FXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed says traders had thought an Opec deal was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mission impossible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But he also wants to see more details... Battered finances of major oil producing countries forced the leaders to put their differences to one side and end a 2-year unofficial war on shale. Crude prices surged by 6% following yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news and sent Asian equities higher with energy stocks leading the rally. Such a deal should have had a stronger impact on oil, I would say at least a 10-15% rally, but the limited details of the agreement put a limit on the upside and we will now have to wait until November 30 to see whether the agreement will translate into actions, and whether non-OPEC oil producers will follow suit. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Global stock markets are heading higher today, after the Opec cartel pulled a big surprise, and agreed to cut oil production, for the first time in eight years. The deal was hammered out at informal talks in Algiers last night. It will see global production cut by up to 700,000 barrels per day, from 33.24m to 32.5-33m. That effectively takes Opec back to the levels in play before the cartel abandoned its targets last December, triggering a glut in production. News of the deal sent the oil price soaring late last night, up around 6%. Brent crude is now worth $48.76 per barrel, up from $45.70 yesterday. Traders had seen little chance of a deal at the Algiers talks, given the tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran. But instead, Saudi appear to have abandoned its policy of keeping the oil price low to drive rivals, such as shale producers, out of the markets. Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil minister, Bijan Zanganeh, broke the news, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have decided to decrease production by around 700,000 barrels per day. Opec officials say that production levels for each member country will be agreed at its next formal meeting, on 30 November in Vienna. Reuters has more details: After reaching its group target, it will seek support from non-member oil producers to further ease the global glut. Brent crude settled up $2.72, or 5.9%, at $48.69 a barrel, hitting a more than two-week high of $48.96. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose by $2.38, or 5.3%, to settle at $47.05, after a peak $47.45, its highest since 8 September. The oil rally spilled over into the stock market, with Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s index of energy shares rising 4% for its best one-day gain since January. Some analysts are hailing the deal as a breakthrough. For example, Phil Flynn, analyst at Chicago-based brokerage Price Futures Group, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a historic deal. This is the first time Opec and non-Opec will agree together in over a decade. This should put a floor on oil and should see oil move back toward the $60s.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But other experts aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced; will this cut really be enforced? Which countries will actually cut production? And if the oil price goes up, won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t shale producers simply start pumping more too? For now, though, the markets are happy. Asian markets rallied overnight, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expecting European indices to jump by around 1% this morning.
