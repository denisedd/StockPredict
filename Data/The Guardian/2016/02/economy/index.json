Crude prices were on the slide once more, given there was no sign of any deal between Opec and the likes of Russia to cut production and stem the supply glut. On top of that, sentiment was hit by major losses at BP and a 48% drop in profits at Exxon Mobil.</p> <p>So Brent crude fell as much as 5% before recovering some ground - and helping markets off their worst levels at the same time. It is currently down 2.8% at $33.26 a barrel. West Texas, which slipped below $30 at one point, is now down 1% at $30.6 a barrel.</p> <p>Adding to the downbeat mood came reports that China was imposing new controls to help control outflows of capital from the country, in particular a cap on people buying insurance from overseas.</p> <p>So despite the marginal recovery, the final scores showed some hefty falls:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 fell 138.09 points or 2.2% to 5922.01</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.8% to 9581.04</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac closed down 2.47% at 4283.99</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 3.05% to 17,922.45</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 2.96% at 8528.7</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.84% to 552.5</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 271 points or 1.65%.</p> <p><em>On that gloomy note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening.

Major indices are rapidly shedding the gains they made in the second half of January, as a cocktail of worries returns. The first of these is the oil price, which has rediscovered its old habit of diving like a stone, helped in no small part by the absence of any rumours about another OPEC meeting.</p> <p>The session started with oil firms in the red, as BP\u2019s results sent the shares into a tail spin, but the company has been joined at the bottom of the index by miners and insurers. The former are down as economic growth concerns take centre stage, with this concern not helped by warnings from Fed policymakers, while the latter are in retreat thanks to China, which appears to be coming up with new and creative ways to try to stem capital flight. The reaction is probably overdone where the likes of Prudential are concerned, but it is hard to remain positive when the tentative rally of the past two weeks is slipping from your grasp.</p> <p>Adding to concerns was ExxonMobil, which is down 3% as the earnings beat fades amidst the stark reality of a remarkable slump in profits. As crude prices slide once more, thanks to markets suddenly waking up and remembering the massive oversupply story, it looks like this sector will be the trailblazer for any renewed slump in stock markets.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56b0cd3ee4b054341b6d0f04\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-02T15:41:42.361Z\">3.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Back in the UK, and one of the biggest fallers apart from commodity companies is Prudential.</strong></p> <p>The insurance group is down nearly 8% on reports that China might be taking steps to stem outflows of capital. In particular Bloomberg has said the country could impose restrictions on people buying insurance products abroad, with a $5,000 cap per transaction to be imposed from 4 February. Analyst David Morrison at Spread Co said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Amid today\u2019s unsettling stock market action, Prudential stands out as one of the big losers. But this has nothing to do with the announcement that Anne Richards will be joining the Pru from Aberdeen Asset Management later this year.</p> <p>Instead it comes on the back of China\u2019s currency regulator imposing restrictions on its citizens buying overseas insurance products. This isn\u2019t just bad news for the Pru or the insurance sector in general. It raises fears that the Chinese authorities may take further action to limit capital controls. This is a particular worry as we head towards the extended Chinese New Year holiday break.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-02-02T15:42:08.581Z\">at 3.42pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-56b0c8ade4b048ec83a765b2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-02T15:19:25.110Z\">3.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are the Dow movers:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8933fcf4c624135f794f9ec398e4a6b7d066294b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8933fcf4c624135f794f9ec398e4a6b7d066294b/0_0_1133_919/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dow under pressure\" width=\"1000\" height=\"811\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dow under pressure</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56b0c6e6e4b048ec83a765ab\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-02T15:12:24.955Z\">3.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>A sliding crude price and the lack of any major data to give direction have combined to send markets lower, </strong>says financial analyst Connor Campbell of Spreadex:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Things turned ugly this afternoon, with a woeful performance from Brent Crude and a particularly weak open from the US indices seeing the markets double down on the day\u2019s losses.</p> <p>Now down around 4.5% and threatening to fall below $32 per barrel, the resumption of Brent Crude\u2019s decline has been the main catalyst for the day\u2019s dismal trading. And as ever, when the commodities begin to fall the FTSE loses its way in pretty dramatic fashion, the UK index dropping a whopping 150 points as the day went on. The main casualty was BP; plunging by nearly 10% the oil has lost wave upon wave of investors this Tuesday following the revelation of its worst annual losses for 20 years.</p> <p>Whilst the DAX was prevented from posting the kind of absurd losses it is known for thanks to a record low German unemployment rate figure, the CAC was right up there with its UK peer this afternoon, falling around 2.6% as the day wore on. Over in the US, meanwhile, the Dow Jones quickly sank by 250-ish points after the bell rang on Wall Street, exactly what the markets didn\u2019t need following such an awful morning in Europe.</p> <p>The lack of truly significant data likely exacerbated today\u2019s losses, investors left with little other option but to focus on the same fears that have caused the markets to start 2016 in such dire fashion. Tomorrow, then, maybe slightly better, with a cavalcade of services figures around the globe set to distract the markets (however briefly or successfully is unclear) from their current malaise.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56b0bfcce4b048ec83a7658e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-02T14:45:44.300Z\">2.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street drops nearly 250 points, with US crude below $30</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Alphabet success comes as the overall market has moved sharply lower.</p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 241 points or 1.46%, as Wall Street follows other markets lower.

                "bodyText":"The optimism seen at the end of last week seems to have disappeared as quickly as it came. Crude prices were on the slide once more, given there was no sign of any deal between Opec and the likes of Russia to cut production and stem the supply glut. On top of that, sentiment was hit by major losses at BP and a 48% drop in profits at Exxon Mobil. So Brent crude fell as much as 5% before recovering some ground - and helping markets off their worst levels at the same time. It is currently down 2.8% at $33.26 a barrel. West Texas, which slipped below $30 at one point, is now down 1% at $30.6 a barrel. Adding to the downbeat mood came reports that China was imposing new controls to help control outflows of capital from the country, in particular a cap on people buying insurance from overseas. So despite the marginal recovery, the final scores showed some hefty falls: The FTSE 100 fell 138.09 points or 2.2% to 5922.01 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.8% to 9581.04 France\u2019s Cac closed down 2.47% at 4283.99 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 3.05% to 17,922.45 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 2.96% at 8528.7 In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.84% to 552.5 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 271 points or 1.65%. On that gloomy note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow for a busy day of service sector surveys around the globe. As European markets head towards the close nursing heavy losses again Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said: The end of January, when markets raced higher, seems such a long time ago. Major indices are rapidly shedding the gains they made in the second half of January, as a cocktail of worries returns. The first of these is the oil price, which has rediscovered its old habit of diving like a stone, helped in no small part by the absence of any rumours about another OPEC meeting. The session started with oil firms in the red, as BP\u2019s results sent the shares into a tail spin, but the company has been joined at the bottom of the index by miners and insurers. The former are down as economic growth concerns take centre stage, with this concern not helped by warnings from Fed policymakers, while the latter are in retreat thanks to China, which appears to be coming up with new and creative ways to try to stem capital flight. The reaction is probably overdone where the likes of Prudential are concerned, but it is hard to remain positive when the tentative rally of the past two weeks is slipping from your grasp. Adding to concerns was ExxonMobil, which is down 3% as the earnings beat fades amidst the stark reality of a remarkable slump in profits. As crude prices slide once more, thanks to markets suddenly waking up and remembering the massive oversupply story, it looks like this sector will be the trailblazer for any renewed slump in stock markets. Back in the UK, and one of the biggest fallers apart from commodity companies is Prudential. The insurance group is down nearly 8% on reports that China might be taking steps to stem outflows of capital. In particular Bloomberg has said the country could impose restrictions on people buying insurance products abroad, with a $5,000 cap per transaction to be imposed from 4 February. Analyst David Morrison at Spread Co said: Amid today\u2019s unsettling stock market action, Prudential stands out as one of the big losers. But this has nothing to do with the announcement that Anne Richards will be joining the Pru from Aberdeen Asset Management later this year. Instead it comes on the back of China\u2019s currency regulator imposing restrictions on its citizens buying overseas insurance products. This isn\u2019t just bad news for the Pru or the insurance sector in general. It raises fears that the Chinese authorities may take further action to limit capital controls. This is a particular worry as we head towards the extended Chinese New Year holiday break. Here are the Dow movers: A sliding crude price and the lack of any major data to give direction have combined to send markets lower, says financial analyst Connor Campbell of Spreadex: Things turned ugly this afternoon, with a woeful performance from Brent Crude and a particularly weak open from the US indices seeing the markets double down on the day\u2019s losses. Now down around 4.5% and threatening to fall below $32 per barrel, the resumption of Brent Crude\u2019s decline has been the main catalyst for the day\u2019s dismal trading. And as ever, when the commodities begin to fall the FTSE loses its way in pretty dramatic fashion, the UK index dropping a whopping 150 points as the day went on. The main casualty was BP; plunging by nearly 10% the oil has lost wave upon wave of investors this Tuesday following the revelation of its worst annual losses for 20 years. Whilst the DAX was prevented from posting the kind of absurd losses it is known for thanks to a record low German unemployment rate figure, the CAC was right up there with its UK peer this afternoon, falling around 2.6% as the day wore on. Over in the US, meanwhile, the Dow Jones quickly sank by 250-ish points after the bell rang on Wall Street, exactly what the markets didn\u2019t need following such an awful morning in Europe. The lack of truly significant data likely exacerbated today\u2019s losses, investors left with little other option but to focus on the same fears that have caused the markets to start 2016 in such dire fashion. Tomorrow, then, maybe slightly better, with a cavalcade of services figures around the globe set to distract the markets (however briefly or successfully is unclear) from their current malaise. The Alphabet success comes as the overall market has moved sharply lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 241 points or 1.46%, as Wall Street follows other markets lower. Fears of a global slowdown in the wake of weak industrial data this week have unnerved investors once more, while oil continues to slide as hopes fade of a deal between Opec and other oil countries - Russia in particular - to cut production. Brent crude is down 5% at $32.5 while West Texas has slipped below $30 a barrel. Elsewhere the S&amp;P is down 1.4% while the falls on European markets are accelerating. The FTSE 100 is now down 154 points or 2.5% while Germany\u2019s Dax is down 1.35% and France\u2019s Cac has lost 2.1%. Alphabet shares have jumped more than 4% at the open, valuing it at around $545bn. In contrast Apple is down almost 1% to give it a market capitalisation of around $530bn. Wall Street has opened and Alphabet has indeed overtaken Apple to become the world\u2019s largest listed company. UK energy group British Gas has announced it will axe 500 jobs as part of a cost cutting programme by its parent company Centrica. It did not say where or when the cuts would be made, according to Reuters which quotes British Gas chief executive Mark Hodges as saying: British Gas is well positioned to grow but we must ensure that our costs allow us to be competitive for our customers. Back with big oil, and Exxon Mobil has unveiled a 48% drop in its fourth quarter profit to $2.78bn and said it would cut spending this year by a quarter. That follows news that BP has made its biggest ever loss and plans 7,000 job cuts. The sell-off in stock markets is continuing, with the FTSE 100 now down 116 points or 1.9%. BP, now down 8.4%, has contributed around 21 points to the fall. Oil and mining companies as a whole have knocked some 50 points off the index. In Europe Germany\u2019s Dax is down 1.3% and France\u2019s Cac is 2% lower. At the moment, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are showing a 128 point loss on the US index when Wall Street opens. Whether that has an impact on Google - sorry Alphabet - overtaking Apple as the world\u2019s most valuable listed company remains to be seen. Worried about China? Maybe you\u2019re not worried enough. Royal Bank of Scotland has issued an online research note today, explaining how China\u2019s economy could hit trouble. Senior Economist Marcus Wright fears that China\u2019s economy has slowed more quickly than official data shows, and is struggling to break its addiction to debt (which helped fuel growth in recent years) This means Beijing is struggling to rebalance the economy in the face of a credit boom, triggering recent market turbulence and fears of a disorderly yuan devaluation. Wright predicts that a \u201chard landing\u201d is a serious risk for China, with consequences for countries worldwide. He says: China\u2019s slowdown is already impacting the global economy through the channels of growth, trade, inflation, interest rate expectation and financial linkages. There is more to come on all these fronts. The full presentation is online here. RBS have helpfully tweeted some of the key charts: Our energy editor Terry Macalister has established that BP is actually planning to cut 7,000 more jobs, more than first thought, after reporting an an annual loss of $6.5bn this morning. Terry also reports that CEO Bob Dudley thinks investors are \u201coverreacting\u201d by sending its shares down by 9% so far today.... Over in Greece, the negotiations between Athens and its creditors over its bailout programme have taken a curious twist, as talks resume today. The EU side has apparently hinted that Greece might get an easier ride, if it does a better job processing the refugees arriving on its shores from the Middle East. The Greek newspaper Kathimerini explains: Greek authorities are scrambling to set up screening centers for migrants and refugees as soon as possible as German officials have made it clear to Athens that more efficient management of the refugee crisis could help along creditors\u2019 review of the country\u2019s third bailout, Kathimerini understands. According to sources, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has indicated to Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras that success in tackling the migration crisis could boost the country\u2019s prospects for progress with the review, which Athens hopes could ease the way for debt talks. Combined with a burgeoning debate about Greece\u2019s future in the passport-free Schengen area, the message from Berlin is said to have encouraged action by Greek officials. Blackmail? Bribery? Or an attempt to fix two problems in one go? Currently, some refugees trying to move west from Greece are stranded at the border with Macedonia, due to anti-austerity protests held by farmers. BP\u2019s share price continues to wilt as analysts digest today\u2019s slump in profits/record loss (depending what measure you pick). It is currently down 8.8%, which by my reckoning wipes \u00a35.8bn off its market capitalisation. BP boss Bob Dudley has also warned that other oil companies will follow his lead and slash jobs, in response to the slide in the crude price. ITV\u2019s Joel Hills has the details: The oil sector is churning out the rumours today, as the crude price drops. The latest one is that member of the OPEC cartel are still resisting an emergency meeting where a production cut could be hammered out. That\u2019s despite the pain being suffered across the oil-producing countries, with Saudi facing serious austerity, Nigeria seeking help from the World Bank, and Russia apparently considering privatising various state assets. BP is briefing journalists in London now, after reporting its biggest annual loss in at least 20 years. The oil giant is predicting a volatile 2016, and warning that the cost of the Deepwater Horizon spill disaster is still rising. The oil is continuing to weaken, mirroring the selloff in the equity markets. Brent crude is now off 3.7% or $1.20 at $32.97 per barrel, hit by persistent fears of economic slowdown and oversupply in the oil market. And the Russian rouble is falling in sympathy, as cheaper oil brings more trouble for struggling petro-exporters. Tim Condon, head of Asia research at ING, fears that the oil sector is locked in a vicious downward spiral with factories. Oil companies cut spending last year after crude prices fell sharply, which meant they ordered less from manufacturers. That hit factory growth, and also meant they needed less energy. That hit demand for oil, helping to push stockpiles up and prices down. Or as Condon put it to clients: \u201cManufacturing is (the) leading edge of a global growth slowdown.\u201d \u201cWe think the 50% crash in global oil prices in the second half of 2014 caused the manufacturing slump by crushing commodity producers\u2019 spending. However, we also think that in 2015 weaker manufacturing, especially in China, began to drive down oil prices. The negative feedback loop is causing severe strains.\u201d Mario Draghi and colleagues at the European Central Bank will be relieved that the eurozone jobless rate fell last month, as they ponder whether to take new stimulus measures next month. Alex Lydall, senior sales trader at Foenix Partners, says investors expect action in March. Traders and investors assumed from the latest ECB press conference that further cuts in the deposit rate and perhaps an extension and expansion of Quantitative Easing are potentially on the cards. Today\u2019s selloff has wiped out almost all the spike last Friday, after the Bank of Japan took the dramatic step of introducing negative interest rates. Central bank stimulus packages don\u2019t have the impact they used to, as investors worry that the global economy is heading remorselessly downwards. Brenda Kelly of London Capital Group explains: It would seem that central bank impact is really beginning to lose its charm and the days of buying the dip on the back of stimulus expectations is no longer the winning strategy it once was. We\u2019re back to the same old story today with materials and energy providing a drag on the FTSE as BP delivered what was frankly a terrible set of results \u2013 its worst loss in 20 years. Breaking: The Eurozone unemployment rate has hit its lowest level since September 2011. Eurostat is reporting that the region\u2019s jobless rate dipped in December to 10.4%, from 10.5%. Across the wider EU, the jobless rate remained at 9.0%. Although the fall is encouraging, it still leaves 21.944 million men and women out of work in the 28 members of the EU, including 16.750m in the euro area. There were, as usual, stark difference across Europe too. Among the Member States, the lowest unemployment rates in December 2015 were recorded in the Czech Republic and Germany (both 4.5%), Malta and the United Kingdom (both 5.1%, October data for the UK). The highest unemployment rates were observed in Greece (24.5% in October 2015) and Spain (20.8%). More gloom. Growth in Britain\u2019s building sector has hit a nine-month low, according to new figures from data firm Markit. Markit\u2019s UK construction PMI has fallen to 55.0 in January, from 57.8 in December. That suggests growth slowed to its lowest rate since April 2015. The survey found that:\uf0a7 UK construction sector experiences growth slowdown at the start of 2016 Job creation eases to its slowest for almost two-and-a-half years Construction firms report lowest business confidence since December 2014 Worries about global growth and weak, falling oil prices are back under the spotlight today, warns Arnaud Masset, market analyst at Swissquote Bank. And that\u2019s why the European markets are sliding again. The FTSE 100 is now down 85 points, and being dragged lower by oil companies, banks and miners: Investors are also gloomy after yesterday\u2019s factory data. It showed the US manufacturing sector was not as strong as hoped, while China continued to weaken. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale explains: Yesterday afternoon\u2019s US economic data was pretty consistently below expectations, reinforcing the clear signs that global manufacturing is down in the dumps. BP\u2019s poor results are also a reminder of the havoc playing out in the oil sector, as hopes of a deal between Russia and Saudi Arabia to cut production dwindle. FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga says: Tepid manufacturing data from China, the world\u2019s largest energy consumer, renewed fears that demand may be dwindling. These anxieties added to the rapidly fading expectations around OPEC cooperating with Russia to curb production, while ongoing concerns over the excessive oversupply of oil in the markets continued to haunt investors. BP\u2019s CEO, Bob Dudley, has warned that the oil price will remain volatile until the second half of 2016. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, he predicted spikes - up and down - in the next few months as Iran returns to the oil market. Just in: Germany\u2019s unemployment rate has hit a new record low of just 6.2%. Destatis, the stats body, reports that the German jobless total fell by 20,000 in January, compared to expectations of an 8,000 decline. Another difficult morning is unfolding on the European stock markets. In London, the FTSE 100 has shed 1.3%, or 82 points, to 5977. BP is partly to blame - it has knocked 17 points off the Footsie on it own, and also dragged rival Royal Dutch Shell down too (it reports results on Thursday). Mining shares are also down, with BHP Billiton off 4%. Across the channel, Germany\u2019s DAX is down 0.9% and the French CAC is down 1.3% BP\u2019s stonking loss has hit shares across the energy sector: Shares in BP have slumped at the start of trading, after the energy giant reported its worst loss in 20 years. BP shares fell 5.8%, or 21p, to 345p as investors reacted to the news that it lost $6.482bn in 2015, on a pre-tax basis, compared to a profit of \u00a33.780bn in 2014. That, Reuters reports, is the biggest loss in two decades. Oil companies like to report their results in \u201cunderlying replacement cost profit\u201d terms, to strip out the impact of the fluctuating oil price. But even then, BP\u2019s results are worse than expected. It reported a 91% drop in underlying profits in the last three months, to just $196m. It\u2019s bad news for workers - BP is planning to cut an extra 3,000 jobs in its downstream unit by the end of 2017, on top of 4,000 earlier cuts. After weeks of haggling, Sainsbury has finally secured the takeover of Home Retail - owner of catalogue shopping chain Argus. The two sides reached terms overnight of a \u00a31.3bn merger. This is Sainsbury CEO Mike Coupe\u2019s first big deal -- he\u2019s hoping to repel the march of Amazon, and rising pressure from discount grocers. Assuming shareholders back the deal, Sainsbury will soon be installing Argos outlets in its stores. My colleague Sean Farrell has the details of the deal: Britain\u2019s second-biggest supermarket has proposed paying Home Retail shareholders 55p in cash and 0.321 Sainsbury\u2019s shares for each of their shares, valuing Home Retail at \u00a31.1bn. Under the terms of the proposed deal, Home Retail shareholders would also get a further \u00a3200m from the sale of Homebase, Home retail\u2019s DIY and homewares business. Along with a 2.8p per share payment in lieu of a final dividend, the proposed offer values Home Retail at 161.3p a share or about \u00a31.3bn. Most Asian stock markets lost ground today, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei closing 0.64% lower. China bucked the trend, though, jumping over 2%, after the People\u2019s Bank of China pumped more money into the system. Marketwatch explains why: China\u2019s central bank injected 100 billion yuan ($15.2 billion) in short-term loans to money markets, in a move to stave off potential liquidity squeezes ahead of the weeklong Lunar New Year holiday that starts on February 7. This is the first leg of the bank\u2019s usual twice-a-week money-market operations. Overnight, Australia\u2019s central bank left interest rates unchanged at the record low of 2%. But it also warned it could cut soon if the recent financial market turbulence continues. Worries over the strength of the global economy has pushed the gold price up to its highest level since the start of November. Bullion hit $1,130 per ounce in early reading, as investors scurried for safe-havens in the face of recent weak economic data. Fears over China were also rife, after yesterday\u2019s data showed its factory sector shrinking at the fastest rate since 2012. Japan\u2019s move into negative interest rates on Friday has also caused jitters, as traders wonder whether further unconventional monetary policy will be deployed soon. And this uncertainty is making gold more attractive. Reuters explains: With rates close to zero, the \u201conly option is to move either towards zero or negative rates as the Japanese and selected European countries are already doing in a desperate attempt to force banks to lend\u201d, INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir wrote to clients. \u201cWhatever the case, this should be constructive for gold.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling overage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Worries over the global economy continue to weigh on markets today, after yesterday\u2019s disappointing manufacturing surveys from China and the US. The main European markets are expected to dip, extending yesterday\u2019s selloff: On the data front, we find out at 10am whether Europe\u2019s jobs market improved in December. The main eurozone jobless rate is expected to remain at 10.5% , matching the four-year low reached in November. And at 9.30am, we also get the latest survey of the UK construction sector for January. Last week we learned that the building industry contracted in the last quarter of 2015, so analysts will be hoping for signs of recovery. In the City, oil giant BP and online supermarket Ocado are reporting financial results. As feared, BP has suffered from the slump in the oil price. It\u2019s also outlining significant job cuts. And supermarket chain Sainsbury has been hammering out the terms of a takeover for Home Retail, to get control of its Argos shops.",

His speech fuelled the view that the Bank of England could sit tight on interest rates through 2016. </p> <p>Mr. Carney indicated to a Treasury Committee that this is his personal view, so the analysis and forecasts contained in the Quarterly Inflation Report, as well as in the February MPC minutes, will offer insights as to what extent Mr. Carney\u2019s views are shared by the rest of the MPC.

However, there is clearly a very real possibility that the bank will sit tight until 2017. Our assumption of a November interest rate hike is based on our belief that economic growth will become more solid later on in 2016, earnings growth picks up anew amid a tightening labour market and consumer price inflation trends gradually up.

The influx of refugees should also provide overall help to Eurozone growth in 2016, primarily through increased public expenditure. There are also more growth orientated fiscal policies in some countries. Meanwhile, lower unemployment across the Eurozone is supportive to consumer spending along with the boost to purchasing power coming from negligible inflation, although the number of jobless remains relatively high.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the January services and manufacturing PMIs showing slower expansion and deeper overall cuts in prices charged support the case for the ECB to deliver more stimulus at its 10 March policy meeting.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56b1c6a0e4b048ec83a767af\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-03T09:23:58.236Z\">9.23am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">China expects 6.5% to 7% growth this year</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>China has set a target range for economic growth in 2016, and it is slightly below last year\u2019s objective following the target being missed last year.

                "bodyText":"The slower growth in US services has pushed Wall Street into negative territory, with the Dow Jones industrial average now down 32 points or 0.2%. The FTSE 100 has seen its falls accelerate and is now down 70 points, while the FTSE Eurofirst 300 has lost 1.3%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow for the Bank of England\u2019s interest rate decision on Super Thursday. The ISM services report for the US is also showing a slowdown in growth last month. The index came in well below expectations at 53.5 in January, compared to 55.8 in December and forecasts of a reading of 55.1. This is the lowest reading since February 2014, while business activity is at its worst since August 2012. The US service sector grew more slowing in January than in the previous month, according to the first of the day\u2019s two surveys. Markit\u2019s services PMI for January came in at 53.2 compared to an initial reading of 53.7 and the final December level of 54.3. The composite PMI - which measures both manufacturing and services - fell from 54 in December to 53.2. This is the lowest level since October 2013. More on the prospects of an Opec meeting, from the Wall Street Journal: With oil gaining ground and better than expected private payroll numbers, Wall Street has started the trading day on a positive note. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has added around 90 points or 0.3%, while the S&amp;P 500 has opened up 0.42% and Nasdaq is 0.57% higher. Over in Greece, and journalists are joining in the general wave of protests against proposed pension reforms. Helena Smith reports: The rally, part of a 24-hour strike, comes ahead of tomorrow\u2019s general strike, the third to hit Greece since Syriza was voted back into office in September. Journalists claim that government plans to merge their own pension funds with others is unlawful and counterproductive. Tomorrow\u2019s industrial action will see the entire country come to a grinding halt. Ironically, left wing Syriza has decided to give the strike its blessing and is backing the protests against internationally dictated reforms now creating a storm of reaction across Greece. The country has similarly been paralysed by protesting farmers who have set up roadblocks and sealed off borders nationwide. The weakening of the global economy means conditions have tightened since the Federal Reserve raised US interest rates in December, according to New York Fed president William Dudley. And if such conditions were still in place at the time of its March meeting the Fed would have to take that into consideration, he said. In an interview with MNSI he said the weaker outlook and any further strengthening of the dollar could have \u201cserious consequences\u201d for the health of the US economy. Here are the ADP numbers for the past year: The full report can be found here. Ahead of Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll numbers, the ADP private sector payroll survey has shown stronger than expected growth. US employment increased by 205,000 in January compared to forecasts of a 195,000 rise. The December number was revised up to 267,000 from 257,000. Here\u2019s a minor bright spot from Brazil\u2019s PMIs: GlaxoSmithKline has beaten forecasts for its fourth quarter results, helped by growing demand for new drugs helping to offset falling sales of its Advair respiratory treatment. Sales rose 2% while core earnings per share fell 34% to 18.1p - better than the expected 17.9p. Oil is moving higher again on hopes that an agreement between Opec and Russia to cut production might be moving a step closer. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said if there was consensus among Opec and non-Opec producers to meet \u201cthen we will meet,\u201d according to Reuters. He was speaking at a news conference with Oman foreign minister Yusuf bin Alawi who said there was no agreed time for a meeting \u201cbut it will be soon.\u201d We have been here before of course, but these latest comments have helped push Brent crude 1.8% higher to $33.32 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is back above $30, adding 1.87% to $30.44. As a consequence stock markets have recovered from their lows, with the FTSE 100 now down just 0.3% and France\u2019s Cac off 0.24%. Germany\u2019s Dax is down 1% however, with banks under pressure. Here\u2019s our report on the better than expected UK service sector survey: Speaking of interest rates the Bank of Japan - which caught markets on the hop last week by introducing negative interest rates - said earlier there were no limits to the measures it could take to boost the economy. Reuters reports: Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the central bank has ample room to expand stimulus further and is prepared to cut interest rates deeper into negative territory, signalling a readiness to act again to hit his ambitious inflation target. Even after deploying what he described as \u201cthe most powerful monetary policy framework in the history of modern central banking,\u201d Kuroda said he remained open to devising new means to revive the economy if existing tools did not work. \u201cIf we judge that existing measures in the toolkit are not enough to achieve (our) goal, what we have to do is to devise new tools,\u201dKuroda said in a speech at a seminar on Wednesday. \u201cI am convinced that there is no limit to measures for monetary easing,\u201d he said. The BOJ chief said although Japan\u2019s economy was recovering moderately, it was taking longer than expected to achieve his 2 percent inflation target due to slumping energy costs. While offering few clues on the trigger for further monetary easing, Kuroda said the recent global markets rout and slowing emerging economies could hurt Japanese business sentiment and discourage firms from boosting wages. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is how (such external risks) could affect confidence,\u201d he said. The Bank of England\u2019s latest interest rate decision is due on Thursday and, despite a slightly better than expected UK services PMI, no one expects any change at the meeting. Even if the pound is moving higher on the back of the figures, it is probably also being influenced by the prospects of Brexit as the referendum looms. Many economists have doubts about whether the Bank will raise rates at all in 2016. Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight said: There can be absolutely no doubt that the Bank of England will keep interest rates down at 0.50% again on Thursday at the conclusion of the February Monetary Policy Committee meeting. Whether the Bank of England acts on interest rates at all in 2016 currently looks touch and go. There will most likely be an 8-1 vote again within the MPC for interest rates staying at 0.50%, as there has been repeatedly since last August. While there may well be some speculation that [MPC member Ian] McCafferty could step back from voting for an interest rate hike at the February meeting, we suspect he will stick doggedly to his call Governor Mark Carney\u2019s recent high profile speech indicated that UK growth and inflation since last summer has been weaker than the Bank of England had expected, and the conditions are not in place for an interest rate hike. His speech fuelled the view that the Bank of England could sit tight on interest rates through 2016. Mr. Carney indicated to a Treasury Committee that this is his personal view, so the analysis and forecasts contained in the Quarterly Inflation Report, as well as in the February MPC minutes, will offer insights as to what extent Mr. Carney\u2019s views are shared by the rest of the MPC. While the near-term UK growth and consumer price inflation outlook has weakened, of key importance will be has the Bank of England become more downbeat about the longer-term outlook? Heading into Thursday\u2019s events, we just about believe that one interest rate hike from 0.50% to 0.75% is more likely than not before the end of 2016 \u2013 with November the most likely candidate for action. However, there is clearly a very real possibility that the bank will sit tight until 2017. Our assumption of a November interest rate hike is based on our belief that economic growth will become more solid later on in 2016, earnings growth picks up anew amid a tightening labour market and consumer price inflation trends gradually up. But there are appreciable uncertainties and downside risks to this outlook \u2013 not least the outcome of the UK referendum on EU membership, which currently looks like it could take place in June. Further out we expect the Bank of England to only lift interest rates to 1.50% by end-2017 and 2.25% by end-2018. Back with the UK services PMI, and economist Daniel Vernazza at UniCredit Research said the numbers were positive, but talk of economic growth of 0.6% in the first quarter could be a little ambitious: It\u2019s a reassuring number, particularly given the heightened financial market volatility in January that likely adversely impacted the banking and finance sector. Moreover, the more forward-looking new orders and employment indices both accelerated and lie above their long-run average. This resilience in services sector demand is reflected in wider margins, as output price inflation edged up despite a fall in input price inflation. The composite PMI (the weighted average of the services, manufacturing and construction PMIs) rose to a 6-month high and is consistent with quarterly GDP growth of around 0.6% at the turn of the year. However, this is inflated by a surge in the manufacturing output PMI in January that is highly unlikely to last. We continue to expect growth to slow modestly to 0.4% quarter on quarter in the first quarter of 2016, down from 0.5% quarter on quarter in the fourth quarter of 2015, as the UK faces a number of headwinds ahead, not least the referendum on the UK\u2019s membership of the EU that now looks likely to take place in June. Christmas shoppers snapping up food, drinks and tobacco helped push eurozone retail sales up by 0.3% in December compared with November, in line with expectations. Year on year, eurozone retail sales climbed 1.4%, slightly less than the forecast 1.5%, according to Eurostat. In the 28 member European Union, sales rose 0.1% month on month and by 2% year on year. Sterling has reached a three week high of $1.4449 after the stronger than expected services data. The service sector survey suggests the UK economy could grow by around 0.6% in the first quarter, up from the estimated 0.5% in the final quarter of 2015, said Markit Despite the global economic jitters and the floods and storms in the country, the UK services sector unexpectedly grew in January. The Markit/CIPS services purchasing managers index came in at 55.6 last month, up slightly from 55.5 in December and better than the expected dip to 55.3. The stronger than forecast figures come ahead of the latest Bank of England rate decision on Thursday, albeit most economists expect rates to remain on hold for some time yet. And the survey showed companies are concerned about the risks to growth, not least the forthcoming EU referendum. Markit economist Chris Williamson said: The economy defied expectations and picked up speed in January, but cracks continue to appear in the country\u2019s resilience to the various headwinds... Despite the uptick in growth, the increased uncertainty about the outlook and persistent lack of inflationary pressures means the majority of [Bank of England] policymakers will no doubt be more worried about avoiding another downturn than whether the economy needs higher interest rates. The eurozone PMI figures add to the evidence for the European Central Bank to take more stimulus measures at its March meeting, says Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight: The slowdown in services expansion to a 12-month low in January will raise concern that heightened global economic uncertainty and financial market turmoil are weighing down on a reasonably decent but hardly robust Eurozone cyclical upturn. Indeed, with the corresponding manufacturing survey also showing some loss of momentum in January, the purchasing managers\u2019 composite manufacturing and services output index for the Eurozone dipped to a 4-month low of 53.6 in January from 54.3 in December. January\u2019s reading of 53.6 was also below the average of 54.1 seen in the fourth quarter of 2015, which was actually the best quarterly average since the second quarter of 2011; however it was still comfortably above the 50.0 level that indicates flat activity. While there are clearly heightened downside risks to the Eurozone growth outlook from global economic and geopolitical events (which could increasingly weigh down on confidence in the Eurozone as well as hampering exports), for the time being at least we are maintaining our forecast that Eurozone GDP growth will improve to 1.7% in 2016 from an estimated 1.5% in 2015. Appreciable support to Eurozone growth is coming from very low oil and commodity prices, a competitive euro and ECB stimulus (that looks like it will be extended in March). The influx of refugees should also provide overall help to Eurozone growth in 2016, primarily through increased public expenditure. There are also more growth orientated fiscal policies in some countries. Meanwhile, lower unemployment across the Eurozone is supportive to consumer spending along with the boost to purchasing power coming from negligible inflation, although the number of jobless remains relatively high. Meanwhile, the January services and manufacturing PMIs showing slower expansion and deeper overall cuts in prices charged support the case for the ECB to deliver more stimulus at its 10 March policy meeting. China has set a target range for economic growth in 2016, and it is slightly below last year\u2019s objective following the target being missed last year. Bloomberg reports: China set an economic growth target range of 6.5 percent to 7 percent for this year, slower than the objective of about 7 percent in 2015, the head of the country\u2019s top economic planner said. While downward pressure on the economy is \u201crelatively big\u201d in the first quarter, China has the ability to realize such a goal, National Development and Reform Commission Chairman Xu Shaoshi said Wednesday at briefing in Beijing. The country also plans to take steps to curb excess industrial capacity and deal with unprofitable \u201czombie companies,\u201d Xu said. China has many policy tools to deploy, and the central bank\u2019s recent cut to minimum down payments for first time home buyers will help reduce excess housing stock, Xu said. Growth last year slowed to 6.9 percent, the slowest annual pace in a quarter century. President Xi Jinping has said gross domestic product gains in the next five years should average at least 6.5 percent per year to realize the goal of doubling 2010 gross domestic product and per capita income by 2020. Some people are hard to please: Germany\u2019s service sector grew more slowly than expected in January. The Markit services PMI stood at 55 last month, compared to an initial reading of 55.4 and the 56 level seen in December. Markit economist Oliver Kolodseike told Reuters: German service providers remained in expansion mode at the start of 2016. Although output rose to the smallest extent in three months, the underlying rate of growth was robust overall, helped by a further sharp rise in new business. The German composite PMI - which tracks activity in both the manufacturing and services sector - came in at 54.5, in line with earlier estimates but down on December\u2019s 55.5. In France, the service sector returned to growth in January but still showed the effects of the terror attacks in Paris in November. The Markit services PMI rose from 49.8 in December to 50.3, slightly down on a preliminary reading of 50.6. But the increase means the sector moved above the 50 level which indicates growth rather than contraction. The hotel and restaurant sector reported continued weakness in the wake of the Paris attacks, said Markit. Overall the eurozone service and composite PMIs came in much as expected: More on the Italian and Spanish PMIs: Here\u2019s our report on the Syngenta deal. Sean Farrell writes: China National Chemical has offered to buy Syngenta, the Swiss pesticide maker, for more than $43bn (\u00a330bn) in what will be the biggest takeover by a Chinese company. ChemChina, as the state-owned company is known, has courted Syngenta, the world\u2019s largest agribusiness company, since November when it had a proposed $42bn offer rebuffed. The cash takeover, which Syngenta\u2019s board will recommend to shareholders, will heighten the shakeup in the agrochemicals industry after Dow Chemical and DuPont agreed to combine to create a company valued at more than $100bn. The deal, if completed, will make ChemChina, led by its ambitious chairman Ren Jianxin, the world\u2019s biggest producer of pesticides and agrochemicals. It will also support the ambitions of China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, to increase output and keep China self sufficient in food production as its growing middle class eats more meat and farmland is turned into housing and golf courses. Full story here: Italy\u2019s service sector also grew in January - for the eleventh month in a row - but at a slower pace than in December. The Markit services PMI dropped to 53.6 in January from 55.3 the previous month, a bigger fall than expected. Analysts had forecast a figure of 54 for January. Here\u2019s Japan\u2019s services numbers from earlier: Despite the raft of service sector data emerging today, Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct says the most important numbers of the day could be the US ADP jobs figures, ahead of the non-farm payroll data on Friday: The key point on the economic calendar today may well be the ADP payroll figures from across the Atlantic. These are something of a curtain raiser ahead of Friday\u2019s non-farm payrolls and with the US having printed a slew of downbeat data in recent weeks, there\u2019s concern that the Federal Reserve may have moved too quickly with that first rate hike \u2013 today\u2019s number could well be the canary in the coal mine here. The ADP report, which measures private sector payrolls, is expected to show an increase of 190,000, down from December\u2019s bumper figure of 257,000. Spain\u2019s service sector saw a slowdown in growth in January. Markit\u2019s services purchasing managers index came in at 54.6 in January, down from 55.1 in the previous month and the slowest growth rate since December 2014. In early trading, European markets have - as expected - edged lower. The FTSE 100 has fallen 15 points or 0.27% while Germany\u2019s Dax opened down 0.4% and France\u2019s Cac is 0.1% lower. On PMI services day, we\u2019ve already had the Irish data, and it looks positive. The Investec services purchasing managers\u2019 index rose to 64 in January from 61.8 in December. Philip O\u2019Sullivan, chief economist at Investec Ireland, said: Taken together with Monday\u2019s Manufacturing PMI report, this week\u2019s surveys suggest that the strong momentum evident across the Irish economy in 2015 has continued into the New Year. The composite PMI - which measures both manufacturing and services - also moved higher. There may be worries about the state of the Chinese economy but that has not stopped one of its state owned companies making the country\u2019s largest overseas acquisition by a Chinese firm. ChemChina is making an agreed $43bn offer for Swiss seeds and pesticides group Syngenta. Last year US rival Monsanto made an unsuccessful attempt to buy Syngenta. Ahead of what is expected to be another bearish start on the European markets, Mic Mills at Capital Index said: An uneasy Asian session dismissed the surprisingly strong Caixin/Markit Services PMI and HSBC China Composite PMI figures from China overnight as crude oil remained centre stage, with worries of oversupply sending WTI futures back below $30 a barrel. After trading down to last week\u2019s levels of 17070 the Nikkei did manage to claw back some ground...Gold was the biggest winner trading up to 3 month highs as investors seek a safe haven. European markets look set to suffer a weaker open... yesterday\u2019s better than expected employment figures [were] unable to lift the gloom as the continuing glut in oil and fears of a global slowdown seem to outweigh any good news.... Whether decent performances in [the service sector] numbers can help the markets remains a doubt. Mike van Dulken and Augustin Eden at Accendo Markets said the downbeat mood comes despite the better than expected Chinese services data, as well as comments from the Bank of Japan suggesting there was room for more stimulus in the shape of QE or more negative interest rates. European markets are expected to drop back again at the open: Oil prices seem a little more stable after the recent falls. Brent crude is down 0.12% at $32.68 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is up 0.1% at $29.91. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling overage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Stock markets continue to come under pressure on renewed fears of a global economic slowdown and a renewed fall in oil prices. Overnight Asian markets have followed a slump on Wall Street as US crude dipped under $30 a barrel again. The Hang Seng ended down 2.9% and the Nikkei is 3.1%. In China, the CSI300 index of the largest listed companies lost 0.43% , while the Shanghai Composite closed down 0.35%. These falls came despite moves by the Chinese government to boost the property market, with a reduction in the minimum deposit for first and second-time home buyers. The day sees a whole raft of service sector data, and China is first out of the blocks. The Caixin services PMI came in at 52.4 in January, up from 50.2 in the previous month. This is the highest since July 2015, but did little to support the markets. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The weak December reading of 50.2 in stark contrast to the much more bullish official measure had spooked concerns that Chinese consumers were reining back spending in the lead up to Chinese New Year. This morning\u2019s January reading came in at 52.4 a significant improvement on the previous month and in the process rather undermining the argument that concerns about a Chinese slowdown are the primary factors behind the recent bout of equity market jitters. The services sector has been the more resilient of the two main sectors of the global economy over the past few months but there has been a concern that the weakness in manufacturing could cause some ripple out effects into the broader economy, as job losses in manufacturing dent consumer spending and cause a slowdown in the wider economy. The latest services PMI numbers for January from Spain, Italy, France and Germany are broadly expected to remain fairly robust at 54.6, 54.2, 50.6 and 55.4 respectively. The French economy is a particular concern but that isn\u2019t really too much of a surprise given recent events and the fact that the state of emergency is still in place. In the UK, the PMI is expected to come in at around 55.3 but could be lower given the recent floods and severe weather. Here\u2019s the day\u2019s main economic events: 8.45 (GMT) Italian services and composite PMI 8.50 French services and composite PMI 8.55 German services and composite PMI 9.00 Eurozone services and composite PMI 9.30 UK official reserves 9.30 UK services and composite PMI 10.00 Eurozone retail sales 13.15 US ADP employment data 14.45 US Markit services and composite PMI 15.00 ISM non-manufacturing index",

He also cautioned against repeating the mistakes of the past, when rate rises had come as a shock to indebted households and businesses, and said he wanted to send a clear message to households. \u201cWe are trying to inform the markets, and most importantly households and businesses in this country, what\u2019s likely to happen on rates,\u201d Carney said. \u201cIt is helpful, in my opinion, for households and businesses to recognise that it\u2019s more likely than not that rates are going to go up and to plan their affairs accordingly, particularly since while there\u2019s been tremendous progress \u2013 British households have done a great job in paying down debt \u2013 they are still relatively indebted.\u201d The comments come after Carney was forced to row back on a suggestion made last summer that a decision on starting to raise interest rates would \u201ccome into sharper relief\u201d around now. On Thursday, he insisted he would not allow the Bank to \u201ctie our hands\u201d with guidance. The tone of the Bank\u2019s latest outlook for the economy suggested that policymakers would be in no hurry to raise rates. Economists do not expect a move until the end of this year, according to a Reuters poll before Thursday\u2019s update from the Bank. Financial markets are not pricing in a rise for another two years. After a tumultuous start to the year on financial markets thanks to jitters over China\u2019s economic slowdown, the Bank predicted that emerging economies were likely to grow more slowly than in recent years and that global growth would be \u201conly modest\u201d. But Carney said the UK was well placed to cope with global headwinds thanks to high employment, strong domestic demand and a better capitalised banking sector. \u201cAs one of the most open economies in the world, the UK cannot help but be affected by an unforgiving global environment and sustained financial market turbulence,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, our prospects for a continued solid expansion are underpinned by the resilience built over the past seven years.\u201d The governor\u2019s remarks came alongside the Bank\u2019s quarterly deluge of documents, including minutes from the latest interest rate decision and the inflation report with forecasts for the economy. The pound initially weakened against the euro and the US dollar as those minutes revealed that policymaker Ian McCafferty dropped his recent backing for a rate rise. He had voted against the eight other members of the monetary policy committee since last August, but this month agreed with his colleagues that it was too soon to raise interest rates. Sterling later bounced back as traders digested Carney\u2019s message that interest rates were more likely to rise than fall. The Bank softened its outlook for inflation, which has been close to zero for a year as global commodity prices have tumbled. At 0.2% in December, it was well below the Bank\u2019s target of 2%, measured on the consumer prices index (CPI). \u201cThe scale of recent commodity price falls means that CPI inflation is likely to remain below 1% until the end of the year,\u201d the inflation report (pdf) said. One of the key factors behind McCafferty\u2019s change of heart and the Bank\u2019s softer inflation forecasts was lacklustre wage growth. That had come in weaker than the MPC had been expecting and policymakers were cautious about predicting any significant pick-up over the coming months. They noted signs that wage negotiations were being affected by low inflation, with employers perhaps less generous and workers being less demanding given that they were enjoying a boost to household budgets from cheaper fuel and food. As headline inflation picked up, nominal wage growth would \u201cin all likelihood\u201d increase. However, the MPC said there were downside risks to such a view. On the outlook for economic growth, the Bank repeatedly used the word \u201cresilient\u201d with regard to household and business spending. But the MPC cut its forecasts and now expects GDP growth of 2.2% this year, down from 2.5% previously. The outlook for 2017 growth was cut to 2.4% from 2.7%.",

                "bodyText":"One last thing...The London stock market outperformed its French and German rivals today, to finish 61 points higher, or 1%, at 5898. Mining shares led the way, with Anglo American surging by 19%, Glencore gaining 15% and Antofagasta jumping by 14%. That followed the sudden weakening in the US dollar, as Wall Street and the City anticipated that US interest rates would not rise much this year, given recent weak data. A cheaper dollar pushes up commodity prices, while looser monetary policy should be good for growth. Welcome news for miners, who had a torrid 2015. Mining stocks have also been heavily shorted by hedge funds, so those bears will have been squeezed by the rising share prices. Good night. GW A late PS... Larry Elliott, our economics editor, has summed up the message from the Bank of England today. Here\u2019s his conclusion: There are three conclusions to be drawn from the inflation report, the minutes and the governor\u2019s letter. The first is that it would now be a major surprise if interest rates rose this year. The second is that the Bank\u2019s credibility has been dented by its failure to call the economy right and the confused messages it has been sending out to the public. Finally, the prospect of 0.5% interest rates extending into an eighth and perhaps a ninth year risks stoking up a housing boom. The Bank has so-called macroprudential tools that can be deployed to cool down the property market without damaging the rest of the economy. It is going to need them. And finally, a couple of photos from today\u2019s press conference just landed: Ouch. The latest economic data from America is a reminder of why the Bank of England is worried about the global economy. US factory orders shrank by 2.9% in December, according to new data - the biggest drop since the end of 2014. Being criticised by journalists is an occupational hazard in central banking, but Mark Carney doesn\u2019t appear to enjoy it. So he may not particularly like this analysis of today\u2019s inflation report, from Sky News\u2019s Ed Conway. Mr Carney\u2019s problem is that every time he makes a big forecast he seems to get it wrong. When he came into office, the Governor brought with him a whizzy new framework for setting UK interest rates. Under \u201cforward guidance\u201d, he would provide clarity about borrowing costs. He promised, based on the Bank\u2019s forecasts, that he and the Monetary Policy Committee would start to consider lifting them only when unemployment dropped beneath 7%. Suddenly, within a few months, the jobless rate, hitherto stuck stubbornly above that level, started to come down. Within a year, forward guidance had to be dropped, replaced with a far more vague set of promises some nicknamed \u201cfuzzy guidance\u201d. Not to be deterred, Mr Carney started to drop hints about when the first rise in rates would come. In a speech at the Mansion House in 2014 he signalled that rates would go up sooner than markets expected (which meant within a year). That was wrong. Last summer he predicted the decision to raise rates would come into sharper relief \u201cat the turn of the year\u201d. That was wrong. Well, unless you\u2019re being very literal indeed and think it could also entail not raising rates. The one prediction he has stuck to that had, up until now, looked pretty uncontroversial was that the next move in rates would be up rather than down. But, in the past few weeks even that has now come into question.... More here: The Independent\u2019s Ben Chu flags up one curious moment in today\u2019s press conference: That\u2019s a bit odd, as you might expect inflation to take off sharpish once spare capacity in the labour market has been sucked up. As, indeed, a former Bank deputy governor pointed out: Today was dubbed \u201cSuper Thursday\u201d, but it was more like \u201cParty pooper Thursday\u201d as the Bank of England cut its growth forecasts. Savers, who might wonder when they might get a higher interest rate, won\u2019t be feeling particularly super, either. Rohan Sivajoti, advisory services director at financial advisor eVestor, says: \u201cWith a unanimous vote to keep interest rates unchanged, a mediocre global economic outlook and growing deflation fears, \u2018Super Thursday\u2019 has proved to be anything but. \u201cBeleaguered savers, who yet again will be inwardly groaning at the news, may also be resigned to the fact that they have limited options at present. However, now more than ever, savers need to make their investments work harder for them. Those looking to secure their financial future, should review deposits and options for investments and look at reducing debt while it is still relatively cheap to do so.\u201d There was quite a contrast between Mark Carney\u2019s performance at the press conference, and the minutes of this week\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee meeting released at noon. Kallum Pickering, senior UK economist at Berenberg Bank, says the MPC are clearly worried. The MPC cautioned on risk from financial market volatility, slowing global growth and now the EU referendum. The committee noted that since the previous report other central banks including the European Central Bank had eased further, oil prices had fallen and financial market volatility had risen. This was linked to developments in China and other emerging markets and had \u2018coloured\u2019 the outlook for the global economy Stephanie Flanders, JP Morgan\u2019s chief market strategist for Europe (and former BBC economics editor), says weak wage growth could scupper a rate hike this year. She writes: The bottom line of today\u2019s report is that the UK cannot ignore the weakening of global growth prospects \u2013 particularly the weakness of global trade \u2013 and neither can the Bank of England. But domestic consumption is driving the recovery in the UK and the US and the Bank of England can see little reason to expect domestic consumption to grind to a halt. On balance, we still expect the US Federal Reserve to raise rates again over the course of 2016 as recession worries recede and sentiment in emerging market economics starts to stabilise. In that environment, we would expect the Bank of England also to raise rates by the end of 2016. However, much will depend on domestic wage pressures, which look somewhat weaker now than they did 6 months ago. Whatever happens, the high level of UK household debt \u2013 much of it borrowed on adjustable or semi-adjustable mortgages \u2013 underscores that the rate increases that do happen will be gradual and modest relative to past cycles.\u201c Back in 2014, Mark Carney was labelled the \u201cunreliable boyfriend\u201d for giving mixed messages about possible rate rise timings. Today, it felt like the governor was playing a defensive husband, denying that he ever misled the public while insisting that he\u2019ll still raise rates at the right time. Anyway, a quick recap: The prospects of an early UK interest rate rise have receded, after the Bank of England left borrowing costs at a record low of just 0.5%. The Monetary Policy Committee voted 9-0 to leave rates at 0.5%, with noted hawk Ian McCafferty abandoning his calls for a rise. The BoE has slashed its growth forecasts. It now expects GDP to rise by just 2.2% this year, not 2.5%, as Britain is hit by the weakening global economy. Mark Carney has insisted that interest rates are still more likely to rise, than fall. The governor faced down a sceptical press pack in London, who reminded the governor that his previous forward guidance on the path of interest rises has proved somewhat unreliable. Asked if he sticks to his previous prediction that the next move will be upwards, he declared \u201cAbsolutely. The whole MPC stands by that.\u201d Carney also rejected criticism for telling households recently that interest rates were \u201cmore likely than not\u201d to rise in 2016. He said his original forward guidance, that rates would stay on hold until the economy improved, had given businesses and households confidence. We are not going to tie our hands ever to raise interest rates or adjust policy in any way, shape or form to a certain date.\u201d Governor Carney warned that problems in the global economy could hurt Britain, saying: The outlook for trade is particularly challenging, with net exports expected to drag on UK growth over the forecast period. But he tried to play down the idea that Britain could follow Japan and the Eurozone into imposing negative interest rates. Carney said a rate cut hasn\u2019t even been discussed at this week\u2019s MPC meeting, but the committee does keep its tools under review. And asked about the EU referendum, Carney said the Brexit risk has had some impact on the pound. \u201cThere is not yet a big risk premium built into business and household confidence around the referendum. We do see in th eexchange rate market, and it\u2019s observed in the report, that there has been some buying of protection if you will, around the referendum.\u201d That\u2019s the end of the press conference. The press pack are scrambling back to their newsrooms, and Mark Carney has headed back to his office to keep the monetary wheels in motion. I\u2019ll pull together a summary shortly. Q: Negative interest rates are now in place in Japan, the eurozone, and Switzerland, so are they within the Bank\u2019s toolkit? Carney replies that the bank thinks interest rates are \u201cnot at the lower bound\u201d - in other words, they could be cut further. We will review our toolkit, he continues. But we have not discussed negative rates, as monetary policy is pointing in a different direction. He reminds the reporters that they saw the minutes of this month\u2019s MPC meeting, while they were locked in a room \u201cbeing treated pretty badly and forced to read a bunch of documents\u201d*. Those minutes show that negative interest rates weren\u2019t discussed. You\u2019ll know when they are... [* - don\u2019t worry, they probably get drinks and biscuits too] Another questions about Brexit -- what contingency plans have the BoE taken? Carney declines to reveal any details, but suggests that - like with the 2014 Scottish referendum - the Bank will reveal its homework after the event. Q: Are you worried, governor, that you might go through your entire tenure at the Bank without raising interest rates? Carney insist he\u2019s relaxed about this prospect. He points out that former policymaker David Miles did two terms without raising interest rates, but did plenty of other things such as quantitative easing. The important thing is that we set policy to maximise the changes that we meet our objectives. That\u2019s how we\u2019re going to be judged. Q: How worried is the Bank of England about the global economy? We do see some downside risks, Carney replies. Britain is a particularly open economy, so it\u2019s very vulnerable to global problems. That\u2019s why the Bank of England usually has lower growth forecast than other bodies, such as the IMF. He cites market fears over China, and its knock-on impact on other emerging markets. And monetary policy could tighten more quickly, if those upside risks develop. Q: When does low inflation start to become a worry for the Bank? Carney bats this question over to Ben Broadbent. Broadbent says there\u2019s \u201cno simple level when it becomes an over-riding concern\u201d, but the bank is watching wages closely for signs that inflation is weakening. Now deputy governor Ben Broadbent takes the microphone, insisting that there\u2019s no \u2018mechanical link\u2019 between the UK output gap and any interest rate move. You might remember that the output gap was one measure cited by Mark Carney in 2014, when he took his second stab at setting forward guidance on interest rates. So, it\u2019s still a factor, but don\u2019t expect it to trigger an interest rate hike. We won\u2019t be \u201cbound by past comments\u201d when we decide it\u2019s time to raise interest rates, says Carney. He also denies that his forward guidance, various speeches, and wotnot have caused volatility. Short-term UK interest rates are half as volatile as before he was parachuted into the BoE City experts aren\u2019t very impressed with Mark Carney\u2019s performance, as he tries to talk down the Brexit risk and talk up the chances of an interest rate hike: Our economics editor Larry Elliott asks Carney when the decision about rate rises will come into \u201csharper focus\u201d again. Carney denies that the MPC are looking at monetary policy through bleary eyes. We take a decision at every meeting. This week\u2019s decision was \u201ceasy\u201d, though. Carney gets a question about the European Union referendum. He says the Bank of England isn\u2019t modelling for \u2018parallel universes\u201d, so today\u2019s report doesn\u2019t estimate the impact of Brexit. He argues that there isn\u2019t yet a \u201cbig risk premium\u201d due to the possibility of Britain leaving the EU. However, there has been some impact on the pound as investors seek protection ahead of the referendum. Mark Carney is trying to argue that the financial markets are underpricing the chances of a UK interest rate rise. Paul Diggle, economist at Aberdeen Asset Management, isn\u2019t sure Carney\u2019s message will get through: The Bank did send a signal that they think the market is wrong about when it thinks rates will rise. Investors think the first rate rise won\u2019t come until February 2018 and the Bank has tried to say they should bet on it coming sooner. But the way they send this signal is so opaque \u2013 a couple of graphs buried in chapter 5 of the Inflation Report - it\u2019s not really clear whether anyone will pay attention. Carney\u2019s forward guidance certainly hasn\u2019t paid dividends for investors up until now.\u201d Carney is now warning that there could be more slack in the labour market than first thought. That would mean wage growth might be disappointing (as firms wouldn\u2019t have to fight for workers as much), meaning inflation remains weak. But he also points to the introduction of the national living wage, which should raise inflation a bit. (from April, workers in the UK aged over 25 earning the minimum rate of \u00a36.70 per hour will get a 50p per hour increase). Q: Do you think the public gives your advice as much credibility as it used to, given previous guidance on rates? Carney gives a long answer, defending his original forward guidance (he originally set a 7% jobless rate as a key target before considering a rate rise, only to backtrack when it was achieved sooner than planned). The worst thing we can say about that guidance is that more people went to work earlier - and we\u2019re not going to apologise for that, Carney smiles. And he\u2019s also happy that UK households believe rates may rise this year, as it means they are less likely to risk a credit splurge. Although households have made \u201cgreat progress\u201d, they are still pretty indebted. Carney insists, though, that the MPC will never \u201ctie its hands\u201d to changing monetary policy at a certain time, or at certain events. And in short, we have nothing to explain, he concludes -- a classic central banker\u2019s answer to criticism. Onto questions: Q: Does Mark Carney still believe interest rate are more likely to rise, rather than fall? Absolutely, the governor replies, and so does the monetary policy committee. He reiterates that the market path of rates implies that inflation will overshoot the 2% target in the medium term unless borrowing costs are hiked. Interest rates are more likely than not to rise during the forecast horizon, says Carney. He points to the current \u201cmarket path\u201d for interest rates (where investors expect borrowing costs to be). On that path, inflation will hit its 2% target in the medium term, and then rise higher, meaning higher borrowing costs will be needed. And Carney insists: We\u2019ll do the right thing at the right time, on rates. Katie is tweeting the key points from Carney\u2019s press conference: Carney says the Bank of England expects real incomes in the UK to grow solidly this year, after several lean years. And business investment should also continue to grow strongly. Carney then warns that global financial conditions have deteriorated notably recently, with a \u201cparticularly challenging\u201d outlook for trade. That means Britain\u2019s net exports will continue to drag on growth (ie, we\u2019ll import more than we sell to the rest of the world) The governor of the Bank of England is giving a press conference now, to discuss the quarterly inflation report. Mark Carney begins by saying that the UK economy is in much better shape than in March 2009 when rates were first cut to 0.5%. Seven years ago, the economy was in serious trouble at the height of the financial crisis, and heading into recession. Today, we have sluggish global growth, turbulent financial markets, and a resilient UK economy. And that\u2019s why the Bank still expects the UK economy to keep growing. The prospect of UK interest rates being cut to a new record low is looming over the City: It\u2019s staggering to think that UK interest rates have now been pegged at 0.5% for almost seven years (it started in the dark days of March 2009) Laith Khalaf, Senior Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says we could see a decade of ultra-low rates: \u2018An interest rate rise is like the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, the nearer you get to it, the further away it moves. A rise in rates now looks firmly in the long grass, with growth forecasts cut and cheaper oil putting downward pressure on inflation, which is already way below the Bank of England\u2019s target. Markets are currently pricing in a rate rise in the middle of 2017, though they have been consistently premature in their forecasts, and reaching the dubious milestone of a decade of ultra-low interest rates is now a distinct possibility. The prospect of an early UK interest rate rise has receded into the distance, writes Katie Allen from the Bank of England. She reports: The Bank flagged the recent sharp sell-off in global stock markets and investors\u2019 jitters about a slowdown in China as it revealed that policymaker Ian McCafferty dropped his recent call for a rate rise. He had voted against the eight other members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) since last August but this month agreed with his colleagues that it was too soon to raise interest rates from 0.5%, where they have been for almost seven years. Wage growth has been weaker than the MPC had been expecting and minutes to its latest policy meeting suggested it was cautious about predicting any significant pick-up in pay over coming months. \u201cAgainst that backdrop, all members of the committee thought that maintaining the current stance of policy was appropriate at this meeting,\u201d the minutes said. Here\u2019s Katie\u2019s full story: The pound has fallen almost half a cent against the US dollar, to $1.456. Markets are concluding that interest rates won\u2019t move for some time, given today\u2019s gloomy inflation report and the news that Ian McCafferty has given up calling for a rate hike. The Inflation report is online here, and full of interesting charts if you like that kind of thing. This one shows how the oil price has fallen much further than the Bank expected: And this shows how the markets are already expecting interest rates to stay lower, for longer. This chart shows how the Bank of England has cut its growth forecasts for the next three years (the old forecasts are in brackets after the new ones) And the message from the BoE is that economic conditions have deteriorated over the last quarter: Since the November Report, global output and trade growth have slowed further and the latest data suggest a softer picture for UK activity in 2015 than previously assumed, with four-quarter growth slowing to 2\u00bc% by Q4 on the MPC\u2019s backcast. The Bank of England also points to the turmoil in the financial markets: Developments in financial markets seem in part to reflect greater weight being placed on the risks to the global outlook stemming from China and other emerging economies. The Bank of England has also taken a knife to its growth forecasts, admitting that the UK economy is not expanding as fast as expected. It now expects GDP to rise by just 2.2% this year, down from 2.5% three months ago. And for 2017, it has cut its growth forecast to 2.3%, down from 2.6%. The Bank of England says that economic conditions have deteriorated in the last three since its November quarterly inflation report: Global growth has fallen back further over the past three months, as emerging economies have generally continued to slow and as the US economy has grown by less than expected. There have also been considerable falls in the prices of risky assets and another significant fall in oil prices. The 9-0 vote means that Ian McCafferty has abandoned his calls for interest rates to rise. He had been the lone hawk on the MPC, arguing that borrowing costs should go up now before inflation took hold. But with oil so cheap, and growth weakening around the globe, he\u2019s had a rethink. Breaking: The Bank of England has voted to leave UK interest rates at their current record low of 0.5%. And the decision was unanimous, with the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee voting 9-0 not to alter borrowing costs. We have less than 30 minutes to go until Bank of England announces its interest rate decision, at noon in London. It will also release its latest quarterly inflation report, with new forecasts for growth and inflation. And half an hour after that, Mark Carney will hold a press conference to discuss the report. This is the third \u201cSuper Thursday\u201d -- but frankly, the first two haven\u2019t lived up to this billing, thanks to the lack of pressure to raise interest rates and the mediocre global economic outlook. Alastair McCaig of IG reckons it needs rebanding: How the department overseeing the trade descriptions act have not intervened in the use of the term \u2018Super Thursday\u2019 when the Bank of England posts its inflation report and interest rate decision, is somewhat baffling. Anyway, the smart money is on another \u2018no change\u2019 in interest rates, followed by plenty of questions about the darkening global outlook, deflation fears, and whether Britain could follow Japan and the eurozone into imposing negative interest rates. Ed Conway, writing for Sky News today, points out that borrowing costs could be cut this year. Households should prepare themselves for a possible UK interest rate cut this year, with investors betting that there is now a greater chance that the next move in borrowing costs is down not up. Money markets are now putting a one-in-four probability on the Bank of England reducing its official rates below the 0.5% level they have been sitting at since 2009. It follows a dramatic shift in their expectations for interest rates. For the majority of the post-crisis recovery, markets were betting that 0.5% would be the floor for borrowing costs, which would rise in the coming years. Now they are not pricing in a full increase in Bank rate until August 2018 - two months after Mark Carney\u2019s five year term as Bank Governor is due to end... Back in Brussels, Pierre Moscovici has explained that his latest forecasts don\u2019t factor in the prospect of Britain\u2019s leaving the EU. Why not? Because everyone\u2019s committed to avoiding such an outcome. Moscovici has also defended the EC\u2019s more rosy forecasts for Greece (well, less gloomy, anyway): Shares in London have been lurching around like a well-refreshed journalist leaving The Inkwell after last orders (I imagine). After jumping almost 90 points at the open, the FTSE 100 index slowly subsided until it was only up 20 points, before getting a second wind and romping ahead again. Mining companies are still leading the way, with Anglo American leaping by 11%, BHP Billiton gaining 8% and Antofagasta up 7.5%. It makes for a tricky morning for traders: So why the wild lurches? Investors are trying to decide how much optimism to take from the rally in the oil price, and the sudden weakness in the US dollar. This could mean that the turmoil in the commodity market is reaching a bottom, especially if the US Federal Reserve is backing away from raising American interest rates several times this year. The City is also waiting for the Bank of England to deliver its quarterly inflation report, in an hour\u2019s time. Ilya Spivak, currency strategist, at DailyFX, says markets expect a \u201cdovish outcome\u201d. Traders are currently pricing in a 64% chance that rates remain unchanged over the next year, and a 36% probability that rates are cut to 0.25%, he adds. Commissioner Pierre Moscovici is briefing the media now, about the EC\u2019s new economic forecasts. My colleague Jennifer Rankin is tweeting the key points: I can\u2019t believe *anyone* is euphoric, given the last few years. But do carry on, Pierre... The FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel is also ferreting out some important facts: Despite those headwinds from China and refugees, the European economy is now entering its fourth year of recovery, says the EC. Today\u2019s report states: Growth continues at a moderate rate, driven mainly by consumption. At the same time, much of the world economy is grappling with major challenges and risks to European growth are therefore increasing. A flurry of news is flying our way from Brussels, as the European Commission releases its new economic forecasts. The headline event is that the EC has slashed its forecast for inflation this year to just 0.5%, from 1% three months ago. That\u2019s partly because of the oil price, and also because \u201cwage growth remains subdued\u201d. It has also trimmed its growth forecast for 2016 to 1.7%, down from an earlier forecast of 1.8%. The EC still expects eurozone GDP to rise by 1.9% in 2017, as the slow recovery picks up pace (a little). The Commission blames problems in emerging markets, and also points to the refugee crisis. Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis warns: Europe\u2019s moderate growth is facing increasing headwinds, from slower growth in emerging markets such as China, to weak global trade and geopolitical tensions in Europe\u2019s neighbourhood.\u201d The EC has also revised up its Greek forecasts, saying the economy didn\u2019t actually contract in 2015. It also expects a smaller recession this year. Greece is in the grips of a general strike today as demonstrators renew their protests against the country\u2019s latest bailout deal. Transport links are shut down, shops are closed, and thousands of people are marching through the Greek capital right now. Our Athens correspondent, Helena Smith, reports that the effects are withering. She writes: This is the fifth general strike since the leftist Syriza first came to power but none has been so fully endorsed. In a reflection of the growing anger at all embracing tax and pension reforms, the entire country appears to be paralysed by industrial action supported by every walk of life. In Athens, where almost nothing is open, streets and central boulevards resembled a ghost town this morning with the shutters down on shops, offices and ministerial buildings. Small businesses, which usually turn a blind eye to the pleas of unionists to stay closed, have today heeded their call. \u201cWe have no choice,\u201d said Lakis Antonakis who owns the popular Piazza Duomo caf\u00e9 opposite the capital\u2019s cathedral. \u201cIf they pass these laws more than 50 percent of our earnings will be taxed and I am one of the lucky ones because I can depend on tourists. Other businesses are really struggling. It\u2019s become unsustainable to keep them open. Everyone is very pessimistic.\u201d Unionists, who planned mass protest rallies, attributed the high turn out to the determination of Greeks to ram home the message that they will not accept pension and tax reforms as they now stand. International creditors, led by the IMF, are pushing prime minister Alexis Tsipras for further cuts in pensions to make up for a fiscal shortfall of up to \u20ac4.5bn over the next three years. Grigoris Kalomoiris, of the civil servants union, Adedy, said he also thought Greeks had been encouraged by protesting farmers who have set up roadblocks nationwide. \u201cTheir action over the past two weeks has had a ripple effect. Everything is close even the state audit office,\u201d he told me. \u201cFarmers are leading the way. People are very determined to stop this pillaging because pillaging is what it is. Greece and Greeks cannot go on being pushed like this in the name of debt.\u201d The strike, ironically, has the full support of Syriza \u2013 although government officials, who will soon be called to vote on the reforms, are keeping mum. Apparently the solution to monetary policy paralysis is taller central bank governors: You might have expected the euro to fall this morning, after Mario Draghi guilefully declared that central banks shouldn\u2019t stop taking action to fight deflation. But the single currency didn\u2019t take the hint. Instead, the euro has hit a three-month high against the US dollar, at $1.116. And that\u2019s starting to weigh on European markets, pushing shares down from their earlier highs.... Sales of Volkswagen cars slumped by almost 14% in the UK last month, suggesting that the company is still suffering from the emissions scandal. Just 12,055 VW-branded cars were registered in January, down from 13,993 in January 2015, according to new figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. That cuts VW\u2019s market share to 7.1%, from 8.5%. Other Volkswagen brands also had a bad month. Sales of Seat cars slumped by 25%, from 4,137 to 3,119. This is the fourth month in a row that VW car sales have dropped, following last year\u2019s revelations that it used cheat software to get around emissions tests. Overall, the UK\u2019s new car market got off to a positive start in January, according to the SMMT. Registrations rose by 2.9% compared with the same month in 2015 to reach an 11-year high of 169,678 units. Goldman Sachs has weighed into the Brexit debate, predicting that the pound would slump by around 15% if Britain vote to leave the EU. In a new research note, it argues that investors would be put off from putting capital into the UK if the public reject David Cameron\u2019s new deal. And if the domestic economy also suffered, sterling would come under sustained pressure - due to the country\u2019s current account deficit. Goldman predicts: In our framework, a decline of 2% in domestic demand would still see close to a 15% drop in the British pound to close the current account deficit. Worth remembering that Goldman isn\u2019t completely impartial in this fight. The Bank has apparently given a six-figure donation to the Britain Stronger in Europe campaign, which is fighting against Brexit. European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi has dropped a clear hint that the ECB embark on fresh stimulus measures next month. Speaking in Frankfurt a few minute ago, Draghi insisted that central bankers can\u2019t just stop trying to hit their inflation goals because \u201cglobal disinflation\u201d is dragging prices down. He declared: There are forces in the global economy today that are conspiring to hold inflation down. Those forces might cause inflation to return more slowly to our objective. But there is no reason why they should lead to a permanently lower inflation rate. What matters is that central banks act within their mandates to fulfill their mandates. In the euro area, that might create different challenges than it does in other jurisdictions. But those challenges can be mitigated. They do not justify inaction. The speech is online here. Double ouch: Ouch. Shares in Credit Suisse have tumbled by around 10% in early trading. The Swiss bank is missing out on today\u2019s rally, after hitting shareholders with a loss of 5.83 billion Swiss francs ($5.8 billion) in the last quarter. That drove the bank into its first annual loss since 2008. Credit Suisse took a bigger-than-expected charge to cover restructuring its investment bank,. as new CEO Tidjane Thaim tries to turn the firm around. Thaim was also quite gloomy about the situation today, warning that: Market conditions in January 2016 have remained challenging and we expect markets to remain volatile throughout the remainder of the first quarter of 2016 as macroeconomic issues persist . Oil is continuing to gain ground this morning, adding to last night\u2019s 8% surge. Brent crude has risen to $35.36, up another 1%. European stock markets are a sea of green, as traders welcome the higher oil price and the weaker US dollar. Up we go! European markets are rallying at the start of trading, breaking three days of declines during this volatile week. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares opened 80 points higher, at 5917. That\u2019s a gain of 1.2%, clawing back Wednesday\u2019\u2019s losses. The German, French, Italian and Spanish markets are also up at least 1%. Mining companies are leading the recovery. The weaker US dollar should spur demand for natural resources, as it will take some pressure off emerging markets. And Shell\u2019s shares are rising, despite the company posting an 87% drop in profits this morning. Investors may have feared an even worse performance, given the slump in the oil price. The key to today\u2019s market moves is that the US dollar took an almighty tumble overnight. After strengthening for months, the greenback suffered its biggest one-day drop since 2011. That followed Wednesday\u2019s disappointing US services sector data, which made investors conclude that US interest rates are unlikely to be hiked anytime soon. Perhaps not until 2017? Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says the dollar fell on hopes that the Federal Reserve will \u201creign in its over-egged hawkishness\u201d. This delivered a welcome overshadowing of global growth concerns for markets hooked on cheap money. And this chart puts the dollar\u2019s weakness into some contect: It\u2019s been another day of wild market action in Asia. Most stock markets have surged overnight, on relief that the oil price has climbed back to over $35 per barrel. Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200 index led the way, jumping by 2%, with investors hoping that the commodity crunch may be bottoming out. Only Japan missed out, because the yen gained against the US dollar (bad news for Japanese exporters) From Melbourne, Chris Weston of IG calls it \u201can incredible night of moves in markets\u201d. And the trigger was the oil price, which has gained almost 10% since yesterday afternoon. What we have seen is one of the most amazing one day moves in oil one will ever see, with US and Brent oil rallying 9% and 8% from yesterday\u2019s ASX 200 close. Oil is benefitting from a weaker dollar, rumours that OPEC might pull an emergency meeting to cut production, and suggestions that the selloff has simply gone too far. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s Bank of England Super Thursday -- that time of the quarter when the UK central bank sets interest rates, and also releases its latest inflation report. \u201cSuper\u201d could be pushing it, though. We\u2019re expecting rates to remain unchanged at 0.5% (of course). The BoE will probably also lower its forecasts for growth and inflation, reflecting recent turmoil and rising pessimism about the world economy. Governor Mark Carney will then face the cream of the economic press pack, who will presumably try to get him to admit that interest rates are highly unlikely to rise this year (despite Carney\u2019s recent pronouncements). Might they even be cut to fresh record lows, governor?... Also coming up today... It\u2019s going to be another lively day in the markets. European shares are expected to rally strongly, after three days of falls, and oil is looking perkier too (more on that shortly) European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi is giving a speech in Frankfurt this morning; could that include fresh hints about ECB stimulus in March? In the corporate world, we\u2019re getting results from oil group Shell and mobile network operator Vodafone, among others. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

AstraZeneca\u2019s biotech bets for the future may or may not prove to be good business. We\u2019ll have to wait half a decade to find out. In the meantime, should the company\u2019s pay committee, when judging annual bonuses, adjust for the short-term dilution to earnings? It is allowed to do so, but awards might smell like policymaking on the hoof unless the arithmetic is 100% clear. In AstraZeneca\u2019s case, it would surely be better to scrap annual bonuses altogether. After all, the only target that really matters is Soriot\u2019s ambition to improve annual revenues from $25bn to $45bn by 2023.",

So, I would date the recovery not from 2008 or 2009, but actually from early 2013. And since then we\u2019ve enjoyed three years of pretty solid growth, certainly in the labour market.\u201d",

So the prospect of a rate rise was suddenly back on the agenda, and as a consequence the dollar rose and markets fell.</p> <p>In reality, the outlook for the Fed\u2019s next move is no clearer than before, and as we know, markets hate uncertainty.</p> <p>So Wall Street led the drive lower, with sentiment not helped by a slump in shares of Linkedin after it fell into the red. Europe lost early gains to end the week on a downbeat note. The final scores showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong> The FTSE 100 fell 50.70 points or 0.86% to 5848.06<br></strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.14% to 9286.23</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.66% at 4200.67</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished down 2.13% at 17,250.26</strong></li> <li><strong>But Spain\u2019s Ibex bucked the trend, ending 0.37% higher at 8499.5</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 169 points or just over 1%.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56b4ca42e4b05bd1cd9e5316\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-05T16:15:46.193Z\">4.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>On the market\u2019s negative reaction to the mixed jobs data, David Morrison of Spreadco said investors needed guidance from the US Federal Reserve:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[It was] a bad number on the face of it suggesting that the Fed is less likely to be in any rush to raise rates further at its March meeting, or even for the rest of 2016. If that\u2019s the case then one would\u2019ve expected the dollar to fall, precious metals to build on recent gains and equities to rally.</p> <p>But two hours after the event and with all the US markets fully open that wasn\u2019t what we were seeing. The dollar was up; gold and silver were slipping and what began as a modest pull-back on the major US stock indices was beginning to gather downside momentum. What\u2019s going on?</p> <p>Well, as is often the case the devil was in the detail. The Unemployment Rate fell to 4.9% - its lowest level since the first quarter of 2008. Average Hourly Wages rose 0.5% month-on-month (well above the +0.25 expected) and up a total of 2.5% from the same time last year. This presents a problem for the US central bank and that is what worries investors.</p> <p>Of course, it could be that everything flips round by the time we close tonight. But I can\u2019t help thinking that investors are desperate to get some guidance from the Fed. Without that, they will continue to unwind positions and lighten up on risk.

A lot of workers have substituted good jobs for poor jobs or aren\u2019t working at all which is why the labor participating rate continues to hold. I think the real problem is a lack of consumer confidence that we\u2019re going to come out of this, the economy can recover or we can fall back into a recession.

Even though Non-Farm Payroll is notoriously unpredictable, and regularly revised, it will still set the mood in the markets - possibly for some time.</p> <p>So, what should we watch for?</p> <p><strong>1) The first question is how many new jobs were created in January?</strong> The consensus figure is that the NFP rose by 190,000. That would be a slowdown on December\u2019s 292,000 (which could be revised), but not a disaster.</p> <p>However, Wall Street economists are quite divided - <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> and <strong>Bank of America Merrill Lynch</strong> have predicted 170,000 new jobs, while French bank <strong>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</strong> is optimistically expecting 245,000.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RANsquawk/status/695565665269366784\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"ht\" dir=\"ltr\">US <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFP?src=hash\">#NFP</a> Guesses<br><br>SocGen 245k<br>BarCap/Citi 225k<br>HSBC 214k <br>JP AM 209k <br><br>Exp/CS/UBS 190k<br><br>MS 180k<br>Wells 178k<br>DB/JP Chase 175k<br>GS/BofAML 170k</p>&mdash; RANsquawk (@RANsquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RANsquawk/status/695565665269366784\">February 5, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><strong>2) Wage growth is also important.</strong> The Fed is unlikely to raise rates again until it sees decent earnings growth. Economists predict that wages probably increased 2.2% annually, or 0.3% month-on-month. Not too impressive, if so.</p> <p><strong>3) Where were the jobs created?</strong> The report could show that the energy industry kept slashing staff, in response to the fall in the oil price. But how are manufacturers faring?

                "bodyText":"Citigroup is the latest big bank to say that Britain\u2019s economic growth and the pound would be hit if it leaves the European Union. Citi said Brexit could knock up to 4 percentage points off economic growth over the next four years, and the pound could fall by 15% to 20%. The bank\u2019s Michael Saunders said, \u201cBrexit would probably trigger major economic weakness and a political crisis in the UK...with a 15-20 per cent depreciation of sterling in trade weighted terms, resultant return to import driven inflation and a major policy dilemma.\u201d The warning follows something similar from Goldman Sachs. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the day, and indeed the week. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back again on Monday. Over in Greece, thousands of police men (backed up by firemen and coastguard officials) are marching through Athens chanting \u201cwe save lives, don\u2019t drown ours \u201c in reference to pension cuts, writes Helena Smith. All are in uniform. They\u2019re protesting pension funds being amalgamated and demanding that they be excluded from planned reforms by virtue of the sensitivity of their jobs. Protestors have descended on the capital from all over Greece, including the southern Aegean, site of mass refugee arrivals. The union of police employees from Trikala are participating with a banner that reads: \u201cNo to the measures of death. Stop the cuts.\u201d The initial reaction to the US jobs numbers, which showed a weaker than expected rise of 151,000 in non-farm payrolls, was that a US rate rise was therefore off the table in the immediate future. But as the afternoon wore on, investors began to concentrate on the rise in average earnings and the fact that the jobless rate was at an eight year low. So the prospect of a rate rise was suddenly back on the agenda, and as a consequence the dollar rose and markets fell. In reality, the outlook for the Fed\u2019s next move is no clearer than before, and as we know, markets hate uncertainty. So Wall Street led the drive lower, with sentiment not helped by a slump in shares of Linkedin after it fell into the red. Europe lost early gains to end the week on a downbeat note. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 50.70 points or 0.86% to 5848.06 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.14% to 9286.23 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.66% at 4200.67 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished down 2.13% at 17,250.26 But Spain\u2019s Ibex bucked the trend, ending 0.37% higher at 8499.5 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 169 points or just over 1%. On the market\u2019s negative reaction to the mixed jobs data, David Morrison of Spreadco said investors needed guidance from the US Federal Reserve: [It was] a bad number on the face of it suggesting that the Fed is less likely to be in any rush to raise rates further at its March meeting, or even for the rest of 2016. If that\u2019s the case then one would\u2019ve expected the dollar to fall, precious metals to build on recent gains and equities to rally. But two hours after the event and with all the US markets fully open that wasn\u2019t what we were seeing. The dollar was up; gold and silver were slipping and what began as a modest pull-back on the major US stock indices was beginning to gather downside momentum. What\u2019s going on? Well, as is often the case the devil was in the detail. The Unemployment Rate fell to 4.9% - its lowest level since the first quarter of 2008. Average Hourly Wages rose 0.5% month-on-month (well above the +0.25 expected) and up a total of 2.5% from the same time last year. This presents a problem for the US central bank and that is what worries investors. Of course, it could be that everything flips round by the time we close tonight. But I can\u2019t help thinking that investors are desperate to get some guidance from the Fed. Without that, they will continue to unwind positions and lighten up on risk. Expect further volatility. Markets are extending their losses as investors look to the rise in US average earnings and conclude that perhaps there will be more rate rises from the Federal Reserve this year after all. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down 150 points or 0.9%, while in Europe the FTSE 100 has fallen 20 points and Germany\u2019s Dax is down 34 points. The dollar - which has been weak all week - has also recovered some ground after the figures. The dollar index is currently up 0.6% to 97.07 after hitting a 15 week low on Thursday. US investors are also nervous after a slump in the shares of Linkedin after the company fell into the red, which has weighed on other tech companies. Something a bit lighter on non-farms day: Back with the US jobs data, and the weaker than expected headline figure adds to the feeling the Federal Reserve erred in raising interest rates in December, says Larry Elliott: Hindsight is a wonderful thing. It\u2019s easy to be wise after the event and say a decision was a mistake. But it\u2019s hard to imagine that the Federal Reserve would have raised interest rates in December had it known then what it knows now. News that employment growth as measured by the increase in non-farm payrolls was up by 151,000 is just the latest piece of evidence to suggest that the US economy is going through a tough period. Growth in the fourth quarter was weak, sales of durable goods suggest that businesses are reluctant to invest, and consumers are saving rather than spending the windfall from lower oil prices. Even so, Janet Yellen, chairman of the Fed, is not going to hit the panic button and reverse December\u2019s increase \u2013 at least not yet. There are two reasons for that: a U-turn would be a considerable blow to the central bank\u2019s reputation; and the Fed will want to see more evidence before it decides that the world\u2019s biggest economy is heading for a recession rather than simply going through a temporary soft patch. Larry\u2019s full analysis is here: The European Commission has said that it accepts the Portuguese budget after some changes, but it is still at risk of non-compliance with EU rules. It will assess the budget again in the spring. It said: The European Commission considers that the Portuguese government\u2019s 2016 Draft Budgetary Plan is at risk of non-compliance with the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact. In its Opinion adopted today, the Commission therefore invites the authorities to take the necessary measures within the national budgetary process to ensure that the 2016 budget will be compliant with the Stability and Growth Pact. Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis, responsible for the Euro and Social Dialogue, said: \u201c...The Portuguese Government is invited to take the necessary steps to ensure that the 2016 budget is compliant. In spring, the Commission will reassess Portugal\u2019s compliance with its obligations under the Stability and Growth Pact, including under the Excessive Deficit Procedure.\u201d The full statement is here: European Commission adopts Opinion on Portugal\u2019s 2016 Draft Budgetary Plan We mentioned earlier that the European Commission was meeting to discuss Portugal\u2019s anti-austerity budget, and could reject it. Well, perhaps not entirely. The non-farm figures, although the headline number was lower than expected, still suggest further US rate rises this year, according to UniCredit chief economist Harm Bandholz: The [jobs] report unequivocally supports the Federal Reserve\u2019s (and our) baseline view that further gradual rate hikes are warranted. After all, ongoing labor market dynamics are the main driver of consumer spending, which in turn is the main driver of economic growth in the US. A falling unemployment rate and faster wage gains also mean that the Fed is getting closer to meet both of its mandates. That said, many Fed officials have in recent weeks highlighted the unusual uncertainty about the outlook, and stressed that they need to see evidence that global headwinds and tighter financial conditions do not affect the US economy. So while this report is undoubtedly a step in the right direction, the FOMC wants to see more of these signs before pulling the trigger again. And here are the odds on a hike: Following the mixed US employment figures, the US market is slipping back in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down around 30 points or 0.16% while the S&amp;P slipped 0.2% and the Nasdaq fell 0.4% at the open. European markets are off their best levels, with the FTSE 100 now up just 7 points after earlier climbing nearly 50 points. Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac are also up just 20 and 14 points respectively. Brent crude has dipped 0.6% to $34.25 a barrel. So, fewer US rate cuts this year than previously forecast perhaps. More reaction to the non-farm numbers. And here\u2019s a gloomy one from Gary Chaison, Professor of Industrial Relations at Clark University: There is no joy in this month\u2019s jobs report and no sign that things have turned around. The recovery isn\u2019t happening, it isn\u2019t expanding and the labor participation rate is holding. While wages are up a bit, it isn\u2019t enough to make an impact. A lot of workers have substituted good jobs for poor jobs or aren\u2019t working at all which is why the labor participating rate continues to hold. I think the real problem is a lack of consumer confidence that we\u2019re going to come out of this, the economy can recover or we can fall back into a recession. For the huge recession we had, we should be seeing a huge recovery and this is impacting the voters and public in general. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: Signs of a slowdown in hiring, still-weak annual pay growth and disappointing survey data, all pitched alongside an adverse financial market environment so far this year, reduce the odds of the Fed hiking rates again in March. \u201cThe unemployment rate fell to an eight-year low of 4.9% as the economy added 151,000 jobs in January, according to official estimates, signalling a marked slowing in the rate of job creation after the surge seen late last year. However, this is still a robust rate of employment growth, and a trend strong enough to keep bringing unemployment down. Furthermore, December\u2019s numbers had in part reflected stronger than usual construction sector hiring due to unseasonably warm weather... It would therefore not be surprising if Fed policymakers decided to await clear signs of an upturn in the economic data flow and easing of financial conditions before committing to more tightening. Some commentators have concluded January\u2019s Non-Farm Payroll was good, apart from the bad bits. Others reckon it was a bad report, apart from the good bits. So on balance, it\u2019s probably OK. There are around 6 million Americans stuck in part-time jobs who want to work full time, down from around 6.8 million a year ago. Today\u2019s report says: These individuals, who would have preferred full-time employment, were working part time because their hours had been cut back or because they were unable to find full-time jobs. And that\u2019s despite a steady-pickup in full-time job creation since 2011. Mixed but not too bad, is the verdict of Rob Carnell at ING on the non-farm numbers, with a March rise in US interest rates now very unlikely: The January labour market survey was very mixed, though the headline payrolls figure was on the soft side, at only 151,000, with downward revisions to the previous months data (262,000 down from 292,000). But aside from this, the report wasn\u2019t all that bad. The household survey registered an eye-popping and rather improbable 615,000 increase, which added to the 485,000 gain in December suggests more than 1.1 million jobs were created in the last two months. That takes some swallowing, but helped to push the unemployment rate down a further notch to 4.9%. But adding to the sense that this is a mixed, rather than bad reading, both hours worked and average earnings also came in on the stronger side, with some upwards revisions on the wages side. It is difficult to see exactly what the Fed will make of this. But with global financial conditions tightening, this release says \u201cmore data needed\u201d before drawing any firm conclusions about any shift in Fed policy. That does at least suggest that a March hike remains off the table. And hopefully by then, we will have a better idea of whether things are really slowing, with no further hikes possible, or whether recent data were just a soft patch and the Fed can resume tightening later in the year. Several industries took on more staff last month, says the Bureau of Labour Statistics. Here\u2019s a breakdown of where new jobs were created in January: The retail sector: +58,000 jobs, Employment in food services and drinking places: +47,000. Health care: +37,000 Manufacturing: +29,000 jobs in January Financial activities: +18,000. But, employment declined in private educational services, transportation and warehousing, and mining. The Non-farm Payroll is online here. US futures - which before the non-farm figures were predicting a 19 point gain on the Dow Jones Industrial Average - are now suggesting a 65 point decline when the market opens. These latest non-farm payroll numbers are another set of poor data since the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates in December, says Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com: However confident Janet Yellen and her Fed colleagues were when raising interest rates in December, the US data released in January must be giving them food for thought \u2013 and today\u2019s poor non-farm payroll figures are no different. Adding less than 200 thousand jobs for the first time since October, coupled with lower than expected GDP and productivity figures, has taken some of the shine off of the previously buoyant US economy. Yellen won\u2019t be worrying too much just yet, as other major economies have pared down growth forecasts amid global volatility. Many observers will surely be adopting a wait and see approach. Josh Raymond, director at London-based broker XTB, sums it up: It\u2019s a mixed bag. The dollar is fluctuating wildly as traders (and their algorithms) try to decide if this is a good jobs report, or a bad one. Here\u2019s the unemployment rate: This is important. Average earnings rose by 0.5% month-on-month in January, and were up 2.5% over the last year. That\u2019s a decent pick-up, suggesting that workers are feeling the benefits of the recovery. And that will reassure the Federal Reserve that it didn\u2019t blunder by raising interest rates in December. December\u2019s payroll has been revised down to +262,000, down from the previous estimate of +292,000 But it\u2019s not all bad - November\u2019s has been revised up to +280,000, from +252,000. Effectively, almost 30,000 new hires have been moved around. Nothing to panic about. Here we go! The US economy created 151,000 new jobs last month, according to the Non-Farm Payroll which is flashing on the wires right now. That\u2019s rather weaker than the 190,000 expected by economists. The US unemployment rate has dipped again, though, to just 4.9%. That\u2019s an eight-year low. Lots more to follow.... Economist Frederik Ducrozet predicts solid earnings growth.... If the economists are right, today\u2019s non-farm payroll will show the slowest job creation since September: Thank goodness. We\u2019re about to get the final major economic news of the week. At 1.30pm GMT sharp, or 8.30am Washington time, we\u2019ll get a insight into the state of the US jobs market. Even though Non-Farm Payroll is notoriously unpredictable, and regularly revised, it will still set the mood in the markets - possibly for some time. So, what should we watch for? 1) The first question is how many new jobs were created in January? The consensus figure is that the NFP rose by 190,000. That would be a slowdown on December\u2019s 292,000 (which could be revised), but not a disaster. However, Wall Street economists are quite divided - Goldman Sachs and Bank of America Merrill Lynch have predicted 170,000 new jobs, while French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale is optimistically expecting 245,000. 2) Wage growth is also important. The Fed is unlikely to raise rates again until it sees decent earnings growth. Economists predict that wages probably increased 2.2% annually, or 0.3% month-on-month. Not too impressive, if so. 3) Where were the jobs created? The report could show that the energy industry kept slashing staff, in response to the fall in the oil price. But how are manufacturers faring? If they aren\u2019t hiring, that could suggest the factory sector is struggling. It will take something remarkable today to prevent the US dollar posting its worst week since the last global downturn. Since Monday morning, the dollar has lost almost 3% against a basket of major currencies, as traders reassess the prospects for American monetary policy following signs of economic weakness at home and abroad. The possibility that we see zero US interest rises this year weakened the greenback against almost every other currency. Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Barton has tweeted the details: Yesterday, Greece\u2019s riot police clashed with protesters as Athens was gripped by a huge anti-austerity protest. Today, officers have been protesting outside prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019s mansion, objecting to cuts to their own pensions. There will be more protests later, as the Kathimerini newspaper flags up: The brief rally dispersed without any upheaval but police are expected to monitor a larger anti-austerity rally scheduled to take place in central Athens on Friday afternoon when fire service workers are to join police officers in protesting the planned changes to the pension system. For the second day running, mining stocks are going on a remarkable rally. Anglo American is leading the charge, up 10%, adding to Thursday\u2019s 19% surge, with commodity player Glencore up over 5%. It looks like traders are anticipating that miners will benefit if (as seems likely) the US Federal Reserve resists raising interest rates much this year. That, the theory goes, makes the US dollar weaker and means commodity prices rise (you need more dollars to buy the same lump of iron ore). This is all bad news for the speculators who have \u2018shorted\u2019 mining stocks - selling shares they don\u2019t own, and planning to buy them back at a lower price in future. Once that bet goes wrong, speculators can be caught in a nasty \u2018bear squeeze\u2019, scrambling over each other to buy shares to cover their short position. The FT\u2019s Neil Hume, though, wonders if something else is happening at Anglo.... ArcelorMittal has become the latest company to count the cost of the commosity crunch The world\u2019s largest steelmaker is to raise $3bn through a rights issue to strengthen its finances, news that sent its shares sliding by over 7%. After weeks of rocky markets, traders are grateful that there\u2019s really not much going on today. That will change when the US jobs report lands at 1.30pm. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, says we should enjoy the quiet while we can: \u201cEquity markets are pretty much flat amid a welcome calming of recent volatility as investors adopt their traditional wait-and-see ahead of the US monthly jobs report, even if it should have little bearing on the topic and driver of the week - the Fed\u2019s ability to raise rates in 2016 amid soggy data and protracted financial market gyrations following its December hike. Two and a half months after taking office, Portugal\u2019s left-wing government is heading into a showdown with EU authorities. The Commission is holding a special college meeting today, to discuss Lisbon\u2019s failure to submit tax and spending plans that meets EU rules. It could reject Portugal\u2019s new anti-austerity budget - which would be a pretty incendiary development. Politico\u2019s Ryan Heath sets the scene: Portugal yesterday adopted its budget without waiting for Commission approval. Now, if the budget is rejected in Brussels \u201cit would mark the first time a eurozone government has had its spending plan vetoed.\u201d Some suspect that a small country (Portugal) is once again being targeted not only on the merits of its own problems but to make a point to a bigger country (Italy) with similar issues that the EU dare not touch directly. I can\u2019t see Portugal meekly accepting a rebuke. Its current budget will create deficits above the 3% limit in both 2016 and 2017 -- as the government tries to unravel years of austerity and spur more growth. Yougov\u2019s claim that the Brexit campaign have a nine-point lead has been gently rubbished by Andrew Cooper of rival polling group Populus: European stock markets have opened cautiously, with little news to stir investors ahead of the US jobs report in just five hours time. The German and French markets have picked up, led by exporters, following a small dip in the value of the euro against the US dollar this morning. In London, mining shares are dropping after posting big jumps yesterday. Anglo American, which surged by almost 20% on Thursday, are down 4%. But the City is really waiting for the NFP report, because it could shunt the dollar one way or the other. Tony Cross of Trustnet explains: Looking ahead, it\u2019s the US non-farm payrolls that will dominate in the short term as this could readily counter the dollar weakness that we\u2019ve seen creeping in of late. Critically this has been pushing commodity prices higher and accounted for at least part of the short squeeze that was seen as buoying the miners yesterday, so anything that looks too hot in the data could have repercussions going into the weekend break. UBS analyst Paul Donovan isn\u2019t impressed by the media clamour over Non-Farm Payroll Day. Peppering his morning research note with sarcastic exclamation marks, he writes: Employment report Friday!!! A frequently revised statistic about a tiny change in a very large labour market!!! Cue the media frenzy right now. The consensus is for a generally OK report in aggregate. Sorry, Paul. There\u2019s a lot of chatter about Brexit in the City this morning. Bank of England deputy governor, Ben Broadbent, has told the BBC that companies don\u2019t appear to be freezing spending ahead of the EU referendum (which could come in June) Asked about Brexit risks, he said: \u201cWe have not yet seen, regarding investment intentions, any weakening of those of late,but obviously it\u2019s something we watch pretty closely.\u201d But a glance at the front page of The Times could encourage companies to rethink their spending plans. A new survey puts the Out campaign in the lead, by 45% to 36% (with 19% of people unsure). But before we cement up the Channel Tunnel, let\u2019s remember that the polling industry has been far from infallible recently (it got the Scottish referendum, and the last general election, wrong). And these kind of stories are also likely to get Remain supporters out to the polling booth. Which may be why they\u2019re expected to win: Most Asian stock markets fell today, as traders hunkered down ahead of this afternoon\u2019s non-farm payroll report. In Japan, the Nikkei fell by another 1.3%, amid nervousness that the yen might continue to strengthen against the US dollar (bad for Japanese exporters and inflation). The Chinese stock market also fell, losing around 0.6% in a quiet trading session. Many investors have already quit the bourses and headed home to celebrate the Chinese New Year The European trading day has started with weak economic data out of Germany. German factory orders declined by 0.7% month-on-month in December, according to stats body Destatis. Economists expected a 0.5% drop, following a 1.5% jump in orders in November. These monthly surveys can be quite volatile, but it suggests Germany\u2019s economy ended 2015 on the back foot. And it can\u2019t just be blamed on emerging markets. Orders from outside the eurozone actually rose, but that couldn\u2019t make up for falling demand from Germany\u2019s euro neighbours, or within Germany itself. Bloomberg has more details: Domestic orders fell 2.5%, the ministry said, while euro-area orders slumped 6.9% and demand from outside the currency bloc rose 5.5 percent. Orders for investment goods declined 0.5, and for consumer goods surged 4.3 percent. \u201cOrder activity somewhat recovered in the fourth quarter,\u201d the ministry said in a statement. \u201cIncreasing demand from countries outside the euro area indicates a gradual recovery the global economy. However, industry expectations have somewhat clouded, signaling a more modest recovery in industrial activity. Good morning. Another turbulent week in the markets is nearly over. But there\u2019s just one major hurdle to get over first \u2013 the US unemployment report, due at 1.30pm GMT. January\u2019s Non-Farm Payroll is expected to show that around 192,000 new jobs were created in America last month (excluding the volatile agriculture sector). The unemployment rate is projected to stay at 5% -- just half the level in the eurozone. And wage growth could remain elusive, with earnings expected to rise just 2.2% year-on-year. Economists will be scrutinising the data closely, for signs that the labor market is weakening. Recent economic surveys from the US have been somewhat disappointing, with service sector growth slowing last month. A disappointing payroll report could renew fears over the US economy, and mean the US central bank cannot raise interest rates for several months. Perhaps not even this year? The US dollar is already on track for its worst week since 2009, and it could slump again if the NFP comes in below forecasts. Angus Nicholson of IG explains: A big miss on the NFP numbers (150,000 or less) would see a further dive in the US dollar, killing expectations of any further rate hikes by the Fed. Europe\u2019s stock markets are expected to open cautiously, with investors sitting on their hands until the report comes out. Also coming up today: A row is brewing in Brussels with Portugal, whose new left-wing government has angered eurocrats by submitting a budget that doesn\u2019t meet the EU\u2019s fiscal rules. More on that shortly.... And Bank of England governor Ben Broadbent is on a media tour this morning:",

While the figures were not as bad as 0% growth might suggest, they do show signs of households being more circumspect about spending than they have been for some while.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/05/public-debt-is-not-the-issue-thats-just-a-neo-con-scare-campaign\">Public debt is not the issue \u2013 that's just a neo-con scare campaign | Philip Soos</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of the problems with retail trade figures is that for the most part we talk in terms of current dollars. So when the Australian Retail Association talks about the Christmas sales setting a record, it\u2019s actually not that big of a statement. Things for the most part cost more now than they did a year ago, and thus even with small wage growth, generally each December we spend more in the shops than we did a year earlier. </p> <p>The other problem with retail trade figures is that they are affected by seasonal factors perhaps more than most other statistics. </p> <p>While the seasonally adjusted figures showed that in December there was just 0.03% growth over the sales in November, in reality Australians spent 23.9% more in December than they did in November, and 4.7% more they did in December 2014: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Retail turnover - December growth (ordinary data).\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/jlGmp/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But we don\u2019t really bother with original data because it doesn\u2019t tell us a whole lot \u2013 it\u2019s no big surprise to discover we shop more in December than we do in November and we will always do so unless Christmas gets shifted to 25 November. </p> <p>The seasonally adjusted figures attempt to give us an idea of how much more we spent in December taking into account that every year we always spend big in that month. But even the seasonally adjusted figures can be a tad excitable:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Retail sales monthly growth.\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/i9Ol7/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The trend growth in December was a fairly respectable 0.3%. However, even the trend figures struggle a bit in the retail world. </p> <p>The release of the iPhone 6 in August 2014 saw such a big jump in the sales that it \u201cbroke\u201d the trend line. And its most recent incarnation last year also wrecked havoc with the figures. </p> <p>The biggest drag on the retail turnover figures in December were electrical and electronic goods \u2013 those sales fell 1.7% in December. But this is not all that surprising given the latest version of the iPhone was released in September. In September and October electrical goods sales rose 3.1% and 1.9%.

                "bodyText":"Every year around Christmas the news is full of stories from retail groups boasting of how the sales this year are the biggest ever, so it was with a fair amount of cold water that the latest retail turnover figures released on Friday showed that trade was absolutely flat in December. While the figures were not as bad as 0% growth might suggest, they do show signs of households being more circumspect about spending than they have been for some while. One of the problems with retail trade figures is that for the most part we talk in terms of current dollars. So when the Australian Retail Association talks about the Christmas sales setting a record, it\u2019s actually not that big of a statement. Things for the most part cost more now than they did a year ago, and thus even with small wage growth, generally each December we spend more in the shops than we did a year earlier. The other problem with retail trade figures is that they are affected by seasonal factors perhaps more than most other statistics. While the seasonally adjusted figures showed that in December there was just 0.03% growth over the sales in November, in reality Australians spent 23.9% more in December than they did in November, and 4.7% more they did in December 2014: But we don\u2019t really bother with original data because it doesn\u2019t tell us a whole lot \u2013 it\u2019s no big surprise to discover we shop more in December than we do in November and we will always do so unless Christmas gets shifted to 25 November. The seasonally adjusted figures attempt to give us an idea of how much more we spent in December taking into account that every year we always spend big in that month. But even the seasonally adjusted figures can be a tad excitable: The trend growth in December was a fairly respectable 0.3%. However, even the trend figures struggle a bit in the retail world. The release of the iPhone 6 in August 2014 saw such a big jump in the sales that it \u201cbroke\u201d the trend line. And its most recent incarnation last year also wrecked havoc with the figures. The biggest drag on the retail turnover figures in December were electrical and electronic goods \u2013 those sales fell 1.7% in December. But this is not all that surprising given the latest version of the iPhone was released in September. In September and October electrical goods sales rose 3.1% and 1.9%. If we excluded electrical and electronic sales from the total figures, then December trade would have gone up by 0.2%. It\u2019s why even with the weak December figures, the annual growth is a fairly respectable 4.0% in trend terms and 4.2% seasonally adjusted: It also goes to the changing nature of our consumption habits and the importance of December in the retail figures. Thirty years ago, 43% of our retail spending was on food (from supermarkets etc) and from cafes, restaurants and takeaways. By the turn of the century it was up to 49% and in December last year it was 53%: And while we do spend more on food and eating out in December than in other months \u2013 all those big Christmas lunches \u2013 December is less important for those sectors of the retail industry than all others. For department stores, December is worth almost two months of the year in sales. For clothing and footwear, December is equivalent to six weeks: And thus as our spending habits have turned from spending in department stores and on clothing to food and eating out, the month of December has become less important: Mostly however, this isn\u2019t because of a big change in our tastes, but because non-food purchases have become relatively cheaper over the years. Think about how much a DVD player cost 15 years ago relative to, say a meal at McDonalds, and you get an idea. In essence, we haven\u2019t actually taken to eating out more, just that more of our weekly spend is being taken up on food and eating out. We actually buy a lot more household goods than we used to, but they also cost much less now: Looking at the growth in the volume of how much we spend is important because household consumption has been a big driver of GDP growth \u2013 in the past year it contributed only slightly less than net exports. And real GDP growth looks at volume not current dollars. The ABS only measures retail volume spending each quarter, and in the December quarter it grew by 0.6% in trend terms and by 2.5% over the past year \u2013 down from 3.1% in the September quarter. Retail spending does not include all of household consumption \u2013 it doesn\u2019t for example include education and health spending, or other services, but the two measures have shown good parallels over the past decade: The slight slowing in the growth of retail spending volume is not particularly indicative of a strong economy, but the growth of 0.6% in volume at least provides some counter to the gloom of the 0% spending growth in current dollars. The figures, however, also provide some signs that the housing boom is on the wane. In NSW spending on furniture, floor coverings, homeware and textile goods \u2013 things that you buy for a new home \u2013 grew by just 0.6% in 2015 \u2013 well down on the 21% growth that occurred in 2014. Similarly the growth of such spending in Victoria has fallen drastically in the past six months: Despite the 0% growth in trade recorded in December, the retail figures are not a horror show. But they do point to somewhat of a slowing, and not just in things we buy in the shops but also in the housing sector. And they certainly suggest households are at best less eager to spend money than they have been for almost two years, which is not a great sign for an economy that relies on households to power much of its growth.",

Financials have been really badly hit of late, and in a sign of how dire things have got, some European banks are trading lower than they did during the depths of the financial crisis.

London\u2019s FTSE-100 has posted a 2.7% sell-off, pushing the benchmark index squarely back into bear-market territory, but losses across mainland Europe have been even more pronounced. The fact that WTI crude tested territory below $30/barrel once again has done nothing to help matters but we\u2019ve got this overriding fear that another global slow down is imminent and many investors are adjusting portfolios to suit. The theme of risk aversion is buoying precious metals... as gold eyes a break above $1200 an ounce for the first time in over six months.</p> <p>But 25 stocks [in the FTSE 100 are] sporting losses in excess of 5% on the day, underlying the sense of panic that is creeping in. Economic data remains thin on the ground tomorrow but given at least some of the downside in stocks can be attributed to that renewed weakness in oil, this remains a metric worth watching closely.

In a new note he says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We struggle to remember many occasions when investor sentiment was quite as bearish and widespread as it feels today. Sure, 2008 was worse as the global financial crisis and fears of global depression created panic in markets, but today\u2019s cool disdain for risk assets still takes some beating. When we were asked by a client this week what reason bullish investors were citing for their optimism, we had to confess that we couldn\u2019t answer as we hadn\u2019t met any in recent times. The collective noun for a group of bears is a \u2018sleuth\u2019, but it doesn\u2019t take much detective work just now to identify what investors are concerned about. </p> </blockquote> <p>Those concerns revolve around the usual suspects - China, emerging markets, dollar, oil etc - but added to that are the fact that central banks are moving towards negative interest rates, which is not particularly positive for equity markets. Secker said he feared any moves higher by stock markets, prompted by relief rallies on positive new, would \u201cprove short-lived as investors increasingly question the value and effectiveness of further central bank action.\u201d</p> <p>And then there is Europe:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Recent investor caution tends to focus on fears of excess US dollar strength, low oil prices and/or China, but we think it is quite plausible that Europe moves back up the pecking order (to its more usual place some would say!) as we move through 2016. The UK\u2019s forthcoming referendum on EU membership, likely to take place in June, may appear the most plausible catalyst in the short term to raise regional risk premia, but the ongoing migrant issue risks eroding political cohesion over the medium term and political uncertainty is rising in the periphery.</p> <p>Greece has a daunting debt repayment due this summer, Spain is currently without a government, new European regulations are preventing Italy from adopting an effective \u2018bad bank\u2019 solution and the recently elected socialist government in Portugal is reversing course on prior austerity and competitiveness improvements. During a cyclical upswing, markets are prone to overlook such concerns, but the opposite would be true if growth starts to relapse. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56b8a5ede4b09b1cb9ebb4fd\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-08T14:34:30.619Z\">2.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens sharply lower</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US markets have followed Europe into the red, as fears about the global economy continue to rattle investors.</p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 220 points or 1.3% while the S&amp;P 500 is down just over 1% and the Nasdaq has fallen 1.7% at the open.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56b8a3cfe4b08e789ae4d89b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-08T14:20:34.092Z\">2.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>With the Greek stock market at <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/feb/08/uk-business-confidence-falls-global-recession-fears-markets-business-live?page=with:block-56b891ebe4b08e789ae4d874#block-56b891ebe4b08e789ae4d874\">its lowest since at least 1990</a></strong> and banks bearing the brunt of the selling, here is the huge damage done to the four biggest since the start of the year:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/zantespear/status/696698428580036608\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Frances_Coppola\">@Frances_Coppola</a> Greece 4 biggest banks YTD Alpha Bank -45,38% NBG -40,82% Piraeus -51,08% Eurobank -47,31%.Market cap YTD from 11.5B to 6B</p>&mdash; Theo Mylonas (@zantespear) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zantespear/status/696698428580036608\">February 8, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56b89faee4b08a40b2bad984\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-08T14:10:11.322Z\">2.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Readers in America should brace themselves. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/feb/08/uk-business-confidence-falls-global-recession-fears-markets-business-live?page=with:block-56b882ffe4b08e789ae4d841#block-56b882ffe4b08e789ae4d841\">The selloff that began in Europe this morning </a>is heading your way. </strong></p> <p>Wall Street is expected to fall sharply when trading begins in 20 minutes time, as fears over the global economy reach New York.</p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average is tipped to fall by over 1%, while US crude oil is flirting with the $30/barrel mark.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"072c6afddf0177015aeb3ea03e47fd44c03a8d89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/072c6afddf0177015aeb3ea03e47fd44c03a8d89/0_0_545_221/500.jpg\" alt=\"Here\u2019a a handy Wall Street scorecard from the FT\" width=\"500\" height=\"203\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Here\u2019a a handy Wall Street scorecard from the FT</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: FT</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Terry Sandven,</strong> chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis, told Reuters that investors will remain nervous until the oil price picks up.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cEquities are in a \u2018go-nowhere-fast\u2019 mode, with a downward bias in the near term. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56b89bdfe4b08a40b2bad97c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-08T13:58:13.913Z\">1.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Is this why Deutsche Bank shares are falling?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"eb3be0b1d90647a8e7cda0107c9e7057a70883f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb3be0b1d90647a8e7cda0107c9e7057a70883f9/0_0_2162_3500/618.jpg\" alt=\"The headquarter of German company Deutsche Bank is pictured in Frankfurt/Main, Germany, on January 28, 2016.

                "bodyText":"That\u2019s all from us until tomorrow, after another day dominated by wild swings in the markets and angst over the global economy. Will Tuesday be different? Come back tomorrow and find out. Goodnight! GW Wall Street has closed for the night, after a day of turmoil in the major stock markets. The Dow Jones industrial has finished down 177 points, or 1.1%, at 16,027, as gloom over global growth hit financial stocks. The S&amp;P 500 index, which covers more US stocks than the Dow, shed 1.4% and the Nasdaq finished down 1.8%. Serious losses, but better than the lowest points of the day. Wall Street was dragged up by a late rally in energy stocks. Credit card firm Visa was the biggest faller on the Dow, followed by Goldman Sachs: Tech firms had a bad day - with social media network Twitter dropping by over 5% to a new record low: As we\u2019ve been covering for the last 14 hours, that followed hefty losses in Europe. The FTSE 100 plunged by 2.7%, or 158 points, wiping \u00a340bn off the blue-chip London index. And European markets fell further, hit by fears over the banking sector and the global economy. Greece was the worst performer, though, hitting its lowest level in 25 years! Owen Callan, senior analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, said investors are increasingly anxious about the \u201cfundamental picture\u201d of the world economy. Callan said: \u201cPeople are worried about the global economy and particularly now we are beginning to look at the banks. \u201cYou are seeing more and more people saying: \u2018Is this 2008 again?\u2019 Maybe not quite as severe, but do we need to be worrying about the banking sector and risk assets on a bigger level?\u201d Here\u2019s our news story about today\u2019s selloff: Hello..... the US stock market is staging a late rally, bouncing off its earlier lows. The Dow is now down just 150 points, or 0.9%, having been down almost 400 points a couple of hours ago: Some big names are leading the Wall Street fallers, with 20 minutes until the closing bell is rung. Investment bank Goldman Sachs is down 5.8%, mirroring the selloff in global banking stocks. Visa is close behind, down 5.6%, followed by Nike (5%), Home Depot (4.6%) and Boeing (3%). Here\u2019s a few photos from Wall Street today, as traders faced another day of chunky losses. Deutsche Bank\u2019s soothing statement about its bond repayments may have calmed investors nerves a little. Shares are creeping back from their lows on Wall Street, meaning the Dow is now only down 269 points, or 1.7%. Good news, there\u2019s only one hour to go until Wall Street closes and Manic Monday is over. Bad news, the US stock market is still heavily in the red. The Dow is down 2.17%, or 351 points to the bad, with the S&amp;P and Nasdaq in deeper trouble: Newsflash: Deutsche Bank has just issued a statement, saying it can meet a crucial debt repayment in April. The Frankfurt-based bank, which was at the heart of today\u2019s market turmoil, says it has a \u201cpayment capacity\u201d of around \u20ac1bn. That will cover the \u20ac350m due in April on its CoCo bonds -- debt which converts into shares, or is wiped out, if a bank hits financial problems and defaults. As we covered this morning (details here), some analysts fear Deutsche could miss a CoCo payment in 2017, if economic conditions worsen. Deutsche says it will probably have a \u201cpayment capacity\u201d of \u20ac4.3bn next year in 2017, depending on its operating performance this year. Here\u2019s Deutsche\u2019s statement: Deutsche Bank publishes updated information about AT1 payment capacity The stock market turmoil risks blowing a multi-billion pound black hole in the UK government\u2019s fiscal plans. That\u2019s the warning from the IFS thinktank, which published its Green Budget today, one month ahead of the official budget. Here\u2019s the story: Britain\u2019s leading experts on the public finances are warning that the turmoil on global stock markets threatens to leave a \u00a32bn black hole in George Osborne\u2019s deficit-reduction plans that could force the chancellor to raise taxes or make fresh cuts in spending to hit his budget targets. On a day in which share prices crashed in Europe and the US, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said Osborne\u2019s plan to put the UK back in the black by the end of the current parliament was vulnerable to a protracted financial market panic. The IFS said tumbling share prices \u2013 which wiped more than \u00a340bn off the value of the companies quoted on the FTSE 100 Index on Monday \u2013 were one of a number of factors that could blow the chancellor\u2019s plan off course in the next four years. Forecasts that wages growth will be lower than previously expected could knock another \u00a35bn hole in his budget, the thinktank said. And here\u2019s the full story: The Telegraph\u2019s Mehreen Kahn points out that the European banking sector has lost a sixth of its value in the last month. Here\u2019s her take on today\u2019s market mayhem: Global stocks were gripped by a fresh bout of panic selling on Monday raising fears over the health of the world\u2019s banking system for the first time since the financial crisis. European markets slumped to their lowest level in more than two years amid an unremittingly bleak outlook for the global economy and concerns over the resilience of the world\u2019s biggest lenders. The Euro Stoxx 600 index of leading bank shares fell as much as 6pc in Monday\u2019s trading, closing down 5.6pc, plumbing depths not seen since August 2012. The continent\u2019s lenders have now lost 17.3pc of their value of the last 30 days.... (more here) Anxious investors are continuing to pile into gold, sending it up to $1,200 per ounce for the first time in over seven months: So far this year, shares in America\u2019s largest banks have slumped by at least 15% as investors fear a global downturn. The biotech boom has speedily unwound, too.. There\u2019s no sign, yet, that Wall Street might recover from its early selloff. The Dow is stubbornly down around 344 points, or 2.1%, at 15,860 points. The broader S&amp;P 500 is down 2.3%, and the tech stock-packed Nasdaq has shed 2.9%. That\u2019s nearly as bad as the European selloff, and suggests we\u2019re facing yet more market turbulence. \u201cYelp\u201d indeed..... US technology stocks are being hit hard today. Tesla, the electric car company, have slumped by 9% today, dropping below $150 for the first time in two years. Global markets suffered a bad start to the week, with the Chinese new year proving as turbulent as the slump in the early days of January. Although the Chinese markets were closed, that did not end the recent spate of volatility facing investors. Fears about a slowdown in global growth returned with a vengeance, while banking shares were among the poorest performers on worries about the outlook, and the effect of negative interest rates on their business. On top of that came a cocktail of other concerns, from the prospect of Britain leaving the European Union to concerns about the review of Greek\u2019s progress in meeting its bailout targets. The rout was widespread, with the Greek market at its lowest for around 25 years and the Eurofirst300 dropped to a near two and a half year low. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 158.7 points or 2.7% to 5689.36 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 3.3% to 8979.36 with Deutsche Bank 9.5% lower France\u2019s Cac closed 3.2% lower at 4066.31 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 4.09% to 16,441.2 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 4.44% at 8122.1 In Greece, the Athens market lost 7.87% to 464.23 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 323 points or 2%. There seems little justification for the day\u2019s slump in banking shares, said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: Markets are clearly worried about a global economic downturn at a time when central banks have little dry powder left to fight off recessionary forces. The tables were turned in the UK stock market today with recent winners suffering from profit-taking, while the miners were virtually the only stocks to keep their heads above water. The collapse in the oil price has been a big shock to the financial system and its effects are still being absorbed by international stock markets, in particular the implications for global demand. Financials have been really badly hit of late, and in a sign of how dire things have got, some European banks are trading lower than they did during the depths of the financial crisis. There doesn\u2019t seem to be much justification for such a dismal outlook, but markets appear to be stuck in a negative feedback loop at the moment. A sense of panic seems to be setting in, but any increase in the oil price might help markets, said Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct: Equities across the globe have kicked off the week in a deeply downbeat mood. London\u2019s FTSE-100 has posted a 2.7% sell-off, pushing the benchmark index squarely back into bear-market territory, but losses across mainland Europe have been even more pronounced. The fact that WTI crude tested territory below $30/barrel once again has done nothing to help matters but we\u2019ve got this overriding fear that another global slow down is imminent and many investors are adjusting portfolios to suit. The theme of risk aversion is buoying precious metals... as gold eyes a break above $1200 an ounce for the first time in over six months. But 25 stocks [in the FTSE 100 are] sporting losses in excess of 5% on the day, underlying the sense of panic that is creeping in. Economic data remains thin on the ground tomorrow but given at least some of the downside in stocks can be attributed to that renewed weakness in oil, this remains a metric worth watching closely. Anything that fundamentally impacts on supply could be all it takes to instil some confidence in markets, but in the absence of any better news the bears are likely to remain in control. One reason for the current market problems is the US Federal Reserve ending its quantitative easing programme, says Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Bloomberg has the story: Ever since the Federal Reserve began to withdraw monetary stimulus, liquidity has steadily been drying up. Therein lies the crux of the broader stress in financial markets, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which have seen violent selloffs occur following the surprise revaluations of currencies in Switzerland and China, as well as Japan\u2019s introduction of negative interest rates. Head of U.S. Mortgages Chris Flanagan and Strategist Mao Ding don\u2019t necessarily lay blame for market dislocations squarely on U.S. monetary policymakers. The two observe, however, that since early 2014\u2014when the Fed began winding down its open-ended asset purchases\u2014liquidity stress has \u201cpersistently risen\u201d and served as the proximate cause of the episodic spikes in Merrill Lynch\u2019s Global Financial Stress Index that have since occurred. [They said:] \u201cThis persistence suggests to us that deteriorating liquidity is at the heart of and may be the primary driver of broader rising financial stress.\u201d Full story here: Bank of America: This Chart Shows \u2018Deteriorating Liquidity\u2019 Is at the Heart of Market Carnage More turbulence in the banking sector, which has been by worries about negative interest rates, the outlook for profits and slowing global growth. Trading in Barclays shares was halted briefly after volatile movements. Now resumed, the shares are down 5.4%. With China\u2019s markets closed for the new year holiday, it is a worrying sign that share prices elsewhere continue to tumble, says Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG: The selling that began this morning has gathered pace across the globe this afternoon, as the US joins in the one-way move. Chinese investors will feel relieved that their market has taken the week off, but the absence of the volatility provided by Shanghai sends a worrying message \u2013 investors in the US and Europe are worried by many things, not least the current interest rate outlook in the US. Recent surveys of fund managers may indicate rising cash balances, but so far these appear to be remaining on the side lines, pulling the rug from under what remains of this bull market. In a week when economic data is relatively light, it is becoming increasingly apparent investors are struggling to find any positive news on which to create a rally. Then there are the banks. Jasper Lawler at CMC Markets said: Banking shares across Europe buckled under the pressure of global growth concerns in concert with the ugly spectre of negative interest rates. Weak earnings from European banks, notably that of Deutsche Bank have seen investors significantly reassess the chance of an earnings turnaround after years of regulatory fines for past misdeeds. The disappointing earnings across the sector from the big US firms to Credit Suisse whose chief executive asked to have his bonus cut by as much as 50% is refocusing investor attention on bad loan books which have not been addressed since the European crisis. In the days after Deutsche Bank issued a surprise profit warning, credit default swap spreads ballooned as investors started to question the bank\u2019s ability to fund itself. The CDS jump has caused a sharp drop in Deutsche Bank shares. Markets continue to slide, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now down around 300 points. Meanwhile in Greece, the Athens market has closed down 7.87% to 464.23, its lowest level in at least 25 years. Banks - as elsewhere - are among the biggest fallers, down up to nearly 30% in some cases. Greece\u2019s finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos said he expected the review of the country\u2019s bailout programme to restart next week, and conclude two weeks later. But with worries about planned pension and tax reforms - which have seen major protests in recent days - have unnerved investors. Manos Hatzidakis of Beta Securities told Reuters: The market is pricing in financial and political instability, and delays in the review. Sterling has hit a one week low, falling to $1.4393 amid worries about the outlook for banks and concerns about the effects of any vote from Britain to leave the European Union. It is also at a 13 month low against the euro. The recent move by central banks to push interest rates into negative territory is bold but unco-ordinated and could lead to a \u201crace to the bottom,\u201d according to Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s. The ratings agency said: Four European central banks--in Switzerland, Denmark, and Sweden, plus the European Central Bank--have adopted negative policy rates, and Japan surprisingly joined the club on January 29 this year. \u201cThe Bank of Japan\u2019s decision to follow suit on negative rates is likely to reinforce the trend toward shrinking yields in core government bond markets, as the search for yield spreads from Japan into Europe,\u201d said Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s economist Sophie Tahiri... \u201cThe bold venture into negative interest rates signals to market participants that central banks will use all tools at their disposal to meet inflation targets,\u201d said Ms Tahiri. \u201cThe problem is that all developed markets\u2019 central banks face the same deflationary pressures from weak commodity prices and have the same incentive to use their exchange rate to combat those pressures.\u201d This increasing competition between developed markets\u2019 central banks to stem currency appreciation signals a new phase in the extended aftermath of the global financial crisis. Independent attempts to weaken exchange rates could lead to an undesirable \u201crace to the bottom\u201d among central banks. Here\u2019s a snapshot of the Dow movers, mainly down of course: Amid the current worries about the global economy, Europe could start moving up the list according to strategist Graham Secker at Morgan Stanley. In a new note he says: We struggle to remember many occasions when investor sentiment was quite as bearish and widespread as it feels today. Sure, 2008 was worse as the global financial crisis and fears of global depression created panic in markets, but today\u2019s cool disdain for risk assets still takes some beating. When we were asked by a client this week what reason bullish investors were citing for their optimism, we had to confess that we couldn\u2019t answer as we hadn\u2019t met any in recent times. The collective noun for a group of bears is a \u2018sleuth\u2019, but it doesn\u2019t take much detective work just now to identify what investors are concerned about. Those concerns revolve around the usual suspects - China, emerging markets, dollar, oil etc - but added to that are the fact that central banks are moving towards negative interest rates, which is not particularly positive for equity markets. Secker said he feared any moves higher by stock markets, prompted by relief rallies on positive new, would \u201cprove short-lived as investors increasingly question the value and effectiveness of further central bank action.\u201d And then there is Europe: Recent investor caution tends to focus on fears of excess US dollar strength, low oil prices and/or China, but we think it is quite plausible that Europe moves back up the pecking order (to its more usual place some would say!) as we move through 2016. The UK\u2019s forthcoming referendum on EU membership, likely to take place in June, may appear the most plausible catalyst in the short term to raise regional risk premia, but the ongoing migrant issue risks eroding political cohesion over the medium term and political uncertainty is rising in the periphery. Greece has a daunting debt repayment due this summer, Spain is currently without a government, new European regulations are preventing Italy from adopting an effective \u2018bad bank\u2019 solution and the recently elected socialist government in Portugal is reversing course on prior austerity and competitiveness improvements. During a cyclical upswing, markets are prone to overlook such concerns, but the opposite would be true if growth starts to relapse. US markets have followed Europe into the red, as fears about the global economy continue to rattle investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 220 points or 1.3% while the S&amp;P 500 is down just over 1% and the Nasdaq has fallen 1.7% at the open. With the Greek stock market at its lowest since at least 1990 and banks bearing the brunt of the selling, here is the huge damage done to the four biggest since the start of the year: Readers in America should brace themselves. The selloff that began in Europe this morning is heading your way. Wall Street is expected to fall sharply when trading begins in 20 minutes time, as fears over the global economy reach New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is tipped to fall by over 1%, while US crude oil is flirting with the $30/barrel mark. Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis, told Reuters that investors will remain nervous until the oil price picks up. \u201cEquities are in a \u2018go-nowhere-fast\u2019 mode, with a downward bias in the near term. Some analysts are concerned that Deutsche Bank may struggle to repay some of its bonds, if economic conditions continue to deteriorate. That\u2019s helps explains why its shares have slumped 5%, as investors also drive up the cost of insuring its debt. The key is Deutsche\u2019s CoCo bonds, or contingent convertible bonds, which are written down or converted to equity when a bank\u2019s capital falls to a certain level. CoCo bonds have been introduced since the 2008 financial crisis, to spare governments from funding another bailout. They pay a decent return, to encourage investors to hold them, in return for shouldering the risk if things go wrong. Bloomberg\u2019s John Glover has the story: Deutsche Bank may struggle to pay coupons on its riskiest bonds next year if operating results disappoint or litigation costs are higher than expected, according to analysts at CreditSights Inc. Bonds and stock of Germany\u2019s largest bank have plunged this year, with the shares shedding 35% of their value and its contingent convertible bonds -- known as CoCos, or additional Tier 1 securities -- turning in a similar performance. The cost of protecting the company\u2019s subordinated debt from default for five years using credit-default swaps has more than doubled since the end of 2015, rising to 420 basis points, a four-year high, from 187. \u201cWhile we are confident about 2016 coupons, we are less so about coupon payments in 2017,\u201d CreditSights analyst Simon Adamson wrote in a note to clients today. Deutsche Bank will do \u201ceverything in its power to pay them\u201d because it will need to issue such bonds in the future, he said. Full story: Deutsche Bank\u2019s Woes Threaten CoCo Coupons, CreditSights Says The selloff is gathering pace in Frankfurt. The German DAX index has just slumped through the 9,000 point mark for the first time in 16 months, down 3.2%. Bank stocks are leading the DAX further down.... Stock market wizards like to tell you that \u2018buy and hold\u2019 is a solid strategy, that allows shareholders to ride out turbulence. Shares outperform other assets in the long term, they chant. Well, tell that to a Greek investor. The Athens market has just slumped to its lowest level in at least 25 years. Greek bank shares are being pulverised today, with Eurobank down 27%, National Bank of Greece down 25% and Piraeus down 20%. It\u2019s only three months since the Greek banking sector was recapitalised, getting \u20ac14bn of new funding to help stabilise the economy. China has lost its claim to be the world\u2019s fastest-growing major economy, to India. New government figures from Delhi show that Indian gross domestic product grew by 7.3% in the last quarter of 2015, compared with a year earlier. That beats China, which expanded by 6.8% over the same period. India\u2019s statistics body also estimated that GDP will expand by 7.6% in the year through March. That would also outpace Beijing, which is aiming for growth close to 7%. Caution is needed with these figures. Many economists suspect China is growing rather slower than the official readings. And some have told Reuters that India\u2019s figures are surprisingly strong. Almost every company on the FTSE 100 index has fallen this morning, during another bout of heavy selling across Europe\u2019s stock markets. Worries over the state of the world economy continue to drive shares lower. Only five companies are defying the rout, including gold producer Randgold and silver producer Fresnillo, who are both benefitting from the panic. That has left the FTSE 100 languishing at 5,735 points, down 112 points or 1.9% today. Other European markets are deeper in the red, losing around 2.4% on average, and hitting their lowest level since October 2014. Conner Campbell of Spreadex has summed up the situation (I\u2019ve added links to key points in this blog): A slow start soon turned disastrous this Monday, with many of the European indices plunging to lows not seen since October 2014. With Citigroup warning of a potential \u2018death spiral\u2019 if investors behave irrationally to the stronger dollar/weaker commodities/harmed emerging markets cycle that the world appears to be trapped in at the moment, the markets have taken another kicking this Monday. It doesn\u2019t help, of course, that the day\u2019s economic calendar is so sparse, with investors left pondering the purely negative side of things as the morning continued. The FTSE sank by nearly 2%, plummeting past 5800 in the process as Brent Crude fell back towards the $33 per barrel mark. The DAX, always the liveliest index in instances like this, lopped off a whopping 2.6% in value as the morning progressed, and is in serious danger of falling below the 9000 mark; the CAC, meanwhile, matched its dramatic German peer with its own 2.5% drop. The Eurozone had the added negative of a 10 month low Sentix investor confidence figure, the reported 6.0 far lower than the 9.6 announced in January, whilst the German index has the extra burden of a dismal morning from Deutsche Bank. The FT\u2019s Joel Lewin has a handy explanation of why bank shares are falling today. Fears surrounding non-performing loans and other deep-rooted issues in the Italian banking sector have driven nerves, while a slew of weak earnings from large banks such as Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank have added to concerns. Weak growth provides an unsupportive backdrop, as does the possibility of more deeply negative benchmark interest rates. And that\u2019s why Commerzbank has dropped by 4.7%, Deutsche Bank is down 3.4%, and BNP Paribas has lost 3.3%. UK banks are also suffering, with Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland both down 1.7% In another sign of angst, the gold price has just hit a three month high. Bullion is swapping hands at $1,171 per ounce, the most since the end of October. It has already gained around 10% since the start of 2016, as concerns over the world economic outlook have grown. The OECD think tank has issued new economic indicators for investors to digest (in between hammering the SELL button). It sees \u2018tentative\u2019 signs that the Chinese economy is bottoming out, but slowing growth in the US. The OECD is also quite upbeat about Europe, saying: In the euro area as a whole, and in Germany and Italy, the composite leading indicators signal stable growth momentum while in France the outlook is for firming growth.\u201d We\u2019ll find out on Friday if they\u2019re right, when the latest eurozone GDP figures are published (starting at 6.30am GMT, so set your alarm clocks). How worried should we really, really be about a global recession? No-one knows for sure. But investment bank Goldman Sachs reckons it is still unlikely, despite fears that the recent market turmoil will feed into the \u2018real economy\u2019. They have estimated that there is an 18% chance that the United States goes into recession over the next year, rising to 23% over the next two years. For the eurozone, it\u2019s a 24% risk this year, up to 38% by the end of 2017. So hardly a done deal. Goldman\u2019s Jan Hatzius agues that \u201cThe recent market weakness should provide good risk-adjusted opportunities for those brave enough to defy Mr. Market\u2019s gloomy prognosis about the world economy.\u201d The selloff in European markets this morning suggests Mr Market isn\u2019t convinced.... The Greek stock market is still falling, and now down over 6%. That\u2019s pretty worrying, given the political tensions in Athens. Wall Street is expected to suffer losses when trading begins in New York, in just over three hours time. According to the future market, the Dow Jones industrial average will fall 1.2% at the open. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index is being called down 1.6%. The oil price is falling again, hit by concerns over the global economy. Brent crude has dropped by 1.7% to $33.47 per barrel, wiping out last week\u2019s rally. Confirmation that Germany\u2019s stock market is at a 15-month low: The Greek stock market has slumped by 5% to its lowest level since 2012 - when it nearly left the eurozone. That\u2019s partly due to the general wave of worry today, but it also reflects the standoff over Greece\u2019s bailout. Creditors are pushing the government to make deeper pension reforms, while protestors flocked to the streets last week to call for less austerity. European banking shares are bearing the brunt of today\u2019s rout. In Germany, shares in Deutsche Bank have tumbled by 4.35%. And the cost of insuring Deutsche\u2019s debt against default, using a credit default swap or CDS, has hit the highest level since July 2012. That underlines how much nervousness is in the markets today: Last month, Deutsche announced that it suffered a loss of \u20ac6.7bn last year. New CEO John Cryan said it was \u2018sobering\u2019, and some analysts fear Cryan will struggle to turn Deutsche around in the current market turmoil. As well as the huge loss, Deutsche also reported falling revenues. According to Bloomberg, that could indicate the bank will struggle to hit its capital ratio targets. As shares slide, investors are scrambling to get their hands on safe-haven assets such as German government debt today. And that has driven the yield, or interest rate, on German bunds into deeper negative territory. In other words, traders are willing to pay more than the face value of the bonds and accept a guaranteed loss - unless they can offload them onto someone even more desperate..... A wave of selling is gripping Europe\u2019s stock markets, as this morning\u2019s stream of bad news hits traders. In London, the FTSE 100 index is suddenly down by 101 points, or 1.7%. And there are steeper losses across Europe, where the benchmark FTSeurofirst 300 index has shed 2%. That means European stocks are at their lowest point since October 2014, as money pours out of shares and into safe-haven bonds. Concerns over the weakness of the global economy appear to be rippling through trading floors again. The sharp fall in eurozone investor confidence reported a few minutes ago is contributing to the bad mood: Alastair McCaig, Market Analyst at IG. says: Stock markets in Europe are in full retreat... with the disappointing Sentix figures triggering a mid-morning selloff. The news that UK business morale has hit a three-year low isn\u2019t helping either. More gloom! Economic sentiment among investors across the eurozone has fallen sharply this month, as the problems in the global economy hit Europe. Sentix, the Frankfurt-based think tank, has just reported that its index of investor morale has hit a 10-month low in February, dropping from 9.6 to 6.0. And its sub-index of economic expectations hit its lowest level since November, 2014, sliding from 6.3 to just 1.5. Manfred Huebner, Sentix\u2019s managing director, warns: The euro zone proves it is not immune to the enormous loss of momentum in the global economy. The global economy is thus currently on the brink, led by a US economic downturn! Sentix blamed \u201cthe loss of dynamism\u201d in Germany and the United States, while Latin America and Eastern Europe are in a worse state. And Sentix singles out the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate increase last December, which is \u201cnow considered a big mistake by the majority of investors\u201d. It also pointed to the slump in commodity prices, and its impact on emerging markets. Wall Street bank Citigroup has contributed to the sombre feeling in the markets, with a research note last week warning that we could face a \u2018death spiral\u2019. The bad news, according to Citi, is that the dollar could keep strengthening, driving commodity prices lower, hurting emerging markets (EM), and thus pushing the dollar higher etc etc. The good news is that it probably won\u2019t happen though, if \u2018rational behaviour\u2019 kicks in . CNBC has the details: \u201cThe world appears to be trapped in a circular reference death spiral,\u201d Citi strategists led by Jonathan Stubbs said in a report on Thursday. \u201cStronger U.S. dollar, weaker oil/commodity prices, weaker world trade/petrodollar liquidity, weaker EM (and global growth)... and repeat. Ad infinitum, this would lead to Oilmageddon, a \u2018significant and synchronized\u2019 global recession and a proper modern-day equity bear market.\u201d Stubbs said that macro strategists at Citi forecast that the dollar would weaken in 2016 and that oil prices were likely bottoming, potentially providing some light at the end of the tunnel. \u201cThe death spiral is in nobody\u2019s interest. Rational behaviour, most likely, will prevail,\u201d he said in the report. Great headline - but maybe the report is a little overblown? One money manager thinks so.... The Economist Intelligence Unit is also concerned about the economic situation. Their managing director, Robin Bew, tweets that they think UK interest rates will remain at 0.5% until 2019 In another sign of unease, shares in UK chipmaker ARM Holdings have slipped by 4% to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard. ARM reports results on Wednesday, and analysts fear it is suffering from the slowdown in the US technology sector. Last week, Apple predicted that sales of the iPhone (which uses ARM chips) will start to fall later this year. Another UK tech firm called Imagination, which designs chips, warned this morning it will make an operating loss this year. It blamed a slowing market, and uncertainty over China. Peter Elston, chief investment officer at Seneca Investment Managers, argues that we\u2019re unlikely to be entering a recession yet. Recessions generally start because central banks are trying to restrain economies, he told Bloomberg TV this morning. But right now, inflation pressures are very low, and economies are still some way from full capacity. \u201cThis would be an extremely unusual place for a global recession to start.\u201d True. But arguably, we\u2019ve been in an \u201cextremely unusual place\u201d since the financial crisis, with central bank stimulus has been underpinning growth. Ultra-low interest rates helped struggling firms limp on and quantitative easing pumped up the stock market. Still, though, global growth is weak and vulnerable to the impact of higher US interest rates - unless the Fed changes course.... Shares in engine maker Rolls Royce have shed 2% at the start of trading, as the City braces for further problems. After hitting shareholders with five profit warnings in two years, Rolls-Royce could now slash its dividend when it posts its annual results on Friday. My colleague Graham Ruddick explains: The company has been hurt by cuts to defence spending by western governments, a fall in demand for corporate jets, and a slump in the oil price. European stock markets have begun the new week rather gingerly. The FTSE 100 index has gained 20 points, or 0.4%, but Germany\u2019s DAX is only up 0.1% and the French CAC is slightly lower. This fall in UK business confidence will only fuel concern that the global economy is slowing. Chris Weston of financial spread-betting firm IG says this is the biggest issue in the markets today. Will we see a recession in the US and other developed nations? There is little doubt this is the number one question being asked right now. He points out that insurance against company\u2019s defaulting has spiked in value recently, especially for banks. And the stock market turbulence, and the recent surge in the US dollar, show how financial conditions have deteriorated. If that feeds through to the real economy, we could be in serious trouble. As Chris puts it: The strong fear is this stress \u2013 that is clearly being felt in the financial markets \u2013 will start to filter through to Main Street. We have some worrying news to start the week -- confidence among UK executives has hit its lowest level since 2013. Concerns over Britain\u2019s upcoming EU referendum are adding to worries over the global economy. And business leaders now fear their companies are suffering. That\u2019s according to a regular survey conducted by BDO, the professional services firm. It warns that the UK is now suffering from problems in the global economy, particularly China\u2019s slowdown and signs of weakness in America. The turmoil in the Middle East is also hitting confidence. Peter Hemington, partner at BDO LLP, warns: \u201cGlobal headwinds are finally hitting business confidence and the added uncertainty of EU referendum just round the corner is fuelling concerns. This knocked BDO\u2019s Business Optimism Index \u2013 which predicts growth six months ahead \u2013 down to 100.0. That\u2019s the tipping point below which firms expect their output growth to drop under the long term trend rate. So what can be done? One option, the BDO says, is for the government to introduce a zero-rate of VAT on companies that sell their goods to exporters. Manufacturers could certainly use some help. The sector is already in recession, even though the wider UK economy grew by a solid-enough 0.5% in the final quarter of 2015. BDO found that manufacturing output contracted again this month, which it attribued to \u201cdecreasing global confidence\u201d. Dr Gerard Lyons, the Mayor London\u2019s economic advisor, points out that other measures were less gloomy: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It looks like a quiet start to the week, as investors wait to hear from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen. Yellen testifies to Congress on Wednesday and Thursday, and will give her take on the recent turmoil in the financial markets, and the state of the global economy. She\u2019s also likely to be questioned on whether the Fed was right to raise interest rates in December, and whether future hikes are now on the back-burner. It could be a tricky balancing act for Yellen; she won\u2019t want to fuel the current market angst, but nor can she sound complacent. Thomas Costerg, of Standard Chartered Bank in New York, predicts that Yellen will keep her options open regarding future interest rate rises: \u201cShe may emphasize the positives in the U.S. economy, particularly the still-strong labor market. Looking ahead, she may sound more cautious, and she will likely highlight that the negatives are mostly from abroad and that they are watching the global picture closely.\u201d City traders are also digesting the news that China burned through another $99.5bn in foreign exchange reserves last month, defending the yuan. That takes China\u2019s FX reserves down to their lowest level since 2012, although Beijing still has $3.23 trillion fo firepower. Those figures haven\u2019t alarmed Chinese investors, though, as they are now on holiday for the Chinese New Year. We\u2019re expecting a quiet start to trading in Europe, with the main indices expected to rise. And there\u2019s not much in the economic calendar today, apart from the monthly survey of eurozone Investor Confidence, from Sentix, at 9.30am GMT.",

                "bodyText":"Anxiety in global markets and a weakening US economy will force the Bank of England to delay UK interest rate rises until at least 2020, according to a leading firm of analysts. The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) forecast, which will cheer mortgage borrowers and disappoint savers, extends by at least three years the timeline for the central bank\u2019s first increase from the historically low 0.5%. Most analysts have forecast a first rise in the base rate for almost seven years towards the end of this year or early 2017. The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, said last month that the UK faced \u201ca powerful set of forces\u201d that prevented policymakers from raising rates.

However, that is sounding rather hollow right now. We see the continued inclusion of this text as an attempt to portray an open mind about the recent activity slowdown, and not to present a self-fulfilling picture of gloom at the Fed. Financial markets may see this as dovish speech overall, though probably not out of line with expectations.<br></p> <p>There was also a somewhat defensive paragraph justifying the December rate hike \u2013 we expect that once the questioning starts, Chair Yellen will come in for some stick from disgruntled members of Congress, some of whom may be facing a hostile electorate later this year.<br></p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-02-10T14:24:16.282Z\">at 2.24pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-56bb457ae4b084d24a9f080f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-10T14:14:49.558Z\">2.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One interpretation of Yellen\u2019s remarks on rates is that she is admitting they were raised too soon, says Augustin Eden at Accendo Markets.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A not unusually muted reaction to Fed Chair Janet Yellen\u2019s testimony this afternoon, given that she\u2019s come out and said \u2018financial conditions in the US have recently become less supportive of growth.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t take a 1<sup>st</sup> class physicist to recognise that this is essentially another way of saying \u2018we raised interest rates before we should have.\u2019</p> <p>Nothing had fundamentally changed in December, but the Fed decided to ignore the fundamentals and move US monetary policy to a place that\u2019s less supportive of growth.

In addition, the Committee recognized that it takes time for monetary policy actions to affect economic conditions.</p> <p>If the FOMC delayed the start of policy normalization for too long, it might have to tighten policy relatively abruptly in the future to keep the economy from overheating and inflation from significantly overshooting its objective. Such an abrupt tightening could increase the risk of pushing the economy into recession.</p> <p>It is important to note that even after this increase, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56bb413fe4b0dde64e262b88\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-10T13:56:21.252Z\">1.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Janet Yellen has also said that the Fed would slow the pace of interest rate hikes, if the threats to the US economy materialise.</strong></p> <p>She tells the Committee on Financial Services that:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In particular, stronger growth or a more rapid increase in inflation than the Committee currently anticipates would suggest that the neutral federal funds rate was rising more quickly than expected, making it appropriate to raise the federal funds rate more quickly as well.</p> <p>Conversely, if the economy were to disappoint, a lower path of the Federal funds rate would be appropriate. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-02-10T14:01:42.581Z\">at 2.01pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-56bb40aae4b0cc2320172517\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-10T13:53:23.888Z\">1.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The full testimony is <strong><a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/yellen20160210a.htm\">here</a></strong>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56bb3f58e4b0cc2320172512\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-10T13:51:11.148Z\">1.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Yellen: We'll probably only raise rates gradually</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Janet Yellen has also touched on the big issue dominating the markets - how quickly will interest rates rise?</strong><br></p> <p>She sounds cautious, but neither rules anything in or out (classic central banker)</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe FOMC anticipates that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate. </p> <p>In addition, the Committee expects that the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below the levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>(the FOMC, or Federal Open Market Committee, meets eight times a year to set US monetary policy)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Riccanomix/status/697412693775540224\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Yellen hints of slower rate hikes, hewing to tone of gradualism, but does not signal Fed on hold.</p>&mdash; Carl Riccadonna (@Riccanomix) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Riccanomix/status/697412693775540224\">February 10, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Riccanomix/status/697414195680251904\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Yellen acknowledges risks, but signals Fed on appropriate course--could move slower, but not turning back.</p>&mdash; Carl Riccadonna (@Riccanomix) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Riccanomix/status/697414195680251904\">February 10, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56bb3e3fe4b0dde64e262b77\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-10T13:46:31.039Z\">1.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Yellen: China slowdown could hurt America</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Janet Yellen has also warned that \u201cforeign economic developments\u201d could harm the US economy.</strong><br></p> <p>In her testimony to Congress, the Fed chair singles out concerns about the slowdown in China. </p> <p>That has already caused \u201cincreased volatility in global financial markets\u201d, and \u201cexacerbated concerns about the outlook for global growth\u201d, says Yellen.</p> <p>She adds: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>These growth concerns, along with strong supply conditions and high inventories, contributed to the recent fall in the prices of oil and other commodities.

                "bodyText":"That\u2019s all for tonight, after another lively day. A quick reminder of the key points. Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen has warned that the turmoil in the markets could hurt the US economy. She hinted the interest rates will only rise slowly, but tried to dampen speculation that the Fed could cut borrowing costs. Here\u2019s our summary of her testimony to Congress. The Dow Jones index closed down 99 points after Yellen spoke. The dollar weakened, as traders anticipated more dovish monetary policy this year. European markets had rallied back from two-year lows, on hopes that the recent selloff had gone to far. Bank shares led the rebound, with Deutsche Bank gaining 10%, after Germany\u2019s heavyweight began planning to buy back debt to strengthen its financial position. Credit Suisse boss Tidjane Thiam became the latest top bank executive to call for calm. He argued that banks are in much better shape than before the 2008 crisis. But Australia\u2019s market earlier fell into bear territory, having lost 20% since its recent high last April. Japan\u2019s Nikkei also suffered losses on Wednesday. The International Monetary Fund threatened to pull the plug on Ukraine\u2019s bailout. It wants its government to cleans our corruption and implements reforms. And new data showed that Europe\u2019s factory sector had a bad December; Britain\u2019s industrial output fell by 1.1% during the month. Goodnight! GW It now seems pretty unlikely that the Fed will risk raising interest rates in March, for fear of throwing fuel on the fire. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, says: As most analysts spotted, the key phrase in Janet Yellen\u2019s testimony was when she said conditions in the US had become \u201cless supportive of growth\u201d. That suggested a Fed belief that the drop in share prices will slow the economy but not derail it completely. Yellen\u2019s wait-and-see approach means that a March increase in interest rates is now off the agenda, but the Fed will require more evidence before abandoning its strategy of cautious tightening. With the spectre of 2008 looming larger, that evidence may not be long in coming. Here\u2019s our US colleague\u2019s Jana Kasperkevic\u2019s take on Janet Yellen\u2019s testimony: And here\u2019s a flavour: In her first major speech for two months, Yellen sought to tread a fine line, acknowledging the threat posed by the financial tremors while at the same time pointing out that the US had continued to recover from the deep recession of 2008-09. The Fed chief said: \u201cThe economy is in many ways close to normal.\u201d Specifically, Yellen pointed out that the unemployment rate had declined to below 5%, which many of her Fed colleagues consider to be full employment, and that inflation was likely to move up to 2%. What was not normal, she said, were the federal funds rates, which had to be held for seven years at \u201cexceptionally low levels\u201d. Yellen added that oil prices, steady job creation and faster wage growth should support growth of incomes and consumer spending. \u201cAgainst this backdrop, the committee expects that with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace in coming years and that labour market indicators will continue to strengthen,\u201d she said....(click here for more) Janet Yellen makes the front page of the Financial Times, with her warning about deteriorating financial conditions threatening the US recovery: Another turbulent day in the financial markets is over! And the Dow Jones index has finished in the red, losing 99 points or 0.6% to finish at 15,914, as investors digested Janet Yellen\u2019s testimony. As we covered earlier (summary here), the Fed chair warned that financial conditions have worsened, which could mean future interest rate hikes come more slowly. But she also said she didn\u2019t see rates being cut again. The broader S&amp;P 500 index was unchanged, while the Nasdaq inched up a bit. That means Wall Street failed to match the early rally in Europe, where shares rebounded from two year lows. That followed a weak Asia-Pacific region; earlier, Australia\u2019s market fell into bear territory, and Japan\u2019s Nikkei lost another 2%. Janet Yellen\u2019s hearing at Congress was also attended by a group of protesters from the Fed Up campaign, who oppose December\u2019s rate hike. Wearing green t-shirts reading \u201cRecovery, What Recovery?\u201d, they sat behind the Fed chief during the session in a reminder that the public aren\u2019t too happy about economic conditions right now. A quiet end to the session? That would be too much to ask. A sudden bout of selling has hit Wall Street, sending the Dow down around 100 points, or 0.6%.... The dollar has fallen against the yen, hitting a 15-month low. That indicates traders are calculating that the Fed will be more cautious about interest rate rises, after Yellen said financial conditions had become less supportive for growth. Yellen also managed to reassure investors, says Richard Sichel, chief investment officer of Philadelphia Trust Co. Sichel told Reuters that the Fed chair managed to spur some bargain hunting, even through she also flagged up economic risks: \u201cWhat Yellen said has been taken positively. Stocks in general are cheaper now than they were three days ago or three months ago, so there\u2019s an opportunity to step in.\u201d Cornerstone Macro analyst Roberto Perli believes Janet Yellen managed to leave her monetary policy options open, even though few investors expect many rate hikes this year. Perli says: \u201cThe general message she intended to deliver is that additional rate hikes remain the base case, but markets have to stabilize before we see more.\u201d The US stock market is holding onto its earlier gains, after Janet Yellen completed her appearance at Congress. The S&amp;P 500 is up almost 1%, following the earlier rally in Europe. Joshua Mahony, Market Analyst at IG, says Yellen gave a \u201cmixed testimony\u201d. Her acknowledgement that a Chinese-centred slowdown is detrimentally impacting US growth expectations was offset by yet another reference to a plan for steady and gradual rate rises going forward. A few photos of today\u2019s session: Capital Economics says that Janet Yellen is still more hawkish about interest rate policy than the markets. They write: Fed Chair Janet Yellen\u2019s testimony to Congress today revealed that, while the FOMC might not be ready to raise interest rates for a second time in March, she still anticipates a \u201cgradual\u201d series of rate hikes over the next couple of years. That view is clearly at odds with futures markets, which imply that any additional rate hikes are almost now off the table. Let\u2019s recap the main points from today\u2019s hearing at the Financial Services committee over the last three (long...) hours. 1) Janet Yellen has warned Congress that the global financial turbulence is threatening the US economic recovery. She cited the weakening financial conditions in America, following recent turmoil in the financial markets. \u201cThese developments, if they prove persistent, could weigh on the outlook for economic activity and the labour market, although declines in longer-term interest rates and oil prices provide some offset.\u201d One analyst saw that as an admission that the Fed perhaps shouldn\u2019t have raised interest rates two months ago. 2) But despite this, the Fed chair did not suggest she will reverse course on interest rates. She defended December\u2019s rate hike, arguing that the economy was strong enough to support slightly higher borrowing costs. And she also insisted that any future rises will be heavily dependent on economic performance -- if things deteriorate, the Fed rate will stay exceptionally low for longer. She doesn\u2019t expect to actually cut rate, though, which suggests the Fed isn\u2019t panicking about the situation. 3) But could the Fed go negative, following Japan and the eurozone? Crucially, Yellen indicated that this isn\u2019t really on the agenda yet. She pointed out that the Fed may not have the legal authority to impose negative rates; you\u2019d think this would have been cleared up, if the Fed was really worried. This was the key quote: \u201cI am not aware of anything that would prevent us from doing it but I am saying that we have not fully investigated the legal issues - that still needs to be done.\u201d 4) Yellen have her clearest warning yet about China. She said the financial instability, and plunging commodity prices, caused by its slowing economy was a key threat to the US. 5) But she also tried to remain positive about economic conditions, saying she sees signs of wage growth increasing. \u201cThere are some hopeful signs but I think if the labor market continues to progress we are very hopeful we will see faster progress on wages.\u201d She also argued that families are better off than in 2008, when the financial crisis struck. 6) The Committee raised several other important issues with Yellen; they fear that small challenger banks are being disadvantaged, and want the Fed to release the transcripts of its meetings from 2012, to assist a leak inquiry. Despite Sean Duffy\u2019s best efforts, he only got a holding reply from the Federal Reserve\u2019s top official. The Fed was also criticised for not doing enough to bring down African-American unemployment, and for never even having an African-American regional bank chief. Yellen agreed this is disappointing. And several Representatives challenged Yellen over the state of the domestic economy, pointing out that not enough well-paying \u2018middle-class\u2019 jobs are being created. One was even moved to verse (yes, it was that kind of day....) Congress chair Jeb Hensarling says members have five days to submit further questions for Yellen to respond to. And with that the meeting is adjourned. John Delaney of Maryland says when rates were raised in December, it was based on an improving economy. A lot has happened since then in the markets. When you look at the data now, does it change your view on economic activity and gowth Yellen: The answer is maybe, but the jury is out. We continue to see progress in labour market. GDP growth clearly slowed a lot in the fourth quarter. My expectation is it will pick up in this quarter but financial conditions have tightened which could have implications. Then, we said the risks to outlook were balanced. In January said we were assessing the implications. This is what we\u2019re doing at this point. Has there been a contraction in credit availability recently? Yellen: We haven\u2019t seen this really at this stage. Spreads on lower graded bonds have been widening... When we surveyed banks we\u2019ve seen a tightening of.. loans. This is something that bears watching. There will be additional data before we meet in March [The next Fed meeting}. Andy Barr of Kentucky is asking about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and its funding. Yellen seems unsure of the answers, and starts packing her bag. Keith Ellison of Minnesota also brings up the subject of the high levels of black unemployment. He says this needs the attention of the Fed chair. Is there adequate discussion of Afro-American workers within Fed discussions and if not, what can be done. Yellen: It is of course important we look at different groups, particularly those suffering most in the labour market. Our tools are not ones that can be targeted at particular groups in labour market. Ellison wants Fed to realise not all US citizens are experiencing this upturn. Yellen: We should pay adequate attention to different groups. Unemployment rate is only one measure of what\u2019s happening, appropriate for us to do more detailed assessment. Congressman Ed Perlmutter of Colorado ( a Democrat) praises Yellen (and the President) and asks how we can do better. Yellen: Our objective is to try to make sure the picture shows continuing improvement. The signs of wage growth increasing are tentative but hopeful.. and we will try to keep that progress growing. Inflation [should] move up over time [towards our target]. Some of burden should also be on Congress. Job training, educational programmes... are Congress\u2019s job to address. Perlmutter: Soft spot in the economy is oil and gas. Saudis are pumping like crazy into an oversupplied market. Good for pump prices but causes job losses. Yellen: We\u2019re taking account of fact that energy sector is hard hit, we\u2019re losing jobs there. But it is a pretty small sector of the workforces. It is rippling through to manufacturing. But average household is saving $1000 a year {so that is having a positive effect} Robert Pittenger of North Carolina says the economic recovery is dismal despite all these accommodative policies. Is real unemployment not 10% not 4.9%? Yellen barely gets a chance to begin answering before Pittenger steps in again and his time runs out. Wiliam Clay of Missouri says the Fed is more focussed on inflation than unemployment. Yellen: We have both targets and take issue with idea we are not focussed on the unemployment objective... We continue to have accommodative monetary policy. Mia Love of Utah asks about implications of European financial instability, and ECB and Fed using different policies Yellen: The ECB is dealing with inflation falling well beyond their goal...US has done better, is among the strongest economies. It\u2019s put [upward] pressure on dollar, harming manufacturing and exports. Maxine Waters is back and is back with the topic of big banks receiving support from the Fed. Yellen: It\u2019s an essential tool we need to adjust the rate of short term interest rates. We have 2.5trn dollars of reserves compared to 20 to 30 billion during the financial crisis. If we have to use another technique, we will be likely forced to shrink our balance sheet and.. it would have adverse effects on the economy. David Scott of Georgia disagrees when Yellen says Fed can\u2019t target unemployment, pointing out the large unemployment rate among Afro-Americans. He says Fed has historically downplayed unemployment, nor has Fed ever had an Afro-American as head of one of the regional Fed banks. Yellen: We recognise how serious the problems are and we take our employment mandate extremely seriously, we have been doing everything to promote a strong labour market which would benefit Afro-Americans. She agrees there should be an Afro-American head and regrets there has not been. Ed Royce from California: Are negative rates a tool in the tool box? (He says a recent bank stress test from the Fed suggests this might be being looked at). Yellen: ECB and Japan have gone to negative rates. We have had periods of market stress where we see flight into US Treasury bonds as safe haven. We have set stress tests for banks to look at if Treasuries go negative, this may happen without Fed necessarily setting negative rates. Ruben Hinojosa of Texas asks what else could we do to boost economy. Yellen: Productivity growth has been disappointing since the financial crisis. The debt situation facing the country needs to be addressed by Congress. As population ages debt to GDP ratio will be on an unsustainable course. Hinojosa asks about addressing inequality. Yellen: We don\u2019t have policies that target specific groups, main thing we can do is make sure labour market is working well. There is further to go. Sean Duffy of Wisconsin, as head of oversight committee is complaining Yellen does not always respond to requests from the committee on compliance issues (in particular documents on possible leaks) and says she has ignored subpoenas. Yellen: We have some concern with providing transcripts since they relate to monetary policy. We will consider this and get back to you. Duffy: This is about a leak, will you let me know why I am not entitled to these documents? I sent a letter a year ago. You knew I would ask. Why will you not provide documents. This is about the internal working of the Fed, not market moving documents. Yellen: I think we have complied fully.. Duffy: What would you do if you wanted this from a bank [but were ignored]. I can imagine what Fed would do. I expect these documents to come over. The discussion ends after a point of order is made about the subpoena and dismissed. European markets are closing in positive territory but on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has now slipped back and is down around 12 points. Gregory Meeks of New York asks if Yellen thinks the position is better now than in 2008. Yellen: I believe it is. We\u2019ve made a lot of progress although there are a lot of challenges, a lot of households are suffering. Elsewhere oil is on the rise - Brent is now up 2.7% at $31.15 a barrel - after US crude stockpiles fell unexpectedly last week. Crude inventories dropped 754,000 barrels compared to expectations of a 3.6m barrel rise. Blaine Luetkemeyer from Missouri asks what Fed could do if there is another downturn. Yellen says there are a number of tools including interest rates, but Luetkemeyer rightly points out that rates are almost as low as they can go (even with the recent hike). Brad Sherman of California: Are you going to break up the too big to fail institutions? To make sure it\u2019s not \u201ctoo big to jail\u201d? Yellen: We are using our powers to make sure a systemically important institution could fail without having a systemic effect. Maloney asks: Given the market turmoil and slowing US economy, some analysts are suggesting a possible recession. What would it take to cut rates again? Yellen: Our commitment is to achieve goals of maximum employment and price stability. I do not expect the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) will soon be in a situation to cut rates. The Labour market continues to perform well. Many of the factors factors holding down inflation are transitory. There is always a risk of recession, global developments could produce a slowdown, but don\u2019t want to jump to premature conclusions. I don\u2019t think it will be necessary to cut rates. But if it turned out to be necessary, the FOMC would do what was necessary. Carolyn Maloney of New York asks: Has the turmoil in global markets changed your view on the pace of interest rate rises? Yellen: We are watching very carefully what is happening in global financial markets. The stresses we have seen since the turn of the year relate to uncertainties over Chinese exchange rate policy, the price of oil.. We have not seen shifts that seem significant enough to have driven the sharp move in markets. It seems to be increased fears of recession risk. We have not yet seen a sharp drop off in growth, globally or in the US. Global market developments bear watching. We recognised these developments may have implications for the outlook, which we are currently assessing. Monetary policy is not on a preset course. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina: Does Fed have legal authority to move into negative rates. Yellen: The FOMC considered this around 2010, we were exploring our options. We decided not to lower interest rates into negative territory. Didn\u2019t fully look at legal issues. We would stilll need to investigate more thoroughly. Don\u2019t know any restriction that would prevent us doing it. But we have not fully investigated legal issues. Moore says is there moral hazard in not a single person involved in 2008 crash going to jail. Yellen: I do not think individuals guilty of wrongdoing should escape appropriate penalties. We cannot put in place criminal penalties. We can make sure they are not allowed to work at banking organisations where they committed misdeeds, and in many cases they can be banned from working. We always co-operated with Department of Justice. Gwen Moore from Wisconsin is concerned about small banks. She asks how the rules should have been tailored for small banks, saying \u201cstress tests, capital constraints are killing our small banks.\u201d Yellen says: Community banks and their vitality are exceptionally important. The burden on community banks is intense. We are focussed on doing everything we can to reduce that. What will the world have to look like for a rule based system, asks Mulvaney. Yellen says guidelines from rules are looked at but we should not mechanically follow rules, we need to take into account a large set of indicators. Following on from that, Mick Mulvaney asks if the economy is now normal. Yellen says: The economy in many ways is close to normal... inflation is below 2% but there is a good reason to think it will move up over time. But the neutral level of federal funds rate is by no means normal. We have needed for 7 years to hold the federal funds rate at exceptionally low levels to achieve growth of 2% and in that sense it is not normal. Maxine Waters asks what alternative processes could there be to the Fed paying billions to banks on excess reserves when it raises interest rates. The Fed uses IOER (interest on excess reserves) and Yellen defends the use of this system even though it pays commercial banks above market interest rates. Now for the questions. Chair Jeb Hensarling brings up a recent bill that would require the Fed to follow a rules-based monetary policy, which Yellen opposes but a number of economists have backed in a letter. Yellen is against it because it could jeopardise its independence from political pressure. The two sides are basically just repeated their existing stance on the issue. Markets are moving much higher now even though Yellen has just so far repeated her statement. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 151 points or 0.9%. (Unsurprisingly it\u2019s taking longer than five minutes - the statement is here if you want to follow along). Yellen now gets five minutes to present her testimony, and is reading her statement. The session is underway, and can be viewed live here. Opening remarks come from chairman Jeb Hensarling - who says he will not use the session to criticise the Fed\u2019s decision to raise rates - followed by a number of members of Congress including Maxine Waters and Soth Carolina\u2019s Mick Mulvaney. Congress, waiting for Yellen. The US economy is strong enough to see through this period of turbulence, says economist Harm Bandholz at UniCredit after Yellen\u2019s testimony: In a nutshell: Chair Yellen has, correctly in our view, highlighted the solid fundamentals of the US economy. Accordingly, her baseline outlook for both the economy and monetary policy have not changed. That said, recent developments in financial markets as well as in the global economy have clouded the picture. In this environment, Fed officials prefer to take a step back and wait. Once the clouds have lifted, the gradual normalization of interest rates will continue. Yes, there are risks out there \u2013 and the longer the financial market rout lasts, the bigger the risk that it will become self-fulfilling \u2013, but we believe that fundamentals are solid enough to carry the economy through this period. And this also seems to be the Fed\u2019s view. Accordingly, the fact that financial markets do not expect the next rate hike before the second quarter of 2017 seems well overdone. Well, it\u2019s not a ringing endorsement of Janet Yellen\u2019s comments but US markets have opened in positive territory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 59 points or 0.39%, while at the open the S&amp;P 500 added 0.5%. But the tech-heavy Nasdaq has outperformed, up 1.1%. The dollar has reacted to Yellen\u2019s comments as if more rate rises this year - perhaps even in March - could indeed be on the cards despite the worries about global growth. The US currency has risen 0.25% against a basket of currencies, up from a near four month low on Tuesday. The euro fell 0.5% after the release of the testimony, while sterling has dropped from $1.4560 to $1.4484. Janet Yellen\u2019s testimony might appear to leave the door open for further rate rises, but she is likely to be quizzed sharply about the last one, says Rob Carnell at ING Bank. In his initial thoughts he says: In summary \u2013 Yellen retains an open mind on the need for further tightening, though with a heavy skew of risks to the downside, and was defensive about the December rate hike: The mercifully short prepared statement of Fed Chair Yellen to the House Committee on Financial Services did not contain much that was new from earlier speeches, statements or minutes. To the extent that any new material was used, this was mainly an expansion of the risks from softer overseas demand, with China explicitly mentioned, and also from financial market tightening (stronger USD, higher yields on riskier assets and lower equity prices, offset to some extent by lower bond yields and oil prices). The testimony retained the text about the possibility that rates might have to be increased at a faster than anticipated rate if growth and inflation were stronger than expected. However, that is sounding rather hollow right now. We see the continued inclusion of this text as an attempt to portray an open mind about the recent activity slowdown, and not to present a self-fulfilling picture of gloom at the Fed. Financial markets may see this as dovish speech overall, though probably not out of line with expectations. There was also a somewhat defensive paragraph justifying the December rate hike \u2013 we expect that once the questioning starts, Chair Yellen will come in for some stick from disgruntled members of Congress, some of whom may be facing a hostile electorate later this year. One interpretation of Yellen\u2019s remarks on rates is that she is admitting they were raised too soon, says Augustin Eden at Accendo Markets. A not unusually muted reaction to Fed Chair Janet Yellen\u2019s testimony this afternoon, given that she\u2019s come out and said \u2018financial conditions in the US have recently become less supportive of growth.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t take a 1st class physicist to recognise that this is essentially another way of saying \u2018we raised interest rates before we should have.\u2019 Nothing had fundamentally changed in December, but the Fed decided to ignore the fundamentals and move US monetary policy to a place that\u2019s less supportive of growth. It now appears the markets chose to ignore the Fed in January, preferring the fundamentals, and what do you know? The markets were right \u2013 they\u2019ve been reacting to this testimony for the past four weeks. An economist\u2019s view on Yellen\u2019s comments: Yellen also, as indeed she has to, defended the December decision to raise interest rates. Many have judged that to be a mistake, especially in the wake of the market turbulence and fears about global growth and stresses on the banks which have dominated the headlines so far this year. Yellen suggested that if a pre-emptive rate rise was not implemented, a sharper increase may well have been necessary in the future which could have pushed the economy into recession: The decision in December to raise the federal funds rate reflected the Committee\u2019s assessment that, even after a modest reduction in policy accommodation, economic activity would continue to expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators would continue to strengthen. Although inflation was running below the Committee\u2019s longer-run objective, the FOMC judged that much of the softness in inflation was attributable to transitory factors that are likely to abate over time, and that diminishing slack in labor and product markets would help move inflation toward 2 percent. In addition, the Committee recognized that it takes time for monetary policy actions to affect economic conditions. If the FOMC delayed the start of policy normalization for too long, it might have to tighten policy relatively abruptly in the future to keep the economy from overheating and inflation from significantly overshooting its objective. Such an abrupt tightening could increase the risk of pushing the economy into recession. It is important to note that even after this increase, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative Janet Yellen has also said that the Fed would slow the pace of interest rate hikes, if the threats to the US economy materialise. She tells the Committee on Financial Services that: In particular, stronger growth or a more rapid increase in inflation than the Committee currently anticipates would suggest that the neutral federal funds rate was rising more quickly than expected, making it appropriate to raise the federal funds rate more quickly as well. Conversely, if the economy were to disappoint, a lower path of the Federal funds rate would be appropriate. The full testimony is here. Janet Yellen has also touched on the big issue dominating the markets - how quickly will interest rates rise? She sounds cautious, but neither rules anything in or out (classic central banker) \u201cThe FOMC anticipates that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate. In addition, the Committee expects that the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below the levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.\u201d (the FOMC, or Federal Open Market Committee, meets eight times a year to set US monetary policy) Janet Yellen has also warned that \u201cforeign economic developments\u201d could harm the US economy. In her testimony to Congress, the Fed chair singles out concerns about the slowdown in China. That has already caused \u201cincreased volatility in global financial markets\u201d, and \u201cexacerbated concerns about the outlook for global growth\u201d, says Yellen. She adds: These growth concerns, along with strong supply conditions and high inventories, contributed to the recent fall in the prices of oil and other commodities. In turn, low commodity prices could trigger financial stresses in commodity-exporting economies, particularly in vulnerable emerging market economies, and for commodity-producing firms in many countries. Should any of these downside risks materialize, foreign activity and demand for U.S. exports could weaken and financial market conditions could tighten further.\u201d Newsflash: The Federal Reserve has just released Janet Yellen\u2019s prepared testimony, ahead of this afternoon\u2019s grilling from Congress in 90 minute time. The Fed chief is striking a cautious note about economic prospects, warning that: \u201cFinancial conditions in the United States have recently become less supportive of growth, with declines in broad measures of equity prices, higher borrowing rates for riskier borrowers, and a further appreciation of the dollar. These developments, if they prove persistent, could weigh on the outlook for economic activity and the labor market, although declines in longer-term interest rates and oil prices provide some offset. But Yellen also points to \u201congoing employment gains and faster wage growth\u201d, which should push real incomes higher. She also suggests that global economic growth should \u201cpick up over time\u201d, helped by \u201chighly accommodative monetary policies abroad\u201d [such as Japan and the eurozone]. And the Fed chief remains confident about medium-term growth prospects, saying: Against this backdrop, the Committee expects that with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace in coming years and that labor market indicators will continue to strengthen.\u201d Inequality is one of the issues of our age. Bernie Sanders is building a presidential bid by fighting it, and charities like Oxfam regularly warn that the rich are taking more and more of the cake. Now, credit ratings agency S&amp;P has warned that quantitative easing (QE), a key weapon used in the financial crisis, is widening inequality and the wealth gap between young and old. Under QE, central banks buy assets such as government bonds with new money, driving up the cost of safe assets and encouraging investors into riskier ones (this is the theor, anyway) But it\u2019s also hurting those who don\u2019t own assets, as S&amp;P explains: Quantitative easing (QE) stabilized the economy but also exacerbated wealth disparity between rich and poor, mainly by boosting financial asset prices and house prices. During the U.K.\u2019s recent \u201cjobs-rich, pay-poor\u201d economic recovery, strong employment gains were accompanied by a further rise of already high wage dispersion and an ever-growing share of part-time employment in lower income groups. Between 2006 and 2008 (before QE) and 2010-2012 (after QE started), average wealth held directly in stocks increased by 55% for the wealthiest 10% and by 130% for wealthiest 1% of U.K. households. In the context of the tight housing market, low interest rates and QE are among the drivers behind the widening wealth and income gap between younger and older generations and between those on the housing ladder and those not on it. European markets are sailing higher, up over 2% on average, reversing six days of steady losses which dragged them to a two year low. But the rally looks could unravel, depending on how the chair of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen, performs at Congress in a couple of hours time. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains: Talk of Deutsche Bank doing an emergency bond-buyback to shore up its finances and relieve worried creditors has seen the German bank\u2019s shares rally by over 10%, lifting the rest of the banking sector. In a way it\u2019s a bit of deju vu from yesterday when markets initially rose thanks to news from Deutsche Bank before financial and commodity sectors led to a spectacular roll-over. There is plenty of scope for another sharp twist in the direction of markets today around 3pm GMT when fed Chair Janet Yellen gives her testimony to the House Financial Services Committee. Investors can\u2019t get enough of Deutsche Bank today. Its shares jumped 17% at one stage this morning, fuelled by reports that it will launch a debt buy-back offer soon. That move would show Deutsche\u2019s financial muscle and calm fears over its ability to meet debt repayments and dividends. Supportive words from Berlin\u2019s finance ministry today may also have helped, along with Deutsche management\u2019s insistence yesterday that the bank is \u201crock solid\u201d. But Deutsche\u2019s problems are not suddenly solved. There are still fears over the quality of the bank\u2019s assets (it is trading at around half its book value). An economic downturn would inflict further losses. Deutsche made a \u20ac6.8bn loss last year, showing the struggles in the banking sector. Newish CEO John Cryan is trying to clean the bank up, following fines for various scandals. But it could face further provisions in the future. There are fears that banks will suffer if eurozone interest rates are cut deeper into negative territory. That would eat into profits, penalising them for leaving cash at the ECB. It would also force prices of government bonds even higher, meaning banks would get an even lower rate of return (if anything). It\u2019s been a bad morning for UK modelmaker Hornby. The miniature train firm, which also owns racing car outfit Scalextric and aeroplane kitmaker Airfix, hit investors with another profit warning today. It also admitted it could breach its loan agreements with its banks - never a good sign. And there was nothing small about the market reaction - Hornby shares have tanked by over 40%. TV presenter James May (who loves toys of a certain generation), has urged the British people to act now, while there\u2019s still time. This might dampen the mood in the markets. The head of the International Monetary Fund has warned that Ukraine could lose financial support unless its government gets serious about cleaning up and reforming its economy. IMF chief Christine Lagarde declared: \u201cI am concerned about Ukraine\u2019s slow progress in improving governance and fighting corruption, and reducing the influence of vested interests in policymaking. Without a substantial new effort to invigorate governance reforms and fight corruption, it is hard to see how the IMF-supported program can continue and be successful. Ukraine risks a return to the pattern of failed economic policies that has plagued its recent history. It is vital that Ukraine\u2019s leadership acts now to put the country back on a promising path of reform.\u201d The IMF agreed to a $17.5bn bailout program for cash-strapped Ukraine last year, but has held back a $1.7bn payment since last autumn due to concerns over corruption. Those fears were inflamed when economy minister Aivaras Abromavicius resigned last week, saying it was impossible to implement reforms. He claimed he was under pressure to appoint government cronies to key positions, continuing Ukraine\u2019s well-known problems with graft and vested interests. Ukrainian government bonds have already tumbled in value recently, to levels suggesting a high risk of default or restructuring. Context is everything.... There are encouraging signs from New York. Wall Street is expected to rally when trading begins, just over three hours time. The Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 are tipped to rise by 1%, while the Nasdaq is being called 1.6% higher. The German government has reiterated that it is not worried about Deutsche Bank. A finance ministry spokeswoman told reporters in Berlin that: \u201cYou heard the short sentence that the minister [finance minister Wolfgang Schuable] said yesterday in Paris that he is not concerned, I don\u2019t have anything to add to that.\u201d European banking shares are surging, lead by Deutsche Bank which has jumped by 15%. Investors seem to be regaining their nerve, having been gripped with worries over the financial sector. Rumours that Deutsche is planning to strengthen its financial position by buying back some debt have also helped the mood. Economic jitters are also being eased, with the oil price up 1.5% today. Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, explains: Despite another poor session overnight, markets in the UK and Europe have rallied impressively. Banks are surging higher, with Deutsche shrugging off the woes of yesterday as investors take the opportunity to buy on weakness once again. A better performance from the oil price and heavily oversold conditions in a number of markets, plus expectations regarding Janet Yellen\u2019s appearance later in the day have provided bulls with the chance to reverse some of the heavy losses seen so far in February. The main European banking index has gained 5% today. A decent rally - but it still leaves shares down 23% so far this year. And although we\u2019ve heard supportive words from Deutsche CEO John Cryan and German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble yesterday, nothing has really changed. The head of Swiss bank Credit Suisse has launched a full-throated defence of the banking sector, in an attempt to calm fears of a new crisis. Tidjane Thiam told the Financial Times that: \u201cThe banking system in general is much stronger than in 2008, 2009 [but] there are a lot of memories of that period. \u201cSome of the scenes we are seeing today are not justified . . . Banks are smaller, they are deleveraged, they are less risky, they are better capitalised.\u201d Thiam was speaking after Credit Suisse shares slumped to their lowest in more than two decades yesterday. He told the FT that Credit Suisse has \u201cno liquidity issues\u201d, and a \u201cstrong balance sheet\u201d. And investors may have heeded his words. Credit Suisse shares have jumped by 5%, as part of a wider rally in bank shares.... The slump in UK industrial production may show that Britain\u2019s economy is weaker than we thought. Economist Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight explains: December\u2019s sharp drop in industrial production will fuel concerns about the UK economic outlook as well as the unbalanced nature of growth. It will also likely harden views that the Bank of England will not be raising interest rates during 2016. However, we believe it remains highly unlikely that the Bank of England will cut interest rates. The ONS estimated last month that the UK grew by 0.5% in the last quarter of 2015. Sky News\u2019s Ed Conway reckons this could be cut: Ouch. Britain has suffered its biggest fall in industrial output since September 2012. It\u2019s another sign of weakening economic demand \u2013 one of the main triggers for the recent market turmoil. UK industrial production shrank by 1.1% month-on-month in December, according to new figures from the Office for National Statistics. That was primarily caused by a 4.6% plunge in oil and gas extraction, and a 4% drop in mining. But British manufacturing also suffered, with output down by 0.2% month-on-month and 1.7% lower than in December 2014. Alarmingly, the UK isn\u2019t alone either. France and Italy have also reported sharp falls in factory output this morning, and Germany did the same yesterday. It fuels fears that the global economy ended 2015 with a whimper, not a bang. Shares across Europe are picking up pace, as investors shake off some of their gloom. The FTSE 100 is now up 43 points, or 0.8%, and there are bigger gains over the channel. Germany\u2019s DAX has leapt by 1.8%, as worries over Deutsche Bank recede this morning. Francois Savary, chief investment officer at Geneva-based Prime Partners, says: \u201cThe rebound in Deutsche Bank is helping to reassure some investors who had been concerned about possible contagion in the banking sector.\u201d The slump in profits at shipping magnate A.P. Moller\u2013Maersk [details] hasn\u2019t caused much alarm. It\u2019s quite a different picture than we saw in the Asia-Pacific markets a few hours ago: But there is still a lot of anxiety around, as investors prepare to hear from the head of the Federal Reserve when she testifies to Congress this afternoon. Janet Yellen may concede that the Fed is unlikely to raise borrowing costs four times this year, as it originally expected. But if she sounds too worried, that could spark another bout of market mayhem. It\u2019s a tricky balancing act, says Ilya Spivak, currency strategist at DailyFX. He reckons Yellen will try to avoid saying too much. it ought to be kept in mind that the markets want to be reassured. This injects a degree of wishful thinking into the equation. F or her part, the Fed Chair will almost certainly refrain from plain-spoken commitment on the direction of policy. Here\u2019s the worst-performing companies in Australia today, who helped to drag its stock market more than 20% below its recent peak. Mesoblast, the biggest faller, is an adult stem cell research firm. Many of the other fallers are natural resource and energy companies (including Liquified Natural Gas, Western Areas, Karoon Gas and Whitehaven Coal) Deutsche Bank is climbing higher! The Wall Street Journal has a good take on how Australia\u2019s banks helped drag the country\u2019s stocks into a bear market today. \u201cThis is the first sustained bear market I have seen since the GFC [global financial crisis],\u201d said Evan Lucas, a market strategist at brokerage IG in Melbourne, noting the S&amp;P/ASX 200 briefly was in bear territory in 2011. Australia\u2019s major banks, which are some of the biggest stocks on the S&amp;P/ASX 200 and have a large index weighting, have been caught in a global bank-share selloff this week, despite their having less exposure to liquidity risks compared with peers in the U.S. and Europe and substantially less reliance on the long end of the bond curve and wholesale funding, Mr. Lucas said. Still, worries about banks globally have only exacerbated a decline for local lenders. The financials subindex has lost 14% this year as brokers have flagged concerns about the sustainability of the industry\u2019s attractive dividends as Australia\u2019s economy remains subdued and signs emerge that the property market is beginning to cool. More here: Australia Shares Fall Into Bear Market It\u2019s not all the fault of the banks, though. Mining stocks have also tumbled, in response to waning demand for commodities from China. BHP Billiton, for example, has fallen 12% since the start of January. Resource companies are now cutting thousands of jobs, in response to falling prices for coal, iron ore, zinc, nickel, copper and bauxite. Australia\u2019s fall into bear market territory today has sent another cloud of gloom over the City of London. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx sums up the mood: Once again the European indices are enduring the aftermath of a rocky Asian session, the Nikkei plunging to a 16 month low following a 2nd day of heavy losses, with the added concern of a bear market-entering night for the Australian markets thrown in for good measure. A red-washed commodity sector is dragging the index down at the moment, though if Brent Crude can see a sustained climb above $31 per barrel (with the US crude inventories arriving this afternoon) sentiment may be able to shift as the day goes on. Danish shipping and oil conglomerate A.P. Moller\u2013Maersk is getting a kicking. Shares in the group have slumped by 7.5%, making it the worst stock in Europe today, after it reported a fourth-quarter net loss due to impairments of $2.6 billion on its oil assets. The global slowdown is hurting the firm. Demand for shipping goods overseas has fallen, just as new ships ordered years ago come into service. Shares in Deutsche Bank have jumped by over 4% at the start of trading, amid rumours that it is planning new steps to reassure investors about its financial health. The Financial Times set the hare running last night, reporting that: Deutsche Bank is considering buying back several billion euros of its debt, as Germany\u2019s biggest bank steps up efforts to shore up the tumbling value of its securities against the backdrop of a broader rout of financial stocks. After European banks suffered a second consecutive day of sharp falls, Deutsche Bank is expected to focus its emergency buyback plan on senior bonds, of which it has about \u20ac50bn in issue, according to the bank. The move was unlikely to involve so-called contingent convertible bonds [cocos] which, along with the bank\u2019s shares, have been the butt of a brutal investor sell-off in recent days, people briefed on the plan said. Banks can generate capital gains by buying back bonds at a discount to their face value. More here: Deutsche Bank considers multibillion bond buyback European stock markets are crawling higher in early trading, after two days of hefty falls. The FTSE 100 index of major blue-chip London shares is 26 points higher (+0.3%), led by mining group Anglo American (up 3%). The other European markets are also gaining a little ground, with Spain\u2019s IBEX up 1.1% and the French CAC up 0.7%. So, not exactly a big rally. Traders will be hoping it lasts, after seeing fears over the global economy take hold on Tuesday. I suspect they\u2019ll try to sit tight until Fed chair Janet Yellen testifies to Congress in 7 hours time. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, says: Once again the FTSE-100 has kicked off the session with a modest bounce, recovering some of yesterday\u2019s gains in the process, but the underlying situation appears little changed. Crude oil prices may be ticking higher but they are still in what could be termed \u2018distressed\u2019 territory below $30/barrel, although despite all this there\u2019s a definite air of risk-on returning to markets. Japan\u2019s stock market also had a rough day, losing another 2.3% and sending the Nikkei to a fresh 16-month low. The selloff was partly fuelled by fears that central bankers are losing the battle to keep economies afloat. My colleague Martin Farrer explains: One analyst said markets could be seeing the start of the \u201cfinal capitulation\u201d as the attempt by central banks to stimulate growth with cheap money since the global financial crisis in 2008 had run its course. \u201cThe artificial support from central banks is at a crossroads,\u201d said Evan Lucas, of IG in Melbourne. \u201cCentral bank intervention will no longer create the holding pattern of the past year; markets now believe banks are out of ammunition.\u201d Here\u2019s Martin\u2019s news story on the Asian selloff: The heavy falls on the Australian stock market has triggered fears that we\u2019re entering another GFC, or Global Financial Crisis. ABC News explains: Stockbroker and author of Marcus Today, Marcus Padley, holds the view that this week\u2019s Australian bank sell-off is more about fear than reality. \u201cThere is fundamentals and there is sentiment, and people are very fearful of another GFC-style event,\u201d he told ABC News Online. This chart shows how the Australian market has now shed more than 20% since last April. Australia\u2019s stock market has been dragged into bear market territory as the the global market rout hit Asia again. The country\u2019s benchmark index, the S&amp;P/ASX 200, endured a rough day and finished down 1.2% at 4775.7 points. That\u2019s more than 20% below last April\u2019s peak, that calm time before fears over the global economy (particularly China) began to hit shares worldwide. It means Australia joins Japan\u2019s Nikkei, China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, and Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 in bear market territory. Financial shares were hit, with Bank of Queensland tumbling by almost 7%, and energy companies also led the selloff. Australian investors are getting spooked by events across the globe, says Reuters: Persistent fears about slowing global growth and the Chinese economy, the health of Europe\u2019s banking sector and concerns that Beijing and major central banks might not be able to turn things around have combined to rattle investors. \u201cWhat\u2019s the scary part about this is we can see things get pretty ugly, pretty quickly,\u201d said Evan Lucas, market strategist at IG in Melbourne. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Hold onto your hats, because it\u2019s going to be another stressful day in the financial world. With concerns over the banking sector mounting, investors have three items on the agenda today. 1) Deutsche Bank. Germany\u2019s biggest lender is fighting back against concerns over its financial strength, which drove its shares to a record low last night. There are reports that Deutsche is considering buying some of its debt back, to reassure investors. 2) Janet Yellen. The head of the Federal Reserve testifies to Congress today (3pm GMT, or 10am local time). She\u2019ll be quizzed about the state of the world economy, the banking sector, and whether she\u2019s considering imposing negative interest rates in America (just two months after raising borrowing costs) 3) Oil. The canary in the global economic coalmine had a bad Tuesday, plunging by around 9% to around $30 per barrel. That\u2019s putting more stress on the energy industry, and also the banks, who could suffer heavy losses if producers default on their loans. London\u2019s stock market hit a three-year low yesterday, but traders are suggesting it could be a calmer morning. Economic-wise, the latest UK industrial production data is released at 9.30am. That will show if British factories suffered from the global slowdown in December. And on the corporate front, we get results from (among others) UK chipmaker ARM this morning, and social media network Twitter late tonight. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

                "bodyText":"The government has appointed a Facebook director and the former head of Amazon UK to a new advisory committee on the digital economy, despite the ongoing row over the amounts such companies have paid in tax to the UK exchequer. The appointments come days after it emerged that the Department for Work and Pensions plans to give a non-executive directorship to Amazon\u2019s boss in China, Doug Gurr. Minister for the Cabinet Office Matt Hancock said he had appointed Facebook\u2019s Richard Allan, the director of policy, Europe, to a new advisory board that will help shape the government\u2019s digital services. In October last year it emerged that Facebook paid just \u00a34,327 in corporation tax in the UK. Its revenues in the UK were \u00a3105m last year but the company declared an operating loss of \u00a328.5m. Hancock has also appointed Brian McBride, Amazon\u2019s former UK managing director, to the group, which will be called the Government Digital Services advisory board. McBride is now chairman of the online fashion retailer, ASOS. The group will meet on a quarterly basis to support, advise and challenge the government to deliver better services for users and evaluate how emerging digital and technology trends can be applied to public services. The group also includes the founder and CEO of LoveFilm, Saul Klein. LoveFilm is owned by Amazon. In addition, Brent Hoberman and Baroness Lane-Fox, the founders of Lastminute.com are also members of the group. Hoberman is also a director of Guardian Media Group. Hancock has also appointed Herman Narula to the group. Narula is the chief executive of Improbable, a London-based developer of SpatialOS, an operating system for building virtual worlds and simulations recently backed by the Silicon Valley venture fund, Andreessen Horowitz. Hancock said: \u201cI\u2019m thrilled to have these experts on board and look forward to working closely with them to discover and build the new digital infrastructure.\u201d Although many see the value of the government co-opting business leaders to advise it on policy, there are growing fears that largely US-based technology companies are having an increasing influence at a time when there is growing public pressure for them to pay more tax in the UK. Gurr\u2019s appointment was condemned by veteran tax campaigner Margaret Hodge who said: \u201cIf people are not putting their proper share into the pot, how can government ever justify giving them prestigious positions?\u201d Amazon\u2019s UK business paid just \u00a311.9m in tax in 2014, even though its Luxembourg unit took \u00a35.3bn from internet sales in the UK.",

Analyst Connor Campbell at Spreadex said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Initially threatening a 300 point plunge when the bell rang on Wall Street the Dow Jones settled into a more solid, if still troublesome, 175 point drop as the open receded into the background. Whether or not the better than expected, and best since December, jobless claims helped (it probably didn\u2019t) is unclear, though at this point in time in the most worthless piece of positive news is likely appreciated by fear-stricken investors. The Dow was probably saved (and this is all relative, remember) by the fact that the blood loss endured by the US banking sector was nowhere near as gory as the scenes over in Europe, Bank of America the worst hit at around a 4% decline.</p> <p>In Europe things were much the same, i.e. not too good at all. The FTSE just about managed to claw its way back to the 5600 mark, arguably thanks to the fact that Brent Crude is now closer to $31 per barrel than it is to $30. The DAX, meanwhile, tucked under a 2% decline around 40 points away from 8900, whilst the CAC climbed down from its 3.7% nadir to post a 2.7% loss, both indices aided by a (minor) reduction in losses form Deutsche Bank and Societe Generale respectively.</p> <p>The big question now is, does today\u2019s horrorshow continue into Friday? Given just how fearful investors appear to be at the moment it is incredibly hard to tell; one thing tomorrow does have going for it, however, is data. Lots and lots of it. Germany, Italy and the Eurozone as a whole reveal their preliminary fourth quarter GDP figures, whilst the US sees retail sales, import prices and the University of Michigan consumer sentiment number. The markets will be hoping (nay, praying) that, with a bit of distraction (like on Wednesday), the week can end on a slightly more positive note.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56bca05ee4b0e04c43d738da\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-11T15:04:41.284Z\">3.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is back on Capitol Hill to discuss the global outlook and monetary policy with the Senate Banking Committee, the second and last day of her testimony to Congress.</p> <p>The hearing has begun and can be viewed <strong><a href=\"http://www.banking.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/hearings?ID=EBDD6E93-DC93-415D-99E1-0CD84FFA04D5\">here.</a></strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56bca29ce4b0d007e4723bc1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-11T15:03:25.495Z\">3.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Elsewhere Morgan Stanley has agree to pay $3.2bn relating to the sale of mortgage-backed bonds before the financial crisis.</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56bc9e8de4b0e04c43d738d7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-11T14:46:04.557Z\">2.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ahead of Yellen\u2019s testimony, some think it is time for a US rate cut:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/D_Blanchflower/status/697791707002220544\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Global demand collapsing stock markets tumbling &amp;

                "bodyText":"That\u2019s an appropriate moment to stop. Back tomorrow, for another day of market drama - plus the latest eurozone growth figures, starting with France at 6.30am GMT. Here\u2019s our latest news story: Better get some sleep :) Goodnight! GW Today\u2019s selloff in Asia, Europe and America have pulled global stocks into bear market territory. Reuters has the details: Stock indexes worldwide stumbled on Thursday on fears over the health of the global economy, with a global equity benchmark index closing the day more than 20 percent below its record high last May, confirming global stocks are in a bear market. MSCI\u2019s all-country world equity index which tracks shares in 45 nations, was last down 4.73 points, or 1.32%, to 353.35. The index hit its lowest level in more than two and a half years and was down 20.18% from an all-time high close of 442.70 on May 21, 2015. As we\u2019ve been covering today, this fall into bear market territory began with hefty losses in Hong Kong. Its stock market fell by 4%, on the first day\u2019s trading since the Lunar New year holiday. The baton then passed to Europe, which fumbled it. Bank shares had a very poor day indeed, on escalating fears that they will struggle to handle an economic slowdown, and lower negative interest rates. In nervous trading, shares slumped and government bonds soared, while oil took a dive and gold rallied. That tee\u2019d up America for its fifth daily fall in a row, as Fed chair Janet Yellen repeated her concerns that financial conditions are deteriorating. Uncertainty over US monetary policy going forward - will rates be hiked, cut, or even go negative? - weighed on shares again. It looks like the S&amp;P 500 has finished at its lowest closing level since April 2014, at 1829 points. Financial shares in the S&amp;P fell by 3%, bringing 2016 losses to roughly 18%, points out our US business editor Dominic Rushe. Here\u2019s the main movers and shakers: The Dow has lost around 4.6% of its value since last Thursday - the last time it posted a daily rise. The index is down 10.1% since the start of this year. This is the fifth day running in which the Dow Jones index has lost ground. Reminder: Tonight\u2019s losses in New York follow another day\u2019s torrid trading in Europe. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has another day to forget, losing 2.4% as investors raced for safe-haven assets such as German bonds, the yen, and gold. The Footsie, which includes the top 100 companies in London, closed at its lowest level in three and a half years. Our friends at the Daily Telegraph have worked out that \u00a380bn has been wiped off the FTSE 100 index this week. And there\u2019s still one day to go.... Phew! America\u2019s stock market has closed for the night, and the main three indices are all in the red. The Dow ended the day down around 251 points, having clawed back from a 400-point loss an hour or so ago. And the Nasdaq wilted in the final moments, surrendering earlier gains to finish down 0.4%. Shares picked up after the WSJ reported that Opec might be prepared to cut oil production. But financial stocks dragged again, with Goldman Sachs down 4.1%, and JP Morgan losing 3.98%. The biggest Dow faller was Boeing, following reports that regulators are investigating the airline maker. The latest research note from French Bank BNP Paribas just landed in my inbox. Here\u2019s their \u2018big picture\u2019 view: Central-bank action looks uncoordinated and we see few signs of calm ahead. We expect no further action from the Fed in 2016 or 2017 and we think central banks across the world will continue to adopt easier policies in response. It looks like traders are trying to give the Dow a late push. It\u2019s now down 188 points, or half its earlier losses..... Hello hello.... look at the Nasdaq. The tech stock-heavy index has shrugged off its earlier losses, and is now up 7 points (or 0.2%). Leading the way are: TripAdvisor: +13% Cisco +10% Expedia +8.5% Tesla: +6.3% That still leaves the Nasdaq down 6.9% this month, and 13% since the start of the year. Now that today\u2019s OPEC rumour has sunk in, Wall Street is still in red, but off its lowest levels. The Dow is currently down 273 points, or -1.7%, with just 40 minutes until the closing bell. This final hour can be a volatile time.... This is the story that moved the market a few minutes ago, by Summer Said of the Wall Street Journal. OPEC members are ready to cooperate on a cut, but current prices are already forcing producers outside the group to at least cap output increases, says UAE Energy Minister Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazrouei. Non-OPEC supplies are expected to drop up to 800K barrels/day while global demand growth is seen at 1.3M\u2013which will help the market balances itself. \u201cThe positive thing is the current market is forcing everyone not to increase output,\u201d says al-Mazrouei, adding, \u201cI\u2019m optimistic that the balance will happen this year despite the oversupply and stocks overhang.\u201d  Interesting stuff. But it\u2019s not exactly definitive proof that OPEC is about to cave in and axe production. Energy stocks are suddenly spiking, pulling the US stock market off its lowest levels. And it\u2019s triggered reports that the energy minister of the UAE has said Opec members are \u201cready to co-operate\u201d on production cuts. Rumours of this sort have been swirling, and then denied, for some time. But maybe this time it\u2019s different.... Wow. The Dow just lurched through the 400-point loss mark, as news of the latest tumble in the oil price broke. Then it ricocheted back, to \u201cjust\u201d 340 points down in a few moments. Oil has just plumbed new depths, as oversupply fears and global recession worries take their toll again. West Texas Intermediate (US crude oil) has sunk below $26.19 per barrel, to hit the lowest levels since May 2003. There\u2019s no let-up in the market gloom today, with the Dow Jones industrial average still down over 2%. The Dow is currently trading at 15,570, a loss of 344 points. Only two stocks are up - network equipment vender Cisco, and entertainment group Walt Disney (who posted strong results earlier this week). Boeing is the big faller; the aircraft maker has lost 8.9% today following reports that regulators are probing the company\u2019s accounting. Reuters also blames \u201cmounting concerns\u201d about Boeing\u2019s its slowing sales and production. Following close behind in the losers bench are Goldman Sachs (-4.4%) and JP Morgan (-4.2%). They\u2019re tracking the general sell-off in financial stocks today. Two months after the first US rate rise in a decade, the financial markets reckon the Fed is more likely to CUT, rather than risk a second hike. Kit Juckes, top currency strategist at Societe Generale, reckons that the market turmoil has been sparked by a loss of faith in central bankers. In a new note to clients, he writes: We\u2019ve relied on central bankers to fix all the world\u2019s woes, when all they could really do was to get the global financial system back on an even keel. Keeping policy too easy for too long and boosting asset markets in the vain hope that this would deliver a sustainable demand pick-up has meant that even a timid attempt at normalising Fed policy has caused two months of mayhem. Now, a growing realisation that central banks\u2019 powers are waning has prompted a rush into safe havens. And, of course, years of ultra-loose monetary policy have also led us to this point: We\u2019re just getting the stickers saying \u2018Easy Money may cause harmful side-effects if consumed persistently for long periods\u2019 printed.... Yellen\u2019s second and final testimony ends with chairman Richard Shelby suggesting a review of the Fed\u2019s structure. She seems unconvinced but says it is up to Congress. And with that it\u2019s over. A cocktail of concerns has sent markets tumbling again. Worries about a severe global economic downturn, stresses on bank balance sheets, the falling oil price and Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen\u2019s comments about the impact of a slowdown and the market turmoil on the US economy have sent investors scurrying away to havens such as gold. Yellen\u2019s comments about negative interest rates added to the unease as the afternoon wore on. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 fell 135.33 points or 2.39% to 5536.97, its lowest level since the end of July 2012 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 2.93% to 8752.87 France\u2019s Cac closed 4.03% lower at 3896.71 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished down 5.63% at 15,773.00 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 4.88% at 7746.3 In Greece, the Athens market fell 1.89% to 440.88 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 349 points or 2.2%. Charles Schumer of New York says the strength of the US dollar is another form of rates rise so another hike would be a double whammy for the economy. Yellen says the dollar is a factor in interest rate policy, but says although some sectors have been hit by the strength of the US currency the economy has managed to continue creating jobs. Heller: A year ago you said falling oil would be good for the economy. Do you think you made a mistake. Yellen: Clearly declining oil prices have had some negative effects [on the economy]. [But] we are still a net importer of oil, and households are seeing sustantial gains from falling oil price. Dean Heller of Nevada: Different Fed officials saying different things causes confusion to public and markets. Do you see a problem? Yellen: Congress created a system with a large committee with diverse views so we did not fall into groupthink mentality. We have 17 members with a range of views. We have guidelines for communications. It says everyone should make clear they are speaking for themselves, not the committee. The market response to the Fed rate decision for a number of weeks was tranquil, it had been communicated and was expected. At the turn of the year markets saw more volatility. The drivers were China and oil price falls amid weakening global growth, so I don\u2019t think it was our policy. Yellen is asked again about the rate rise at the end of last year. Yellen: We felt in December the economy was moving up and inflation would go up. A lot has gone on since then. We are in the process of assessing how those developments affect our outlook. We will meet in March and have a new set of projections. I\u2019ve not thought that a downturn sufficient to make the next move a cut was a likely possibility. Not seen a shift in economic outlook to make that likely. But she added that if things changed to make that appropriate, the Fed would look at it. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts asks about living wills for banks, which are designed to make sure if they fail there will not be a systemic risk, and says there are 11 where they were deemed not to be sufficient and have been resubmitted. Yellen: We gave detailed guidance about what we want to see in these latest rounds of living wills. We are..evaluting them. If a living will does not address the shortcomings, we are prepared to make the finding that the living will is insufficient. Tom Cotton of Arkansas asks the December rate rise, and Yellen says the Fed wanted to move gradually so that the economy remained on a sustainable growth path. Cotton then asks about when she expects energy prices and the dollar to stabilise. Yellen: Energy prices have continued to move down, eventually they will stabilise. When that happens and the dollar stabilises, inflation will begin to move up but [difficult to predict when.] Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania: I wanted the Fed to normalise policy [ie start raising rates again which happened in December]. Markets now appear to price in no further increases in interest rates. But what are the risks of negative rates? [He lists several including pressure on banks, the prospect of currency war, an effective tax on savings and so on] Yellen: In European countries which have [introduced negative rates], I was surprised it was possible to take them as negative as they did. Don\u2019t think they pass on negative rates to small depositors, which means bank\u2019s margins are squeezed. They [other central banks] were concerned about inflation being below objectives and wanted to stimulate economy. In our context, in 2010 we were concerned about the impact on money market functioning. Before we took such a step we would have to see how they worked in US context. But we don\u2019t even know if clearing and settlement systems would be able to handle negative rates. Toomey asks about the legal position, saying a Fed memo seemed to suggest there could be a probem. Yellen: A memo from 2010 said legal issues had not been studied. I am not aware of any legal restriction that would mean we could not establish negative rates but I haven\u2019t studied legal side of it. Question from Bob Corker of Tennessee : Is Fed out of ammunition unless you go to negative rates? If things go south are you considering negative rates? Yellen: The answer is we had previously considered them and decided they would not work well back in 2010. In light of others [introducing them], we are taking a look at them again because we would want to be prepared. We have not finished that investigation. Not automatic they would work well here. I would not take them off the table, but there is work to do to see if they would be suitable. Senator Jon Tester of Montana: What is Fed seeing in housing sector right now? Yellen: We are seeing recovery in housing, it has gone on for a number of years but is very gradual. House prices have increased quite a bit. [But] the level of new construction remains quite low relative to demographic trends. Quite a significant way for housing to go before it is consistent with demographic trends. It is a support to the economy. Senator Mike Crapo asks: Would you agree liquidity in bond markets may be less available in stressed market conditions. Yellen: Normal conditions haven\u2019t changed that much but perceptions suggest that under stressed conditions liquidity may disappear when its most needed. We are looking at these things... Asked about wages, she says a pick up in wage growth is tentative. She hopes as the economy improves this will increase. Chair Richard Shelby asks if the precipitous decline in the price of 0il and gas plus the rise of the dollar surprised the Fed or could you have predicted it? Yellen says the Fed and the markets have been quite surprised by movements in oil price. In part they reflect supply isssue, demand may also play a role. The stronger dollar we in some ways anticipated as US economy has been performing more strongly than others. But she says they were surprised at how much it has risen. Asked about the economy and recession, she says there is always some chance of recession in any year. But evidence suggests expansions don\u2019t die of old age. We are looking very carefully at global financial developments which create risk... they may influence the trajectory of the economy and monetary policy. It is premature to make a judgement [on a recession this year]. On the strength of banks: We have a more resistent banking system. We have used stress tests to see if firms can support credit needs of our economy even in times of great [financial] stress. We do have a strong banking system and we\u2019ve seen marked improvement. Here\u2019s a chart showing how the chances of a Fed rate rise have dropped sharply since January in the wake of the market turmoil and Yellen\u2019s comments: After opening comments from committee chair Richard Shelby and senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is currently delivering her testimony (identical to yesterday\u2019s speech remember). Meanwhile markets seem to have recovered a little from their worst levels. Analyst Connor Campbell at Spreadex said: Initially threatening a 300 point plunge when the bell rang on Wall Street the Dow Jones settled into a more solid, if still troublesome, 175 point drop as the open receded into the background. Whether or not the better than expected, and best since December, jobless claims helped (it probably didn\u2019t) is unclear, though at this point in time in the most worthless piece of positive news is likely appreciated by fear-stricken investors. The Dow was probably saved (and this is all relative, remember) by the fact that the blood loss endured by the US banking sector was nowhere near as gory as the scenes over in Europe, Bank of America the worst hit at around a 4% decline. In Europe things were much the same, i.e. not too good at all. The FTSE just about managed to claw its way back to the 5600 mark, arguably thanks to the fact that Brent Crude is now closer to $31 per barrel than it is to $30. The DAX, meanwhile, tucked under a 2% decline around 40 points away from 8900, whilst the CAC climbed down from its 3.7% nadir to post a 2.7% loss, both indices aided by a (minor) reduction in losses form Deutsche Bank and Societe Generale respectively. The big question now is, does today\u2019s horrorshow continue into Friday? Given just how fearful investors appear to be at the moment it is incredibly hard to tell; one thing tomorrow does have going for it, however, is data. Lots and lots of it. Germany, Italy and the Eurozone as a whole reveal their preliminary fourth quarter GDP figures, whilst the US sees retail sales, import prices and the University of Michigan consumer sentiment number. The markets will be hoping (nay, praying) that, with a bit of distraction (like on Wednesday), the week can end on a slightly more positive note. Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is back on Capitol Hill to discuss the global outlook and monetary policy with the Senate Banking Committee, the second and last day of her testimony to Congress. The hearing has begun and can be viewed here. Elsewhere Morgan Stanley has agree to pay $3.2bn relating to the sale of mortgage-backed bonds before the financial crisis. Ahead of Yellen\u2019s testimony, some think it is time for a US rate cut: As predicted, the US market has followed the rest of the world lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 243 points or 1.5%, while the S&amp;P 500 has lost 1% and Nasdaq 1.3%. Meanwhile the International Monetary Fund has confirmed that Christine Lagarde has been nominated for a second five year term as managing director unopposed. Her first term ends in July. Well, here\u2019s the answer to the question about whether Janet Yellen would change her testimony from Wednesday\u2019s remarks in the light of the day\u2019s renewed market turmoil. No. The Fed said: Chair Yellen submitted identical remarks to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, on February 11, 201. So if you want to read along with Yellen at 10am EST (3pm GMT) here it is again. Here\u2019s some comments on Portugal and Greece from Slovakia\u2019s finance minister Peter Ka\u017eim\u00edr ahead of the eurogroup: Bloomberg points out another possible reason behind the plunge in bank shares: Oil rich Gulf states have of course been hard hit by the plunge in crude prices. Now here\u2019s a key question about today\u2019s second testimony from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen: Over in Brussels, eurozone finance ministers are telling reporters that the European banking sector is in good shape, as they arrive for a Eurogroup meeting. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem revealed that ministers will consider the market turbulence during today\u2019s session. European commissioner Pierre Moscovici was pretty optimistic too: And Finnish finance minister Alex Stubb was \u201crelaxed\u201d about the situation: Out of the mists of gloom comes some good news, in the shape of the weekly US jobless figures. They show that the number of Americans filing new unemployment claims fell by 16,000 last week, to a seven-week low. The initial jobless claims figure came in at 269,000, down from 280,000. So, US companies kept hiring staff last week, despite the market turmoil. World stock markets are gripped by another bout of feverish selling today. Fears over the global economy and the financial sector have hit shares, driven down (most) sovereign bond yields, and sent wild gyrations through the foreign exchange markets. In London, the FTSE 100 has hit a three and a half-year low. The blue-chip index is currently down 120 points, or 2%. Financial stocks are under real pressure, with Aberdeen Asset Management, Prudential and Barclays all down 6%. Other European markets are being routed too, with the French CAC plunging by 3.5%, Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB losing 5%(!) and German DAX off by 2%. Wall Street is expected to follow suit, with the Dow being called down 280 points or almost 2%. The day began with a big selloff in Asia, as traders returned after the Lunar New Year. Hong Kong\u2019s stock market slid by 4%. Maike Currie, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International, says investors face volatile markets: \u201cFebruary has continued much like January begun, with markets yo-yoing and investor sentiment swinging from one concern to the next. The FTSE 100 broke the 5,500 barrier today \u2013 hitting a new low since July 2012. \u201cInvestors can\u2019t be blamed for feeling unnerved. There is a cocktail of worries clouding the investment horizon from a slowing China, emerging market rout, the unprecedented collapse in the oil prices and more recently, the problems brewing in the banking sector. Bank shares are in the eye of the storm again: France\u2019s Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale has tumbled by 13% after warning that \u201cheadwinds\u201d could hit profitability this year. Deutsche Bank is down by 9%, two days after insisting it was \u201crock-solid\u201d. The dollar has fallen sharply against the yen, before suddenly rebounding, sparking rumours that the Bank of Japan has intervened to weaken its currency. And the British pound has fallen by over a cent against the US dollar to $1.439. Money has poured into German, US and UK government debt. This has driven down Britain\u2019s cost of borrowing to an alltime low. But Portugal\u2019s bonds have weakened, sparking fears that investors are worrying about Lisbon again. Sweden\u2019s central bank fired another shot in the currency wars, surprising the markets by slashing interest rates to a new record low of minus 0.5%. The oil price has weakened again, with US crude oil trading at levels last seen in 2003. But gold has jumped by 2.6% to $1,229 per ounce, a nine-month high. Financial sentiment right now: A rumour is sweeping the trading floors that the Bank of Japan has intervened to weaken the yen, following today\u2019s surge against the US dollar. And the yen has weakened, moving from \u00a5111.5 to \u00a5112 against the $1. America is waking up to the news that Asian and European markets have taken another bath this morning. And they are next in line: Investors are ditching Portuguese government bonds this morning, as the financial turmoil grows. The wave of selling has driven up the yield on Portugal\u2019s 10-year bonds to 4.3%, up from 3.5% yesterday. That\u2019s a remarkable surge, meaning that prices have dropped sharply. It implies that the markets are losing confidence in Portugal again, demanding a higher rate of return for holding its bonds. Shorter-term Portuguese debt is also being hit. The move comes as Lisbon\u2019s new left-wing government begins to reverse some of its predecessor\u2019s austerity policies. Last week, the EU warned that Portugal was \u201cat risk\u201d of breaching Europe\u2019s fiscal rules, after warily approving its 2016 budget. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, reckons fear is driving shares down today, rather than a fundamental shift. He says: The fear surrounding global financial markets has been cranked up further today, as risk assets once more took a battering in favour of defensive plays. The continued deterioration in the FTSE is as much to do with the ongoing fall in oil and the fall in the US dollar against the yen, as the outlook for the UK economy itself, yet with markets in freefall, who is going to argue with a trend? There are many potential causes of the current rout. For example: signs of slowing global growth; fears that negative interest rates severely undermine bank profitability; the bad loans lurking in the European financial sector; suspicions that China is much weaker than the GDP figures show.... All good reasons to worry. But as the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Juliet Samuel flags up, the City isn\u2019t sure what\u2019s really behind it. In a morning of wild and alarming moves, one stands out. The Japanese yen has jumped by 1.7% against the US dollar today, strengthening from \u00a5113.3 to $1, to \u00a5111.5. That\u2019s a chunky daily move. And so far this year, the yen has gained by 7.5% against the US dollar, hitting its strongest point since November 2014. That will surely concern the Bank of Japan, which imposed negative rates last month in its latest attempt to stimulate growth and inflation. A stronger yen is bad for exports, and also deflationary as it makes imported goods cheaper. Yann Quelenn, market analyst at Swissquote Bank, explains: The US dollar printed a fresh 16-month low against the Japanese yen, suggesting that traders believe the BoJ will be unable to further weaken the yen, while betting the Fed will remain sidelined for a longer period of time. But there is also chatter that the BoJ may have to intervene in the markets to weaken the yen. Here, courtesy of David Buik of Panmure Gordon, is a snapshot of the day\u2019s rout (so far) in the banking sector: Britain\u2019s borrowing costs have now hit their lowest level since the late 1600s, thanks to the plunge in bond yields today (details here). So reckons Sky News\u2019s economics editor, Ed Conway, who has checked the historic data. It\u2019s unlikely that Britain\u2019s medieval kings could have borrowed any cheaper either. They were notorious serial defaulters, due to the demands of court life and military ambitions. Mind you, academics at the University of Reading have argued that the picture was more nuanced.... They wrote: It can be difficult to identify medieval interest rates, in part because interest charges had to be disguised to circumvent the Church prohibition on usury, but we found that the king could borrow at 15% annualised interest when his finances were stable but that this could increase to more than 40% during periods of financial pressure, most notably during wartime. Edward I probably had a surplus on his account with the Ricciardi, who collapsed as the result of a \u2018credit crunch\u2019 caused by the unexpected outbreak of war between England and France..... More here: Credit Finance in the Middle Ages: loans to the English crown c.1272-1340 The Greek stock market is suffering another rout, led by its banks: Oil is being thumped by predictions of a growing crude glut, as the world economy slows. The price of US crude has fallen by almost 3% today, to $26.74 per barrel. That\u2019s a one-month low, but also close to the levels ploughed in 2003: Bloomberg\u2019s Caroline Hyde tweets the details: The refusal of oil producers to cut production is fuelling concerns that we may run out of places to put the stuff, as inventory levels keep rising. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains: The threat of further rate hikes from the Fed coupled with diminished prospects for a joint production cut between OPEC and non-OPEC producers have sent US oil prices back down to 12-year lows. The renewed slump in the price of oil has been unfortunate timing for French oil giant Total to report a 20% rise in annual net profits which CEO Patrick Pouyanne proclaimed as the \u201cbest performance\u201d amongst the oil majors. Today\u2019s rout has driven European bank shares down to their lowest level in three and a half years. The Stoxx 600 Banks index, which includes the main lenders in Europe, has shed 6.1% and is now at its lowest level since August 2012. Summer 2012 was the point at which the eurozone debt crisis began to ease, with European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi vowing to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the euro. Today\u2019s rout is being led by Italian banks, and French bank SocGen (after its results missed forecasts today). Britain\u2019s government borrowing costs have just hit an all-time low, according to Reuters data. The yield on 10-year UK gilts, which are the benchmark for UK borrowing, has fallen to 1.29% this morning in a wave of buying. Yield, the interest rate on the debt, fall when prices rise. So this implies Britain can borrow cheaper than at any time before (the data I can see goes back to 1989) That sounds like good news, except that it reflects wider fears over a global recession. If traders were upbeat about growth prospects, they\u2019d be buying shares instead. Investors are scrambling into \u201csafer\u201d eurozone government bonds. That\u2019s another sign that they\u2019re seeking protection against recession and market turmoil. German government bond yields (the interest rate on bunds) has hit a nine-month low this morning - meaning the prices of these bonds has hit the highest level since May 2015. And the yield on US 10-year Treasury bills has hit its lowest in three years, at just 1.62%. That also suggests traders are pessimistic about future growth and inflation prospects. Bank shares are getting a tonking this morning. Deutsche Bank, the source of so much worry, is down by 6.3% in Frankfurt, with Commerzbank close behind. After a rough start to trading, European stock markets are deep and turbulent sea of red. Italy is the worst performer, with its FTSE MIB index slumping by over 4%: FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga says Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is partly to blame. He reckons investors are disappointed that Yellen didn\u2019t rule out interest rate rises, when she appeared at Congress yesterday: Although the economic environment has transformed for the worst since the start of the year with ongoing China woes and violent declines in oil prices exposing the US economy to downside risks, in defiance the Fed continues to hold the view of raising rates at a gradual pace. While Yellen also emphasized that financial conditions in the US have become less supportive of growth, this was counterbalanced with the impressive labour report which in the eyes of the Fed opened doors for a potential rate rise in March. Yellen will get a second bite at the cherry later today, when she continues testifying to US lawmakers. Wall Street is expected to take a tumble later today: Nour Al-Hammoury, chief market strategist at ADS Securities in Abu Dhabi says: Asia and Europe equities remain weak following the Feds acknowledgment that they have concerns over global markets. European financial risk indices continue to rise, which is keeping demand high for safe haven assets. Ahead of the open we\u2019re currently calling the DOW down 275 15640 and the S&amp;P down 32 at 1820 Sweden\u2019s central bank has cut the country\u2019s interest rates deeper into negative territory, in another sign of the turbulence in the financial world. The Riksbank has just announced that the headline rate will fall to -.50%, from -0.35%. The move is designed to drive inflation up and stimulate growth. The bank says: The economy continues to strengthen but inflation is expected to be lower during 2016 than previously forecast. The rate cut will also weaken the Swedish currency. It is already hitting the Swedish Krone hard, sending the euro surging against the krone. Only 3 economists surveyed by Bloomberg has expected such a deep cut (8 thought rates would stay at minus 0.35%, and 7 predicted a cut to minus 0.45%) Tony Cross, analyst at Trustnet Direct, says fears over the world economy are hitting shares hard, and also pushing the oil price down. Any hopes that yesterday\u2019s modest rally for the FTSE-100 would mark something of a turning point have been dashed. WTI crude oil prices tested territory below $27/barrel, whilst the return to work after the Lunar New Year break saw traders in Hong Kong lacked any signs of optimism. Janet Yellen\u2019s words yesterday have clearly done nothing to calm sentiment \u2013 yes the next US rate hike may have been pushed back, but the challenge now is managing the US recovery against a potential global slowdown. The London selloff is accelerating, wiping 130 points off the Footsie. The index of major blue-chip shares has now hit its lowest level since July 2012: Over in Paris, French bank Societe Generale has plunged by 9%. It missed City forecasts this morning, with net income coming in around 31% below analyst forecasts. SocGen also warned that \u201cheadwinds\u201d could hamper its efforts to hit profitability targets this year. That wipes out yesterday\u2019s recovery: Money is pouring into safer assets, and out of shares. The gold price has risen to $1,211 per ounce, its highest since May 2015. And the Japanese yen has hit its highest level against the British pound since November 2013. Down we go again! European shares are falling at the start of trading. The FTSE 100 has shed 101 points, or 1.7%, to 5,570 points. Germany\u2019s DAX has lost 1.5%, and the French CAC is off by 1.6% Most London shares are down, but mining stocks are leading the selloff reflecting ongoing gloom about the global economy. Rio Tinto has slumped by 6.7%, after it abandoned its \u201cprogressive dividend\u201d policy this morning (a promise to pay more shareholders in future years). This follows a late-selloff on Wall Street last night, and the slumps in Asia earlier today. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says: The weakness stems from Fed chair Janet Yellen warning on current financial market turbulence and suggesting further rate hikes could be delayed, which added to already raised anxiety about the health of the global economy to hold back risk sentiment. It\u2019s never great returning to work after a holiday. But the mood in Hong Kong was particularly grim, as investors watched shares tumble. Nitin Dialdas, chief investment officer at Mandarin Capital in Hong Kong, told Reuters that 2016 will be tough. \u201dI think this is going to be a difficult year for investors and even a fledgling U.S. economic recovery looks to be snuffed out by global markets development.\u201d Charles Li, chief executive of the Hong Kong Stock exchange, was also gloomy: \u201cThere is very little good news and continuous bad news and this is a test of market confidence.\u201d Hong Kong\u2019s stock market is suffering its worst start to the Lunar New Year since 1994. A wave of selling has hit shares as traders return to their desks after this week\u2019s holiday. They were swift to catch up with the turmoil in European and US markets, with Asian markets having been shut since Friday. The Hang Seng index has lurched down, losing 795 points or nearly 4% to 18,535. That\u2019s its biggest one-day loss in six months. As this chart from Bloomberg shows, that\u2019s the worst start to a Lunar New Year in over two decades: There were similar losses in other Asian markets. South Korea\u2019s Kospi staged its biggest daily drop in nearly four years, down 2.9 percent to finish at 1,861.54. Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital in Sydney, blamed fears over the global slowdown, and the oil price slump, adding: \u201cWhat started in January as mainly China based worries has clearly broadened back out to concerns about global growth\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s no end in sight to the market turmoil. European stocks are expected to fall at the start of trading, with worries over the global slowdown centre-stage again. The futures market suggests the main indices, including London\u2019s FTSE 100, will lose around 1% at the opening - wiping out Wednesday\u2019s small rally. Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is testifying to Congress for the second day running (at 3pm GMT). She\u2019ll probably repeat her concerns about the turmoil in the markets, which could prevent the Fed from hiking rates this year. We\u2019ll hear from another central bank today, too. At 8.30am, Sweden\u2019s Riksbank announces its monetary policy decision, and some economists believe it will cut interest rates deeper into negative territory. And Eurozone finance ministers are meeting in Brussels; Greece\u2019s struggling bailout talks will be on the agenda, as Athens and its creditors continue to argue over its austerity plan. In the corporate world. oil giant Total, holiday firm Thomas Cook, insurance group Zurich and mining giant Rio Tinto are all reporting results (more on them shortly....) We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

Oil jumped on renewed hopes that producers would agree to meet to cut output (although we have heard this many times before), which helped lift energy companies. Nicholas Hyett, investment analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Oil stocks are rallying today on speculation that Opec might be willing to cut production. It will need to be a big cut though; some US storage facilities are at 90% of capacity with new production still to come online this year.</p> </blockquote> <p>Banks also came back from their beaten-down levels, after better than expected figures from Commerzbank, news that JP Morgan\u2019s Jamie Dimon was snapping up the bank\u2019s shares and Deutsche Bank\u2019s plan to buy back debt.</p> <p>Wall Street also helped, moving higher after better than expected US retail sales, while there appeared to be no real shocks in the eurozone GDP figures, albeit Greece moved back into recession.</p> <p>Investors are already looking ahead to Monday, when Chinese markets re-open after a week\u2019s holiday for New Year. Will its stock market move higher or play catch up with the falls elsewhere in global markets? With Wall Street closed on Monday, it could be another volatile day.

However, pessimists (and there are many around at the moment) will be quick to point out that there\u2019s little sign of an actual meeting between major oil producers, and that Saudi intransigence on production cuts remains the chief, and currently insuperable, obstacle to tackling the problem of huge oversupply.</p> <p>At least the banks are doing better today, with both the FTSE banking sector and its European counterparts racing away.

He says:</p> <blockquote> <p>In principle, cutting policy rates into negative territory should boost growth and inflation. But central banks have not communicated these benefits clearly, and the hesitant way in which they have been introduced has undermined confidence, raising the risk that negative rates do more harm than good.</p> <p>Although markets are rebounding today, the sharp falls in equity prices and in particular bank shares since the beginning of the year have led many to claim that negative rates are damaging global economic prospects. Markets have focused on three main concerns.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <ul> <li>First, negative deposit rates impose a direct financial cost on banks, harming their profitability and thus their willingness to make new loans...[But] we estimate that negative policy rates in the four European economies that have applied them are costing the banking sector around \u20ac3bn a year. That is a trivial fraction of their assets and is not a game-changer for their profitability either...</li> <li>The second fear is that the rush to impose negative policy rates is the latest front in a futile currency war. There is some truth to this argument as a weaker exchange rate is a key channel through which negative rates can operate. But there is little evidence that the major central banks are competing to weaken their currencies, and insofar as they are, the result will be looser global monetary policy which should be positive for global growth.</li> <li>Perhaps the biggest worry though is that cuts to policy rates have added to the sense that the world economy is slowing sharply and that policymakers are running out of options. Policy loosening has fuelled, rather than soothed, market fears...Central banks themselves are partly to blame for this response because they have repeatedly claimed that policy rates could not be lowered further, only to surprise the markets by cutting rates weeks later. No central bank has given a clear idea of how low interest rates on excess reserves could go, adding to the perception that they are flying blind. Nonetheless, claims that monetary policy has reached its limits are exaggerated. After all, there is still plenty of scope for further quantitative easing.</li> </ul> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56bdfc1be4b0eba06ed5fc41\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-12T15:39:25.406Z\">3.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The University of Michigan survey suggests a falling outlook for inflation:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Lavorgnanomics/status/698167972662288388\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">5-10yr <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/inflation?src=hash\">#inflation</a> expectations in the U. of Mich. survey fell 0.3% to 2.4% - lowest reading in the history of the series</p>&mdash; Joseph A.

Lower oil prices have certainly helped, with the US consumer benefitting from cheaper gas to the tune of $80m per day. The labour market continues to strengthen and consumer confidence hasn\u2019t been shaken, all of which bodes well for the domestic economy.</p> <p>What really matters though, is how well the US weathers the global risks in the long-term: namely, Chinese devaluation and the exacerbating effect of the stronger US dollar. Clearly, the tentacles of the Chinese slowdown are spreading, and the lack of a clear enough policy is a red flag to ongoing volatility. Equally, the dollar has been strengthening due to the robustness \u2013 until recently \u2013 of the US recovery and the Fed\u2019s decision to hike rates in December. However, it does drag down exports and adds to the already widening trade deficit. While it\u2019s not yet a case of stunting US growth, all eyes will remain on Yellen to soothe where she can.

He repeated that debt relief - a bone of contention among some of the country\u2019s creditors - needed to be a key element of the programme. He wrote in <strong><a href=\"https://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/2016/02/11/greece-toward-a-workable-program/?hootPostID=406cd1348e266ebe45426232bdc79335\">a new IMF commentary</a></strong>:</p> <blockquote> <p>The IMF does not want Greece to implement draconian fiscal adjustment in an already severely depressed economy. In fact, we have time and again been the ones arguing for a fiscal adjustment path that is more supportive of recovery in the near term and more realistic in the medium term.</p> <p>We have yet to see a credible plan for how Greece will reach the very ambitious medium-term surplus target that is key to the government\u2019s plans for restoring debt sustainability. This emphasis on credibility is crucial for generating the investor confidence that is critical to Greece\u2019s revival. A plan built on over-optimistic assumptions will soon cause Grexit fears to resurface once again and stifle the investment climate.</p> <p>The overriding objective of the IMF\u2019s engagement with Greece is to help the country put itself back on a path of sustainable growth that benefits the Greek people. The IMF will support the Greek authorities and their European partners in developing a program of reforms and debt relief that adds up. There are difficult choices to be made, but it is important to make them so that Greece\u2019s efforts over the last six years are not wasted.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the need for both reforms and debt relief, he said:</p> <blockquote> <p>It is argued that the IMF has made its participation dependent on socially draconian reforms, especially of the pension system. This is not the case. Ultimately a program must add up: the combination of reforms plus debt relief must give us and the international community reasonable assurances that by the end of Greece\u2019s next program, after almost a decade of dependence on European and IMF assistance, Greece will finally be able to stand on its own. This implies an inverse trade-off between ambition of reforms and strength of debt relief\u2014we can certainly support a program with less ambitious reforms, but this will inevitably involve more debt relief.</p> <p>This said, no amount of pension reforms will make Greece\u2019s debt sustainable without debt relief, and no amount of debt relief will make Greece\u2019s pension system sustainable without pension reforms. Both need to come about. There is no doubt that both Greece and its European partners will face politically difficult decisions in the coming months to arrive at a program that is viable\u2014one that adds up.</p> </blockquote> <p>And on pensions, he said Greece is too poor to afford its present pension system:</p> <blockquote> <p>Despite the pension reforms of 2010 and 2012, Greece\u2019s pension system remains unaffordably generous. For instance, the standard pensions in nominal Euro terms are broadly similar in Greece and Germany, even though Germany\u2014measured by the average wage\u2014is twice as rich as Greece. Add to this that Greeks still retire much earlier than Germans and that Germany is much better at collecting social security contributions. The result is that the Greek budget needs to transfer some 10 percent of GDP to cover the gaping hole in the pension system, compared to a European average of some 2\u00bd percent. Clearly, this is unsustainable.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-02-12T14:24:28.771Z\">at 2.24pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-56bdd9b1e4b0999485acbd94\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/larryelliott\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-12T13:12:21.639Z\">1.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The next phase of the eurozone crisis is about to begin, to judge by the latest GDP figures, argues our economics editor Larry Elliott.

The eurozone peaked in the second quarter of 2015 and the trend was starting to weaken even before the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/12/turbulent-week-stock-markets-investors-safe-havens-gold-yen\">recent turbulence on the financial markets.</a>..</p> <p>In the short term, further stimulus from the ECB is a bolt-on certainty next month, either through cuts in interest rates or an expansion of its QE programme, or more likely both.

Seemingly, unlike most Eurozone countries, Italian GDP was reliant on net trade in the fourth quarter as domestic demand was reported to have been a drag. </p> <p>On a more positive note, <strong>Spanish</strong> GDP growth held up well at 0.8% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter, having edged back to this level in the third quarter from a peak growth rate of 1.0% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter.</p> <p>Among the other Eurozone countries, there were modest pick-ups in quarter-on-quarter GDP growth in the fourth quarter in the <strong>Netherlands </strong>(to 0.3% from 0.1%), <strong>Belgium</strong> (to 0.3% from 0.2%) and <strong>Portugal </strong>(to 0.2% from 0.0%). <strong>Cyprus</strong> grew by 0.4% quarter-on-quarter, which was down slightly from 0.5% in the third quarter.</p> <p>Additionally, there was robust expansion in <strong>Slovakia </strong>(up 1.0% quarter-on-quarter, as it had been in the third quarter) and <strong>Estonia</strong> (up 1.2%).<br></p> <p>However, <strong>Greece</strong> <strong>moved into recession</strong> as GDP contracted by 0.6% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter after a drop of 1.4% in the third quarter as it continued to be hampered by fiscal austerity and capital controls<br></p> <p><strong>Finland also moved into recession</strong> as GDP fell 0.1% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter after a drop of 0.6% in the third quarter. </p> <p>Furthermore, <strong>Austrian </strong>GDP was only flat quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter, as it had been in the third quarter.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56bdba2de4b00fe68dd2501d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-12T10:55:59.599Z\">10.55am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Greece\u2019s protesting farmers are digging in for the long haul.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/northaura/status/698097387923968000\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Athens: protesting farmers camp at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/syntagma?src=hash\">#syntagma</a> sq.

                "bodyText":"Finally, more on New York Fed president William Dudley playing down talk of negative interest rates in the US, in the wake of Janet Yellen\u2019s comments this week. Edward Helmore writes: New York Fed president William Dudley has dismissed speculation that the US Federal Reserve could adopt negative interest rates as \u201cextraordinarily premature\u201d. Speaking a day after Fed chair Janet Yellen concluded two days of congressional testimony during which she left open questions on whether the US could follow central banks in Europe and Japan by adopting negative rates, Dudley, a voting member on the Fed\u2019s policymaking committee, struck an optimistic tone. He said US households and banks are better able to absorb shocks than they were when the last recession hit. Against a backdrop of supportive US consumer and household debt data released Friday, Dudley added US monetary policy remains \u201cquite accommodative\u201d after the Fed\u2019s decision to raise interest rates in December. \u201cKey sectors of the US economy, such as the household sector, seem to be in good shape,\u201d he said, repeating Yellen\u2019s assertion that despite market turmoil that\u2019s caused the S&amp;P 500 to lose 10% of its value this year, economic expansions do not simply \u201cdie of old age\u201d. The full story is here. On that note we\u2019ll close up, and say thanks for all your comments. See you again soon. Worries about a global slowdown, falling oil prices and the effect of negative interest rates on banks have combined to produce another traumatic week for stock market investors. But the week ended with sentiment much improved, with European markets showing significant gains. Oil jumped on renewed hopes that producers would agree to meet to cut output (although we have heard this many times before), which helped lift energy companies. Nicholas Hyett, investment analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said: Oil stocks are rallying today on speculation that Opec might be willing to cut production. It will need to be a big cut though; some US storage facilities are at 90% of capacity with new production still to come online this year. Banks also came back from their beaten-down levels, after better than expected figures from Commerzbank, news that JP Morgan\u2019s Jamie Dimon was snapping up the bank\u2019s shares and Deutsche Bank\u2019s plan to buy back debt. Wall Street also helped, moving higher after better than expected US retail sales, while there appeared to be no real shocks in the eurozone GDP figures, albeit Greece moved back into recession. Investors are already looking ahead to Monday, when Chinese markets re-open after a week\u2019s holiday for New Year. Will its stock market move higher or play catch up with the falls elsewhere in global markets? With Wall Street closed on Monday, it could be another volatile day. Meanwhile the final scores in Europe ahead of the weekend showed: The FTSE 100 jumped 3.08% or 170.63 points to 5707.60, its biggest one day rise since August Germany\u2019s Dax added 2.45% to 8967.51 France\u2019s Cac climbed 2.52% to 3995.06 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 4.7% up at 16,514.87 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 2.25% better at 7920.8 In Greece, despite the protests and a slump back into recession, the Athens market added 3.04% to 454.29 In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 227 points or 1.4% higher. More pictures from Greece, where farmers are protesting outside parliament. And more proof of the volatile week markets have just suffered: Deutsche of course had been hit by worries about its balance sheet and the effect of negative interest rates, like others in the sector, as well as pressure on its contingent convertible bonds. But along with the recovery in bank shares, Deutsche has also been lifted by news it planned to buy back debt. The FTSE 100 has jumped 3.08%, its biggest one day rise since 27 August. As of Thursday, some \u00a380bn had been wiped off the UK\u2019s leading index. With today\u2019s recovery that has been cut to \u00a336bn. More on oil: Despite the current market rally, leading shares still have some way to go to mount a major recovery. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said: The week finishes in much better form than it began, with stock markets in Europe and the US clawing back losses, with even some better US retail sales figures adding to the merry mood. European markets in particular can look forward to more positive momentum on Monday, when the US is out of action for Presidents Day. That of course is the short-term picture, and for the FTSE 100 even a significant recovery in coming weeks, similar to that seen in January, would still leave the market in a firm downward move. Oil prices have been on another tear higher today, which has provided a firm base on which to build the broader stock market rally. However, pessimists (and there are many around at the moment) will be quick to point out that there\u2019s little sign of an actual meeting between major oil producers, and that Saudi intransigence on production cuts remains the chief, and currently insuperable, obstacle to tackling the problem of huge oversupply. At least the banks are doing better today, with both the FTSE banking sector and its European counterparts racing away. After all, even if rates aren\u2019t going higher, there\u2019s always the hope of more ECB largesse to sweeten the outlook somewhat... The return of China to the market fray after their holiday could also be key for further gains, although a couple of days of volatility as they play catch-up cannot be ruled out. US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen floated the idea the bank could look at negative rates in her testimony to Congress this week. But one of her colleagues is not so sure. New York Fed President William Dudley said negative rates elsewhere - ie in Japan and Europe - would have little effect on the US economy, reports Reuters, adding that negative rates \u201cshould not be part of the conversation right now in the US.\u201d He also said US bank were in good shape despite the share price falls in the sector in recent days. Negative interest rates should help lift growth and inflation but if the market turmoil continues, the economic consequences could outweigh the benefits, says Michael Pearce at Capital Economics. He says: In principle, cutting policy rates into negative territory should boost growth and inflation. But central banks have not communicated these benefits clearly, and the hesitant way in which they have been introduced has undermined confidence, raising the risk that negative rates do more harm than good. Although markets are rebounding today, the sharp falls in equity prices and in particular bank shares since the beginning of the year have led many to claim that negative rates are damaging global economic prospects. Markets have focused on three main concerns. First, negative deposit rates impose a direct financial cost on banks, harming their profitability and thus their willingness to make new loans...[But] we estimate that negative policy rates in the four European economies that have applied them are costing the banking sector around \u20ac3bn a year. That is a trivial fraction of their assets and is not a game-changer for their profitability either... The second fear is that the rush to impose negative policy rates is the latest front in a futile currency war. There is some truth to this argument as a weaker exchange rate is a key channel through which negative rates can operate. But there is little evidence that the major central banks are competing to weaken their currencies, and insofar as they are, the result will be looser global monetary policy which should be positive for global growth. Perhaps the biggest worry though is that cuts to policy rates have added to the sense that the world economy is slowing sharply and that policymakers are running out of options. Policy loosening has fuelled, rather than soothed, market fears...Central banks themselves are partly to blame for this response because they have repeatedly claimed that policy rates could not be lowered further, only to surprise the markets by cutting rates weeks later. No central bank has given a clear idea of how low interest rates on excess reserves could go, adding to the perception that they are flying blind. Nonetheless, claims that monetary policy has reached its limits are exaggerated. After all, there is still plenty of scope for further quantitative easing. The University of Michigan survey suggests a falling outlook for inflation: The US consumer confidence figures are not too bad under the circumstances, reckons James Knightley at ING Bank: US consumer confidence as measured by the University of Michigan dipped to 90.7 in February versus 92.0 in January. This is a bit weaker than the 92.3 consensus, but isn\u2019t too bad given the scale of equity market sell-off. Indeed, strong employment gains, rising real incomes and a firm housing market are providing enough offsetting effects for now and with retail sales having come in stronger than expected (when upward revisions are included) it looks a reasonably encouraging consumer spending story for now. However, equity markets don\u2019t seem particularly interested unfortunately and the longer that this goes on the greater the risk that it feeds negatively into the real economy through weaker sentiment and tighter financial conditions. And after the US retail sales, here is some less positive news in terms of consumer confidence. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index has missed expectations with a fall from 92 in December to 90.7. The consensus forecast was for a reading of 92 for January. The index of consumers expectations fell from 82.7 to 81, a four month low. Meanwhile business inventories rose 0.1%, in line with forecasts. Oil continues to rebound, on renewed hope of production cuts to stem the supply glut. Apparently helping the rally were reported comments from United Arab Emirates oil minister Suhail Al Mazrouei that producers were ready to work together. But we have been here many times before, and he was also reported as saying that there would be no cuts unless there was full co-operation among producers. There have been several optimistic reports suggesting Opec might be ready to talk to other producers such as Russia about limiting output, but so far no real progress. Nevertheless, Brent crude is now up 5% at $31.59 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is 6% better at $27.79. And that is one of the factors helping to support stock markets as they bounce back from recent lows. Another cut in the European Central Bank\u2019s deposit rate in March has strong support among the central bank\u2019s governing council, Reuters is reporting. Any cut could come as part of a broader package including some changes to the bank\u2019s asset purchase programme, but there is little appetite for more radical action . Reuters says markets are pricing in at least two rate cuts by the end of the year, taking the deposit rate from -0.3% to -0.55%. Banking groups are unlikely to be happy, since their shares have been hammered this week by fears about the effects of the wave of negative rates on their balance sheets and margins. Reuters reports one policymaker as saying: \u201cCutting the deposit rate by more than 10 basis points would hurt bank profitability, not a popular idea right now, especially given what\u2019s happening in the banking sector.\u201d With markets elsewhere moving ahead after the recent turmoil (the Nikkei was the exception), the US has joined in the more optimistic mood. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 140 points or 0.9% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.6% higher and the Nasdaq added 1%. Energy and financial stocks were among the early gainers. It appears there is some disagreement over the earlier comments about Greece from the IMF\u2019s Poul Thomsen: But: The US retail sales show consumer spending remains important to the country\u2019s economy but the key question is how it will cope with the global problems, says Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management: Consumer spending has played a starring role in supporting growth in the US\u2019 service-led economy, and the latest retail figures suggest this is set to continue. Lower oil prices have certainly helped, with the US consumer benefitting from cheaper gas to the tune of $80m per day. The labour market continues to strengthen and consumer confidence hasn\u2019t been shaken, all of which bodes well for the domestic economy. What really matters though, is how well the US weathers the global risks in the long-term: namely, Chinese devaluation and the exacerbating effect of the stronger US dollar. Clearly, the tentacles of the Chinese slowdown are spreading, and the lack of a clear enough policy is a red flag to ongoing volatility. Equally, the dollar has been strengthening due to the robustness \u2013 until recently \u2013 of the US recovery and the Fed\u2019s decision to hike rates in December. However, it does drag down exports and adds to the already widening trade deficit. While it\u2019s not yet a case of stunting US growth, all eyes will remain on Yellen to soothe where she can. For now, as hinted in her testimony to Congress, she\u2019ll continue to put any immediate rates rise on hold. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said the US retail sales showed some positive signs: With US data on the whole far from convincing following the interest rate rise, Fed Chair Janet Yellen will be pleased with the green shoots shown in today\u2019s retail sales figures. Any positive figure is a step in the right direction, and onlookers still await an uptick in consumer activity prompted by continuing low fuel and energy prices. Yellen will still be wary given that the numbers have been given a leg-up from the holiday season, and she should expect there to be further strain on the US economy in the coming months. Overall, US retail sales rose 0.2% in January, while the December figure has been revised upwards from a 0.1% fall to a gain of 0.2%, said the Commerce Department. Cheaper fuel prices as the oil price tumbled seemed to encourage spending, although it also cut back revenues at petrol stations, while spending at bars and restaurants was hit by the severe winter weather. But clothing stores saw sales rise 0.2% and online retailers saw a 1.6% jump (the effect of harsh weather again presumably). Over in the US and signs that consumers may be spending again as retail sales beat expectations. Core retail sales - which exclude cars, fuel, building materials and food services - increased 0.6% in January after a 0.3% fall in the previous month. Analysts had forecast an increase of around 0.3%. Deutsche Bank has confirmed earlier reports it may buy back some of its debt, an idea which has been supporting its share price after its falls earlier this week. Deutsche has said it will offer to buy up to \u20ac3bn of European debt and $2bn of US debt. Ahead of Greece falling into recession and the new protests in Athens, the International Monetary Fund has said that fears of the country leaving the eurozone will increase unless a credible reform plan is put together. And Poul Thomsen, head of the IMF\u2019s European department, said it had not yet seen such a plan. He repeated that debt relief - a bone of contention among some of the country\u2019s creditors - needed to be a key element of the programme. He wrote in a new IMF commentary: The IMF does not want Greece to implement draconian fiscal adjustment in an already severely depressed economy. In fact, we have time and again been the ones arguing for a fiscal adjustment path that is more supportive of recovery in the near term and more realistic in the medium term. We have yet to see a credible plan for how Greece will reach the very ambitious medium-term surplus target that is key to the government\u2019s plans for restoring debt sustainability. This emphasis on credibility is crucial for generating the investor confidence that is critical to Greece\u2019s revival. A plan built on over-optimistic assumptions will soon cause Grexit fears to resurface once again and stifle the investment climate. The overriding objective of the IMF\u2019s engagement with Greece is to help the country put itself back on a path of sustainable growth that benefits the Greek people. The IMF will support the Greek authorities and their European partners in developing a program of reforms and debt relief that adds up. There are difficult choices to be made, but it is important to make them so that Greece\u2019s efforts over the last six years are not wasted. On the need for both reforms and debt relief, he said: It is argued that the IMF has made its participation dependent on socially draconian reforms, especially of the pension system. This is not the case. Ultimately a program must add up: the combination of reforms plus debt relief must give us and the international community reasonable assurances that by the end of Greece\u2019s next program, after almost a decade of dependence on European and IMF assistance, Greece will finally be able to stand on its own. This implies an inverse trade-off between ambition of reforms and strength of debt relief\u2014we can certainly support a program with less ambitious reforms, but this will inevitably involve more debt relief. This said, no amount of pension reforms will make Greece\u2019s debt sustainable without debt relief, and no amount of debt relief will make Greece\u2019s pension system sustainable without pension reforms. Both need to come about. There is no doubt that both Greece and its European partners will face politically difficult decisions in the coming months to arrive at a program that is viable\u2014one that adds up. And on pensions, he said Greece is too poor to afford its present pension system: Despite the pension reforms of 2010 and 2012, Greece\u2019s pension system remains unaffordably generous. For instance, the standard pensions in nominal Euro terms are broadly similar in Greece and Germany, even though Germany\u2014measured by the average wage\u2014is twice as rich as Greece. Add to this that Greeks still retire much earlier than Germans and that Germany is much better at collecting social security contributions. The result is that the Greek budget needs to transfer some 10 percent of GDP to cover the gaping hole in the pension system, compared to a European average of some 2\u00bd percent. Clearly, this is unsustainable. The next phase of the eurozone crisis is about to begin, to judge by the latest GDP figures, argues our economics editor Larry Elliott. He writes: Greece is back in recession. Italy is barely growing. Portugal expanded but only at half the expected rate. The message could hardly be clearer: the next phase of the eurozone crisis is about to begin. On the face of it, the performance of the eurozone economy in the final three months of 2015 looks solid if unspectacular, with growth as measured by GDP up by 0.3%. But scratch beneath the surface and the picture looks far less rosy. The beneficial impacts of the European Central Bank\u2019s quantitative easing programme have started to wear off, as has the effect of the big drop in oil prices in the second half of 2014. The eurozone peaked in the second quarter of 2015 and the trend was starting to weaken even before the recent turbulence on the financial markets... In the short term, further stimulus from the ECB is a bolt-on certainty next month, either through cuts in interest rates or an expansion of its QE programme, or more likely both. In the longer term, a summer of crisis eurozone summits to discuss the fate of Greece looms. Probably not what David Cameron wants as he contemplates how to win his Brexit referendum. Larry\u2019s full comment is here: Here\u2019s our full report on the eurozone GDP figures: More on the yen: Europe\u2019s stock markets continue to shrug off the sight of protests in recession-hit Greece, and lacklustre growth in the euro area. Bank shares are still rallying, with Deutsche Bank up 9% and Commerzbank 17% higher after it announced its first dividend since 2007 today. Here\u2019s the lunchtime scores: FTSE 100: up 100 points at 5636, + 1.8% German DAX: up 136 points at 8,891, + 1.5% French CAC: up 47 points at 3,944, +1.2% David Lamb, head of dealing at the forex specialists FEXCO, says European investors are pinning their hopes on more stimulus from the European Central Bank: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine how the sense of deja-vu could be any stronger. The confirmation that Greece has slumped back into recession came as rioters stalked the streets of Athens to protest against government austerity. \u201cGrowth in the Eurozone\u2019s biggest economies remains weak too, so at first glance it\u2019s a puzzle that both European stocks and the Euro should rally in response to such a bleak picture. \u201cThe reason is the now racing certainty that the ECB will soon restart the Euro\u2019s printing presses. Mario Draghi has dropped ever heavier hints that more QE is coming - and on this evidence it may come as soon as March. Here\u2019s a round-up of the latest eurozone GDP data, from Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight: Fourth-quarter Eurozone GDP growth was limited by lacklustre German GDP growth of 0.3% quarter-on-quarter, which matched the third-quarter performance. German growth was reportedly held back by negative net trade in the fourth quarter as exports fell and imports rose. In addition, French GDP growth edged down to 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter from 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter, as it was held back slightly by a hit to economic activity from the Paris terrorist attacks in November. Particularly disappointingly, Italian barely grew in the fourth quarter as GDP edged up just 0.1% quarter-on-quarter. This continued a disappointing slippage in growth through 2015, as quarter-on-quarter GDP expansion came down from 0.2% in the third quarter, 0.3% in the second quarter and 0.4% in the first. Seemingly, unlike most Eurozone countries, Italian GDP was reliant on net trade in the fourth quarter as domestic demand was reported to have been a drag. On a more positive note, Spanish GDP growth held up well at 0.8% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter, having edged back to this level in the third quarter from a peak growth rate of 1.0% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter. Among the other Eurozone countries, there were modest pick-ups in quarter-on-quarter GDP growth in the fourth quarter in the Netherlands (to 0.3% from 0.1%), Belgium (to 0.3% from 0.2%) and Portugal (to 0.2% from 0.0%). Cyprus grew by 0.4% quarter-on-quarter, which was down slightly from 0.5% in the third quarter. Additionally, there was robust expansion in Slovakia (up 1.0% quarter-on-quarter, as it had been in the third quarter) and Estonia (up 1.2%). However, Greece moved into recession as GDP contracted by 0.6% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter after a drop of 1.4% in the third quarter as it continued to be hampered by fiscal austerity and capital controls Finland also moved into recession as GDP fell 0.1% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter after a drop of 0.6% in the third quarter. Furthermore, Austrian GDP was only flat quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter, as it had been in the third quarter. Greece\u2019s protesting farmers are digging in for the long haul. Athens correspondent Helena Smith reports that there are \u201cextraordinary scenes\u201d in the capital, ahead of a major anti-austerity protest later today. She writes: The area outside the agriculture ministry now resembles a war zone after farmers - mostly from Crete - fought pitched battles with police. Have just spoken to Manolis Gazakis, a farmer from the district of Rethymnon, who told me: \u201cWe said it would be war and we meant it. The government has to understand that it is us or them. We are not going to back down over measures that amount to our survival. Just the taxes they are proposing would kill us.\u201d The protestors are threatening to cut off major arteries in and around the city centre. Dozens of units of riot police have been deployed. Concern is such that road checks are even being conducted on trucks for fear that tractors may be hidden inside! Farmers, now pouring into the capital from other parts of the country, are said to be in negotiation with authorities ahead of a major rally later today. Greece\u2019s fall back into recession came as riot police clashed with farmers in Athens. They are holding a big anti-austerity rally, to urge prime minister Alexis Tsipras to withdraws its proposed social security and pension reform plan. Those reforms, though, are demanded by Greece\u2019s creditors in return for bailout funds - and eventual debt relief. Greece has lurched back into recession following the economic and political crisis last summer which saws its banks shuttered and capital controls imposed. Eurostat reports that Greek GDP fell by 0.6% in the last three months of 2015. That follows a 1.4% slump in output in the third quarter, and wipes out growth of 0.2% in April-June. Fourth-quarter GDP was a whopping 1.9% lower than a year earlier, Eurostat says. That\u2019s a serious slump, showing the damage suffered by Greece during the long standoff between Athens and its creditors last year. Greek companies have been warning for months that capital controls are hurting them badly, and these figures appear to back that up. Growth of 0.3% is quite mediocre, frankly, given the eurozone benefitted from substantial (and long-awaited) monetary stimulus last year. Lower energy bills should also have given consumers a lift. These charts from Eurostat show how eurozone growth remained at 0.3% in the fourth quarter of last year. Growth also slowed on an annual basis, across both the EU and the eurozone. Breaking: The eurozone economy grew by 0.3% in the final three months of 2015. Capital Economics isn\u2019t impressed with Portugal\u2019s growth rate: Breaking: Portugal also struggled in the last quarter of 2015. New growth figures from Lisbon show that Portuguese GDP only increased by 0.2% in the final quarter of 2015. Economists had hoped for growth of +0.4%. On an annual basis, Portugal\u2019s economy only expanded by 1.2% over 2015, below expectations of 1.4% growth. Italy\u2019s slowing economy will fuel concerns that Europe\u2019s recovery is running out of puff. Holger Sandte of Nordea Markets has tweeted this graph, showing how the eurozone lost momentum during 2015: We\u2019re expecting the overall euro area GDP figures to show an increase of 0.3% for the last quarter (they are released in 30 minutes). There\u2019s a clear downward trend in Italy\u2019s quarterly growth over the last year. ABN Amro economist Nick Kounis reminds us that Italy has been struggling for a while: Oh deary, deary me. Italy\u2019s economy only grew by 0.1% in the final three months of 2015, new data show. That\u2019s only half as fast as in July-September, when Italy expanded by 0.2%. It dashes hopes that growth might accelerate to +0.3%, and underlines the weakness of the eurozone economy. It appears that poor domestic demand held Italy back. The FT\u2019s Rome correspondent, James Politi, sounds worried: A flurry of new GDP data is hitting the wires. Poland has posted decent-looking growth, with GDP gaining 3.9% in the last year, or 1.1% quarter-on-quarter. And Bulgaria has grown by 3.1% annually, and 0.8% in the last quarter. Deutsche Bank is scrambling off the mat - shares are up by around 4%, and the cost of insuring its bonds against default has dipped. Greece and Italy share the dubious distinction of the worst-performing stock markets in 2016. Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB has lost a quarter of its value since January 1, while the Athex Composite has plunged by 30%. Spain, Germany and Austria are also lagging, with losses of around 17% each. Back to eurozone GDP, and Finland remains in recession after contracting by 0.1% in the last three months. That follows a 0.5% contraction in the July-September quarter, and means Finland\u2019s economy is still smaller than in 2008. It has suffered from falling demand for its paper industry, the decline of Nokia, and the impact of sanctions on its neighbour, Russia. And as a member of the eurozone, Finland hasn\u2019t been able to devalue its currency. There are remarkable scenes in Athens right now, as farmers protesting against pension cuts and austerity measures clash with riot police. After weeks of protests, which closed motorways, the farmers have decamped to the Greek capital for a mass rally. More than 300 famers have made the trip from Crete, to urge Alexis Tsipras\u2019s government not to impose reforms to social security system. Here\u2019s a video clip which appears to show farmers chasing the riot police down an Athens street: Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, says we should be cautious about today\u2019s rally: London\u2019s FTSE-100 is positively flying as the week\u2019s final session gets underway, with almost 100 points having been tacked on already. A late rally on Wall Street and a relatively measured day\u2019s trade across most of Asia \u2013 aside from Japan \u2013 is helping throw a little confidence into the mix as we run towards the weekend break. Oil is also working its way a little higher off recent lows, which will be helping sentiment for stocks - but critically the fundamentals haven\u2019t changed. As such, this still looks more like bargain hunting than the market turning its back definitively on the run lower. London\u2019s shares are surging higher, pushing the FTSE 100 up by 96 points. The other European indices are also higher, helped by those bank and mining shares. Financial shares are rallying across Europe, pushing the Stoxx 600 bank index up by 2.7%. Commerzbank can take some of the credit. Early today the German lender announced its first dividend since 2007, after posting better-than-expected fourth quarter profits. Hold onto your hats! Shares are rallying at the start of trading in London. In London the FTSE 100 has jumped by 62 points, a gain of 1.1%. Most shares are gaining ground, including mining companies and banks who have been badly hit by this week\u2019s panicky selling. Rolls-Royce is leading the rally, after sparing investors another profits warning this morning (although it did slash its dividend). Remember, the Footsie plunged by over 2% yesterday, so this is only a partial recovery after a pretty rough week. Pedestrians in Toyko stopped to stare as their stock market plunged by 5% today, in its worst weekly rout since 2008 today. VP Bank Group chief economist Thomas Gitzel says the 0.3% rise in German GDP was \u201cnot exhilarating\u201d but also not a reason to worry. He told Reuters that: \u201cSlow but steady was the retrospective motto for 2015\u201d The Financial Times points out that Germans have rarely had it so good: Back in the markets, gold is on track for its best week since October 2011 as investors scurry for safety. Gold bugs will be rubbing their hands, after seeing the spot price of bullion jump 6% since Monday. It hit a one-year high of $1,260 per ounce overnight, before dipping a little. Gold\u2019s failing as investment vehicle is that it doesn\u2019t pay a return. But when capital preservation is the name of the game, people pile in. Is Germany getting a refugee boost? ING economist Carsten Brzeski warns that 2016 could be harder for Germany than many people expect. He writes: On top of the well-known risk factor like slowing China and emerging markets or a still struggling Eurozone, low oil prices and the possible weakness of the US economy could give the German economy a hard time. In particular, any slowdown of the US economy could turn out to be a double whammy for Germany. The direct impact through weaker demand from last year\u2019s most important trading partner and the indirect impact through a stronger euro are in our view currently the biggest risks for the German economy. To some extent, there are similarities between Germany\u2019s showcase soccer team Bayern Munich and the Eurozone\u2019s showcase economy. At first glance, both performances look impressive and flawless. At second glance, however, weaknesses have emerged recently. These weaknesses have clearly increased the risk for both Bayern Munich and the German economy to surprisingly be knocked off their respective pedestals in the coming weeks and months. Here\u2019s Carsten\u2019s full take on this morning\u2019s GDP figures. Bloomberg economist Maxime Sbaihi\u2019s eagle eye has spotted something important in the German data (which is online here) Germany\u2019s trade with the rest of the world weakened in the last quarter. Destatis reports that: The development of foreign trade had a downward effect on growth because the exports of goods were down on the previous quarter. Imports decreased, too, though less strongly. Johannes Gareis, economist at French investment bank Natixis, confirms that this held back growth: The German economy achieved \u201cmoderate growth\u201d in the last quarter, says Destatis. And it appears that Germany relied on domestic demand. Destatis explains: General government final consumption expenditure was markedly up, while household final consumption expenditure rose slightly again. A positive development was also observed for capital formation. And this chart shows German growth since the debt crisis began: Here we go! The German economy grew by just 0.3% in the final three months of the year. That matches economist forecasts - and confirms that Europe\u2019s largest economy is only expanding quite modestly. It\u2019s not the robust growth that politicians would like to see - on the other hand, Germany is also avoiding being pulled into recession by the global downturn. Over in Tokyo, traders are catching their breath after riding out the worst week in over seven years. Today\u2019s 4.8% plunge means that the Nikkei has shed 11.1% this week, the biggest weekly drop since October, 2008. Recession fears stalked the markets. Tsuyoshi Shimizu, chief strategist at Mizuho Asset Management, explains: The markets are clearly starting to price in a sharp slowdown in the world economy and even a recession in the United States. \u201cI do not expect a collapse or major financial crisis like the Lehman crisis but it will take some before market sentiment will improve,\u201d he added. Here\u2019s our story on the latest Asian rout: Eurozone GDP day usually starts with French growth numbers. But not today, because INSEE actually reported two weeks ago that the eurozone\u2019s second-largest economy grew by only 0.2% in October-December, down from 0.3% in the summer. That weak performance bolstered fears that the French economy was stuttering. IG are calling the European stock markets slightly this morning: But given the volatility this week, who knows? After a wild week, economists hope that today\u2019s eurozone growth figures could provide some relief to the financial markets. Then again, it could make things worse: Good morning. We\u2019re tracking two important stories today - the ongoing turmoil in the world financial markets, and the release of eurozone growth figures for the last quarter. Last night, global markets sank into \u2018bear territory\u2019, when fresh falls on Wall Street dragged world stocks 20% below their recent high: Global stocks enter bear market after another rout - as it happened And the selling hasn\u2019t stopped. Already today, Japan\u2019s stock market has tumbled by another 4.8%, following Thursday\u2019s big selloff in Europe. The selloff appears to being driven by continued fears of a global downturn, and the health of the banking sector - as analysts warn that negative interest rates could seriously threaten their business model. And we\u2019ll get a good insight into the European economy this morning, with a flurry of new growth figures from most of the major EU countries. Here are the main events to watch out for:: Germany: 7am GMT / 8am CET Italy: 9am GMT / 10am CET Portugal: 9,30am GMT / 10.30am CET Greece: 10am GMT / 11am CET The eurozone: 10am GMT / 11am CET Economists predict that eurozone growth remained sluggish at just 0.3%. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events though the day....",

                "bodyText":"A recovery in US consumer spending revived battered stock markets in Europe and New York on Friday, despite the latest eurozone GDP figures showing a broad slowdown across the currency union and Greece slipping back into recession. The FTSE 100 soared 169 points to register the strongest daily increase since last August, before the Dow Jones index followed suit in New York, wiping out much of the losses from earlier in the week as January figures for US consumer spending beat expectations. The FTSE 100 still ended the week down 2.4%. Nine of the 10 major sectors in Wall Street\u2019s Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s index were higher, led by a 2.4% rise in the financial sector, which fought off concerns that low interest rates and risky lending had undermined the stability of some institutions. Banks were helped by comments from Bill Dudley, deputy chairman of the US Federal Reserve, who said they were well capitalised and able to withstand a global shock. JP Morgan jumped 5.6% to $56.05 a share after chief executive Jamie Dimon bought more than $25m (\u00a317.24m) of the bank\u2019s stock. For much of the week, investors feared that a contraction in US factory output, sluggish employment growth and persistently low inflation were signals that the US economy was heading for a recession. Plunging oil prices, which slumped below $27 a barrel in the US, falling commodity values and a rush by investors to safe haven assets added to the gloomy picture. James Knightley, an economist at ING Financial Markets, said resilient US employment, rising real incomes and a recovering housing market in a period of extreme volatility on global markets, were providing enough offsetting effects for now. \u201cHowever, equity markets don\u2019t seem particularly interested unfortunately and the longer that this goes on the greater the risk that it feeds negatively into the real economy through weaker sentiment and tighter financial conditions,\u201d he said. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, said the health of the US economy depended on how well it could weather the global risks in the long term, especially a devaluation of the Chinese currency that would make US exports more expensive. \u201cClearly, the tentacles of the Chinese slowdown are spreading and the lack of a clear enough policy is a red flag to ongoing volatility,\u201d she said. Fed chief Janet Yellen failed to calm markets during an appearance on Capitol Hill this week, when she said that it was possible the central bank would cut rates if the situation deteriorated. Dudley waded into the debate on Friday, downplaying the likelihood of a rate cut: \u201cTo me, that\u2019s not something that should be part of the conversation right now.\u201d The US economy has \u201cquite a bit\u201d of momentum that will help offset weakness from abroad, he said, even as he acknowledged he now expected inflation to take a bit longer to return to the Fed\u2019s 2% target because of the drag from the falling price of oil. The 19-member eurozone economy added another prop to market sentiment after figures showed it grew 0.3% in the final quarter of 2015 after German exports put in a strong performance. But analysts continued to worry that the refugee crisis and the prospect of Greece defaulting on its loans, forcing it to seek further funds from Brussels and the International Monetary Fund, would halt the eurozone recovery. France and Italy, which appeared to be recovering strongly last spring, showed that even the second and third largest economies in the currency zone were ailing. France could only manage 0.2% growth in the final quarter while Italy registered 0.1% growth, despite benefiting from low energy costs, an export-boosting drop in the euro\u2019s value and monetary stimulus from the central bank. Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics, said the downside risks had increased and as a result the European Central Bank will back \u201cfurther decisive policy support\u201d at its March meeting. Greece, which has seen its debt to GDP ratio soar past 190% in recent months, fell into recession after recording its second quarter of negative growth. The Syriza government, led by prime minister Alexis Tsipras, has struggled to maintain a recovery that followed an accord signed last summer for a third bailout. Lenders are demanding that Greece scrap tax breaks for farmers and impose pension reforms that will lead to higher monthly contributions from the self-employed and salaried employees. Farmers carried their protest to Athens on Friday, driving tractors through the centre of the city and rioting when blocked by police from approaching government buildings.",

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Since early December, a general deterioration in market sentiment has taken root and has gathered pace over the last week. This initially appeared closely linked to concerns regarding weakening economic activity around the globe \u2013 notably in emerging markets \u2013 and to potential adverse signals from falling commodity prices. Over time however, market sentiment has become more volatile and susceptible to rapid change. In this environment, stock prices significantly declined and bank equity prices were particularly hit, both globally and in Europe. The sharp fall in bank equity prices reflected the sector\u2019s higher sensitivity to a weaker-than-expected economic outlook; it also reflected fears that some parts of the banking sector were exposed to the higher risks in commodity-producing sectors. The bulk of euro area listed banks, although they have relatively limited exposure to emerging markets and commodity producing countries, are currently trading well below their book values. </p> <p>The fall in bank equity prices was amplified by perceptions that banks may have to do more to adjust their business models to the lower growth/lower interest rate environment and to the strengthened international regulatory framework that has been put in place since the crisis.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"695e667211d8c3a6024acdb26d6fa4ebdf796b2f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/695e667211d8c3a6024acdb26d6fa4ebdf796b2f/0_0_598_336/500.jpg\" alt=\"Draghi at the European Parliament.\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Draghi at the European Parliament.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: European Parliament</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He also tried to calm concerns about the state of European banks, in particular in relation to non-performing loans:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the euro area, the situation in the banking sector now is very different from what it was in 2012. Perhaps most importantly, euro area banks have significantly strengthened their capital positions over the past few years...</p> <p>Clearly, some parts of the banking sector in the euro area still face a number of challenges. These range from uncertainty about litigation and restructuring costs in a number of banks to working through a stock of legacy assets, particularly in the countries most affected by the financial crisis. There is a subset of banks with elevated levels of non-performing loans (NPLs). However, these NPLs were identified during the Comprehensive Assessment, using for the first time a common definition, and have since been adequately provisioned for. Therefore, we are in a good position to bring down NPLs in an orderly manner over the next few years. For this purpose, the ECB\u2019s supervisory arm is working closely with the relevant national authorities to ensure that our NPL policies are complemented by the necessary national measures.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-02-15T14:29:22.575Z\">at 2.29pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-56c1dac7e4b0eba06ed5ff12\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-15T14:07:32.075Z\">2.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">ECB will not hesitate to act - Draghi</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>European Central Bank president Mario Draghi has said the bank will not hesitate to act in the light of the recent economic and market turmoil.</p> <p>At its last meeting the ECB said it would review its monetary policy stance at its next meeting in March, but<strong><a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2016/html/sp160215.en.html\"> in a speech to the European Parliament</a></strong>, Draghi suggested the turbulence in the markets last week has given it extra urgency:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In order to make the euro area more resilient, contributions from all policy areas are needed. The ECB is ready to do its part. As we announced at the end of our last monetary policy meeting in January, the Governing Council will review and possibly reconsider the monetary policy stance in early March. The focus of our deliberations will be twofold.</p> <p>First, we will examine the strength of the pass-through of low imported inflation to domestic wage and price formation and to inflation expectations. This will depend on the size and the persistence of the fall in oil and commodity prices and the incidence of second-round effects on domestic wages and prices.</p> <p>Second, in the light of the recent financial turmoil, we will analyse the state of transmission of our monetary impulses by the financial system and in particular by banks. If either of these two factors entail downward risks to price stability, we will not hesitate to act.</p> </blockquote> <p>And he repeated his calls for fiscal policies to help the economy recover:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In parallel, other policies should help to put the euro area economy on firmer grounds. It is becoming clearer and clearer that fiscal policies should support the economic recovery through public investment and lower taxation. In addition, the ongoing cyclical recovery should be supported by effective structural policies. In particular, actions to improve the business environment, including the provision of an adequate public infrastructure, are vital to increase productive investment, boost job creations and raise productivity. Compliance with the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact remains essential to maintain confidence in the fiscal framework. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-02-15T14:23:13.235Z\">at 2.23pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-56c1ce9ae4b0eba06ed5ff04\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-15T13:13:10.919Z\">1.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>It is doubtful that HSBC ever intended to leave the UK and highly likely chancellor George Osborne paid too high a price to ensure it stayed,</strong> says economics editor Larry Elliott.<br></p> <p>His full analysis is here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/2016/feb/15/hsbcs-gunboat-diplomacy-london-george-osborne\">HSBC's gunboat diplomacy worked well.

European markets are also strongly higher, but with the US out of the picture due to a national holiday it is too early to know whether these gains are going to last into the rest of the week.</p> <p>Oil prices, which are still the main determinant of whether stock markets go up or down, are higher on the day; if the commodity can keep rallying into coming sessions we will see fresh buying momentum develop in stock markets.</p> </blockquote> <p> Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Equity markets making a bullish start to the week<strong>, </strong>adding to the gains of Friday and Thursday\u2019s bounce from lows helped by breaks of the February downtrends.

This after poor data from China (Exports, Imports) and Japan (GDP, Industrial Production) added to hopes of more central bank intervention and stimulus which buoyed commodities prices. Add to this a continued waning of worries over the banking sector (despite many a headwind remaining) thanks to talk of the ECB buying bundles of bad loans from Italian banks and many are asking if we have found a bottom.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa4f5752f073ce5659b445e6ac02916c1f312c83\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa4f5752f073ce5659b445e6ac02916c1f312c83/0_0_1142_631/1000.jpg\" alt=\"FTSE 100 risers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"553\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">FTSE 100 risers</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b0a7df6248a21e30f26f9aa17ad25a756f71655\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b0a7df6248a21e30f26f9aa17ad25a756f71655/0_0_1013_608/1000.jpg\" alt=\"FTSE 100 fallers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">FTSE 100 fallers</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-02-15T10:27:00.023Z\">at 10.27am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-56c1a3dae4b02a1b50141cb2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-15T10:11:28.443Z\">10.11am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">HSBC warns on Brexit</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>After HSBC announced it planned to keep its headquarters in the UK, it has also warned it could move 1,000 investment banking jobs from London to Paris if the UK leaves the European Union.</strong> Jill Treanor reports:</p> <blockquote> <p>HSBC chairman Douglas Flint told the BBC that while the \u201cbest answer\u201d was to remain in a reformed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news\">Europe</a>, the bank had the ability, in the event of a \u201cno\u201d vote, to \u201cmove people between London and Paris\u201d.</p> <p>Flint was referring to the bank\u2019s non-ringfenced operations.

They say a week can be a long time in politics (I think it was Harold Wilson the former British prime minister, who coined the phrase), and the same could also be said for the markets.

                "bodyText":"With no guidance from Wall Street, one way or the other, European markets continue to perform strongly. Investors had feared there would be a collapse in the Chinese market which wouild cause more turmoil elsewhere, but this failed to happen. Instead a 7.% rise in Japan is one of the driving factors behind broad based gain elsewhere. The FTSE 100 is currently more than 2% higher while Germany\u2019s Dax has jumped 3%, France\u2019s Cac has climbed 3.5% and Spain\u2019s Ibex is up 3.1%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for your comments and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Augustin Eden at Accendo Markets said: Mario Draghi\u2019s speech at the European Parliament is essentially an exercise in reassurance, because no one \u2013 not even the central banks - knows what\u2019s going on at the moment. The market simply doesn\u2019t stay in one place long enough to be prescribed the right treatment. So we must wait until March for genuine talk about specifics, and things could well be very different by then. Of course, they could also be exactly the same as they are now! Question: Inflation expectations over 10 years are well below ECB targets. Which indicator would you use. What would be success or failure of monetary policy? What is the appropriate fiscal stance. Draghi: We are far away, we do not use one set of indicators [five years, ten years]. But we are far away, so we will reconsider stance in March. Our objective is rate below but close to 2%. Our horizon to reach the target has been lengthened... due to developments out of our control: emerging markets, oil prices, etc. The same situation is in the US, Japan. Appropriate fiscal stance for eurozone. At the moment, lightly expansionary. Ideally should be expansionary while in line with stability and growth pact. Draghi\u2019s comments about being ready to act seem to be sending the euro lower. The single currency is down more than 1% on the day against the dollar at $1.1141. Question: Your policies have been criticised for not working, including savers with low interest rates. Also I read the ECB is in talks with Italian government about buying bundles of bad loans. My question is, why? How is it in the interests of rest of euro area? Draghi: Don\u2019t agree QE and monetary policy not working. It has been the only one stimulative policy. We now face a situation different to two years ago. We have a gradual recovery, which continues. We have to get inflation back to our objective, below or close to 2%. On that front the situation is less satisfactory. The council will review and reconsider monetary policy stance in March. This policy produces low interest rates. But we have low interest rates everywhere. The problems savers etc in eurozone are the same as in US and Japan. The solutions are slightly different. We are very conscious of this, and wish rates could go up again. It would mean recovery is proceeding successfully. On Italian talks - not that I know. The story that ECB would buy non-performing loand in Italy. We are not talking about buying anything. The question is could they be accepted as collatoral. [But] collatoral is different from purchasing. He added that having NPLs in asset backed securities would not disqualify using ABS\u2019s as collatoral. But I am not aware of talks, and I would say we have no losses on our collatoral at the moment. Question on the current negotiations between the EU and Britain. Draghi: The ECB is not a party to these negotations. We can say two things. There are two aspects we should protect [in any negotiations]. One is single market, second is our monetary union. Further integration of our monetary union is essential. The EU and Britain have to work together, both drawing benefits from it, he says, adding: The objective of the talks is to anchor the UK in the EU. Question about abolition of \u20ac500 note [as it is linked increasingly with crime] Draghi: We are considering action on that front. We have to do it very carefully. The council and board reflecting on how to do it in best way. But nothing to do with reducing cash [in the system]. Draghi has also addressed the meltdown in the banking sector in recent days, which has been partly caused by concern about the effect of negative interest rates on banks\u2019 margins. He said: Since early December, a general deterioration in market sentiment has taken root and has gathered pace over the last week. This initially appeared closely linked to concerns regarding weakening economic activity around the globe \u2013 notably in emerging markets \u2013 and to potential adverse signals from falling commodity prices. Over time however, market sentiment has become more volatile and susceptible to rapid change. In this environment, stock prices significantly declined and bank equity prices were particularly hit, both globally and in Europe. The sharp fall in bank equity prices reflected the sector\u2019s higher sensitivity to a weaker-than-expected economic outlook; it also reflected fears that some parts of the banking sector were exposed to the higher risks in commodity-producing sectors. The bulk of euro area listed banks, although they have relatively limited exposure to emerging markets and commodity producing countries, are currently trading well below their book values. The fall in bank equity prices was amplified by perceptions that banks may have to do more to adjust their business models to the lower growth/lower interest rate environment and to the strengthened international regulatory framework that has been put in place since the crisis. He also tried to calm concerns about the state of European banks, in particular in relation to non-performing loans: In the euro area, the situation in the banking sector now is very different from what it was in 2012. Perhaps most importantly, euro area banks have significantly strengthened their capital positions over the past few years... Clearly, some parts of the banking sector in the euro area still face a number of challenges. These range from uncertainty about litigation and restructuring costs in a number of banks to working through a stock of legacy assets, particularly in the countries most affected by the financial crisis. There is a subset of banks with elevated levels of non-performing loans (NPLs). However, these NPLs were identified during the Comprehensive Assessment, using for the first time a common definition, and have since been adequately provisioned for. Therefore, we are in a good position to bring down NPLs in an orderly manner over the next few years. For this purpose, the ECB\u2019s supervisory arm is working closely with the relevant national authorities to ensure that our NPL policies are complemented by the necessary national measures. European Central Bank president Mario Draghi has said the bank will not hesitate to act in the light of the recent economic and market turmoil. At its last meeting the ECB said it would review its monetary policy stance at its next meeting in March, but in a speech to the European Parliament, Draghi suggested the turbulence in the markets last week has given it extra urgency: In order to make the euro area more resilient, contributions from all policy areas are needed. The ECB is ready to do its part. As we announced at the end of our last monetary policy meeting in January, the Governing Council will review and possibly reconsider the monetary policy stance in early March. The focus of our deliberations will be twofold. First, we will examine the strength of the pass-through of low imported inflation to domestic wage and price formation and to inflation expectations. This will depend on the size and the persistence of the fall in oil and commodity prices and the incidence of second-round effects on domestic wages and prices. Second, in the light of the recent financial turmoil, we will analyse the state of transmission of our monetary impulses by the financial system and in particular by banks. If either of these two factors entail downward risks to price stability, we will not hesitate to act. And he repeated his calls for fiscal policies to help the economy recover: In parallel, other policies should help to put the euro area economy on firmer grounds. It is becoming clearer and clearer that fiscal policies should support the economic recovery through public investment and lower taxation. In addition, the ongoing cyclical recovery should be supported by effective structural policies. In particular, actions to improve the business environment, including the provision of an adequate public infrastructure, are vital to increase productive investment, boost job creations and raise productivity. Compliance with the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact remains essential to maintain confidence in the fiscal framework. It is doubtful that HSBC ever intended to leave the UK and highly likely chancellor George Osborne paid too high a price to ensure it stayed, says economics editor Larry Elliott. His full analysis is here: Is the European Central Bank\u2019s Outright Monetary Transactions policy - president Mario Draghi\u2019s promise in 2012 to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the euro - legal? The European Court of Justice has ruled it is, but on Tuesday a German court will look at the issue (although no judgement is expected until the summer. UniCredit\u2019s Andreas Rees says: Tomorrow, a public hearing on the OMT before the German Constitutional Court (GCC) will take place. Besides the complainants, Bundesbank President Weidmann and ECB Executive Board Member Mersch will also attend. The ruling is expected by summer. In June 2015, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) already stated that the OMT is legal under EU law. However, the GCC made the controversial claim of having the right to deliver a final judgment as far as German institutions (the Bundesbank) are concerned. In general, we expect the GCC to accept the verdict of the ECJ. In order not to lose its face, the GCC could stress the responsibility of the German government and the Bundestag in case of the OMT being activated. One possibility is the making of provisions for the federal budget in the theoretical case of losses for the Bundesbank. Even if the GCC was heading for an outright confrontation with the ECJ there would not be any legal obstacles (for the Bundesbank) to participate further in QE. Over in Greece and the country\u2019s budget primary surplus came in at \u20ac1.19bn in January, up from \u20ac443m last year and well above the target of \u20ac307m. The figures were helped by better than expected revenues and lower than forecast outlays. The Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann may find himself in a tricky spot: More signs that the European Central Bank may act next month to provide further stimulus to the economy, including rate cuts, following news that Germany\u2019s central bank has cut its inflation forecasts for this year and next. The Bundesbank has slashed its forecast for inflation in 2016 from 1.1% to just 0.25% and in 2017 from 2% to 1.75%. The move comes amid the slump in oil prices, and the bank said: \u201cFluctuations in the price of oil typically have a very fast and noticeable effect on the price of energy for consumers.\u201d The ECB will be looking at its own forecasts for its March meeting, and if it also cuts them, further action is likely. Thousands of steelworkers are starting to arrive in Brussels to protest against what they call unfair trading practices by Chinese firms. The eurozone trade figures showed a rise in the trade balance to \u20ac24.3bn in December from \u20ac23.6bn a year earlier. Exports slipped 0.3% month on month as the benefits of a weaker euro were outweighed by a slowdown in global growth. Imports rose 0.8% in December compared to the previous month. Economist Howard Archer at IHG Global Insight said: Weakened December traded goods data reinforce suspicion that net trade was of little help to Eurozone GDP growth in the fourth quarter.... While eurozone exporters have had appreciable help from a very competitive euro, the upside for exports has been constrained by muted global growth. Looking ahead, Eurozone exporters manufacturers will be worried by the current heightened concerns over global growth and they will also not be happy with the euro\u2019s recent overall firmer tone \u2013 although it is still at a competitive level. With US markets closed and the half term school holiday underway in the UK, it is hard to know how sustainable the market rally is, but continuing strength in the oil price could help. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said: The new week on the London market is barely two hours old, but already the FTSE 100 has notched up triple-digit gains, having risen nearly 6% from the lows seen last Thursday. As with other bounces in recent months, the move has many scratching their heads and wondering why investors have suddenly become so ebullient, when not even a week ago all was doom and gloom. However, the rally comes within the context of a broader downtrend that is a reflection of ongoing concerns about the global economy. For the moment therefore, this upward move gets filed as a brief flowering of bullish sentiment, rather than the start of something much more long-term. European markets are also strongly higher, but with the US out of the picture due to a national holiday it is too early to know whether these gains are going to last into the rest of the week. Oil prices, which are still the main determinant of whether stock markets go up or down, are higher on the day; if the commodity can keep rallying into coming sessions we will see fresh buying momentum develop in stock markets. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets said: Equity markets making a bullish start to the week, adding to the gains of Friday and Thursday\u2019s bounce from lows helped by breaks of the February downtrends. And it would appear to be a case of bad news is good news again. This after poor data from China (Exports, Imports) and Japan (GDP, Industrial Production) added to hopes of more central bank intervention and stimulus which buoyed commodities prices. Add to this a continued waning of worries over the banking sector (despite many a headwind remaining) thanks to talk of the ECB buying bundles of bad loans from Italian banks and many are asking if we have found a bottom. After HSBC announced it planned to keep its headquarters in the UK, it has also warned it could move 1,000 investment banking jobs from London to Paris if the UK leaves the European Union. Jill Treanor reports: HSBC chairman Douglas Flint told the BBC that while the \u201cbest answer\u201d was to remain in a reformed Europe, the bank had the ability, in the event of a \u201cno\u201d vote, to \u201cmove people between London and Paris\u201d. Flint was referring to the bank\u2019s non-ringfenced operations. The ringfenced bank includes HSBC\u2019s high street operations, which are to be headquartered in Birmingham to comply with the new rules that protect taxpayers from having to bail out banks. The referendum on Europe, which could be held in June, would have less of an impact on the \u201cholding company\u201d but could impact the operational activities of the wholesale bank, he said. Stuart Gulliver, the chief executive of HSBC, later told Sky News: \u201cWe have 5,000 people in global banking and markets [HSBC\u2019s investment bank] in London and I could imagine that around 20% of those would move to Paris.\u201d Our full report is here: As the market rally continues, the biggest riser in the FTSE 100 is consumer goods group Reckitt Benckiser. The company, whose products range from Nurofen tablets to Durex condoms, reported a 6% rise in like-for-like full year sales, better than the 5.3% forecast from analysts. The results have helped lift its shares more than 6%. With investors taking a more optimistic view of equity markets, the traditional haven in stormy times - gold - is losing its lustre at the moment. Gold is down from $1237 to $1210 an ounce, while silver is also on the slide, down from $15.71 to $15.29 an ounce. The European Central Bank is talking to the Italian government about using its asset purchase programme to buy bad loans packages from banks and accepting them as collateral in return for cash, according to Reuters: The move could give a big boost to a recently approved Italian scheme aimed at helping banks offload some of their 200 billion euros ($225 billion) of soured credit and free up resources for new loans. Nonetheless, it would likely fuel a debate in other countries about whether the ECB is taking on too much risk by buying asset-backed securities (ABS) based on loans that have not been repaid for roughly three months. Italian Treasury officials told reporters the ECB may buy these securities as part of its 1.5 trillion euros asset-purchase program or accept them as collateral from banks in return for cash, in so called repurchase agreements. The ECB declined to comment. Whether the current market rally has any staying power could depend on the central banks, notably the Federal Reserve, says Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe at stockbroker Interactive Investor: Stocks have soared in Asia, rebounding aggressively after last week\u2019s falls and providing further impetus for European markets. Recent moves have seen markets lurching from anticipation to despair, sometimes on the same day - so the hope is that this sharp move higher will set a more positive tone for investors, rather than just be seen as an opportunity to sell the rally. Global central banks are yet again in the spotlight, with the People\u2019s Bank of China intervening to boost the renminbi and Mario Draghi widely expected to discuss further support during his testimony this afternoon. Janet Yellen spent much of last week trying to deflect blame for the market turmoil from the Federal Reserve, but with the ECB, BoJ, and now also the PBoC all actively supporting investors it does rather appear as though the US Fed represents the principal downside risk for global equity markets. Katherine Garrett-Cox is to leave Alliance Trust, the investment company where she became chief executive in 2008, in the latest stage of a shake-up of the business. She stepped down from the board last year but remained chief executive of the company\u2019s fund management arm. Now Alliance said she will leave on 11March by mutual agreement. The business was targeted last year by hedge fund Elliott Advisors who criticised its performance and cost base, leading to a change of chairman. Lord Smith of Kelvin, the new chairman said: Alliance Trust is undergoing significant change to improve both its operating performance and investment returns...it is clear to us that the role of chief executive of Alliance Trust Investments has changed significantly. Garrett-Cox - known in the City as \u201cKatherine the Great\u2019 - earned \u00a31.4m last year, and the company said compensation for her loss of office would be paid \u201cin line with Alliance Trust\u2019s remuneration policy and the terms of Katherine\u2019s contract.\u201d More on what to expect from ECB president Mario Draghi at the European parliament later. Analyst at UniCredit said: Given the latest market developments and with inflation expectations at record lows, we expect confirmation that more easing is in the pipeline. However, testimonies to the EU parliament do not usually send new policy messages, so hints at specific measures are unlikely. On Thursday, the account of the monetary policy meeting held on 21 January will be released. After that meeting - which kept rates on hold - Draghi said the ECB would review its policy measures in March, sooner than many investors had been expecting. As expected European markets have followed Asia higher in early trading. The FTSE 100 is up 97 points or 1.7% while Germany\u2019s Dax has added 2.1%, France\u2019s Cac has climbed 2.2%, Spain\u2019s Ibex 2.65% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB 1.7% at the open. The FTSE Eurofirst300 is ahead 1.6%. Banks, hard hit last week on fears that negative interest rates would squeeze their margins at a time when their balance sheets were already under pressure, are among the leading risers. Commerzbank is up 9.4%, Deutsche Bank 4.8% and Credit Suisse 7.3%. In the FTSE 100 Barclays is 2.5% better while HSBC, which has confirmed it will keep its headquarters in the UK, is up 1.1%. Oil has stabilised after its recent volatility, with Brent crude down just 0.18% at $33.3 a barrel. Despite predictions of a crash in Chinese markets when they re-opened after the Lunar New Year holiday, the worst fears were not realised. Both the CSI300 and the Shanghai Composite have ended down around 0.6%, helped by the positive mood in other Asian markets, notably Japan where the yen weakened amid promises of more intervention if necessary. On the corporate front, BAE Systems has appointed oil executive Charles Woodburn to the newly created role of chief operating officer. The move puts Woodburn in line to replace chief executive Ian King in 12 to 18 months time. It\u2019s a quiet day for data, apart from eurozone trade data and a speech from European Central Bank president Mario Draghi at the European parliament. And with US markets closed for Presidents Day - the country\u2019s tribute to George Washington and Abraham Lincoln - it is Asia which is likely to dominate sentiment for the day. Commenting on the action so far, Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: A strong fix for the yuan has eased devaluation concerns leading to relatively small losses in China, a rebound across the rest of Asia and a higher open expected for Europe. Ordinarily, US markets closed for Presidents Day would leave European trading are a little on the quiet side but recent volatility could mean otherwise. There had been some expectation that Chinese markets could wreak havoc as the country plays catch-up with sharp declines in global stock markets after returning from Lunar New Year celebrations. A bigger than expected decline in Chinese trade data was offset by soothing word over the weekend from PBOC governor Zhou Xiaochuan who played down forex fears. Later in the week comes a range of UK data, including inflation, unemployment and retail sales. And the minutes of the last US Federal Reserve meeting will also be released, although they are somewhat out of date given Fed chair Janet Yellen\u2019s testimony to Congress last week when she raised the prospect of negative US interest rates. Meanwhile the ECB\u2019s attempts to lower the euro have been under pressure so Draghi\u2019s speech will be widely watched. Lawler said: The euro has been a beneficiary of risk-off in financial markets, trading at its highest since October against the dollar. European Central Bank president Mario Draghi\u2019s last attempt to talk up the prospect of further easing at the ECB\u2019s March meeting had the unusual effect of sending the euro higher so he may look to reassert his influence in his speech. I\u2019m handing over to Nick Fletcher, my colleague in London, who bring you all the day\u2019s developments from the UK, European and US markets. Have a good day and thanks for joining me. The FTSE100 and Germany\u2019s DAX is set for a strong opening today according to IG. The puzzle that is the financial markets is engaging brains all over the world. Ajay Rajadhyaksha, an economist at Barclays in New York, told Reuters that market volatility could feed back into the real economy and pose a risk to stability which the authorities are ill-placed to do anything about. He pointed to three sources of volatility that had potential negative feedback loops: lower oil prices, capital outflows and economic weakness in China, and pressure on European banks. Rajadhyaksha said: Of these, we consider China the biggest medium-term risk, but the least immediate issue. Strong day in Australia where the ASX/S&amp;P200 has finished 1.64% or 78 points to the good at 4,843 points. It\u2019s all over for the day in Tokyo where the Nikkei has finished up a whopping 7.16%. Treble sakes all round!!! Here\u2019s where we are so far today. No post-new year fireworks in China but lots of action: The Nikkei average in Tokyo has bounced up 7% after losing 11% last week, shrugging off dreadful GDP figures showing Japan\u2019s economy shrank 1.4% in 2015 A weaker yen has helped, plus the promise of more easing after Shinzo Abe said Tokyo would intervene \u201cwhere necessary\u201d to influence the forex market Other Asia Pacific indices followed suit with Australia up 1.64%, Korea up 1.39% and Hong Kong 2.91%. European markets set to open up In China CSI300 was down 0.67% and the Shanghai Composite was down 0.81% after reopening from the long new year break. Chinese trade plunged sharply in January. Exports down 11% in dollar terms and imports down 16.6%. The yuan strengthened against the dollar after the central bank ruled out further devaluation. Oil dipped slightly with Brent crude falling 17c to $33.19. Japan\u2019s economic revitalisation minister, Nobuteru Ishihara, has all but ruled out emergency government measures to stimulate the economy. Instead, Ishihara called for the quick implementation of a 3.32 trillion yen supplementary budget passed by parliament last month that provides support for child-rearing and nursing care, as well as a handout \u2013 intended to boost spending \u2013 for pensioners. Ishihara said Japan\u2019s economic fundamentals were \u201csound\u201d, adding that it was moving towards a recovery in employment and corporate profits, despite the disappointing GDP figures. Thailand grew by 2.8% in 2015, compared with 0.8% the previous year, according to official data today. But despite the extra growth, the country\u2019s recovery from the turmoil of the military coup in 2014 remains fragile. The state planning agency cut its forecast for 2016 growth to 2.8-3.8% from the 3.0-4.0% range it saw in November. One of the factors in China\u2019s currency fluctuation (see below) is the amount of money wealthy citizens are removing from the country. Some estimates say up to a trillion US dollars has been taken out in the past year, further weakening confidence in China\u2019s slowing economy and undermining the yuan, which the Beijing leadership wants to be become a fully-fledged international unit. So, very interesting piece in the New York Times about the outflow and the practice of Smurfing, whereby people remove the annual maximum $50,000 from the country in cash. China\u2019s trade data has thrown new light on the oil market, where the slump in prices has been a key downward driver of stock markets in recent weeks. China\u2019s crude imports dropped 20% in January from record high volumes the previous month, Reuters reports. Crude imports to the world\u2019s second biggest economy in January were also down 4.6% on a year-on-year basis at 26.69m tonnes, or 6.29m barrels per day. But the data was distorted by China taking advantage of low global oil prices last year to add up to 185m barrels to its reserves, Reuters calculated. So that has taken the edge off crude\u2019s price spike on Friday. London Brent crude was down 17c at $33.19 a barrel at 0430am GMT. The markets are loving the idea of more intervention. The Nikkei is now up more than 6%. Another 5% and it will have regained all the losses of last week in one session. (Funny that, given how we normally associate finance operatives with conservative, anti-government views, isn\u2019t it? ) Japan\u2019s prime minister Shinzo Abe has given some encouragement to investors who think he could authorise more government intervention to boost the economy. He told parliament today that \u201cexcessive currency volatility is undesirable\u201d, a reference to the sharp rise in the yen last week that sent stocks plunging. He added that Tokyo would take appropriate action in the exchange rate market as needed and he hoped the Group of 20 finance leaders will take appropriate measures to address global economic problems when they meet in Shanghai next week. The US dollar rose further hitting a session high of 113.87 yen compared with last week\u2019s 15-month trough of 110.985. In Australia the banks have made a decent comeback after being hurt by last week\u2019s sell-off. The financials sector on the ASX/S&amp;P200 \u2013 the big four banks have been as much as one-third of the index\u2019s overall value \u2013 climbed 1.4% on Monday. ANZ is up 2.43% while the Commonwealth is up nearly 1%. It will be a relief for investors after a sell-off in Europe invoked the spectre of the 2008-09 banking crisis. But they may not be completely out of the woods. A leading UK economist, Sir John Vickers, has warned that the country\u2019s banks face a serious threat from any global economic shock despite the measures taken since the GFC to make them safer. Calling for banks to hold more capital, Sir John, who led the UK\u2019s inquiry into the banking collapse, said: A good way to think about it is as an insurance policy. You have to pay a premium to insure your house and you hope nothing bad will happen. But if it does, you are much better off in paying that premium, and for full coverage. If banks run out of capital, all sorts of havoc could ensue. We want to be in a position where there\u2019s enough of a buffer to take any losses that might occur. Today\u2019s figures from China and Japan are likely to increase the clamour for more action from the central banks. Chris Weston, chief market strategist at IG in Melbourne, identified the key \u201cbad news is good news\u201d formula: Asia has found its mojo. There is nothing like poor data to get the equity bulls excited. Japanese Q4 GDP fell 1.4% quarter-on-quarter annualised, 60 basis points worse than forecasts, with nominal faring slightly better. Consumption remains poor, although if you break down the facts, the shining light is that Capex gained for a second quarter. For those looking at the demand story, China\u2019s January trade data would be particular worrying with exports (in USD terms) falling 11.2% in January and imports falling 18.8% in January. It\u2019s been a lively day so far. Despite shocking data from Japan and China, stock markets are up across Asia Pacific. Although the indices in mainland China are down, last week\u2019s closure will have distorted today\u2019s trading and a better, more up-to-date picture surely comes from Japan where the Nikkei has soared more than 5%. This is presumably on the basis of more intervention by the Bank of Japan to bolster shrinking output. Junko Nishioka, chief economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking, quoted by Reuters, sums up the mood and predicted more monetary easing could come as early as next month: Private consumption is especially weak. The economy is at a standstill. It\u2019s a matter of time before the BOJ and the government will take additional stimulus measures. Anyway, here are the main points: Chinese imports and exports plummeted by 11.2% and 16.6% respectively in January compared with the previous year. The Japanese economy shrank 1.4% in the fourth quarter on an annualised basis. Stocks are up. Nikkei up 5.12% at the lunch break while the ASX200 in Australia is up 0.98% and the Kospi in Korea is 1.38% to the good. Not so good in China where the two main indices \u2013 the CSI300 and the SHanghai Composite \u2013 are down 1.16% and 1.2%. But the Hang Seng in Hong Kong is up 2.39%. Nikkei probably helped by a 0.34% drop in the yen to 113 to the US dollar. Brent crude is down 45c at $32.91 a barrel. There\u2019s no doubt where some commentators stand on the Chinese trade data with these tweets from zerohedge making the point that the poor figures come despite the yuan drifitng lower in recent months. The China trade figures look even worse in dollar terms which put exports down 11.2% in January compared with the same month in 2015, while imports were down a thumping 16.6%, the General Customs Administration said today. However, officials said they expected the downward pressure on exports would begin to ease by the second quarter of this year. Ouch. China has released its trade figures for January and they\u2019re not good. Exports down 6.6% (year-on-year in yuan terms) compared with forecasts of +3.6% Imports down 14.4% compared with 1.8% Trade surplus up to 406bn yuan against a forecast of 389bn. Still on the yuan, it\u2019s clear from market commentary this morning that remarks by the PBOC governor Zhou Xiaochuan at the weekend about the currency have helped calm jitters. In an interview with the financial magazine Caixin, Zhou said that there was no basis for the yuan to keep depreciating and that China did not need to force the yuan lower in order to make exports more competitive. ,The PBOC would keep the yuan stable versus a basket of currencies, he said. That\u2019s good news for markets for a couple of reasons: First, pessimistic observers think a devaluation of the yuan - forced or otherwise \u2013 would be extremely bad new for the global economy. Albert Edwards at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, for example, thinks China will be forced to devalue, sending a wave of deflation around the world. So, a strong statement from Zhou will soothe concerns about a big move in the yuan triggering a currency war. Second, markets hate uncertainty and have been frustrated by China\u2019s opaque decision-making on financial maters. Any statement out of Beijing \u2013 no matter what the policy \u2013 will help. For more background, here\u2019s an explainer from our economics correspondent Phillip Inman about China\u2019s surprise devaluation in August. The yuan, subject of much hand-wringing in trading rooms and world chancelleries alike, has nudged up today. The People\u2019s Bank of China set its official midpoint trading rate at 6.5118 per dollar, up sharply from 6.5314 before the holiday. That reflects a slightly calmer and more optimistic outlook for the Chinese economy compared with 10 days ago. Quite big potatoes given the pressure the currency has been under and the reports of huge intervention to keep it stable. According to Reuters, the midpoint\u2019s 0.3% rise on Monday was the biggest jump on the previous fix since 2 November last year when it gained 0.5%. Trading is underway in China again after the new year break and it looks like they are playing a bit of catch-up with last week\u2019s sell-off. CSI300 index down 2.5% to 2,888.79 points Shanghai Composite index down 2.8% to 2,685.77 points. But the Hang Seng in Hong Kong, where there was a shorter break last week, is more in line with other markets in Asia and is up 2%. Our man in Tokyo, Justin McCurry, has just filed a story on the latest evidence that Shinzo Abe\u2019s plan to kickstart the moribund Japanese economy is failing badly. The economy shrank 1.4% on an annualised basis in the fourth quarter, figures released earlier today showed. Justin writes: In what some have described the death-knell for \u201cAbenomics\u201d \u2013 his three-arrow policy of monetary easing, fiscal stimulus and structural reform \u2013 recent currency and market turmoil have wiped out the gains made soon after he became prime minister in late 2012. \u201c(The plan) actually worked, but now it is moving in reverse,\u201d said Takuji Okubo, director of Japan Macro Advisors in Tokyo. Here\u2019s the full story: Welcome to the Guardian business live blog from Sydney. They say a week can be a long time in politics (I think it was Harold Wilson the former British prime minister, who coined the phrase), and the same could also be said for the markets. During last week\u2019s ferocious selling, it looked like China\u2019s markets had dodged a bullet by being closed for the long new year break. Japan had its worst week since 2008 and oil hit a new low. But today things look rosier. Despite a dismal set of GDP figures, markets around the region have soared on the back of a strong session on Wall Street on Friday and higher oil prices. But the big factor could prove to be comments from China\u2019s central bank governor, Zhou Xiaochuan, who at the weekend ruled out any depreciation of the yuan for the foreseeable future. Main points so far: The Nikkei has shot back up by 4% after last week\u2019s horror show That\u2019s despite the Japan\u2019s GDP shrinking 1.4% in the fourth quarter The ASX/S&amp;P200 is up 0.77% and Korea is up 0.96% Crude prices are down slightly after Friday\u2019s huge double-digit jump Evan Lucas from IG in Melbourne sets the scene: China may be positively influenced by the rally on Friday and the fact Japan looks to have turned a corner. The likelihood of a sharp one-off interventionist devaluation in the [yuan] is remote, bordering on never. [Zhou] did leave the option to allow a gradual depreciation in the [yuan] but, in short, the fear around a Chinese intervention should dissipate. But then again .... The bigger question is: Will it last? Chinese trade figures will get the ball rolling any minute now ....",

It\u2019s a nil-sum game. If we stay or we leave, the fundamentals of the economy will be relatively unmoved.\u201d </p> <p>The fund manager, who in 2014 quit asset management group Invesco Perpetual to set up his own operation \u2013 and attracted billions from small investors \u2013 commissioned<a href=\"https://woodfordfunds.com/economic-impact-brexit-report/\"> research on the potential impact of a British withdrawal</a> from the EU which he has posted on his website. </p> <p>The report, by consultancy Capital Economics, concluded: \u201cIt is plausible that Brexit could have a modest negative impact on growth and job creation.

                "bodyText":"One of Britain\u2019s most influential fund managers has said a British withdrawal from the EU would have no long-term negative impact on the UK economy and could even benefit it in the short term. Neil Woodford, whose \u00a38bn fund has large stakes in leading British companies such as GlaxoSmithKline, BT and BAE Systems, said much of the debate over British exit was \u201cbogus\u201d. Criticising both sides of the economic debate over Brexit, he said that claims that remaining in the EU was beneficial, or that pulling out was damaging, were both wrong. \u201cIt is really hard to see any credibility in an argument to stay or to leave constructed around economics. It\u2019s a nil-sum game. If we stay or we leave, the fundamentals of the economy will be relatively unmoved.\u201d The fund manager, who in 2014 quit asset management group Invesco Perpetual to set up his own operation \u2013 and attracted billions from small investors \u2013 commissioned research on the potential impact of a British withdrawal from the EU which he has posted on his website. The report, by consultancy Capital Economics, concluded: \u201cIt is plausible that Brexit could have a modest negative impact on growth and job creation. But it is slightly more plausible that the net impacts will be modestly positive.\u201d Woodford added that a British departure from the EU, and the economic uncertainty leading up to a referendum, was likely to push down the value of sterling, but that would help struggling exporters. \u201cIt will be a significant event globally that may well be reflected in weakness of sterling, but that will be relatively temporary. If the currency is weaker for a period, that will be potentially stimulative for the economy, so it might actually work out to be good news for exporters.\u201d Woodford\u2019s views puts him at odds with much of big business in the UK. Last week, HSBC warned that it could be forced to switch 1,000 banking jobs to France in the wake of a Brexit vote, while RBS chief Ross McEwan warned that the uncertainty caused by the upcoming referendum could \u201cslow down banking\u201d. Leaders of most big banks argue that leaving would endanger both the status of the City of London as Europe\u2019s financial centre, and growth prospects across the wider economy. The CBI has come out strongly in favour of Britain remaining in the EU, publishing a glossy leaflet underlining the benefits of EU membership. EasyJet also warned recently that fares would rise if Britain left. But Woodford is not alone among business and finance leaders, such as billionaire hedge fund operator Crispin Odey, and construction equipment company JCB boss Graeme Macdonald, in rejecting arguments that a UK withdrawal would seriously harm the economy. In the report from Capital Economics published on the Woodford Funds website, the researchers argue that; on immigration \u201cPolicy is far more likely to change to restrict the number of low-skilled workers entering the country and shift towards attracting more highly skilled workers. This would be a potential headache for low-wage sectors heavily dependent on migrant labour, such as agriculture, but could benefit other sectors with a shortage of highly skilled labour. on trade \u201cIt is highly probable that a favourable trade agreement would be reached after Brexit \u2026 it is certainly possible that leaving the EU would leave the external sector better off in the long run, if Britain could use its newfound freedom to negotiate its own trading arrangements to good effect. on financial services \u201cFinancial services have more to lose immediately after a EU exit than most other sectors of the economy.

                "bodyText":"Major UK-based companies have announced tens of thousands of job losses that are expected to ripple through the economy in the coming months, casting a shadow over Britain\u2019s recovery. Affecting vast areas of the UK economy \u2013 from factories to the high street, banking, media and energy \u2013 the job losses announced in the past fortnight coincided with another wave of panic selling on stock markets and fears of a further global recession. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development expressed concern on Thursday about the state of the global economy. It cut growth forecasts made three months ago and called on its members, including Britain, to ease up on austerity. Two of the UK\u2019s biggest lenders, Lloyds Banking Group and Barclays, along with Credit Suisse, are laying off workers in the UK. BP and Shell have been prompted to cut jobs because of the collapse in crude prices, which has hit oil companies hard. And the British Gas owner, Centrica, reiterated on Thursday that it is to axe 1,000 jobs in the UK this year, as part of 4,000 job cuts by 2020. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: \u201cThese are all fairly highly paid roles \u2026 You\u2019ve got to think that over the next six months you\u2019re going to see some trickle-down effect. A lot of the recovery in the UK has been consumption based, so that ultimately is going to hit consumption rates.\u201d George Buckley, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank, said the loss of highly paid City jobs, along with the new stamp duty surcharge on second homes from April, was likely to affect the buy-to-let market and the wider housing market. \u201cWe have a list of 10 reasons why we are nervous about London house prices,\u201d he said. \u201cI imagine a lot of people who work in the financial services industry own buy-to-let property. It could have a knock-on effect on the buy-to-let market and the property market as a whole.\u201d The woes spread far and wide. Britain\u2019s steel industry, in which 5,000 workers have lost their jobs since last summer, has appealed to the government for emergency assistance. Tata, which owns the remnants of British Steel, announced 1,050 job cuts last month. Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said: \u201cThe UK labour market is becoming more polarised by the day. The loss of important middle-income jobs, in industries such as steel, should concern us all.\u201d Weak wage growth is also a problem. \u201cWhile employment rates may have recovered, real wages are still way below their pre-recession level,\u201d O\u2019Grady added, calling on the government to commit to an \u201cactive industrial strategy\u201d. Wages excluding bonuses had risen by 2% year-on-year at the end of 2015 \u2013 half the pre-crisis average of about 4%, according to the latest official figures published on Wednesday. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said that bankers stood a better chance of finding new employment compared with people in engineering roles. \u201cThe biggest effect will be in areas, particularly manufacturing, where it is very difficult for the people that are affected to redeploy their skills because there aren\u2019t similar recruiters.\u201d The headline job losses will be spread out over a period of time, so economists are sceptical that they will push up the UK unemployment rate, which is currently 5.1%. Employment has been growing strongly, with more than half a million more people in work in the final quarter of 2015 than a year earlier; the figure has been boosted by migration and by older people remaining in the workforce for longer. Amazon, for example, is hiring in the UK and the rest of Europe: the online retailer plans to create more than 2,500 permanent jobs across Britain this year. But many high street retailers are struggling, and supermarkets are also cutting back as a fierce price war shows no sign of abating.",

                "bodyText":"The European Central Bank is expected to take further action to stimulate the eurozone economy at its next meeting in March. Minutes of the ECB governing council\u2019s last get-together show that without an improvement in the outlook for growth for the rest of the year and 2017, policymakers are ready to cut credit costs further to boost bank lending. A risk that emerging market growth prospects will slow further and volatile markets refuse to recover from their recent lows will send already low inflation across the eurozone tumbling again, it said. The strong hint of more interest rate cuts and a possible increase in the level or scope of the current \u20ac60bn (\u00a346.5bn) a month of quantitative easing (QE), follows comments earlier this week from the ECB boss, Mario Draghi, who said the central bank was \u201cready to do its part\u201d to boost growth and inflation. The governing council said: \u201cAt the start of the new year, downside risks increased again amid heightened uncertainty about emerging market economies\u2019 growth prospects, volatility in financial and commodity markets, and geopolitical risks. \u201cIn this environment, euro area inflation dynamics also continue to be weaker than expected.

Brexit featured at the end of a long list of investor concerns, he said \u2013 the knock-on effects of China\u2019s economic slowdown; unrest in the Middle East and the refugee crisis; the oil price crash and its impact on inflation; and the question whether the reaction from central banks, with the Bank of Japan moving to negative interest rates, was \u201cfit for purpose\u201d. But, he added: \u201cVolatility brings its challenges but it also brings its opportunities.\u201d He also highlighted buying opportunities for those investing for the next three to five years. A number of other prominent business figures, including the bosses of engine maker Rolls-Royce, pharmaceutical companies GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca, have said Britain is better off inside the EU. However, one of Britain\u2019s most influential fund managers, Neil Woodford, has said a British withdrawal from the EU would have no long-term negative impact on the UK economy, and it could even benefit it in the short term.",

                "bodyText":"A slide in the oil price as Saudi Arabia seemed to rule out hopes of production cuts sent stock markets sharply lower again after Monday\u2019s rally. Brent crude is currently nearly 4% lower at $33.32, while West Texas Intermediate is down almost 5%. Meanwhile the pound continued to come under pressure on Brexit fears, falling to $1.4022. Commodity companies were among the day\u2019s big fallers, on renewed concerns about a slowdown in China and news that BHP Billiton was slashing its dividend. Standard Chartered was also a big faller, down nearly 7% after reporting its first loss in 26 years amid worries about its exposure to emerging markets. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 75.42 points or 1.25% lower at 5962.31, despite a near 14% rise in London Stock Exchange shares on news of a proposed merger with Deutsche B\u00f6rse Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.64% to 9416.77 France\u2019s Cac closed down 1.4% at 4238.42 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.95% to 17,163.46 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.42% lower at 8267.6 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.2% to 493.97 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 178 points or just over 1%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Sterling has hit a new seven year low against the dollar of $1.4044, following Bank of England governor Mark Carney\u2019s comments suggesting UK interest rates could be cut. The UK currency has also come under renewed pressure on the uncertainty over the forthcoming referendum on whether Britain should leave the European Union, which Carney also referred to. Crude continues to weaken as Saudi oil minister Ali Al-Naimi suggested production cuts were not on the cards. He told a conference in Houston that cutting production would not happen, but major producers would freeze output to help the market rebalance. Saudi Arabia and Russia recently agreed to freeze output at January levels in an effort to deal with the supply glut which has sent crude prices tumbling. He said in Houston that he hoped there would be more agreements on freezing in March, when more meetings will be held. He said \u201cmost of the countries that count\u201d would freeze, according to Reuters. Earlier Iran had apparently dismissed the proposal as ridiculous, despite the country seeming to support it last week. Al-Naimi said the price rout would ease although he did not know when. And he added that he was not banking on cuts \u201cbecause there is less trust than usual\u201d, said Reuters. Brent is currently down 3% at $33.62 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is 4% lower at $32.03. Jasper Lawler at CMC Markets said: Oil prices turned lower after the Iranian oil minister\u2019s colourful description of the output freeze between Russia and Saudi Arabia as \u201cridiculous.\u201d Iran and its plans to ramp up output after the lifting of sanctions is proving a thorn in the side of other producing counties which appear to be reaching consensus that production should stay at current levels. Tensions are clearly rising in the cartel as the Saudi oil minister reposted that \u201cnot all the countries will freeze. The ones that count will.\u201d The day\u2019s confidence figures show how fragile sentiment is at the moment, says analyst Connor Campbell at Spreadex: Whilst the [US] existing home sales figure actually saw a mild increase month-on-month, from 5.45 million to 5.47 million, more notable was the sharp decline in the CB consumer confidence number. Coming in at 92.2 against the 97.4 last month the figure, like this morning\u2019s year-low German Ifo business climate data, highlights just how entrenched the market\u2019s current fears are, despite the sporadic surges that have taken the global indices to a variety of recent highs. There was to be no such surge this afternoon, however, the Dow Jones dropping over 100 in light of that literal knock to the index\u2019s confidence. Over in the UK the FTSE fell past its earlier lows as the afternoon progressed, declining around 50 points to trickle underneath the 6000 mark following the weak US open, a drop exacerbated by Brent Crude slipping under $34 per barrel once again. Back with the London Stock Exchange, and analysts at Numis point to a number of problems facing its proposed merger with Deutsche B\u00f6rse: This represents the third time the LSE and DB have attempted to merge, first in 2000 then in 2004. Although no details were given, a merger is expected to provide enhanced growth, significant customer benefits as well as substantial revenue and cost synergies. However, we see a number of challenges in completing this deal, namely: (1) the competition authority is likely to ask a number of questions as it would create a dominant player in exchanges and clearing in Europe \u2013 the EC blocked a similar deal between Deutsche B\u00f6rse and NYSE Euronext in 2012 citing competition concerns; (2) both have differing views on how to structure their respective clearing businesses \u2013 LSE backs open access (i.e. trading and clearing can occur on different platforms) whereas DB does not; (3) national pride \u2013 would UK politicians be happy with the main UK exchange being owned by a foreign entity. So whilst we see the obvious benefits from such a deal (namely cost and revenue synergies), we remain mindful of the challenges that would need to be overcome for it to complete. The Richmond manufacturing index has also disappointed, coming in at -4 compared to the 2 which analysts had been looking for. However US existing home sales have beaten expectations, up 0.4% in January compared to a forecast fall of 2.5%. US consumer confidence figures for February have come in much lower than expected, as the recent market volatility outweighs the benefits of cheaper oil. The index fell from 97.8 in January - itself revised down from 98.1 - to 92.2. Analysts had been expecting a figure of 97. This is the lowest level since July. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said Despite relatively healthy numbers over recent months, onlookers will be concerned with the worrying dip in this month\u2019s consumer confidence data. It\u2019s surprising that US shoppers have kept their wallets in their pockets for another month, especially considering that low gas prices continue to help them save. While the slip may have a short-term negative affect on the US Dollar, if gas continues to stay low, it\u2019s only a matter of time before US consumers get the spending bug again. Meanwhile US stock markets have opened lower, in line with the dips on European exchanges. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 40 points or 0.2% after another fall in oil prices - West Texas Intermediate is around 2% lower after a report Iran\u2019s oil minister called the proposed output freeze ridiculous. At the open the S&amp;P 500 is 0.3% lower and Nasdaq down 0.4%, ahead of the latest US consumer confidence figures. Back in Europe the FTSE 100 is currently down 22 points or 0.3%, but would be another 4 points or so lower if not for the 16% jump in the shares of the London Stock Exchange. It was not always so friendly between the LSE and Deutsche B\u00f6rse: And here\u2019s the BBC\u2019s story from the time. Here\u2019s our first take on the LSE-Deutsche B\u00f6rse merger plan: The London Stock Exchange is in talks to merge with Germany\u2019s Deutsche B\u00f6rse in a deal that would seal an alliance first discussed at the turn of the millennium. The LSE confirmed on Tuesday it was in detailed discussions with its German rival about an all-share merger. Under the proposed structure, Deutsche B\u00f6rse shareholders would own 54.4% of the combined company and LSE shareholders would hold 45.6%. The UK exchange said: \u201cThe boards believe that the potential merger would represent a compelling opportunity for both companies to strengthen each other in an industry-defining combination, creating a leading European-based global markets infrastructure group.\u201d The exchanges have considered combining forces before. They agreed to merge in 2000 before a rival bid for the LSE from Sweden\u2019s OM Gruppen scuppered the deal, but was then rejected. The LSE then rejected a formal \u00a31.3bn offer from Deutsche B\u00f6rse in January 2005. The full story is here: David Cheetham of City trading firm XTB.com says a merger between the LSE and Deutsche Borse would create one of the world\u2019s biggest financial trading platforms. \u201cShares in London Stock Exchange Group have soared by over 17% in the past hour as news that they\u2019re in talks with Deutsche Boerse have been confirmed. If the deal were to go ahead it would create a clear market leader for European and one of the largest exchanges in the world for trading and risk managing derivatives. The timing of this development appears coincidental as the possibility of a Brexit has become increased in recent days now that a referendum date has been set and Boris has joined the Out campaign.\u201d The news that Britain\u2019s stock exchange could soon merge with its German rival has startled the City, especially given the upcoming EU vote. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, tweets: It\u2019s official! The London Stock Exchange has just confirmed that it is talking to Deutsche B\u00f6rse about a merger deal. It says: Further to the recent movement in LSE\u2019s share price, the Board of LSE and the Management Board of Deutsche B\u00f6rse confirm that they are in detailed discussions about a potential merger of equals of the two businesses. This would create \u201ca leading European-based global markets infrastructure group\u201d, it claims, adding: The combination of LSE and Deutsche Boerse\u2019s complementary growth strategies, products, services and geographic footprint would be expected to deliver an enhanced ability to provide a full service offering to customers on a global basis. Under the plan, Deutsche B\u00f6rse shareholders would hold 54.4% of the new company, while LSE shareholders would hold 45.6%. The LSE\u2019s shares are now up 17%, valuing the group at almost \u00a39.5bn. Deutsche B\u00f6rse shares have also jumped, by around 3%, following the reports of merger talks with Britain\u2019s LSE. And Euronext, another stock market operator, has seen its shares rally by 4%. Investors may be anticipating a bidding war. Here\u2019s the Reuters story that sparked the move: BREAKING: Takeover speculation has just driven shares in the London Stock Exchange up by 9%, to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard. It has been trigger by a Reuters report, that the LSE is in talks over a possible merger with German rival Deutsche B\u00f6rse. Nothing official yet, though. More than a decade ago, the LSE rejected Deutsche B\u00f6rse\u2019s advances.... The timing of these talks is quite intriguing, given the uncertainty which the EU referendum is casting over the City.... Analysts at Scotia Bank have predicted that the UK pound could slump to just $1.30 if the Out campaign win June\u2019s vote. That would be its lowest level in around 30 years, worse than the selloff after the 2008 financial crisis. They have also suggested that consumer confidence would be badly hit, as economic growth slowed sharply.. Sterling is dropping back towards the seven year low it struck on Monday. The pound has lost half a cent against the US dollar, dipping below the $1.41 mark. Yesterday, it weakened to $1.4057, before a late revival. Mark Carney\u2019s warning that investors are protecting themselves against future sterling weakness (details here) may have reminded traders that we face months of uncertainty. Dominic Stewart, sales trader at ETX Capital, says: Sterling has remained vulnerable after falling nearly 2% yesterday - its biggest one day drop in almost six years - amidst fears that Britain may leave the European Union. The Treasury Committee session is now over, and Mark Carney and colleagues have been released back into the wild. But if you want more EU referendum action, check out our Politics Live blog. Andy Sparrow is on deck, covering a speech from David Cameron right now: Cameron: EU referendum is a \u2018once in a generation\u2019 decision - Politics live Guardian readers have known for a while that the Bank of England was working on contingency plans for the EU referendum. Back in May 2015, the Bank of England accidentally emailed us the details of Project Bookend, including how to deny it existed. #oops We wrote at the time that: The email indicates that a small group of senior staff are to examine the effect of a Brexit under the authority of Sir Jon Cunliffe, who as deputy director for financial stability has responsibility for monitoring the risk of another market crash. Cunliffe also sits on the board of the City regulator, the Prudential Regulatory Authority. James Talbot, the head of the monetary assessment and strategy division, is involved in Project Bookend, drawing on his past work as an adviser on European economic policy. The Bank of England is engaged in contingency planning for the EU referendum, Mark Carney tells the Treasury committee. He also reveals that the Prudential Regulation Authority is keeping abreast of the contingency plans that UK banks are making ahead of the June 23 vote. Further details will discussed on March 8, when the governor testifies to the committee specifically about the referendum. [The PRA supervises Britain\u2019s financial sector, to ensure they are \u201csafe and sound\u201d, so they will be keen to avoid any firms being caught out by the referendum]. Rachel Reeves MP asks Mark Carney whether he expects the recent falls in sterling to continue. The governor reiterates that investors have been buying downside protection to protect themselves against falls against the pound, especially against the US dollar [rather than the euro, because it could also suffer if Britain leaves the EU]. Governor Carney concludes: It is safe to say that an element of referendum premium has come into sterling. Rachel Reeves MP reminds Carney that the latest Inflation Report states that interest rates are likely to rise, not fall. How can he can so confident? Mark Carney gives a rather dovish answer, says the Bank expects interest rates to rise, gradually, over the forecast horizon. But of course, if risks increased and the global economy deteriorated, that would have implications. So do you expect the next move to be up, not down? Carney replies that the UK domestic economy is positive, but that must be balanced with disappointing signs from abroad. We must weigh the two up, and we\u2019re not taking a policy decision today. Mark Carney moves swiftly to crush speculation that the Bank of England could hit UK banks with negative interest rates. We have absolutely no intention, no interest, in doing that [imposing negative rates]. He adds that mortgage rates in Switzerland have actually gone up, even though the Swiss central bank have imposed negative borrowing costs. Can you explain the impact of negative interest rates on banks in simple terms, Steve Baker asks? MPC member Gertjan Vlieghe outlines how banks have assets, which are loans, and liabilities, which are deposits. They make a profit by charging borrowers more than they pay to savers. So far, no commercial bank has passed on negative interest rates to its depositors. So...as you lower interest rates more and more, the return on the assets goes down and down but there is no way to balance that with lower returns to savers. In conclusion: The lower interest rates go, the harder it is for banks to make a profit. Q: And do you need to abolish cash to allow negative interest rates to be imposed? Deciding whether people are allowed to hold cash is not one of our tools, Vlieghe replies. Steve Baker MP asks what the distributional impact of negative interest rates would be. It\u2019s too early to say, replies deputy governor Minouche Shafik. Central banks in several areas, including Switzerland, Denmark, Japan and the eurozone, now charge banks to leave money with them. However, this has not generally fed through to consumers - so we don\u2019t have the data to show the impact on the public. Gertjan Vlieghe adds that it\u2019s very hard to say how banks will react to negative interest rates - it depends on each institution. Mark Carney also insists that the Bank could launch fresh stimulus measures. It could cut interest rates closer to zero, from 0.5% today, or buy more assets though QE. Martin Weale says the Bank of England has more tools in the toolbox to stimulate the UK economy if needed. That could include fresh asset purchases though its QE programme [which the Bank has used to buy \u00a3375bn of UK government debt]. Jacob Rees-Mogg MP asks whether the recent fall in bank share prices reflects the macro-economic environment. Or something else? Mark Carney says it is primarily due to the macro picture. He cites \u2018mildly disappointing\u2019 data and uncertainty about the policy stance in emerging and advanced economies. That caused a \u201crenewed appreciation\u201d that we are in an environment of low nominal growth -- a difficult environment for banks. On top of that, Carney adds, there are some concerns in investing circles about the impact of negative interest rates on bank profitability. Dr Gertjan Vlieghe, a member of the Monetary Policy Committee, now warns MPs that the uncertainty over the In-Out EU referendum could hurt the UK economy. Asked about the impact of the weaker pound, he says that on its own, a weaker currency should boost inflation and growth. But the current situation is more complex, given the possibility of Brexit . Vlieghe tells the Treasury Committee that: We think the exchange rate is falling because of increased uncertainty about what\u2019s going to happen in the period leading up to, or the period following, the referendum. It is possible at some point that increased uncertainty from foreign exchange investors also ends up manifesting itself in increased uncertainty by households and businesses which may, or may not, delay or reduce their spending. So far we haven\u2019t seen very clear evidence of that, but we are watching very carefully. So it\u2019s not at all obvious that a weaker pound is a net boost to the economy, concludes Vlieghe, who worked for a hedge fund before being appointed to the MPC last summer. Back to the pound.... and Martin Weale says the recent fall in sterling should push inflation up (as it makes imports more expensive) Mark Carney says he agrees, adding that the recent fall in the pound is partly due to the EU referendum [reminder, it hit a seven year low on Monday]. Carney addes that the Bank \u201cwill take the exchange rate as given\u201d --[ie, it will not make predictions about the referendum result, and its impact on sterling]. And the Bank\u2019s agents across the UK will be watching for signs that business confidence has been hit by exchange rate moves. The committee is keen to find out whether the Bank of England will make a profit or a loss on its bond-buying quantitative easing programme. After all, the richest households have certainly benefitted, because QE drives up asset prices. And we know who holds them..... Tyrie then turns to Britain\u2019s banks - is Carney confident that they are robust enough to rise out another crisis? He points out that Sir John Vickers, who conducted a major inquiry into the UK financial sector after the 2008 crisis, has warned that the banks haven\u2019t gone far enough. What\u2019s your view, governor? Carney insists that the UK banks have met the new capital requirements. So why have bank shares fallen so sharply? Carney blames worries about profitability, not solvency: Since the start of the year bank stocks have been under pressure. There are a variety of causes of that but what is not a cause, what it does not indicate in my view is concerns about the resilience of the institutions. \u201cThe fundamental concerns are about the returns of the institutions.\u201d Andrew Tyrie does have one question on the EU referendum: Q: Has the Bank modelled the impact on sterling if the Out campaign win, given what\u2019s been going on in the markets in recent days? Mark Carney says the bank will treat the June 23rd referendum \u201cexactly like we treat any other political event\u201d. That means the Bank will monitor developments in markets and confidence, and feed those changes into its models. The Bank won\u2019t take any judgements about who will win, or assess the consequences of a leave vote. Q: So what would I see if I looked at your models? We don\u2019t make forecasts about the future value of the pound as part of the model, Carney says. But he then points to the recent volatility in the foreign exchange and options markets, as investors brace for the In-Out referendum in four month\u2019s time. There have been movements, obviously, in sterling, since the timing of the referendum became clear, says governor Carney, adding: Particularly, there has been a sharp increase in risk reversals - buying more downside protection against future falls in sterling around the referendum date as opposed to upside protection. They have spiked to levels consistent with around the height of the Scottish referendum. And they\u2019ve been particularly concentrated against cable...the sterling/dollar options market. That\u2019s as far as Carney will go today - we may need to wait until next month\u2019s hearing for more.... Andrew Tyrie, committee chairman, says he doesn\u2019t want to linger on the Brexit issue for long - as Carney is going to testify about it on 8 March. Panic averted - the session is starting now... The FT\u2019s Emily Cadman reports that Mark Carney is behind schedule.... Looks like there\u2019s a small delay with the web feed of Mark Carney\u2019s session at parliament (hurry up chaps!). Helpfully, Reuters are on the case -- with some comments from deputy governor Minouche Shafik: She\u2019s predicted that UK interest rates will rise, in due course, rather than being cut to fresh record lows. BANK OF ENGLAND DEPUTY GOVERNOR SHAFIK SAYS IF LABOUR MARKET CONTINUES TO TIGHTEN, EXPECT WAGE GROWTH WILL PICK UP BANK OF ENGLAND\u2019S SHAFIK SAYS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT TIMING OF WAGE PICK-UP BANK OF ENGLAND\u2019S SHAFIK SAYS BELIEVES NEXT INTEREST RATE MOVE WILL BE UP The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, is about to take his seat in the Thatcher Room at the Houses of Parliament. He\u2019ll be quizzed by the Treasury committee about the Bank\u2019s latest inflation report, in which it slashed its UK growth forecasts and suggested interest rates may not rise this year. But we\u2019re also hoping to hear Carney\u2019s views on the UK\u2019s EU referendum. You can watch the hearing live, here (right-click to open in a new tab). Carney is accompanied by: Dr Minouche Shafik, Deputy Governor, Markets and Banking, Dr Gertjan Vlieghe, External Member of the Monetary Policy Committee Martin Weale, External Member of the Monetary Policy Committee Bloomberg economist Maxime Sbaihi is alarmed by the fall in German business confidence this month: The euro just hit a three-week low, losing 0.3% to $1.0993 against the US dollar. The single currency is being dragged down by this morning\u2019s weak German business confidence report and the knock-on effect of Britain\u2019s EU referendum (as discussed earlier) Morale among Germany\u2019s business leaders has hit a one-year low, after falling at its fastest rate in over four years this month. IFO, the Munich-based think tank, has reported that German corporate chiefs are much gloomier about future prospects, due to the slowdown in China and recent stock market volatility. IFO\u2019s business sentiment index has fallen for the third month running, to 105.7 from 107.3 in January. That\u2019s the lowest since December 2014. It was driven by a slump in business expectations, suggesting firms are worried about prospects this year. Carsten Brzeski of ING is calling it a \u201cwake-up call\u201d, adding: Global events have finally reached German companies\u2019 boardrooms..... Expectations have taken another sharp hit from recent market turmoil, the adverse impact of low oil prices and renewed concerns about a slowing of the Chinese economy, dropping to 98.8 in February, from 102.3 in January. There\u2019s a lot of chatter that the Britain\u2019s EU referendum could spark a sterling crisis. And that\u2019s because the pound (like the English cricket team) has a worrying history of occasionally collapsing under pressure. Hat-tip to Bank of New York Mellon, and Bloomberg, for this chart: The pound is hovering around $1.413 this morning, having hit a seven-year low of $1.4057 yesterday. FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga believes the pound could fall further in the run-up to June\u2019s vote, and take the euro with it. The growing speculation that a Brexit may spillover to the Eurozone and threaten the future of the European Union has already encouraged bearish investors to attack the Euro across the global currency markets. Shares in Standard Chartered are sliding sharply after it posted its first annual loss since 1989. The bank has lost $1.5bn, and warned that it faces a \u201cbroad range of challenges and uncertainties....notably China and commodities\u201d. The loss is partly due to a $1.8bn restructuring charge as Standard Chartered tries to address the slowdown in emerging markets (the bank is a big player in Asia). The City aren\u2019t impressed -- shares slumped by 11% as investors digested the details. They\u2019re currently down 6%. More to follow later... Over in Frankfurt, the German DAX has slid by 103 points, or over 1%. Investors aren\u2019t impressed by the first fall in German exports since 2012. Each of the 30 companies on the DAX is down, led by energy and utility firm RWE (-2%). Deutsche Bank has shed 1.5%. European stock markets are sliding in early trading. In London, the FTSE 100 has shed 48 points, or 0.8%. The blue-chip index is being dragged down by mining shares, after BHP Billiton reported that \u00a34bn loss and warned that commodity prices will remain weak. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx says BHP\u2019s decision to slash its shareholder payout has shocked investors: It doesn\u2019t help that the mining sector got its own unwelcome surprise; whilst it was expected that BHP Billiton would post its first half year loss in 16 years (coming in \u00a34 billion in the red) analysts were still looking for a 31p dividend. Instead BHP slashed its interim payout by 75% to 16p, whilst also sacrificing its progressive dividend policy in order to protect its credit rating. The company\u2019s subsequent 3.5% slide helped ensure its mining peers started the day at a loss, dragging the FTSE down by nearly 50 points after the bell. Ralph Solveen, an economist at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt, is concerned that German exports fell by 0.6% in the last quarter of 2015. He told Bloomberg that: \u201cInvestment was rather solid. On the other hand, given the rather weak development of exports, you can see that there\u2019s a problem for the German economy.\u201d Germany has suffered a fall in exports as the powerhouse European economy is hit by the global downturn. The Federal Statistical Office has revealed that exports shrank by 0.6% in the final three months of 2015. Economists had expected a dip of 0.3%. That, according to the Financial Times, is the first decline in three years. Imports rose by 0.5% during the quarter, suggesting that Germany was propped up by its domestic economy. ING\u2019s Carsten Brzeski fears that German consumers might struggle to sustain this performance in 2016: Today\u2019s figures also confirmed that Germany grew by an unspectacular 0.3% in the final three months of 2015, with growth dragged back by its negative trade performance. Government spending grew by 1% during the quarter - perhaps partly due to the cost of helping the refugees who arrived in Germany last year. Asian stock markets have fallen today, as the recent rally in shares subsided. And it could be a downbeat day in Europe too, with the main indices expected to fall. Shares are being pulled down by the oil price, which has dipped by almost 2% this morning - erasing its own recent gains. And mining giant BGP Billiton has added to the pessimism, by reporting a stonking loss of \u00a34bn for the last six months - and slashing its dividend by three-quarters. Reuters has the details from Asia: MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.2%, after earlier rising 0.4% to its highest level since January 8. Japan\u2019s Nikkei erased morning gains to close down 0.4%. Korea\u2019s Kospi, which started the day higher, and Australia\u2019s ASX 200, which opened little changed from Monday\u2019s three-week high close, both ended the day with losses. Chinese stocks , which opened little changed, were last trading down almost 1%. Oil markets jumped as much as 7% on Monday as speculation about falling U.S. shale output fed the notion that crude prices may be bottoming after their 20-month collapse. But they retreated on Tuesday on concern that any cuts to U.S. production may be countered by rising output from Iran. U.S. crude futures fell 1.9%, and the international benchmark Brent slid 1.6% on Tuesday. City firm IG reckons European markets will fall at the open. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Coming up today..... Britain\u2019s In-Out EU referendum continues to cast a shadow over the markets, after Brexit fears sent the pound sliding to a seven year low yesterday. The prospect of months of heated debate and uncertainty over the UK\u2019s future is already weighing on the pound in early trading, as some investors continue to sell sterling. Overnight, a group of UK business chiefs have signed a letter backing the In campaign. But crucially, others have declined to get involved. The bosses of Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrison all remain firmly on the fence.... Bank of England governor Mark Carney should be quizzed about the European vote, when he testifies to MPs at 10am GMT on the Bank\u2019s latest inflation report. Deputy governor Minouche Shafik, and fellow interest rate-setters Martin Weale and Gertjan Vlieghe should be providing support. On the economics front, new German trade data is being released this morning. We also get the latest IFO measure of business confidence in the eurozone\u2019s largest economy, at 9am GMT. Standard Chartered, the bank with a big exposure to emerging markets, is reporting results at 8.15am. And in the afternoon, the latest US consumer confidence figure are released. They\u2019ll show how much damage has been caused by the stock market turmoil earlier this year. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

                "bodyText":"The International Monetary Fund has urged the UK to ease back on austerity should the economy slow further, as it warned finance ministers at the G20 summit in Shanghai to boost public spending on infrastructure to fuel global growth. In a report on the UK\u2019s economic outlook, the IMF said the risks of a more severe downturn were mounting as David Cameron\u2019s government battled sluggish productivity growth, a balance of payments deficit, high levels of household debt, and the forthcoming referendum on EU membership. In a mission statement drafted ahead of the G20 meeting in China later this week, it said that the power of monetary policy was beginning to wane and it was incumbent on those governments that could safely increase their spending to act together to boost global growth. The chancellor, George Osborne, and the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, are due to attend the conference. It said the Treasury needed to \u201cremain vigilant to the challenges ahead and to continue its policy efforts to promote growth and further boost resilience\u201d. IMF officials said the Treasury had done enough to stabilise the government\u2019s finances for it to embark on extra investment spending should GDP growth, which has slowed since last year, continue to falter. The Treasury declined to comment on the IMF report. The report said: \u201cFlexibility in the fiscal framework should be used to modify the pace of adjustment in the event of weaker demand growth.\u201d The warning follows an even tougher message from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) last week, which called on the UK to ease up on austerity and join a collective effort by the G20 to spend more on infrastructure projects to boost flagging growth. The Paris-based thinktank, which counts 34 of the world\u2019s wealthiest countries as members, said the G20 needed to recognise that low interest rates and money creation by central banks were no longer enough for a lasting recovery. The OECD\u2019s chief economist, Catherine Mann, said: \u201cWith governments in many countries currently able to borrow for long periods at very low interest rates, there is room for fiscal expansion to strengthen demand in a manner consistent with fiscal sustainability.\u201d The IMF echoed the OECD\u2019s call for a coordinated spending plan by rich nations to reverse a downturn in growth since last summer. It avoided singling out individual countries that should increase their spending, but officials warned that slowing global growth needed a different response from policymakers. The G20 was formed to accommodate the views of rich and developing world economies in the aftermath of the 2008 crash. Members include the US, the UK, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico and Russia. Tumbling oil prices and a dramatic slowing of the Chinese economy have spooked markets, which have slumped since last year. Fears that China, in a bid to increase its exports, is planning to devalue its currency have further undermined confidence in the ability of policymakers in the west to keep the recovery from the 2008 financial crash on track. The US economy has joined the slide in economic activity in recent months, triggering further concerns that global trade, which has already tumbled over the last 18 months, has further to fall. The IMF said the current low interest rates and trillions of dollars of quantitative easing provided by central banks should remain in place, but more action was needed from governments to prevent a bigger drop in global growth this year and next. \u201cA comprehensive approach is needed to reduce over-reliance on monetary policy,\u201d it said. \u201cIn particular, near-term fiscal policy should be more supportive where appropriate and provided there is fiscal space, especially through investment that boosts both the demand and the supply potential of the economy.\u201d IMF officials, concerned that without coordination some countries will boost spending only to suffer a rise in imports and a collapse in their currency, have concluded that the G20 needs to agree a plan of action that involves all members. Osborne has resisted attempts to coordinate spending by G20 countries to boost growth, preferring to focus on reducing the deficit in public spending to achieve a balanced budget by 2020. But the IMF said to support global activity and contain the risks of another financial crash, \u201cthe G20 must act now to implement forcefully the existing G20 growth strategies and plan for coordinated demand support using available fiscal space to boost public investment and complement structural reforms\u201d.",

For a start, policymakers still have room to cut deposit rates further and expand their QE programmes, which should help to support activity and lift inflation. And if growth and inflation fall further, we suspect that governments and central banks would, eventually, adopt more radical policies to revive their economies.</p> </blockquote> <p>What could these more radical policies be: <br></p> <blockquote> <p>Perhaps the most straightforward option would be to raise the inflation target, which would in theory cause real interest rates to fall. As Japan\u2019s experience shows, though, it can be very difficult to raise price pressures when low inflation expectations are engrained. </p> <p>A much more radical and powerful policy would be for the central bank to directly finance government spending, often referred to as a helicopter drop. Unlike QE, this would be very effective in pushing money into the economy and could be quickly stopped if inflation rises too far. </p> <p>There is little appetite for more radical policies at the moment, not least because the world is not currently in a crisis situation. But policymakers have proven that they are willing to change course if they are consistently missing their mandates. And if economic conditions were to deteriorate significantly, political opposition to such policies would surely soften. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56cf268be4b03897ffe23b48\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-25T16:10:42.897Z\">4.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The price of crude continues to slide</strong>.

Connor Campbell at Spreadex said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Whilst not quite at their afternoon highs the FTSE, DAX and CAC have kept up a staggering pace this Thursday; the Dow Jones, meanwhile, has lagged far behind, US investors not quite as eager to pour back into the market as their European peers...</p> <p>It is interesting to see such divergence between the two regions, especially the chasm in trading sentiment currently separating the FTSE and the Dow.

It appears that the US index is sorely missing the earnings-focused gains the FTSE has seen today, with the incredible, dividend driven, performances of Lloyds and RSA Insurance helping overcome any potential negative sentiment following a rough Asian session.</p> <p>Tomorrow, however, does see the US shift back into the limelight after the UK GDP and Eurozone inflation focused trading of Thursday. Not that that will necessarily be a good thing; already coming in at a disappointing annualised rate of 0.7% for the fourth quarter, Friday\u2019s second estimate US GDP figure is set to drop to 0.4%, something that may only exacerbate the Dow\u2019s current dreariness. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56cf0efce4b03786d8023087\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-25T14:36:40.216Z\">2.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>After a rebound in US markets late in Wednesday\u2019s session, the trend is continuing in early trading.</p> <p>Taking its lead from a bounce in Europe - helped by well received results from financial groups Lloyds, RSA Insurance and Axa - the Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed 72 points or 0.4%.</p> <p>Meanwhile the S&amp;P 500 is up 0.2% and Nasdaq 0.27% at the open.</p> <p>Over in Europe, the FTSE 100 has jumped 2.6% - back above the 6000 level - while Germany\u2019s Dax is up 2.3% and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 2.67%.</p> <p>Part of the reason for a tumble on Wednesday, before Wall Street\u2019s late revival, was a falling oil price on growing US inventories and further consideration of Saudi Arabia\u2019s comments suggesting producers were unlikely to cut output.</p> <p>But crude prices have stabilised to give some support to markets, with Brent down just 0.4% at $34.26 a barrel.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56cf0865e4b03897ffe23ae2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-25T14:00:07.611Z\">2.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>But the durable goods data is more mixed than it first appears, says Rob Carnell at ING, and gives no reason for an early rate rise:</p> <blockquote> <p>US durable goods orders data showed a strong rebound in January, rising 4.9% month on month against expectations for a rise of only 2.9%. And this data will buoy hopes that the slowdown in US GDP growth that culminated in a rate of only 0.7% (annualised) in the fourth quarer of 2015 (and will likely be revised lower on Friday), may be turning the corner. </p> <p>This is choppy data at the best of times, so one month\u2019s data has to be taken with a pinch of salt. But these figures, which provide one of the best insights into the business investment environment, are especially important right now. This is because if the US is heading into recession, as some commentators maintain, then we suspect that this decline will be led by investment, with the labour market and consumer spending following in its wake with some lag.</p> <p>However, despite a decent headline figure, and bounces in some of the core indicators (we tend to focus on these core measures to shed some of the volatility of this data), the trend in orders and shipments is not giving a particularly clear message, and we will have to see more data before we can reach any firm conclusions. For example, the three month moving average for core capital goods orders fell further to -6.2%, and core capital goods shipments improved, but from -4.7% to only -4.2%, so still remain deeply depressed.</p> <p>With yet another inconclusive set of data, markets will make of this whatever they want. But the fact remains, the direction of the US economy at this juncture remains far from clear. And in consequence, the Fed\u2019s response remains in the balance, though we feel the hurdles for further tightening are high, so at the very least, this data provides no excuse for a near term tightening. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56cf0777e4b03786d8023071\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-25T13:55:09.818Z\">1.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The good US data of course could also prompt renewed talk of a Federal Reserve rate rise. David Morrison at Spread Co said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The US dollar rose a touch as did equities after durable goods (both including and excluding transportation items) blasted above market expectations. Weekly jobless claims were in line with expectations.</p> <p>It was a knee-jerk reaction which appeared to be algo-driven and it doesn\u2019t feel as if there\u2019s much follow-through to the initial move.</p> <p>Strong data may point to some robustness in the US economy but of course that\u2019s a double-edged sword. After all, it also raises the possibility of further rate increases from the Federal Reserve. In its economic projections back in December the central bank pencilled in 100 basis points-worth of rate hikes in 2016. That would be hard to stomach given the market turmoil since the beginning of the year. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56cf0250e4b03786d8023060\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-25T13:42:22.521Z\">1.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Good news from the US</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Sticking with America.... and US factories have just reported a surge in demand for machinery and heavy-duty equipment last month.</strong></p> <p>It suggests the US economy is stronger than some economists feared .</p> <p>Orders for US capital goods jumped by 4.9% in January, after falling by 5% in December. </p> <p>That smashes forecasts of a 3% rise, and is the biggest monthly jump since March 2015.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/status/702848260667543552\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Really nice looking durable goods number.</p>&mdash; Joseph Weisenthal (@TheStalwart) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/status/702848260667543552\">February 25, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/World_First/status/702848291520831488\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Durable (very) goods</p>&mdash; World First (@World_First) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/World_First/status/702848291520831488\">February 25, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The weekly jobs figures have also been released, and they show a small increase in people filing new unemployment benefit claims. <br></p> <p>Not a major shock, though, and the total is still low in historic terms:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NourHammoury/status/702848105289539584\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">*U.S. INITIAL JOBLESS CLAIMS ROSE 10,000 LAST WEEK TO 272,000</p>&mdash; Nour E.

                "bodyText":"Despite continuing falls in oil prices, the rally in European markets stayed the course. Putting aside worries about China, faltering global growth and volatile commodity prices, investors took heart from a series of positive company updates, not least Lloyds Banking Group, RSA Insurance, Axa and Deutsche Telekom. Wall Street managed to shake off some early uncertainty by the time Europe closed, but there is likely to be further nervousness around the G20 finance ministers meeting in Shanghai which starts later. For the moment, the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 145.63 points or 2.48% higher at 6012.81 Germany\u2019s Dax added 1.79% to 9331.48 France\u2019s Cac closed 2.24% higher at 4248.45 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 2.3% at 17,104.54 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 2.52% higher at 8215.6 In Greece, the Athens market added 2.05% to 483.98 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 49 points or 0.3%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. It has been suggested that with QE and low (and in some cases negative) interest rates, central banks risk running out of ammunition to boost the global economy. But Capital Economics disagrees. The research company\u2019s Nikita Shah said: There is undoubtedly less scope for policy easing than there was a few years ago, but the charge that central banks are now powerless is, in our view, exaggerated. For a start, policymakers still have room to cut deposit rates further and expand their QE programmes, which should help to support activity and lift inflation. And if growth and inflation fall further, we suspect that governments and central banks would, eventually, adopt more radical policies to revive their economies. What could these more radical policies be: Perhaps the most straightforward option would be to raise the inflation target, which would in theory cause real interest rates to fall. As Japan\u2019s experience shows, though, it can be very difficult to raise price pressures when low inflation expectations are engrained. A much more radical and powerful policy would be for the central bank to directly finance government spending, often referred to as a helicopter drop. Unlike QE, this would be very effective in pushing money into the economy and could be quickly stopped if inflation rises too far. There is little appetite for more radical policies at the moment, not least because the world is not currently in a crisis situation. But policymakers have proven that they are willing to change course if they are consistently missing their mandates. And if economic conditions were to deteriorate significantly, political opposition to such policies would surely soften. The price of crude continues to slide. Earlier, data from the US showed stockpiles at the Cushing hub in Oklahoma for oil deliveries has reached new highs. Inventories rose by 503,000 barrels to more than 67.5m barrels between 19 and 24 February, according to Reuters. Brent crude is now down 2.3% at $33.59 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - has dropped 3%. The UK Treasury is not drawing up plans to deal with the fallout if Britain leaves the EU after the forthcoming referendum. Attending a conference on market liquidity, Charles Roxburgh, director general for financial services at the Treasury, said: It\u2019s the government\u2019s policy not to do contingency planning. So we will not be doing contingency planning \u2014 that\u2019s consistent with the position we had on Scotland. The contingency planning is instead being done by the Bank of England. After a bright start, US markets have slipped back after another drop in the oil price, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now up just 12 points. But European markets have held on to much of their gains and are still up around 2%. Connor Campbell at Spreadex said: Whilst not quite at their afternoon highs the FTSE, DAX and CAC have kept up a staggering pace this Thursday; the Dow Jones, meanwhile, has lagged far behind, US investors not quite as eager to pour back into the market as their European peers... It is interesting to see such divergence between the two regions, especially the chasm in trading sentiment currently separating the FTSE and the Dow. Both have a tendency to be weighed down by their respective commodity sectors, the latter seeing an especially volatile session last night thanks to the choppy movements in the oil price. Yet whilst the UK oil and mining stocks (bar the odd anomaly like Rio Tinto and Premier Oil) are largely in the green, ignoring Brent Crude\u2019s latest decline, their US counterparts are far more bearish this Thursday, Chevron (down 1.5%), ExxonMobil (slipping around 0.8%) and Caterpillar (falling roughly 1%) all preventing the Dow from joining the day\u2019s rebound. It appears that the US index is sorely missing the earnings-focused gains the FTSE has seen today, with the incredible, dividend driven, performances of Lloyds and RSA Insurance helping overcome any potential negative sentiment following a rough Asian session. Tomorrow, however, does see the US shift back into the limelight after the UK GDP and Eurozone inflation focused trading of Thursday. Not that that will necessarily be a good thing; already coming in at a disappointing annualised rate of 0.7% for the fourth quarter, Friday\u2019s second estimate US GDP figure is set to drop to 0.4%, something that may only exacerbate the Dow\u2019s current dreariness. After a rebound in US markets late in Wednesday\u2019s session, the trend is continuing in early trading. Taking its lead from a bounce in Europe - helped by well received results from financial groups Lloyds, RSA Insurance and Axa - the Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed 72 points or 0.4%. Meanwhile the S&amp;P 500 is up 0.2% and Nasdaq 0.27% at the open. Over in Europe, the FTSE 100 has jumped 2.6% - back above the 6000 level - while Germany\u2019s Dax is up 2.3% and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 2.67%. Part of the reason for a tumble on Wednesday, before Wall Street\u2019s late revival, was a falling oil price on growing US inventories and further consideration of Saudi Arabia\u2019s comments suggesting producers were unlikely to cut output. But crude prices have stabilised to give some support to markets, with Brent down just 0.4% at $34.26 a barrel. But the durable goods data is more mixed than it first appears, says Rob Carnell at ING, and gives no reason for an early rate rise: US durable goods orders data showed a strong rebound in January, rising 4.9% month on month against expectations for a rise of only 2.9%. And this data will buoy hopes that the slowdown in US GDP growth that culminated in a rate of only 0.7% (annualised) in the fourth quarer of 2015 (and will likely be revised lower on Friday), may be turning the corner. This is choppy data at the best of times, so one month\u2019s data has to be taken with a pinch of salt. But these figures, which provide one of the best insights into the business investment environment, are especially important right now. This is because if the US is heading into recession, as some commentators maintain, then we suspect that this decline will be led by investment, with the labour market and consumer spending following in its wake with some lag. However, despite a decent headline figure, and bounces in some of the core indicators (we tend to focus on these core measures to shed some of the volatility of this data), the trend in orders and shipments is not giving a particularly clear message, and we will have to see more data before we can reach any firm conclusions. For example, the three month moving average for core capital goods orders fell further to -6.2%, and core capital goods shipments improved, but from -4.7% to only -4.2%, so still remain deeply depressed. With yet another inconclusive set of data, markets will make of this whatever they want. But the fact remains, the direction of the US economy at this juncture remains far from clear. And in consequence, the Fed\u2019s response remains in the balance, though we feel the hurdles for further tightening are high, so at the very least, this data provides no excuse for a near term tightening. The good US data of course could also prompt renewed talk of a Federal Reserve rate rise. David Morrison at Spread Co said: The US dollar rose a touch as did equities after durable goods (both including and excluding transportation items) blasted above market expectations. Weekly jobless claims were in line with expectations. It was a knee-jerk reaction which appeared to be algo-driven and it doesn\u2019t feel as if there\u2019s much follow-through to the initial move. Strong data may point to some robustness in the US economy but of course that\u2019s a double-edged sword. After all, it also raises the possibility of further rate increases from the Federal Reserve. In its economic projections back in December the central bank pencilled in 100 basis points-worth of rate hikes in 2016. That would be hard to stomach given the market turmoil since the beginning of the year. Sticking with America.... and US factories have just reported a surge in demand for machinery and heavy-duty equipment last month. It suggests the US economy is stronger than some economists feared . Orders for US capital goods jumped by 4.9% in January, after falling by 5% in December. That smashes forecasts of a 3% rise, and is the biggest monthly jump since March 2015. The weekly jobs figures have also been released, and they show a small increase in people filing new unemployment benefit claims. Not a major shock, though, and the total is still low in historic terms: Over in America, one of the country\u2019s top central bank officials isn\u2019t too worried about the prospect of Britain leaving the EU. James Bullard, president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve President, argued that Brexit isn\u2019t a threat to the US economy, as it would take years for the details to be sorted out. Bullard said (via Reuters): \u201cI don\u2019t think it is a risk event for the US because even if British voters decide to quit the EU there will be years for markets and investors to adjust.\u201d Britain\u2019s blue-chip stock index just burst back through the 6,000 point mark, as investors welcome today\u2019s GDP figures. The FTSE 100 index, which tracks the leading blue-chip shares in London, has jumped by 2.3% or 137 points to 6,004. That wipes out the losses suffered on Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday, when traders were fretting about the global economic slowdown. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, says the \u2018special dividend\u2019 announced by Lloyds today has improved the mood in the City. Dividend increases are all the rage this morning, as Lloyds, RSA and St James\u2019s Place all opt to flash their cash to keep shareholders happy. A 10% rally in Lloyds, along with a decent bounce for the rest of the sector has seen the FTSE add over 100 points within the first couple of hours of trading. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, says Britain\u2019s economy was \u201cwholly dependent on domestic activity\u201d for growth in the last quarter. And without the service sector, there wouldn\u2019t have been any growth at all either, as industrial production fell by 0.5%, and construction contracted by 0.4%. \u201cDomestic demand rose by 0.8% on the previous quarter, with consumer spending and a rise in inventories each accounting for roughly half this increase. Disappointingly, total investment fell slightly, with business investment dropping by 2.1% the biggest fall since the first quarter of 2014. \u201cThe bad news came on the net trade side, which knocked 0.3 percentage points off GDP. At the same time exports were down by 0.1% in the quarter and imports rose by 1.2%. German bank Berenberg reckons that the UK growth rate will slow this year, as the EU referendum approaches. Kallum Pickering, their senior UK economist, explains: Uncertainty hurts confidence and despite strong domestic demand growth toward the end of last year growth is likely to soften in the coming quarters. Economic performance depends on sentiment as much as on fundamentals. The combined effect of heightened global economic worries plus the reality of a possible Brexit - the referendum will take place on 23 June - will likely hit economic performance. As flagged up earlier, some economists think the UK could fall into recession if it votes to leave. He also produced this handy table, showing the details of Britain\u2019s growth over the last 18 months. Some international context: John Hawksworth, PwC\u2019s chief economist, says Britain\u2019s economy performed relatively well last year - encouraging people to move to the UK in search of work. \u201cToday\u2019s data confirmed that the UK economy slowed from 2.9% in 2014 to 2.2% in 2015, but remained the second strongest G7 economy last year after the US. \u201cRelatively strong growth in private sector services continues to drive UK growth despite much weaker trends in manufacturing and construction output in the second half of 2015. This has generated a lot of new jobs and helps to explain why net migration to the UK remained at near record levels of 323,000 in the year to September 2015. The UK jobs market remains a powerful magnet for workers from other slower growing countries in the EU and beyond. That 323,000 figure was released this morning - here\u2019s our news story on it: Hawksworth also agrees that consumers are providing the bulk of the growth: \u201cThe expenditure data for the fourth quarter suggest that steady growth in consumer spending remains the mainstay of the UK recovery. Investment growth seems to have stalled in the second half of 2015, however, and imports grew much faster than exports over this period. But these figures are only preliminary at this stage and may well be revised significantly later, so not too much should be read into them.\u201d Britain\u2019s economic recovery is rather less impressive once you adjust for population changes. On a per capita basis, GDP only grew by 0.3% in the last quarter. And on that measure, the economy is barely larger than in 2008 - before the financial crisis struck. Give yourselves a round of applause, UK consumers. You\u2019re keeping the economy afloat. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the international payments company, World First, explains: We had thought that weaker output numbers from industrial and construction sectors through Q4 would have dragged the overall growth number lower but, once again, consumer expenditure has remained resilient. Thank God for the British disposition to buy anything that isn\u2019t nailed down and to at least offer a few quid for the things that are.\u201d \u201cNet trade was also a drag on output although we can but hope that the recent GBP weakness we have seen will allow exporters to gain orders and hedge at currently attractive levels.\u201d Cook also fears that the \u201cbluster and pantomime over the EU referendum\u201d will arm the economy, by hurting business investment and consumer spending. Britain\u2019s trade balance is rarely a pretty sight, as the country sucks in more goods than it sells to the rest of the world. And today\u2019s growth report shows that the deficit has widened again, from \u00a314.7bn in Quarter 3 2015 to \u00a316.6bn in the fourth quarter. The ONS explains that British companies suffered a small drop in exports in the last quarter, while imports continued to climb. Following a 0.5% decrease in Quarter 3 2015, exports decreased by 0.1% in the latest quarter, while imports increased by 1.2% in Quarter 4 2015 following a 2.7% rise in Quarter 3 2015. Today\u2019s GDP report also confirms that Britain is heavily reliant on its service companies for growth. The service sector grew by 0.7% in the last quarter, meaning it has expanded steadily for three years. Manufacturing, though, was stagnant after shrinking for the previous three months: Shares are pushing higher, as investors express relief that Britain\u2019s growth rate hasnt\u2019 been revised down. The ONS has also confirmed that Britain grew by 2.2% during 2015. Household spending and business investment provided the bulk of the growth, while the UK trade deficit was a drag. The GDP report also shows that UK firms reined in their spending in the last quarter. The ONS says that business investment shrank by 2.1% in the October-December period, the biggest drop in almost two years. Breaking: The UK economy grew by 0.5% in the final three months of 2015. That confirms the initial estimate of GDP growth from the Office for National Statistics. That means Britain grew faster than Germany (which posted GDP growth of 0.3%), France (+0.2), and the United States (+0.2%). Details to follow... Tension is building in the City as we await the second estimate of UK growth in the last quarter, due in 10 minutes time..... The danger of Britain slumping back into recession will jump sharply if the public vote to leave the EU in June. So claim a group of economists surveyed by Bloomberg, who fear that confidence and spending would be knocked by a Brexit victory. Here\u2019s the details: As Britons contemplate their place in the 28-nation bloc before June\u2019s referendum, respondents to a Bloomberg survey said the probability of a slump spikes to 40% in the event of an \u201cout\u201d vote. That compares with just a 13% risk predicted in the most recent monthly poll.... Chris Hare, an economist at Investec Plc, warned: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty likely that we\u2019ll see volatility in financial markets, possibly a tightening in U.K. credit conditions, a hit to business and household confidence and all those things combined should drag on the economy.\u201d Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit doesn\u2019t believe governments will heed the IMF\u2019s latest call for action: BT shares have jumped by 3% this morning, as the stock market gives its verdict to Ofcom\u2019s review of the communications sector. Although the regulator is forcing BT to open up its network to rivals to build new fibre networks, it has backed away from the nuclear option of breaking up the company. That\u2019s a relief for BT, given the criticism it faces over Britain\u2019s patchy super-fast broadband coverage. My colleague Rob Davies explains: BT has been told to let rivals use its infrastructure to lay fibre cables that are faster than its own copper network, as part of a review of Britain\u2019s broadband needs by regulator Ofcom. In a once-in-a-decade review, the regulator stopped short of recommending that BT be forced to split off Openreach, the division that owns the broadband infrastructure. The verdict will be a blow to rivals including Sky and TalkTalk, which have said BT should lose control of the network. But Ofcom left open the possibility of revisiting that nuclear option if BT does not toe the line on a string of issues. It also gave a series of recommendations, including automatic compensation for customers and businesses when the Openreach network experiences problems. The regulator wants to introduce league tables and make it easier for customers to switch provider. Lloyd\u2019s surging share price has helped to push the FTSE 100 index up by 91 points, or 1.5%, to 5956. RSA, the insurance group, is also helping. Its shares are up 7.6%, after it posted a 43% jump in operating profits. CEO Stephen Hester cheered the City, by reporting that his turnaround plan is largely complete. RSA had also been hit by the winter floods in the North of England - taking a \u00a376m charge to cover insurance claims. Sterling has hit a new 14-month low against the euro this morning, as concern over the EU referendum bubbles away. The pound fell to \u20ac1.2609 against the single currency, which should make UK exports a little more competitive in Europe. Shareholders in Lloyds Banking Group have endured some tough years. Seven tough years, indeed, since the bank had to be bailed out after rescuing HBOS during the 2008 financial crisis. But there\u2019s better news this morning - Lloyds has announced it will pay them a special dividend (a princely 0.5p per share) on top of the full-year dividend of 2.25p. Lloyds only resumed paying dividends last year, and the news of an extra payment has sent shares soaring by almost 10% this morning. Chief executive Anto\u0301nio Horta-Oso\u0301rio should also be cheerful - he\u2019s picked up an \u00a38.5m pay deal, even though Lloyds profits dipped last year. China\u2019s stock market has had a bad day. The Shanghai stock market lurched downwards by 6% today, dogged by new anxiety over the Chinese economy. Fears of a possible devaluation also hit confidence, as Martin Farrer explains: Amid continued speculation that China could be forced to devalue the yuan this year, Zhu Guangyao, China\u2019s vice finance minister, said Beijing would seek to keep the exchange rate stable while maintaining its current \u201cmanaged float\u201d regime. \u201cWe do recognise the risk the global economy faces,\u201d he said at a conference on Thursday held by the Institute of International Finance linked to the G20 summit. \u201cWe also understand how important it is to correctly communicate with the market,\u201d he added. Overnight, the International Monetary Fund threw its weight behind calls for fresh action to ward off a global slump. The Fund is worried that the global economy is faltering as financial conditions worsen, emerging markets face tougher times, and the oil industry suffers from cheaper crude prices. In a statement ahead of the G20 finance minister\u2019s meeting in Shanghai, starting tomorrow, the IMF said: These developments point to higher risks of a derailed recovery, at a moment when the global economy is highly vulnerable to adverse shocks\u201d It added that warned governments that they can\u2019t simply rely on central bankers - they need to consider spending more to help their economies. \u201cA comprehensive approach is needed to reduce over-reliance on monetary policy.\u201d \u201cIn particular, near-term fiscal policy should be more supportive where appropriate and provided there is fiscal space, especially through investment that boosts both the demand and the supply potential of the economy.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We get a new health-check on the UK economy this morning. At 9.30am, the second estimate of British GDP for the last three months of 2015 is released. It may confirm that the economy grew by 0.5% during the quarter - unspectacular, but better than most major rivals. But some economists reckon it could be revised down to just 0.4%, if nervous businesses have cut their spending. A disappointing number could inflame worries over the UK, in a week where Brexit fears have already sent the pound sliding to seven-year lows. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: In a rather strange twist of fate one of the best performing economy\u2019s in Europe over the past 12 months has found its currency take an absolute hammering in the past few weeks as investors take a rather one eyed and alarmist perspective on the potential negative consequences of a British exit from the EU in a referendum vote scheduled for June this year. Later this morning we get the latest iteration of UK Q4 GDP and expectations are for growth of 0.5%, unchanged from the previous reading, and an annualised number of 1.9%, though we could see some evidence that business investment is starting to slow from the previous 2.2% to 0.6%, though the annualised measure is expected to increase to 6.4% from 5.8%. Also coming up today: There\u2019s a flurry of company news hitting the wires, including results from Lloyds Banking Group, theme park group Merlin, and insurance firm RSA. More on all those shortly. And Ofcom, the telecoms regulator, is outlining its plans to create more competition and improve Britain\u2019s broadband network. BT, the former state monopoly, is being ordered to open its network to its rivals, to help them build their own high-speed fibre services. However, BT has also dodged the threat of being broken up - although it\u2019s still an option if things don\u2019t improve. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

The bank will be slightly relieved to see that consumers\u2019 inflation expectations picked up to a 7-month high in February, although they were still well below long-term norms. Furthermore, pricing expectations rose slightly for retailers and were stable among retailers. However, they weakened among manufacturers</p> <p>In addition to the marked drop in Eurozone consumer and business confidence in February, pressure for appreciable ECB stimulus in March has been ramped up by early Eurozone consumer price data for February which suggests that a return to deflation is very possible as a consequence of lower oil, commodity and food prices. Specifically, Spanish deflation widened sharply to 0.9% in February (the sharpest since last October) from 0.4% in January while France saw consumer prices fall 0.1% year-on-year after an increase of 0.1% in January.</p> <p>There is clearly now a very real risk that the Eurozone returned to deflation in February despite consumer price inflation rising to an eight-month high of 0.3% in January. While this would be primarily due to lower oil and commodity prices, it would likely reinforce ECB concerns about potential second round effects on wages and price setting.</p> <p>We expect the ECB to trim its deposit rate by a further 10 basis points to -0.40% at its March meeting and believe it could very well step up its monthly purchase of assets (perhaps by \u20ac20bn-\u20ac30bn from the current level of \u20ac60bn. There are reports that the ECB is considering introducing a double tier on its deposit rate in order to ease the pressure on banks\u2019 profitability from another cut. The higher negative rate would only be charged on banks\u2019 deposits with the ECB above a certain level</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56d028f0e4b0bd5a0524cb80\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-26T10:31:55.586Z\">10.31am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Will the weak confidence data mean consumers and businesses keep their hands in their pockets? Bert Colijn at ING Bank says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Economic sentiment... was worse than analysts expected and reflects the somber mood about the Eurozone economy in the beginning of the year, although the indicator is still above its long-term average. The weak external environment is clearly impacting the business sector, as both manufacturing and services indicated weakening sentiment. Consumers even experienced the largest one-month drop in confidence since 2012. Both businesses and consumers are clearly spooked by concerns about the strength of the global economy and financial markets, geopolitical risks and a looming Brexit.</p> <p>For manufacturing, the global weakness is impacting current business, as orders, production and exports went down. The service sector indicated in this survey that recent demand was actually better than in January, but that expectations about future demand went down.</p> <p>Without any hard data for the first quarter, it is difficult to say how the downbeat survey results translate to output growth. Will consumers and businesses act on their negative sentiment or in other words: are they walking the walk or just talking the talk? Last summer, consumer confidence declined on the latest leg of the Greek crisis and the Chinese stock market crash, but consumption growth accelerated in the third quarter. With unemployment coming down, oil prices low and a weak euro, quite a few conditions for growth are benign, but large downside risks remain apparent. In a sense, the Eurozone currently resembles a 50-year old overweight smoker: there are a lot of downside risks, but the base case for the short-term remains fairly decent.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56d028c3e4b0d38537b1f5f4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-26T10:28:37.403Z\">10.28am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/samueltombs/status/703161147449434114\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">EC Econ Sentiment Index for UK, covering whole-econ, fell in Feb to 31-month low &amp; below EU ave.

Ahead of the GDP figures later, UBS concludes it is not.</p> <p>Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer at UBS Wealth Management said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Financial markets are right to be concerned about a slowdown in the world\u2019s largest economy. We expect just 1.5% growth for the US this year, reflecting a contraction in manufacturing activity, tighter credit conditions, the effects of a strong dollar in weaker international markets, and wealth losses due to recent stock market volatility.</p> <p>But markets would be wrong, in our view, to assume that this deceleration represents the start of a recession. Unemployment is under 5%. Average hourly earnings are growing at their fastest pace since 2009. Mortgage rates are just 3.7%, and gasoline prices are the cheapest they\u2019ve been in years. Household debt relative to GDP has dropped a full 20 percentage points over the past six years. These factors should enable real disposable incomes to increase at a sufficient pace to sustain consumption growth, and keep the US out of recession. Furthermore, with unemployment now so low, improved wage-bargaining power should translate into continued income growth, even if jobs growth slows from last year\u2019s 221,000 per month pace.</p> <p>Overall, it would be highly unusual for the US economy to contract against a backdrop of such strong labor markets.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56d01d0ce4b0bd5a0524cb5f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-26T09:41:04.099Z\">9.41am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>There seems to be a bit of playing down G20 expectations going on.</strong></p> <p>Reuters is quoting a senior US Treasury official saying meetings like the G20 are for the gradual shifting of policies, and 20 economies can not be driven from a central meeting.</p> <p>Earlier the head of Italy\u2019s central bank said the most important aim of the meeting wsa to improve the ability to stimulate growth.</p> <p>But he added, according to Reuters, that we should \u201cnot expect concrete action to come from the G20 meeting.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56d018bbe4b074a9f6b35b65\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-26T09:22:29.456Z\">9.22am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s our report on the latest developments in the London Stock Exchange\u2019s proposed merger with Deutsche B\u00f6rse:</p> <blockquote> <p>The planned merger of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/londonstockexchangegroup\">London Stock Exchange</a> (LSE) with Germany\u2019s Deutsche B\u00f6rse will result in a combined company with its main public listing in the UK capital.</p> <p>LSE chief executive Xavier Rolet is set to retire and his Deutsche B\u00f6rse counterpart Carsten Kengeter will take the same role at the new company, according to further details of the proposed merged released on Friday.</p> <p>It <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/23/london-stock-exchange-in-merger-talks-with-deutsche-borse\">emerged on Tuesday</a> that the LSE is in talks about an all-share merger with its German rival which would result in a group worth over \u00a321bn. </p> <p>In Friday\u2019s statement the LSE said the new combined group will be a UK plc domiciled in London, with headquarters in both the British capital and Frankfurt. </p> <p>The board will have equal numbers from each business, a move that was expected.

On top of that, there are fears that the EU referendum and ongoing global economic gloom will prompt consumers to rein in spending over coming months.<br></p> <p>Fresh figures out today suggest Britons are already becoming more cautious about the economic outlook. Consumer confidence fell to a 14-month low in February as people became more worried about the state of the UK economy and about its prospects over the next 12 months, according to market research company GfK. Its monthly confidence barometer, taking in the views of 2,000 people, also showed that consumers were less confident about making big purchases such as furniture or electrical goods.

                "bodyText":"Another indicator that a US rate rise could come sooner than expected comes with a bigger than expected rise in consumer spending. The Commerce Department said consumer spending climbed by 0.5% in February, compared to expectations of a 0.3% increase. Meanwhile there was also a 0.5% rise in income, the largest increase since June. And the final release of the University of Michigan consumer confidence survey rose to 91.7, up from 90.7. But Rob Carnell at ING Bank said it was still difficult to judge the current state of the US economy: As we head into payrolls week next week, there is still a distinct lack of clarity about where the US economy is headed. And given the nature of the non-farm payrolls jobs release, we may not be much the wiser by next Friday, and in consequence, there is likely to still be considerable uncertainty about the direction the Fed will be taking. Markets dislike uncertainty. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back again on Monday. After a brief revival, the pound is slipping back to seven year lows against the dollar, on a combination of the better than expected US GDP figures and continuing uncertainty over the UK referendum on whether to leave the European Union. Sterling is now down at $1.3925, heading back towards the seven year low of $1.3878 it reached on Wednesday. US markets have followed their European counterparts higher, boosted by rising oil prices and better than expected American GDP figures. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed around 90 points or 0.5% in early trading, while the S&amp;P 500 is up 0.3% and Nasdaq 0.7% higher at the open. Hopes of co-ordinated global policy measures from the G20 finance ministers meeting in Shanghai seem to be fading. Reuters reports: China sought to restore confidence in its economy as financial leaders from G20 nations gathered in Shanghai on Friday, and Premier Li Keqiang urged greater global coordination and consideration of policy spillovers. But Germany appeared to all but rule out coordinated stimulus to counter a deepening global chill, and U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said there was no need for a crisis response, as in 2009 when the Group of 20 (G20) major economies agreed on coordinated stimulus to prevent a worldwide depression. While the health of the world\u2019s second-largest economy, which hosts the G20 presidency this year, is a key talking point around the two-day summit, the threat of the UK leaving the European Union and its political and economic implications have also surfaced as concerns among participants in the meeting. \u201cMacroeconomic policy coordination needs to be strengthened. The global economic and financial situation may have become more grim and complex. It is time for countries to stand together to tide over difficulties,\u201d Li said in a video message at the opening of the meeting. Several other policymakers have urged better coordination, but there was disagreement about what steps to take, making it unlikely that concrete action points will emerge from the meeting. \u201cTalking about further stimulus just distracts from the real tasks at hand,\u201d Germany\u2019s Minister of Finance Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble said, rebuffing a recommendation from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that the G20 should start planning now for a coordinated stimulus programme. \u201cWe, therefore, do not agree on a G20 fiscal stimulus package as some argue, in case outlook risks materialise.\u201d Lew had a similar message, saying there was a great deal of economic uncertainty at present but no crisis. \u201cIt would not be reasonable to expect a crisis response in an environment that is not a crisis,\u201d he said told reporters. Overhanging the summit of major economy finance ministers and central bankers are global concerns about China\u2019s ability to manage its domestic markets, currency and commitment to wider restructuring reforms. Concerns about its slowing economy and confusion over its currency policy were among the factors which sowed turmoil in global markets in January. The case for further policy stimulus amid rising debt levels and already extremely low interest rates was a hard sell among some other G20 members. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned cutting rates below zero carried serious risks, and blamed the recent global slump in shares and other assets on the failure of governments to make bold economics reforms. Schaeuble said the debt-financed growth model had \u201creached its limits (and) is even causing new problems, raising debt, causing bubbles and excessive risk taking, zombifying the economy.\u201d And Japan\u2019s Finance Minister Taro Aso shrugged off calls from some quarters for Tokyo to roll out fresh fiscal stimulus. Japan\u2019s central bank stunned investors by adopting negative interest rates last month. The dollar has strengthened following the US GDP data, with sterling now at $1.3960 having earlier regained the $1.4 level. Dennis de Jong, managing directorat UFX.com, said: A dreary Dow Jones is likely to be perked up by today\u2019s better than expected US GDP figures, with annualised growth jumping up to the 1% mark. Financial markets were expecting a slowdown in the world\u2019s largest economy, so much so that conversations about a recession weren\u2019t far away. Yet, with unemployment remaining low and wages increasing at their fastest rate since 2009, growth is back on the agenda. Add to that cheap fuel prices and low mortgage rates, and it may only be a matter of time until disposable incomes are fully realised and growth continues to speed up. The better than expected US GDP figures should at least calm fears the country is heading into a recession. The US economy saw a slowdown in growth in the fourth quarter, but not as much as first thought. In its second revision, the Commerce Department said GDP grew at an annual rate of 1%, compared to the initial forecast of 0.7%. Analysts had been expecting the figure to be revised down to 0.4%. But this is still a slowdown on the 2% growth reported in the previous three months. The revision came as businesses seemed less aggressive in their efforts to reduce inventory. More signs of weak inflation across the eurozone. German\u2019s harmonised consumer price index is up 0.4% month on month, but down 0.2% year on year, compared to expectations of a flat figure. This is the lowest annual level since January 2015. Downbeat data from Greece: More for the ECB to think about, with German inflation set to go into negative territory. Reuters reports: German inflation turned negative in February for the first time in five months, preliminary state data indicated on Friday, giving proponents of further monetary policy easing more ammunition for a European Central Bank meeting next month. Consumer prices fell below zero on the year in five German states, the data showed. In the most populous state North Rhine-Westphalia, annual inflation slowed to 0.1 percent from 0.6 percent in January. The state readings will feed into nationwide inflation data due at 1300 GMT (08:00 a.m. EST). Capital Economics analyst Jessica Hinds said the state data suggested that pan-German EU-harmonized consumer price inflation (HICP) dropped to -0.1 percent from +0.4 percent in January. The market rally is continuing, helped by renewed strength in the oil prices. Brent crude is up 2% at $36.03 a barrel on hopes that a meeting between Saudia Arabia, Russia and Venezuela could tackle the low oil price. Analyst Connor Campbell at Spreadex said: The global indices continued to strive for recent highs this Friday, their growth sustained by a $36 per barrel crossing surge from Brent Crude. However, if expectations of a miserly US fourth quarter GDP figure this afternoon are accurate the US open may end up slightly spoiling the end of week party. Currently, at least, the Dow Jones is joining in with its galloping European peers, the futures promising a 110 point rise when the bell rings on Wall Street, something that would leave the index at its highest point since the first week of January. Yet the spectre of this afternoon\u2019s latest fourth quarter GDP reading may temper investors\u2019 enthusiasm, analysts forecasting a downward revision from an already awful annualised 0.7% to 0.4%. And here\u2019s more for the ECB to think about: European confidence and inflation figures make a strong case for further stimulus measures from the European Central Bank at its March meeting, says Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight: Certainly, the marked drop in overall business and consumer confidence across the Eurozone to an 8-month low heightens concern about faltering growth. However, price developments in the survey did offer a little bit of good news for the ECB. The bank will be slightly relieved to see that consumers\u2019 inflation expectations picked up to a 7-month high in February, although they were still well below long-term norms. Furthermore, pricing expectations rose slightly for retailers and were stable among retailers. However, they weakened among manufacturers In addition to the marked drop in Eurozone consumer and business confidence in February, pressure for appreciable ECB stimulus in March has been ramped up by early Eurozone consumer price data for February which suggests that a return to deflation is very possible as a consequence of lower oil, commodity and food prices. Specifically, Spanish deflation widened sharply to 0.9% in February (the sharpest since last October) from 0.4% in January while France saw consumer prices fall 0.1% year-on-year after an increase of 0.1% in January. There is clearly now a very real risk that the Eurozone returned to deflation in February despite consumer price inflation rising to an eight-month high of 0.3% in January. While this would be primarily due to lower oil and commodity prices, it would likely reinforce ECB concerns about potential second round effects on wages and price setting. We expect the ECB to trim its deposit rate by a further 10 basis points to -0.40% at its March meeting and believe it could very well step up its monthly purchase of assets (perhaps by \u20ac20bn-\u20ac30bn from the current level of \u20ac60bn. There are reports that the ECB is considering introducing a double tier on its deposit rate in order to ease the pressure on banks\u2019 profitability from another cut. The higher negative rate would only be charged on banks\u2019 deposits with the ECB above a certain level Will the weak confidence data mean consumers and businesses keep their hands in their pockets? Bert Colijn at ING Bank says: Economic sentiment... was worse than analysts expected and reflects the somber mood about the Eurozone economy in the beginning of the year, although the indicator is still above its long-term average. The weak external environment is clearly impacting the business sector, as both manufacturing and services indicated weakening sentiment. Consumers even experienced the largest one-month drop in confidence since 2012. Both businesses and consumers are clearly spooked by concerns about the strength of the global economy and financial markets, geopolitical risks and a looming Brexit. For manufacturing, the global weakness is impacting current business, as orders, production and exports went down. The service sector indicated in this survey that recent demand was actually better than in January, but that expectations about future demand went down. Without any hard data for the first quarter, it is difficult to say how the downbeat survey results translate to output growth. Will consumers and businesses act on their negative sentiment or in other words: are they walking the walk or just talking the talk? Last summer, consumer confidence declined on the latest leg of the Greek crisis and the Chinese stock market crash, but consumption growth accelerated in the third quarter. With unemployment coming down, oil prices low and a weak euro, quite a few conditions for growth are benign, but large downside risks remain apparent. In a sense, the Eurozone currently resembles a 50-year old overweight smoker: there are a lot of downside risks, but the base case for the short-term remains fairly decent. Eurozone economic sentiment slipped in February, according to new figures from the European Commission. The sentiment index fell from 105.1 in January to 103.8, below an expected 104.3. Consumer confidence was -8.8, down on January\u2019s -6.3 but in line with forecasts. In the run-up to the UK referendum on Europe, we should expect some dramatic moves in sterling, says Caxton FX analyst Nicholas Laser-Ebisch: As June 23rd approaches, it is likely that the strength of the pound will correlate highly with opinion polls discussing Britain\u2019s EU membership. However, the uncertainty surrounding the EU referendum and possible Brexit - the UK\u2019s most historically unprecedented event of the last few decades - means that the coming months could see quite random currency movements. A main factor of this will be the variety of opinions (both in the UK and outside) centring around the merits of staying in the EU, versus leaving. As beliefs clash, and political rhetoric ramps up, we will likely see exchange rate swings of up to 5% in the next 4 months leading up to the referendum (we have already seen 6% and 8% movements with the pound/dollar and the pound/euro respectively this year). More from George Osborne\u2019s interview with the BBC. The UK chancellor has said the risks to the global economy are at their worst since the financial crisis, making it the worst possible time to be contemplating leaving Europe. Osborne tweeted: The concerns about the global economy echo a speech Osborne made in January, when he warned of \u201ca dangerous cocktail of threats\u201d to the UK. Is the US heading for a recession? Ahead of the GDP figures later, UBS concludes it is not. Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer at UBS Wealth Management said: Financial markets are right to be concerned about a slowdown in the world\u2019s largest economy. We expect just 1.5% growth for the US this year, reflecting a contraction in manufacturing activity, tighter credit conditions, the effects of a strong dollar in weaker international markets, and wealth losses due to recent stock market volatility. But markets would be wrong, in our view, to assume that this deceleration represents the start of a recession. Unemployment is under 5%. Average hourly earnings are growing at their fastest pace since 2009. Mortgage rates are just 3.7%, and gasoline prices are the cheapest they\u2019ve been in years. Household debt relative to GDP has dropped a full 20 percentage points over the past six years. These factors should enable real disposable incomes to increase at a sufficient pace to sustain consumption growth, and keep the US out of recession. Furthermore, with unemployment now so low, improved wage-bargaining power should translate into continued income growth, even if jobs growth slows from last year\u2019s 221,000 per month pace. Overall, it would be highly unusual for the US economy to contract against a backdrop of such strong labor markets. There seems to be a bit of playing down G20 expectations going on. Reuters is quoting a senior US Treasury official saying meetings like the G20 are for the gradual shifting of policies, and 20 economies can not be driven from a central meeting. Earlier the head of Italy\u2019s central bank said the most important aim of the meeting wsa to improve the ability to stimulate growth. But he added, according to Reuters, that we should \u201cnot expect concrete action to come from the G20 meeting.\u201d Here\u2019s our report on the latest developments in the London Stock Exchange\u2019s proposed merger with Deutsche B\u00f6rse: The planned merger of the London Stock Exchange (LSE) with Germany\u2019s Deutsche B\u00f6rse will result in a combined company with its main public listing in the UK capital. LSE chief executive Xavier Rolet is set to retire and his Deutsche B\u00f6rse counterpart Carsten Kengeter will take the same role at the new company, according to further details of the proposed merged released on Friday. It emerged on Tuesday that the LSE is in talks about an all-share merger with its German rival which would result in a group worth over \u00a321bn. In Friday\u2019s statement the LSE said the new combined group will be a UK plc domiciled in London, with headquarters in both the British capital and Frankfurt. The board will have equal numbers from each business, a move that was expected. Rolet, who has been credited with rejuvenating the company and embarking on an acquisition spree, will step down. The combined company will seek a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange and a prime standard listing on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Full story here: Here are the gainers and losers so far on the FTSE 100: More on eurozone inflation: Although most European markets look set for a fall over the month - the FTSEurofirst 300 is currently down 3% in February - the London market has edged marginally higher. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: The FTSE-100 is charging higher again at the open, paced by a strong finish in Wall Street last night and the fact we\u2019ve seen no repeat of that big down leg in Chinese stocks, but it\u2019s worth noting that the London index is only just back to where we started the month. As we run down to the weekend break, it\u2019s looking relatively quiet in terms of the domestic economic calendar although German inflation and US GDP readings could provide some broad direction. Any further signals out of the G20 meeting in Shanghai which runs again tomorrow will also gave the ability to shift sentiment \u2013 February may look as if it\u2019s going to conclude on an upbeat note, but it\u2019s certainly been a wild ride to get here. Meanwhile consumer confidence in the UK fell to a 14 month low in February, while export orders fell sharply in the last quarter of 2015, according to new figures out this morning. Katie Allen reports: We have known for some time that the UK economy has been largely relying on consumer spending for growth - something confirmed in Thursday\u2019s GDP figures. Economists are warning that\u2019s a dangerous position to be in given that households\u2019 real incomes look set to slow this year. On top of that, there are fears that the EU referendum and ongoing global economic gloom will prompt consumers to rein in spending over coming months. Fresh figures out today suggest Britons are already becoming more cautious about the economic outlook. Consumer confidence fell to a 14-month low in February as people became more worried about the state of the UK economy and about its prospects over the next 12 months, according to market research company GfK. Its monthly confidence barometer, taking in the views of 2,000 people, also showed that consumers were less confident about making big purchases such as furniture or electrical goods. But consumer remained upbeat about their personal financial situation. \u201cDespite the positive impact of continued low interest rates and subdued inflation on our day-to-day household budgets, the feeble outlook for growth and a variety of economic uncertainties since the start of the year has depressed our New Year optimism,\u201d says Joe Staton at GfK. Separate figures on exporters also point to more challenging times ahead. Export sales and orders across both manufacturing and services sectors fell significantly in the last quarter of 2015, according to this morning\u2019s report from the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) and DHL. \u201cBritish exporters have faced considerable challenges in recent months. Slowing growth in China and the US, along with the continued weakness in the eurozone, have made it harder for firms to build momentum,\u201d said BCC director general John Longworth. Labour has seized on the BCC report to argue the UK needed a new industrial strategy to tackle challenges around access to finance, skills and infrastructure. \u201cThese figures show that George Osborne has been asleep at the wheel, he\u2019s leaving our economy insufficiently resilient to advancing global threats and not in a high-enough state of readiness to seize on the fast-approaching opportunities to make sure that Britain benefits most,\u201d said Kevin Brennan MP, Labour\u2019s shadow minister for trade, investment and intellectual property. UK chancellor George Osborne has been speaking to the BBC on the referendum and the prospect of Brexit: The French deflation figure of course puts more pressure on the European Central Bank to provide further stimulus at its meeting next month, since it is well shy of its inflation target. ECB president Mario Draghi has already promised he will not hesitate to act, and he may well have to. The recent rally is indeed continuing, with European markets making a bright start on the last trading day of the week. The FTSE 100 has jumped 1% or 64 points to 6077, despite an 8% slump in Royal Bank of Scotland following its figures. Germany\u2019s Dax has opened up 1.5%, France\u2019s Cac has climbed 1.1% and the FTSEEurofirst 300 has risen 0.8%. Elsewhere the London Stock Exchange has just said that following its proposed merger with Deutsche B\u00f6rse, the combined group would be a UK plc domiciled in London. The news is likely to help appease some fears that the German exchange was gaining greater control of the business. But Carsten Kengeter, the German banker running the Frankfurt exchange, will become chief executive. The group also said it was setting up a joint committee to look at the implications of the UK referendum on Europe. But first we have French fourth quarter GDP, which is better than expected. The economy grew by 0.3% in the final three months of the year compared to the previous quarter, which has been revised up from the initial estimate of 0.2%. The INSEE statistics agency said consumer spending and household investment fell less than had previously expected, Reuters reported. Meanwhile French consumer prices fell 0.1% in February, pushing the 12 month inflation rate into negative territory, down -1% compared to estimates of an increase of 1%. Here\u2019s the schedule for the main economic data due later: 10.00 am (GMT) Eurozone consumer confidence 13.00 pm German consumer price index 13.30 pm US GDP (fourth quarter) As far as the US figures are concerned, the second reading of GDP is expected to see a revision down from 0.7% to 0.4%. Royal Bank of Scotland is the latest bank to report its results, and it has announced a \u00a32bn loss, its eighth consecutive year of losses. But chief executive Ross McEwan still received a pay package of \u00a33.9m. Our full story is here: Global markets are being buoyed again by hopes of more stimulus from central banks and reports that oil producers will meet again to discuss the slump in crude prices. As G20 finance ministers meet in Shanghai, the head of China\u2019s central bank hinted the country was preparing to launch another round of stimulus as he sought to reassure the financial markets about the country\u2019s flagging economy. Our full story is here: Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said: The recent rebound in the yuan does appear to have assuaged concerns that the Chinese appear intent on sharply devaluing their currency, however given the timing and location of this week\u2019s meeting, it seems to me merely good policy to avoid criticism from fellow G20 members. It would not be unexpected to see the yuan start sliding again once this weekend\u2019s meeting is in the rear view mirror. The recent call by the IMF earlier this week, followed by the OECD this morning, for the G20 to take bold action at their meeting this weekend could also be a factor behind the rebound in the latter part of this week, at a time when data showed that global trade slowed sharply in 2015, led largely by a slowdown in emerging markets. But he added: It is highly unlikely that the G20 finance ministers will be able to deliver on anything more substantial than mere warm words and empty rhetoric, though I\u2019m sure UK officials will somehow be able to shoehorn a mention into the statement about the risks of a \u201cBrexit\u201d as \u201cProject fear\u201d continues to get ramped up by the various vested interests in the global economy as well as big business. Indeed the Financial Times is reporting (\u00a3) that US chancellor George Osborne is pressing for the G20 to warn of the dangers of Brexit in its official communique due on Saturday. Meanwhile Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said central banks had not run out of ammunition to boost the global economy, as was sometimes suggested, but he also called on the G20 to adopt more positive measures to help growth. So ahead of a raft of data later, notably US GDP figures, markets are continuing their recent rally, with the NIkkei up 0.3% and the Hang Seng 1.8% better. In China the CSI300 is up 1%. European markets are also expected to open higher: This follows a 1.2% gain overnight on Wall Street, as crude prices climbed on reports that Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Russia planned to meet next month. But any major deal seems unlikely following this week\u2019s comments from Saudi suggesting oil producers would not cut production.",

                "body":"<p>Four of Britain\u2019s biggest banks reported annual results this week and insisted they were robust enough to withstand another global downturn. But what did the results for HSBC, Standard Chartered and the bailed-out duo of Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland tell us about the industry and the wider economy? </p> <p> </p> <h2><strong>Bankers\u2019 pay and bonuses </strong></h2> <p>Bonuses have not gone away, despite considerable public and political anger over pay since the 2008 crash. When the pay disclosures of the four banks from their annual results are added up, 800 or so of their employees received more than \u20ac1m (\u00a3790,000) in 2015. Barclays will add to that tally when its annual figures are published on Tuesday next week.</p> <p>The four banks who have reported so far have cut their bonus pools for 2015, but that total still stands at \u00a33.7bn. Chief executive pay was down at HSBC and Lloyds but their bosses still earned \u00a37.3m and \u00a38.5m respectively, while pay rose for the chief executives of RBS and Standard Chartered (in part because of a buy-out for its new chief executive) whose packages reached \u00a33.8m and \u00a39m respectively.<br></p> <h2><strong>Behaviour </strong></h2> <p>Despite years of damning inquiries and punitive fines, banks are still getting into trouble. Bankers are keen to point out that their problems relate to \u201clegacy issues\u201d \u2013 industry jargon for historical misdemeanours \u2013 but they are struggling to emerge from their shadow. The four banks\u2019 annual reports contained a lengthy list of legal warnings of court cases and potential fines from regulators.</p> <p>Predictably, the payment protect insurance scandal has continued to dominate. The damage faced by the industry now tops \u00a330bn after Lloyds <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/25/lloyds-hands-chief-executive-85m-pay-package\">admitted this week that its bill alone had reached \u00a316bn</a>. Lloyds, though, has signalled that the saga could be drawing to a close. Banks are also setting aside money in case they have to pay compensation for controversial packaged bank accounts \u2013 which charge a monthly fee and offer perks such as insurance, but in some cases were missold. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/ng-interactive/2016/feb/23/british-bank-annual-results-interactive\">British bank annual results \u2013 interactive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Each bank has its own issues, too. RBS flagged a looming penalty from the US authorities over the way it sold bonds before the financial crisis \u2013 and the bill could run into billions of pounds. HSBC is still dealing with the consequences of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/11/hsbc-bank-us-money-laundering\">\u00a31.2bn fine for money laundering offences in 2012</a>, as it admitted that a monitor installed by the US in the wake of that scandal is concerned it is taking too long to tackle financial crime. Standard Chartered, meanwhile, revealed it was being investigated for potential failings in its defences against financial crime. </p> <h2><strong>The UK and global economy</strong></h2> <p>The UK economy is crucial for Lloyds and RBS, big lenders to British households and businesses. However, both are being held back from making bigger profits in their domestic businesses because interest rates are at a record low of 0.5%. Lloyds had expected the base rate to rise to 2.5% by 2017, but it revealed this week that it now believed borrowing costs would reach that level two years later \u2013 amid signals from the Bank of England that rate rises are not imminent. </p> <p>Despite that, RBS customers are anticipating a rate rise. Just 15% of its customers are on variable rate mortgages after they moved to fixed rate products in recent years. </p> <p>Both the bailed-out banks could be buffeted by a downturn in the global economy, but HSBC and Standard Chartered have the most exposure to a slump in China and emerging markets. \u201cThe current economic environment is uncertain,\u201d said Stuart Gulliver, chief executive of HSBC. </p> <p>Worryingly for banks with global exposure, interest rates around the world are either low or \u2013 in the case of the eurozone, Japan, Sweden and Switzerland \u2013 turning negative. This makes it difficult for banks to make profits on loans or attract deposits from savers.</p> <p>However, the big question mark is over China, the world\u2019s second largest economy, and whether its recent economic slowdown will become a crash. The prospect of a hard landing has rattled global stock markets and HSBC, which generates a significant amount of its income in Hong Kong, offered some reassurance. It said China was growing more slowly but it would still be the biggest contributor to global economic growth.</p> <h2><strong>Brexit </strong></h2> <p>Lloyds was determined not to give a view on the EU referendum on 23 June, but RBS, HSBC and Standard Chartered were clearer. HSBC, which earlier this month said it would keep its headquarters in the UK, has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/15/uk-better-in-reformed-europe-says-hsbc-chair\">warned 1,000 roles could go to Paris if the UK votes to leave</a>. Standard Chartered, London-based but with operations across the globe, said the UK should not break away from Brussels. RBS cited the referendum as a risk to its business and warned of economic uncertainty related to the vote.</p> <h2><strong>When will taxpayers get their money back in Lloyds and RBS?</strong></h2> <p>Lloyds is in sight of the finish line \u2013 much to George Osborne\u2019s relief. The taxpayer\u2019s stake is now 9%, from the 43% shareholding the government held in 2008. That stake was built when the Treasury pumped in \u00a320bn in wake of Lloyds\u2019 rescue bid for HBOS, the owner of Halifax and Bank of Scotland. But last month the chancellor temporarily abandoned a pledge to make \u00a32bn of shares available to the public at a discount, citing market turmoil. </p> <p>Publication of Lloyds\u2019 results on Thursday, however, put a rocket under the shares. They closed on Friday at 72.1p, just a whisker under the 73.6p at which taxpayers break even on their investment. Any sustained move above that level could allow Osborne to resume selling shares into the market, although any offering to the public seems unlikely until the outcome of the EU referendum is known.</p> <p>The finishing line remains distant for RBS, however. As it reported its eighth consecutive annual loss this week, it also admitted any hope of returning cash to shareholders had been kicked beyond its target of early 2017. Osborne sold off <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/04/rbs-sell-off-george-osborne-defends-1bn-loss\">the first chunk of RBS shares in August</a>, reducing the stake from 79% to 73%.

But what did the results for HSBC, Standard Chartered and the bailed-out duo of Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland tell us about the industry and the wider economy? Bankers\u2019 pay and bonuses Bonuses have not gone away, despite considerable public and political anger over pay since the 2008 crash. When the pay disclosures of the four banks from their annual results are added up, 800 or so of their employees received more than \u20ac1m (\u00a3790,000) in 2015. Barclays will add to that tally when its annual figures are published on Tuesday next week. The four banks who have reported so far have cut their bonus pools for 2015, but that total still stands at \u00a33.7bn. Chief executive pay was down at HSBC and Lloyds but their bosses still earned \u00a37.3m and \u00a38.5m respectively, while pay rose for the chief executives of RBS and Standard Chartered (in part because of a buy-out for its new chief executive) whose packages reached \u00a33.8m and \u00a39m respectively. Behaviour Despite years of damning inquiries and punitive fines, banks are still getting into trouble. Bankers are keen to point out that their problems relate to \u201clegacy issues\u201d \u2013 industry jargon for historical misdemeanours \u2013 but they are struggling to emerge from their shadow. The four banks\u2019 annual reports contained a lengthy list of legal warnings of court cases and potential fines from regulators. Predictably, the payment protect insurance scandal has continued to dominate. The damage faced by the industry now tops \u00a330bn after Lloyds admitted this week that its bill alone had reached \u00a316bn. Lloyds, though, has signalled that the saga could be drawing to a close. Banks are also setting aside money in case they have to pay compensation for controversial packaged bank accounts \u2013 which charge a monthly fee and offer perks such as insurance, but in some cases were missold. Each bank has its own issues, too. RBS flagged a looming penalty from the US authorities over the way it sold bonds before the financial crisis \u2013 and the bill could run into billions of pounds. HSBC is still dealing with the consequences of a \u00a31.2bn fine for money laundering offences in 2012, as it admitted that a monitor installed by the US in the wake of that scandal is concerned it is taking too long to tackle financial crime. Standard Chartered, meanwhile, revealed it was being investigated for potential failings in its defences against financial crime. The UK and global economy The UK economy is crucial for Lloyds and RBS, big lenders to British households and businesses. However, both are being held back from making bigger profits in their domestic businesses because interest rates are at a record low of 0.5%. Lloyds had expected the base rate to rise to 2.5% by 2017, but it revealed this week that it now believed borrowing costs would reach that level two years later \u2013 amid signals from the Bank of England that rate rises are not imminent. Despite that, RBS customers are anticipating a rate rise. Just 15% of its customers are on variable rate mortgages after they moved to fixed rate products in recent years. Both the bailed-out banks could be buffeted by a downturn in the global economy, but HSBC and Standard Chartered have the most exposure to a slump in China and emerging markets. \u201cThe current economic environment is uncertain,\u201d said Stuart Gulliver, chief executive of HSBC. Worryingly for banks with global exposure, interest rates around the world are either low or \u2013 in the case of the eurozone, Japan, Sweden and Switzerland \u2013 turning negative. This makes it difficult for banks to make profits on loans or attract deposits from savers. However, the big question mark is over China, the world\u2019s second largest economy, and whether its recent economic slowdown will become a crash. The prospect of a hard landing has rattled global stock markets and HSBC, which generates a significant amount of its income in Hong Kong, offered some reassurance. It said China was growing more slowly but it would still be the biggest contributor to global economic growth. Brexit Lloyds was determined not to give a view on the EU referendum on 23 June, but RBS, HSBC and Standard Chartered were clearer. HSBC, which earlier this month said it would keep its headquarters in the UK, has warned 1,000 roles could go to Paris if the UK votes to leave. Standard Chartered, London-based but with operations across the globe, said the UK should not break away from Brussels. RBS cited the referendum as a risk to its business and warned of economic uncertainty related to the vote. When will taxpayers get their money back in Lloyds and RBS? Lloyds is in sight of the finish line \u2013 much to George Osborne\u2019s relief. The taxpayer\u2019s stake is now 9%, from the 43% shareholding the government held in 2008. That stake was built when the Treasury pumped in \u00a320bn in wake of Lloyds\u2019 rescue bid for HBOS, the owner of Halifax and Bank of Scotland. But last month the chancellor temporarily abandoned a pledge to make \u00a32bn of shares available to the public at a discount, citing market turmoil. Publication of Lloyds\u2019 results on Thursday, however, put a rocket under the shares. They closed on Friday at 72.1p, just a whisker under the 73.6p at which taxpayers break even on their investment. Any sustained move above that level could allow Osborne to resume selling shares into the market, although any offering to the public seems unlikely until the outcome of the EU referendum is known. The finishing line remains distant for RBS, however. As it reported its eighth consecutive annual loss this week, it also admitted any hope of returning cash to shareholders had been kicked beyond its target of early 2017. Osborne sold off the first chunk of RBS shares in August, reducing the stake from 79% to 73%. The shares closed at 226.6p this week \u2013 below the 502p break-even point.",

The power of monetary policy was beginning to wane, the IMF said, and those governments that could safely increase their spending should step up to the plate and act together. In a <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2016/pr1671.htm\" title=\"\">separate report on the UK</a>, the IMF urged the government to be ready to ease back on austerity should the economy slow further.</p> <p>That all echoed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/18/oecd-calls-for-less-austerity-and-more-public-investment\" title=\"\">pleas by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) for its rich-country members to let up on austerity</a> and collectively agree to spend more on infrastructure projects. Low interest rates and money creation by central banks were no longer enough for recovery, the thinktank warned.</p> <p>Carney has been quick to dismiss the argument put forward recently that central bankers are out of ammunition. But he also joined the chorus calling for finance ministers to do their bit. <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/2016/885.aspx\" title=\"\">Speaking in Shanghai</a> on Friday, he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/26/bank-of-england-chief-accuses-g20-of-failing-to-enact-reforms-to-boost-growth\" title=\"\">accused the G20 of failing to adopt measures to boost global growth</a>. \u201cThe G20 needs to use the time purchased by monetary policy to develop a coherent and urgent approach to supply-side policies,\u201d he said. The Bank governor was scathing about progress on a 2014 pledge to lift the level of G20 GDP by at least 2% by 2018. \u201cLess than half of the measures have been implemented, and only around one third of the promised impact on global GDP has been delivered,\u201d Carney observed.</p> <p>As it happened, the Shanghai meeting ended with their joint recognition that \u201cmonetary policy alone cannot lead to balanced growth\u201d. But based on past pledges, central bankers should not get their hopes up that much will change.</p> <p>One has to wonder why it has taken so long for warnings about austerity to be voiced. Until recently the OECD had strongly backed George Osborne\u2019s deficit reduction programme. Such support emboldened the chancellor to talk about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/10/george-osborne-public-finances-victorian-values\" title=\"\">\u201cfixing the roof while the sun is shining\u201d</a>.</p> <p>And how did he respond to the latest warnings?

                "bodyText":"Seven years ago this week, the Bank of England cut interest rates to 0.5% \u2013 the lowest since the central bank was founded in 1694. In a drastic bid to stem the fallout from the global financial crisis, then governor Mervyn King and his fellow policymakers also kicked off the process of pumping tens of billions of pounds into the economy. Unsurprisingly, Labour chancellor Alistair Darling welcomed the flood of money. The economy had been battered by recession, house prices were falling and unemployment was high. There have been two changes of government since then. And at the Bank too, a new man is in charge; Mark Carney came over from Canada to replace King in 2013. All of the nine people who voted for those record low borrowing costs in March 2009 have left the monetary policy committee. Those years have seen periodic warnings from economists and policymakers that interest rates would have to rise soon. But the dog never barked and here we are: marking yet another year of record low rates. They have been seven lean years for savers but seven years of tailwinds if you happen to be a finance minister. Ultra-loose monetary policy was the backdrop throughout the coalition\u2019s time in office. It was the first government since the 1940s to enjoy unchanged borrowing costs for its entire term. The way things are going, this parliament may be little different. As if to mark this unenviable anniversary, a whole host of commentators have been coming out to say monetary policy cannot do all the heavy lifting. As finance ministers around the world were setting off for the G20 meeting in Shanghai, the International Monetary Fund issued a call for them to boost public spending on infrastructure to fuel global growth. The power of monetary policy was beginning to wane, the IMF said, and those governments that could safely increase their spending should step up to the plate and act together. In a separate report on the UK, the IMF urged the government to be ready to ease back on austerity should the economy slow further. That all echoed pleas by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) for its rich-country members to let up on austerity and collectively agree to spend more on infrastructure projects. Low interest rates and money creation by central banks were no longer enough for recovery, the thinktank warned. Carney has been quick to dismiss the argument put forward recently that central bankers are out of ammunition. But he also joined the chorus calling for finance ministers to do their bit. Speaking in Shanghai on Friday, he accused the G20 of failing to adopt measures to boost global growth. \u201cThe G20 needs to use the time purchased by monetary policy to develop a coherent and urgent approach to supply-side policies,\u201d he said. The Bank governor was scathing about progress on a 2014 pledge to lift the level of G20 GDP by at least 2% by 2018. \u201cLess than half of the measures have been implemented, and only around one third of the promised impact on global GDP has been delivered,\u201d Carney observed. As it happened, the Shanghai meeting ended with their joint recognition that \u201cmonetary policy alone cannot lead to balanced growth\u201d. But based on past pledges, central bankers should not get their hopes up that much will change. One has to wonder why it has taken so long for warnings about austerity to be voiced. Until recently the OECD had strongly backed George Osborne\u2019s deficit reduction programme. Such support emboldened the chancellor to talk about \u201cfixing the roof while the sun is shining\u201d. And how did he respond to the latest warnings? With defiance. \u201cStorm clouds\u201d were gathering in the world economy, with dangers for the UK, Osborne said in Shanghai. Time to get down off the roof, then, one would think. Most certainly not, the chancellor insisted. After UK growth slowed last year, it was in fact more important than ever to keep cutting, Osborne told the BBC in an interview. \u201cSo we may need to undertake further reductions in spending because this country can only afford what it can afford \u2013 and we will address that in the budget, because I\u2019m absolutely clear we\u2019ve got to root our country in the principle that we must live within our means,\u201d he said. So it appears if you are Osborne, you do not need sunshine to cut spending after all. Not that any of his tinkering with the roof since 2010 has really been carried out in the glow of economic fair weather: just rays of artificial light from a loose monetary policy. Now that storm clouds are gathering, Osborne\u2019s austerity looks even more ill-timed. That view is backed up in new research from economists at the University of California, Davis.

More speculatively, there may even be some positives for the world economy \u2013 notably the additional pressure for more growth-friendly policies in the remainder of the EU.</p> <p> In our view... while Brexit would have global ramifications, these should not be overstated, nor need they all be negative. For a start, we doubt the disruption to the UK economy would be as large as many fear. In particular, the uncertainties about the UK\u2019s relations with the rest of Europe could be reduced during the period of negotiations before exit actually takes place. And unlike some potential euro departures, the UK already has its own currency and would be opting to leave rather than being pushed out. The UK would surely also swiftly reassert its commitment to international organisations like NATO and to cooperation with other Western powers in areas of common geopolitical interests.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, even if the UK economy does initially struggle following Brexit, it only accounts for around 4% of world GDP. Indeed, some of the feared costs to the UK \u2013 such as the relocation of international companies to the Continent \u2013 would not have any net impact on the global economy...</p> <p>[And] it is surely inconsistent to argue \u2013 as some do \u2013 that Brexit would both be a disaster for the UK and encourage other member states to quit the EU as well. It is even possible \u2013 though perhaps only wishful thinking at this stage \u2013 that Brexit would be the catalyst for much-needed structural reform in the remainder of the EU, as well as a shift away from austerity. In this (admittedly rosy) scenario, Brexit might yet prove to be a long-term positive both for the UK and for the world economy. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56d45c17e4b0d38537b1fc9b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-29T14:59:00.513Z\">2.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Meanwhile there are more signs of weakness in the US economy, with the Chicago purchasing managers index coming in lower than expected.</p> <p>The index fell from 55.6 in January to 47.6 in February, compared to forecasts of a figure of 53.

We map out where the pound could go in the event of a \u201cBrexit\u201d, how much of a rebound is likely with a vote to \u201cRemain\u201d, and the potential for further currency weakness between now and June. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>What happens to EUR/GBP if the UK votes to stay in the European Union?</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We think that EUR/GBP should revert to the 0.73 level, near which it spent most of last year. In our view, the largest part of the weakness in sterling since November can be attributed to increased concern over the possibility of exit from the EU. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>What happens to EUR/GBP if the UK votes to leave (\u201cBrexit\u201d)?</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We estimate the exchange rate level that would accommodate a sharp correction in the UK\u2019s current account deficit and find that EUR/GBP could go to parity. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>What probabilities do we assign to each outcome?</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We assign a 60% probability to the UK staying in the EU and up to 40% probability of a vote to leave, as we have argued previously based on published opinion polls.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Our baseline forecast is 0.73 for the end of 2016</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We think that the result of the referendum will be one of the UK to remain in the EU, thus our forecast is that sterling will eventually strengthen back to 0.73. However, we expect some further weakness of sterling between now and the vote on 23 June. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>But a vote to leave would push EUR/GBP to 1.00</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The price action so far makes it clear that sterling would weaken in the event of an exit vote. We think that the market would re-price to parity \u2013 and to the extent that it could accommodate a shift in the current account by 2.7% of GDP.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <br> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-02-29T09:55:52.339Z\">at 9.55am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-56d41064e4b0bd5a0524d15f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-29T09:36:12.289Z\">9.36am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK mortgage approvals hit two-year high</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Breaking: UK mortgage approvals have hit their highest level in two years.</strong></p> <p>A total of 74,600 new home loans were approved last month, implying that the British housing market remains pretty robust.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DavidRobinson2K/status/704237433530011648\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">UK mortgage rates hit new record low at avg. 2.96% in Jan as mortgage approvals rise to 2 yr high <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bankofengland\">@bankofengland</a>.</p>&mdash; David Robinson (@DavidRobinson2K) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DavidRobinson2K/status/704237433530011648\">February 29, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/moved_average/status/704237617899036672\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/UK?src=hash\">#UK</a> | JAN MORTGAGE APPROVALS: 74.6K V 74.0KE <a href=\"https://t.co/ZC7UwNU8Lu\">pic.twitter.com/ZC7UwNU8Lu</a></p>&mdash; Ioan Smith (@moved_average) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/moved_average/status/704237617899036672\">February 29, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56d407dfe4b0bd5a0524d156\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-29T09:20:53.010Z\">9.20am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"446bd22b00e3e80b24f3434eb94ae7df4dfe7d23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/446bd22b00e3e80b24f3434eb94ae7df4dfe7d23/0_0_3500_2438/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A closed steel foundry in Tangshan, China, today.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"697\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A closed steel foundry in Tangshan, China, today.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kim Kyung-Hoon/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Here\u2019s a jaw-dropping fact -- China is planning to lay off almost two million workers from its coal and steel industry.</strong><br></p> <p>It\u2019s part of Beijing\u2019s attempts to cut capacity in the sector in response to slowing demand, and to rebalance the wider economy towards consumption.</p> <p>Reuters has the details:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Yin Weimin, the minister for human resources and social security, told a news conference on Monday that 1.3 million workers in the coal sector could lose their jobs, plus 500,000 from the steel sector.</p> <p>China\u2019s coal and steel sectors employ about 12 million workers, according to data published by the National Bureau of Statistics.</p> <p>\u201cThis involves the resettlement of a total of 1.8 million workers.

                "bodyText":"Despite continuing worries about the global economy, as well as disappointment that there were no new stimulus measures announced by G20 finance ministers following their meeting in Shanghai, shares held up pretty well on the last day of the month. A rise in crude prices after comments from Saudi Arabia about wanting to limit volatilty helped support markets, as did news that China was acting to try and boost bank lending and reduce borrowing costs. So the final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished 1.08 points or 0.02% higher at 6097.09, up 0.22% on the month Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.19% to 9495.40 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.9% at 4353.55 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.8% to 17,623.07 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.34% at 8461.4 In Greece, the Athens market rose 1.89% to 516.71 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 49 points or 0.3%. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow for, among other things, the February manufacturing PMIs and Barclays results. As European markets close in mixed fashion, Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: London\u2019s FTSE-100 is finishing up the day\u2019s session broadly flat \u2013 we\u2019re still below where we started the year, but sentiment does appear to be on the up. There was disappointment that we didn\u2019t see more clarity out of the G20 meeting at the weekend, so it\u2019s arguably quite surprising that we haven\u2019t seen additional downside pressures as a result. ... Where March takes the market remains to be seen \u2013 the tide does appear to have turned with regard to London\u2019s FTSE-100 now being well beyond bear market territory and critically oil prices appear to be nudging higher, too. That said, the support we\u2019re seeing for gold does suggest that there\u2019s still a lack of confidence when it comes to the medium term view. An unexpected drop in US home sales adds to the weak data already seen. Reuters reports: Contracts to buy previously owned U.S. homes fell to their lowest level in a year in January, likely weighed down by harsh weather and a shortage of properties for sale, a report showed on Monday. The National Association of Realtors said its pending home sales index declined 2.5 percent to 106.0, the lowest level since January of last year. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast contracts rising 0.5 percent last month. Pending home contracts become sales after a month or two, and January\u2019s unexpected drop suggested home resales will likely weaken after rising only 0.4 percent last month. Contracts were up 1.4 percent from a year ago. The rally in stock markets could continue despite today\u2019s uncertain performance, says Chris Beauchamp at IG: February is going out on a dull note, with markets around the globe ending the month in mixed form. Europe and the UK are broadly lower, with an absence of heavyweight economic and corporate news (after all, who wants to publish data on a leap day?) adding to the general lack of direction. The real fireworks come later in the week, with China data galore and then US non-farms on Friday. As a result, some of the month\u2019s gains are being booked with an eye to buffing up returns for February. However, while this rally has been in effect for two weeks now, it doesn\u2019t really show much sign of stopping, especially since we are hitting a strong historical period for stocks. So long as everyone keeps looking for a reason for the next selloff, the default direction for the market is upwards. The performance of crude oil remains the most important element in this market, and with both Brent and WTI holding up well today there is every reason to expect more upside. Too many traders have been caught out trying to short the market over the past week or so, with little sign so far that the bounce has run its course. China will kick off the manufacturing PMI numbers for February tonight, and there could well be a big impact on market sentiment: More downbeat data from the US: The planned merger between the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche B\u00f6rse poses competition issues, according to France\u2019s economy minister Emmanuel Macron. The deal would hit smaller exchanges such as Euronext Paris. Macron told reporters (quotes courtesy Reuters): We will assess the consequences in strategic terms for Paris\u2019 financial centre. He also raised doubts about the impact of any British exit from Europe on the deal: I think we should assess the possible consequences of a Brexit on such a merger. The G20 was right to list a UK exit from the European Union as a potential risk to the global economy in its statement following last week\u2019s meeting of finance ministers in Shanghai, says Capital Economics. But the research group\u2019s chief global economist Julian Jessop said: However, the negative impacts of \u2018Brexit\u2019 are likely to be smaller than many fear, including the short-term costs to the UK itself. More speculatively, there may even be some positives for the world economy \u2013 notably the additional pressure for more growth-friendly policies in the remainder of the EU. In our view... while Brexit would have global ramifications, these should not be overstated, nor need they all be negative. For a start, we doubt the disruption to the UK economy would be as large as many fear. In particular, the uncertainties about the UK\u2019s relations with the rest of Europe could be reduced during the period of negotiations before exit actually takes place. And unlike some potential euro departures, the UK already has its own currency and would be opting to leave rather than being pushed out. The UK would surely also swiftly reassert its commitment to international organisations like NATO and to cooperation with other Western powers in areas of common geopolitical interests. What\u2019s more, even if the UK economy does initially struggle following Brexit, it only accounts for around 4% of world GDP. Indeed, some of the feared costs to the UK \u2013 such as the relocation of international companies to the Continent \u2013 would not have any net impact on the global economy... [And] it is surely inconsistent to argue \u2013 as some do \u2013 that Brexit would both be a disaster for the UK and encourage other member states to quit the EU as well. It is even possible \u2013 though perhaps only wishful thinking at this stage \u2013 that Brexit would be the catalyst for much-needed structural reform in the remainder of the EU, as well as a shift away from austerity. In this (admittedly rosy) scenario, Brexit might yet prove to be a long-term positive both for the UK and for the world economy. Meanwhile there are more signs of weakness in the US economy, with the Chicago purchasing managers index coming in lower than expected. The index fell from 55.6 in January to 47.6 in February, compared to forecasts of a figure of 53. The PMIs for the US as a whole are due on Tuesday (along with the data for Europe and the UK among others). US markets are marginally higher in early trading, helped by a rise in the oil price. Brent crude is currently up 1.9% at $35.78 a barrel on hopes that oil producers could act to stem the slide in prices. That was helped by Saudi Arabia saying in a statement that it \u201cseeks to achieve stability in the oil markets and will always remain in contact with all main producers in an attempt to limit volatility and it welcomes any co-operative action.\u201d Saudia Arabia and Russia agreed a proposal earlier this month to freeze output at January levels, but Iran is keen to increase production now sanctions against the country have been lifted and it has renewed access to export markets. Iran said on Monday it had increased exports sharply over the past month. So despite continuing worries about the global economy, notably China, and no new stimulus measures agreed by G20 finance ministers over the weekend, US markets have made a vaguely positive start, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average currently up 18 points or 0.1%. Directors at Royal Bank of Scotland must be hoping the shares have reached their bottom. Chief executive Ross McEwan and finance director Ewen Stevenson have both spent nearly \u00a3450,000 or 223p a share on buying 200,000 shares, while chairman Howard Davis has snapped up 40,000 at 222p each. So far their faith is not reaping much reward. RBS shares are currently down 0.6p at 226p. With the eurozone falling back into deflation, the odds on the European Central Bank acting at its meeting next week are growing. Time for a quick recap. Britain has been warned that the pound could slide to parity with the euro if the public votes to leave the EU. Analysts at UBS predicted that sterling would lose around 20% of its value after Brexit, but would strengthen if the Remain side win. They warned that the pound has also been hurt by the EU referendum, pushing it down to 78p to the \u20ac1. In our view, the largest part of the weakness in sterling since November can be attributed to increased concern over the possibility of exit from the EU. ... We think that the result of the referendum will be one of the UK to remain in the EU, thus our forecast is that sterling will eventually strengthen back to 73p. However, we expect some further weakness of sterling between now and the vote on 23 June. And if Britain chooses to Leave the EU, the pound would slide to parity against the euro, UBS reckons. Here\u2019s the key forecast: In other news.... China has eased monetary policy, as Beijing tries to protect its economy from a hard landing. The People\u2019s Bank of China cut the Reserve Requirement Ratio on its banks by 50 basis points (0.5 percentage points), to boost liquidity and credit availability. Economists say more will be needed, though, to cushion the economy. The former governor of the Bank of England has claimed that the eurozone is doomed to failure. In a new book, Lord Mervyn King warned that the public will revolt against mass unemployment and perpetual austerity, if policymakers try to impose closer political union to tackle its problems. He says: Monetary union has created a conflict between a centralised elite on the one hand, and the forces of democracy at the national level on the other. King also argued that Greece needs major debt relief, and a cheaper currency, to end its long economic woes. Campaigners have welcomed the move, arguing that Athens creditors must swallow reality Investors are expecting more stimulus measures from the European Central Bank, after the euro ares slipped back into deflation. Prices fell by 0.2% annually this month, the first negative move since last September. Back in the UK, Amazon has sent shivers through the supermarket sector through a new deal with Morrisons. Under the tie-up, the web giant will sell hundreds of Morrison\u2019s food products to its Amazon Prime customers. This is a fillip for Morrisons, helping the struggling group to sell more items across the UK. Its shares are up 4% so far today. But it\u2019s a blow to Ocado; shares in the online supermarket chain have slumped by 9% as the City sees Amazon eating its market share. And Tesco is also being hit - its shares have lost 2.6% today. John Ibbotson of the retail consultants, Retail Vision, says Amazon could be a serious threat to the major markets: It\u2019s now game on for the rest of the Big Four, who suddenly don\u2019t look so big after all. Tesco could soon be about to find out what it\u2019s like to be David rather than Goliath.\u201dThe problem for the Big Four is that if you pay \u00a379 a year for Amazon Prime, you get the delivery free. Amazon seems content to deliver at a loss indefinitely. Gerard Lyons, chief economic advisor to London mayor (and Brexit campaigner) Boris Johnson, is tweeting about the Chinese RRR cut too. He believes it should help the economy, but also warns it could intensify talk of a currency war (the yuan hit a three-week low when the news was announced) Philip Uglow, chief economist at MNI Indicators, suggests China was right to cut the reserve requirements on its banks today, given its weakening economy. He says: \u201cGiven the continued slowdown in the Chinese economy, it was not too surprising to see the central bank step in once again and loosen policy. The reserve requirement still remains at a relatively high level and there is plenty of room for more easing if needed. Our own survey data showed a significant weakening in February, with the MNI China Business Sentiment Indicator dipping below the all-important 50 mark. The Westpac MNI China Consumer Sentiment Indicator also turned lower in February, clouding the outlook for spending over the coming months.\u201d Britain\u2019s smaller City banks and investment companies are being spared new European rules on bonuses, designed to avoid excessive risk-taking. The UK\u2019s financial regulators have just announced that the rules, which restrict bonuses to 100% of base salary, will only be imposed on big banks and financial firms who are \u201csystemically important\u201d. In a statement, the Bank of England argues that a \u2018blanket ban\u2019 on bonuses would be counter-productive, by pushing up basic pay. Since the introduction of the bonus cap, a number of firms have markedly increased fixed pay as a percentage of total pay, whilst total pay remained stable during the same period. The PRA and FCA believe that the shift to fixed remuneration makes it more difficult for firms to adjust variable remuneration to reflect their financial health, and limits deferral arrangements that put remuneration at risk should financial or conduct risks subsequently come to light. City AM has a good early take: Smaller UK banks and investment firms will not have to abide by EU bonus cap rules \u2013 FCA and PRA And Juliet Samuel of the Wall Street Journal tweets: Money is continuing to pour into Eurozone government debt this morning. This is driving down the interest rate, or yield, on safe-haven bonds. German 10-year bunds have hit a yield of just 0.12%, a 10-month low, meaning investors are accepting virtually no return on their money. It\u2019s another sign of pessimism in the markets, with investors primarily worried about keeping their money safe rather than growing it. Debt campaigners have welcomed Mervyn King\u2019s warning that a \u201csignificant proportion\u201d of Greece\u2019s debts must be written off. But Tim Jones, economist at the Jubilee Debt Campaign, also warns that the current proposals for debt relief fall short: \u201cLord King\u2019s comments are yet another acknowledgment that Greece needs substantial debt cancellation, both for its own recovery, and the wider European economy. Yet even if implemented, the current discussions on debt relief for Greece would not reduce payments for at least 15 years, and would leave them 10 times higher than Germany was paying after it had substantial debt cancellation in 1953.\u201d It takes more than a global market rout to alarm Warren Buffett. The billionaire US investor is sounding remarkably relaxed this morning, as he appears on CNBC. Buffett has revealed that his Berkshire Hathaway fund has been buying shares in 2016, despite the heavy falls on some markets. According to the 85-year old, \u201cnot much\u201d happened in the markets recently. He\u2019s also expecting the \u201cpositive effects of low oil prices\u201d to help the world economy in the months ahead. \u201cNot much\u201d is an interesting way of summing up the recent market moves. So far this year, the Nasdaq has lost 7.8% of its value while the Dow Jones Industrial average is off 5%. Across the globe, the German DAX has lost 12% and Japan\u2019s Nikkei has shed almost 16%. But Buffett made his name, and his fortune, by buying and holding stocks, so he knows what he\u2019s doing..... Today\u2019s surprise cut in China\u2019s Reserve Requirement Ratio will help stabilise the Chinese financial system, says Duncan Innes-Ker of the Economist Intelligence Unit. But it isn\u2019t enough on its own, he adds: \u201cThe latest cut in the RRR shows the central bank straining to maintain loose monetary conditions in a difficult economic climate. The move will partly offset the effects of capital outflows from China and the provisioning requirements that are forcing banks to lock up more funds as non-performing loans climb. However, the surge in loans in January highlighted concerns that bank lending may be spiralling out of control. Ultimately, China\u2019s economy cannot grow on credit alone. It needs further reforms to unlock productivity growth.\u201d Nordea analyst Aurelija Augulyte reckons China has the capacity to do more, given it still holds over $3trn of foreign exchange reserves: Today\u2019s in deflation figures also show that the ECB\u2019s existing stimulus programme hasn\u2019t actually worked yet. The ECB is buying \u20ac60bn of assets each month, widening its balance sheet, but having little obvious impact on the consumer prices index (CPI) The eurozone\u2019s lurch back into deflation means Mario Draghi is certain to announce new measures to stimulate the European economy in two week\u2019s time. So argues Teunis Brosens of ING, who writes: The weakening of core inflation shows the real and present danger that cheap oil will cause low inflation to become ingrained in Eurozone price and wage dynamics. This is especially bad for debt-laden households, businesses and governments in Southern Europe, which will have little scope to \u201cinflate away\u201d their debt burden by increasing nominal wages. Today\u2019s weak core inflation gives doves the upper hand at next week\u2019s ECB-meeting and therefore pretty much seals the deal on additional monetary easing. In another alarming sign, the eurozone has slumped back into deflation for the first time in five months. Prices across the single currency region fell by 0.2% in February, according to data just released by Eurostat. That\u2019s worse than expected, and is the first negative inflation reading since September. Energy prices were the main factor, but price pressures in other areas of the economy were also weak. Core inflation, which strips out volatile elements such as food and fuel, dropped to just 0.7% from 1% in January. It raises the pressure on the European Central Bank to ease monetary policy again at its March meeting. The Chinese central bank says it cut the RRR rate, to guarantee \u201cample liquidity\u201d in the financial sector, and to encourage \u201cappropriate growth\u201d in the credit market. The 50bp cut lowers the Reserve Requirement Ratio to 17%, meaning banks need to hold fewer assets in reserve and can offer cheaper credit. A lower RRR will give Chinese banks the leeway to lower borrowing costs, and to make more money available to domestic companies and borrowers. Breaking news from China! The People\u2019s Bank of China has just eased monetary policy, by cutting the RRR - or Reserve Rate Requirement. Swiss bank UBS has just piled into the Brexit debate, saying there is a 40% chance that Britain will vote to leave the EU in June. In a new report, UBS predicts that sterling would be hit hard if Britain left the EU. It estimates that the pound would hit parity with the euro, which would help UK exporters but make trips to the continent much pricier. Currently, sterling is trading around \u20ac1.27, meaning one euro is worth roughly 78p. UBS reckons it will weaken to around 84p by June, and could then either sharply recover, or weaken, depending on the result. That\u2019s an interesting call from UBS. Other analysts have predicted that the euro would also be hit by Brexit - as it would raise new fears over the future of the eurozone. Here\u2019s a flavour of UBS\u2019s report: A date for referendum is set and the pound is getting pounded The United Kingdom reached an agreement with the European Union and the UK announced that the referendum vote will take place on 23 June 2016 (see \u201cBrexit: An ever closer referendum\u201d). We map out where the pound could go in the event of a \u201cBrexit\u201d, how much of a rebound is likely with a vote to \u201cRemain\u201d, and the potential for further currency weakness between now and June. What happens to EUR/GBP if the UK votes to stay in the European Union? We think that EUR/GBP should revert to the 0.73 level, near which it spent most of last year. In our view, the largest part of the weakness in sterling since November can be attributed to increased concern over the possibility of exit from the EU. What happens to EUR/GBP if the UK votes to leave (\u201cBrexit\u201d)? We estimate the exchange rate level that would accommodate a sharp correction in the UK\u2019s current account deficit and find that EUR/GBP could go to parity. What probabilities do we assign to each outcome? We assign a 60% probability to the UK staying in the EU and up to 40% probability of a vote to leave, as we have argued previously based on published opinion polls. Our baseline forecast is 0.73 for the end of 2016 We think that the result of the referendum will be one of the UK to remain in the EU, thus our forecast is that sterling will eventually strengthen back to 0.73. However, we expect some further weakness of sterling between now and the vote on 23 June. But a vote to leave would push EUR/GBP to 1.00 The price action so far makes it clear that sterling would weaken in the event of an exit vote. We think that the market would re-price to parity \u2013 and to the extent that it could accommodate a shift in the current account by 2.7% of GDP. Breaking: UK mortgage approvals have hit their highest level in two years. A total of 74,600 new home loans were approved last month, implying that the British housing market remains pretty robust. Here\u2019s a jaw-dropping fact -- China is planning to lay off almost two million workers from its coal and steel industry. It\u2019s part of Beijing\u2019s attempts to cut capacity in the sector in response to slowing demand, and to rebalance the wider economy towards consumption. Reuters has the details: Yin Weimin, the minister for human resources and social security, told a news conference on Monday that 1.3 million workers in the coal sector could lose their jobs, plus 500,000 from the steel sector. China\u2019s coal and steel sectors employ about 12 million workers, according to data published by the National Bureau of Statistics. \u201cThis involves the resettlement of a total of 1.8 million workers. This task will be very difficult, but we are still very confident,\u201d Yin said.... European stock markets have opened lower, amid disappointment that the world\u2019s top finance ministers didn\u2019t announce any concrete measures at their meeting last week. In London, the FTSE 100 has shed 38 points, or 0.6%, to 6057 points. The French and German markets are down around 0.9%, following moderate losses in Asia overnight which clocked 1% off Japan\u2019s Nikkei. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, sums up the mood: Markets are kicking off the last trading day of February on a rather downbeat note with the weekend\u2019s G20 meeting of finance ministers in Shanghai almost appearing to have muddied the waters, rather than provided any clarity. Policymakers appear to be in agreement that they need to act in a coordinated manner, but given the reactions we\u2019ve seen so far, that certainly doesn\u2019t appear to be the case. The G20 meeting ended with a communique which warned that the global recovery was \u201cuneven\u201d and failing to deliver \u201cstrong, sustainable and balanced growth\u201d. But in terms of action, it only committed to \u201cfurther enhancing the structural reform agenda\u201d They also warned against Britain leaving the European Union. But as the Guardian reported yesterday, that was added on the insistence of the UK government..... Mervyn King also warns that Greece needs debt relief and a cheaper currency: As he puts it: It is evident, as it has been for a very long while, that the only way forward for Greece is to default on (or be forgiven) a substantial proportion of its debt burden and to devalue its currency so that exports and the substitution of domestic products for imports can compensate for the depressing effects of the fiscal contraction imposed to date. Athens was promised some debt relief as part of its third bailout, agreed last summer. But those talks are on ice right now, as negotiations with its lenders over implementation of the package continue to grind slowly onwards. The Chinese stock market has closed at its lowest level in a month, as fears over the global economy dogged trading floors again. At one stage, the Shanghai Composite was heading for a 15-month low, before finishing down 2.8%. Ray Attrill of National Australia Bank blamed the lack of firm action at last weekend\u2019s G20 meeting: He told Bloomberg: [Finance ministers delivered an]....admission of downside growth risks but no tangible commitments to fiscal policy action in particular to bolster growth in the short term\u201d As a devoted Aston Villa fan, Lord Mervyn King must have relegation on the brain right now. In his new book, the BoE governor suggests that the eurozone missed a trick in 2012 by now allowing struggling eurozone members to be \u201ctemporarily\u201d shunted down to a lower tier. Then they could have won promotion again once they had established closer convergence with their stronger neighbours. Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble apparently proposed this to Greece last summer -- but the idea was rejected. The big fear (as many football fans can attest), is that once you\u2019re relegated, there\u2019s no guarantee of getting back. And \u2018relegation\u2019 could also encourage traders to force weaker members out of the euro. Duncan Weldon, head of research at Resolution Group, agrees: Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, the Telegraph\u2019s international business editor, reckons King\u2019s intervention is very significant. Otmar Issing was Germany\u2019s representative on the European Central Bank\u2019s governing council, and thus an influential voice . Lord King also suggests that Germany, rather than Greece, might pull the trigger on the eurozone. He writes: Germany faces a terrible choice. Should it support the weaker brethren in the euro area at great and unending cost to its taxpayers, or should it call a halt to the project of monetary union across the whole of Europe? The attempt to find a middle course is not working. One day, German voters may rebel against the losses imposed on them by the need to support their weaker brethren, and undoubtedly the easiest way to divide the euro area would be for Germany itself to exit. Mervyn King, the former governor of the Bank of England, has fired a fierce broadside at the eurozone - claiming the single currency block may be doomed. In a new book, the man who steered Britain\u2019s central bank through (and into) the financial crisis warned that the tensions within eurozone - and the huge debts piled up by struggling members such as Greece - can never be fully resolved. Crucially, King also argues that any moves to harden up the single currency could also backfire. Closer political union (which would make it easier to forgive Greece\u2019s debts) will actually inflame popular anger against the eurozone project. As he puts it: \u201cMonetary union has created a conflict between a centralised elite on the one hand, and the forces of democracy at the national level on the other. This is extraordinarily dangerous.\u201d Breaking up the 18-member strong union may be the only way to allow Europe\u2019s struggling Southern states to regain competitiveness. Here\u2019s more from King, via the Daily Telegraph (who have the serialisation rights): The more likely cause of a break- up of the euro area is that voters in the south will tire of the grinding and relentless burden of mass unemployment and the emigration of talented young people. The counter-argument \u2013 that exit from the euro area would lead to chaos, falls in living standards and continuing uncertainty about the survival of the currency union \u2013 has real weight. If the members of the euro decide to hang together, the burden of servicing external debts may become too great to remain consistent with political stability. But if the alternative is crushing austerity, continuing mass unemployment, and no end in sight to the burden of debt, then leaving the euro area may be the only way to plot a route back to economic growth and full employment. The long-term benefits outweigh the short-term costs. Outsiders cannot make that choice, but they can encourage Germany, and the rest of the euro area, to face up to it. If the members of the euro decide to hang together, the burden of servicing external debts may become too great to remain consistent with political stability. As John Maynard Keynes wrote in 1922, \u201cIt is foolish\u2026 to suppose that any means exist by which one modern nation can exact from another an annual tribute continuing over many years.\u201d Here\u2019s the full piece: Daily Telegraph: Lord Mervyn King: \u2018Forgive them their debts\u2019 is not the answer Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It may be February 29th, but investors aren\u2019t exactly leaping for joy this morning. Asian markets are falling, and European bourses are likely to follow suit. Several issues dominate the trading floors right now, including: The state of the global economy, with China\u2019s weaknesses threatening a wider slowdown. Angst over the US elections. Donald Trump\u2019s success at the Republican caucuses is alarming many observers, while Wall Street fears that Bernie Sanders\u2019 has put inequality firmly in the spotlight. The eurozone: The refugee crisis is piling new stress on the region, with inflation still worryingly weak The Brexit question, with polls suggesting the EU referendum on June 23 could be close. Worries about negative interest rates, and fears that central bankers are running out of ammo. But despite these fears, finance ministers didn\u2019t agree any new measures at their G20 meeting last weekend. And for some investors, that\u2019s a decent reason to keep out of the markets...or cut their holdings. Coming up this morning... There\u2019s not much on the agenda, but we do get fresh eurozone inflation data at 10am GMT. That is expected to show a further weakening in price pressures, with the consumer prices index tipped to drop to 0% from 0.3% in January. And at 9.30, the latest UK consumer credit and mortgage lending figure are out.",

But it would not be enough on its own. \u201cThe latest cut in the RRR shows the central bank straining to maintain loose monetary conditions in a difficult economic climate,\u201d he said. \u201cThe move will partly offset the effects of capital outflows from China and the provisioning requirements that are forcing banks to lock up more funds as non-performing loans climb. \u201cHowever, the surge in loans in January highlighted concerns that bank lending may be spiralling out of control. Ultimately, China\u2019s economy cannot grow on credit alone. It needs further reforms to unlock productivity growth.\u201d A series of interventions by policymakers, including interest rate cuts, have done little to revive growth in China, which at 6.9% last year was its slowest rate for 25 years. In some cases such moves have served only to heighten concern about the country\u2019s challenges. There have been six interest rate cuts since November 2014 and Beijing has also resorted to a variety of other methods to encourage growth and expand credit, such as increasing bank liquidity and massaging reserve requirements. The latest cut to the RRR is the fifth in a year. Philip Uglow, chief economist at the financial data firm MNI Indicators, said further cuts could lie ahead. \u201cGiven the continued slowdown in the Chinese economy, it was not too surprising to see the central bank step in once again and loosen policy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reserve requirement still remains at a relatively high level and there is plenty of room for more easing if needed.\u201d",
