Within a year, forward guidance had to be dropped, replaced with a far more vague set of promises some nicknamed \u201cfuzzy guidance\u201d.</p> <p>Not to be deterred, Mr Carney started to drop hints about when the first rise in rates would come. In a speech at the Mansion House in 2014 he signalled that rates would go up sooner than markets expected (which meant within a year). That was wrong.</p> <p>Last summer he predicted the decision to raise rates would come into sharper relief \u201cat the turn of the year\u201d. That was wrong. Well, unless you\u2019re being very literal indeed and think it could also entail not raising rates.</p> <p>The one prediction he has stuck to that had, up until now, looked pretty uncontroversial was that the next move in rates would be up rather than down.

                "bodyText":"One last thing...The London stock market outperformed its French and German rivals today, to finish 61 points higher, or 1%, at 5898. Mining shares led the way, with Anglo American surging by 19%, Glencore gaining 15% and Antofagasta jumping by 14%. That followed the sudden weakening in the US dollar, as Wall Street and the City anticipated that US interest rates would not rise much this year, given recent weak data. A cheaper dollar pushes up commodity prices, while looser monetary policy should be good for growth. Welcome news for miners, who had a torrid 2015. Mining stocks have also been heavily shorted by hedge funds, so those bears will have been squeezed by the rising share prices. Good night. GW A late PS... Larry Elliott, our economics editor, has summed up the message from the Bank of England today. Here\u2019s his conclusion: There are three conclusions to be drawn from the inflation report, the minutes and the governor\u2019s letter. The first is that it would now be a major surprise if interest rates rose this year. The second is that the Bank\u2019s credibility has been dented by its failure to call the economy right and the confused messages it has been sending out to the public. Finally, the prospect of 0.5% interest rates extending into an eighth and perhaps a ninth year risks stoking up a housing boom. The Bank has so-called macroprudential tools that can be deployed to cool down the property market without damaging the rest of the economy. It is going to need them. And finally, a couple of photos from today\u2019s press conference just landed: Ouch. The latest economic data from America is a reminder of why the Bank of England is worried about the global economy. US factory orders shrank by 2.9% in December, according to new data - the biggest drop since the end of 2014. Being criticised by journalists is an occupational hazard in central banking, but Mark Carney doesn\u2019t appear to enjoy it. So he may not particularly like this analysis of today\u2019s inflation report, from Sky News\u2019s Ed Conway. Mr Carney\u2019s problem is that every time he makes a big forecast he seems to get it wrong. When he came into office, the Governor brought with him a whizzy new framework for setting UK interest rates. Under \u201cforward guidance\u201d, he would provide clarity about borrowing costs. He promised, based on the Bank\u2019s forecasts, that he and the Monetary Policy Committee would start to consider lifting them only when unemployment dropped beneath 7%. Suddenly, within a few months, the jobless rate, hitherto stuck stubbornly above that level, started to come down. Within a year, forward guidance had to be dropped, replaced with a far more vague set of promises some nicknamed \u201cfuzzy guidance\u201d. Not to be deterred, Mr Carney started to drop hints about when the first rise in rates would come. In a speech at the Mansion House in 2014 he signalled that rates would go up sooner than markets expected (which meant within a year). That was wrong. Last summer he predicted the decision to raise rates would come into sharper relief \u201cat the turn of the year\u201d. That was wrong. Well, unless you\u2019re being very literal indeed and think it could also entail not raising rates. The one prediction he has stuck to that had, up until now, looked pretty uncontroversial was that the next move in rates would be up rather than down. But, in the past few weeks even that has now come into question.... More here: The Independent\u2019s Ben Chu flags up one curious moment in today\u2019s press conference: That\u2019s a bit odd, as you might expect inflation to take off sharpish once spare capacity in the labour market has been sucked up. As, indeed, a former Bank deputy governor pointed out: Today was dubbed \u201cSuper Thursday\u201d, but it was more like \u201cParty pooper Thursday\u201d as the Bank of England cut its growth forecasts. Savers, who might wonder when they might get a higher interest rate, won\u2019t be feeling particularly super, either. Rohan Sivajoti, advisory services director at financial advisor eVestor, says: \u201cWith a unanimous vote to keep interest rates unchanged, a mediocre global economic outlook and growing deflation fears, \u2018Super Thursday\u2019 has proved to be anything but. \u201cBeleaguered savers, who yet again will be inwardly groaning at the news, may also be resigned to the fact that they have limited options at present. However, now more than ever, savers need to make their investments work harder for them. Those looking to secure their financial future, should review deposits and options for investments and look at reducing debt while it is still relatively cheap to do so.\u201d There was quite a contrast between Mark Carney\u2019s performance at the press conference, and the minutes of this week\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee meeting released at noon. Kallum Pickering, senior UK economist at Berenberg Bank, says the MPC are clearly worried. The MPC cautioned on risk from financial market volatility, slowing global growth and now the EU referendum. The committee noted that since the previous report other central banks including the European Central Bank had eased further, oil prices had fallen and financial market volatility had risen. This was linked to developments in China and other emerging markets and had \u2018coloured\u2019 the outlook for the global economy Stephanie Flanders, JP Morgan\u2019s chief market strategist for Europe (and former BBC economics editor), says weak wage growth could scupper a rate hike this year. She writes: The bottom line of today\u2019s report is that the UK cannot ignore the weakening of global growth prospects \u2013 particularly the weakness of global trade \u2013 and neither can the Bank of England. But domestic consumption is driving the recovery in the UK and the US and the Bank of England can see little reason to expect domestic consumption to grind to a halt. On balance, we still expect the US Federal Reserve to raise rates again over the course of 2016 as recession worries recede and sentiment in emerging market economics starts to stabilise. In that environment, we would expect the Bank of England also to raise rates by the end of 2016. However, much will depend on domestic wage pressures, which look somewhat weaker now than they did 6 months ago. Whatever happens, the high level of UK household debt \u2013 much of it borrowed on adjustable or semi-adjustable mortgages \u2013 underscores that the rate increases that do happen will be gradual and modest relative to past cycles.\u201c Back in 2014, Mark Carney was labelled the \u201cunreliable boyfriend\u201d for giving mixed messages about possible rate rise timings. Today, it felt like the governor was playing a defensive husband, denying that he ever misled the public while insisting that he\u2019ll still raise rates at the right time. Anyway, a quick recap: The prospects of an early UK interest rate rise have receded, after the Bank of England left borrowing costs at a record low of just 0.5%. The Monetary Policy Committee voted 9-0 to leave rates at 0.5%, with noted hawk Ian McCafferty abandoning his calls for a rise. The BoE has slashed its growth forecasts. It now expects GDP to rise by just 2.2% this year, not 2.5%, as Britain is hit by the weakening global economy. Mark Carney has insisted that interest rates are still more likely to rise, than fall. The governor faced down a sceptical press pack in London, who reminded the governor that his previous forward guidance on the path of interest rises has proved somewhat unreliable. Asked if he sticks to his previous prediction that the next move will be upwards, he declared \u201cAbsolutely. The whole MPC stands by that.\u201d Carney also rejected criticism for telling households recently that interest rates were \u201cmore likely than not\u201d to rise in 2016. He said his original forward guidance, that rates would stay on hold until the economy improved, had given businesses and households confidence. We are not going to tie our hands ever to raise interest rates or adjust policy in any way, shape or form to a certain date.\u201d Governor Carney warned that problems in the global economy could hurt Britain, saying: The outlook for trade is particularly challenging, with net exports expected to drag on UK growth over the forecast period. But he tried to play down the idea that Britain could follow Japan and the Eurozone into imposing negative interest rates. Carney said a rate cut hasn\u2019t even been discussed at this week\u2019s MPC meeting, but the committee does keep its tools under review. And asked about the EU referendum, Carney said the Brexit risk has had some impact on the pound. \u201cThere is not yet a big risk premium built into business and household confidence around the referendum. We do see in th eexchange rate market, and it\u2019s observed in the report, that there has been some buying of protection if you will, around the referendum.\u201d That\u2019s the end of the press conference. The press pack are scrambling back to their newsrooms, and Mark Carney has headed back to his office to keep the monetary wheels in motion. I\u2019ll pull together a summary shortly. Q: Negative interest rates are now in place in Japan, the eurozone, and Switzerland, so are they within the Bank\u2019s toolkit? Carney replies that the bank thinks interest rates are \u201cnot at the lower bound\u201d - in other words, they could be cut further. We will review our toolkit, he continues. But we have not discussed negative rates, as monetary policy is pointing in a different direction. He reminds the reporters that they saw the minutes of this month\u2019s MPC meeting, while they were locked in a room \u201cbeing treated pretty badly and forced to read a bunch of documents\u201d*. Those minutes show that negative interest rates weren\u2019t discussed. You\u2019ll know when they are... [* - don\u2019t worry, they probably get drinks and biscuits too] Another questions about Brexit -- what contingency plans have the BoE taken? Carney declines to reveal any details, but suggests that - like with the 2014 Scottish referendum - the Bank will reveal its homework after the event. Q: Are you worried, governor, that you might go through your entire tenure at the Bank without raising interest rates? Carney insist he\u2019s relaxed about this prospect. He points out that former policymaker David Miles did two terms without raising interest rates, but did plenty of other things such as quantitative easing. The important thing is that we set policy to maximise the changes that we meet our objectives. That\u2019s how we\u2019re going to be judged. Q: How worried is the Bank of England about the global economy? We do see some downside risks, Carney replies. Britain is a particularly open economy, so it\u2019s very vulnerable to global problems. That\u2019s why the Bank of England usually has lower growth forecast than other bodies, such as the IMF. He cites market fears over China, and its knock-on impact on other emerging markets. And monetary policy could tighten more quickly, if those upside risks develop. Q: When does low inflation start to become a worry for the Bank? Carney bats this question over to Ben Broadbent. Broadbent says there\u2019s \u201cno simple level when it becomes an over-riding concern\u201d, but the bank is watching wages closely for signs that inflation is weakening. Now deputy governor Ben Broadbent takes the microphone, insisting that there\u2019s no \u2018mechanical link\u2019 between the UK output gap and any interest rate move. You might remember that the output gap was one measure cited by Mark Carney in 2014, when he took his second stab at setting forward guidance on interest rates. So, it\u2019s still a factor, but don\u2019t expect it to trigger an interest rate hike. We won\u2019t be \u201cbound by past comments\u201d when we decide it\u2019s time to raise interest rates, says Carney. He also denies that his forward guidance, various speeches, and wotnot have caused volatility. Short-term UK interest rates are half as volatile as before he was parachuted into the BoE City experts aren\u2019t very impressed with Mark Carney\u2019s performance, as he tries to talk down the Brexit risk and talk up the chances of an interest rate hike: Our economics editor Larry Elliott asks Carney when the decision about rate rises will come into \u201csharper focus\u201d again. Carney denies that the MPC are looking at monetary policy through bleary eyes. We take a decision at every meeting. This week\u2019s decision was \u201ceasy\u201d, though. Carney gets a question about the European Union referendum. He says the Bank of England isn\u2019t modelling for \u2018parallel universes\u201d, so today\u2019s report doesn\u2019t estimate the impact of Brexit. He argues that there isn\u2019t yet a \u201cbig risk premium\u201d due to the possibility of Britain leaving the EU. However, there has been some impact on the pound as investors seek protection ahead of the referendum. Mark Carney is trying to argue that the financial markets are underpricing the chances of a UK interest rate rise. Paul Diggle, economist at Aberdeen Asset Management, isn\u2019t sure Carney\u2019s message will get through: The Bank did send a signal that they think the market is wrong about when it thinks rates will rise. Investors think the first rate rise won\u2019t come until February 2018 and the Bank has tried to say they should bet on it coming sooner. But the way they send this signal is so opaque \u2013 a couple of graphs buried in chapter 5 of the Inflation Report - it\u2019s not really clear whether anyone will pay attention. Carney\u2019s forward guidance certainly hasn\u2019t paid dividends for investors up until now.\u201d Carney is now warning that there could be more slack in the labour market than first thought. That would mean wage growth might be disappointing (as firms wouldn\u2019t have to fight for workers as much), meaning inflation remains weak. But he also points to the introduction of the national living wage, which should raise inflation a bit. (from April, workers in the UK aged over 25 earning the minimum rate of \u00a36.70 per hour will get a 50p per hour increase). Q: Do you think the public gives your advice as much credibility as it used to, given previous guidance on rates? Carney gives a long answer, defending his original forward guidance (he originally set a 7% jobless rate as a key target before considering a rate rise, only to backtrack when it was achieved sooner than planned). The worst thing we can say about that guidance is that more people went to work earlier - and we\u2019re not going to apologise for that, Carney smiles. And he\u2019s also happy that UK households believe rates may rise this year, as it means they are less likely to risk a credit splurge. Although households have made \u201cgreat progress\u201d, they are still pretty indebted. Carney insists, though, that the MPC will never \u201ctie its hands\u201d to changing monetary policy at a certain time, or at certain events. And in short, we have nothing to explain, he concludes -- a classic central banker\u2019s answer to criticism. Onto questions: Q: Does Mark Carney still believe interest rate are more likely to rise, rather than fall? Absolutely, the governor replies, and so does the monetary policy committee. He reiterates that the market path of rates implies that inflation will overshoot the 2% target in the medium term unless borrowing costs are hiked. Interest rates are more likely than not to rise during the forecast horizon, says Carney. He points to the current \u201cmarket path\u201d for interest rates (where investors expect borrowing costs to be). On that path, inflation will hit its 2% target in the medium term, and then rise higher, meaning higher borrowing costs will be needed. And Carney insists: We\u2019ll do the right thing at the right time, on rates. Katie is tweeting the key points from Carney\u2019s press conference: Carney says the Bank of England expects real incomes in the UK to grow solidly this year, after several lean years. And business investment should also continue to grow strongly. Carney then warns that global financial conditions have deteriorated notably recently, with a \u201cparticularly challenging\u201d outlook for trade. That means Britain\u2019s net exports will continue to drag on growth (ie, we\u2019ll import more than we sell to the rest of the world) The governor of the Bank of England is giving a press conference now, to discuss the quarterly inflation report. Mark Carney begins by saying that the UK economy is in much better shape than in March 2009 when rates were first cut to 0.5%. Seven years ago, the economy was in serious trouble at the height of the financial crisis, and heading into recession. Today, we have sluggish global growth, turbulent financial markets, and a resilient UK economy. And that\u2019s why the Bank still expects the UK economy to keep growing. The prospect of UK interest rates being cut to a new record low is looming over the City: It\u2019s staggering to think that UK interest rates have now been pegged at 0.5% for almost seven years (it started in the dark days of March 2009) Laith Khalaf, Senior Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says we could see a decade of ultra-low rates: \u2018An interest rate rise is like the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, the nearer you get to it, the further away it moves. A rise in rates now looks firmly in the long grass, with growth forecasts cut and cheaper oil putting downward pressure on inflation, which is already way below the Bank of England\u2019s target. Markets are currently pricing in a rate rise in the middle of 2017, though they have been consistently premature in their forecasts, and reaching the dubious milestone of a decade of ultra-low interest rates is now a distinct possibility. The prospect of an early UK interest rate rise has receded into the distance, writes Katie Allen from the Bank of England. She reports: The Bank flagged the recent sharp sell-off in global stock markets and investors\u2019 jitters about a slowdown in China as it revealed that policymaker Ian McCafferty dropped his recent call for a rate rise. He had voted against the eight other members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) since last August but this month agreed with his colleagues that it was too soon to raise interest rates from 0.5%, where they have been for almost seven years. Wage growth has been weaker than the MPC had been expecting and minutes to its latest policy meeting suggested it was cautious about predicting any significant pick-up in pay over coming months. \u201cAgainst that backdrop, all members of the committee thought that maintaining the current stance of policy was appropriate at this meeting,\u201d the minutes said. Here\u2019s Katie\u2019s full story: The pound has fallen almost half a cent against the US dollar, to $1.456. Markets are concluding that interest rates won\u2019t move for some time, given today\u2019s gloomy inflation report and the news that Ian McCafferty has given up calling for a rate hike. The Inflation report is online here, and full of interesting charts if you like that kind of thing. This one shows how the oil price has fallen much further than the Bank expected: And this shows how the markets are already expecting interest rates to stay lower, for longer. This chart shows how the Bank of England has cut its growth forecasts for the next three years (the old forecasts are in brackets after the new ones) And the message from the BoE is that economic conditions have deteriorated over the last quarter: Since the November Report, global output and trade growth have slowed further and the latest data suggest a softer picture for UK activity in 2015 than previously assumed, with four-quarter growth slowing to 2\u00bc% by Q4 on the MPC\u2019s backcast. The Bank of England also points to the turmoil in the financial markets: Developments in financial markets seem in part to reflect greater weight being placed on the risks to the global outlook stemming from China and other emerging economies. The Bank of England has also taken a knife to its growth forecasts, admitting that the UK economy is not expanding as fast as expected. It now expects GDP to rise by just 2.2% this year, down from 2.5% three months ago. And for 2017, it has cut its growth forecast to 2.3%, down from 2.6%. The Bank of England says that economic conditions have deteriorated in the last three since its November quarterly inflation report: Global growth has fallen back further over the past three months, as emerging economies have generally continued to slow and as the US economy has grown by less than expected. There have also been considerable falls in the prices of risky assets and another significant fall in oil prices. The 9-0 vote means that Ian McCafferty has abandoned his calls for interest rates to rise. He had been the lone hawk on the MPC, arguing that borrowing costs should go up now before inflation took hold. But with oil so cheap, and growth weakening around the globe, he\u2019s had a rethink. Breaking: The Bank of England has voted to leave UK interest rates at their current record low of 0.5%. And the decision was unanimous, with the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee voting 9-0 not to alter borrowing costs. We have less than 30 minutes to go until Bank of England announces its interest rate decision, at noon in London. It will also release its latest quarterly inflation report, with new forecasts for growth and inflation. And half an hour after that, Mark Carney will hold a press conference to discuss the report. This is the third \u201cSuper Thursday\u201d -- but frankly, the first two haven\u2019t lived up to this billing, thanks to the lack of pressure to raise interest rates and the mediocre global economic outlook. Alastair McCaig of IG reckons it needs rebanding: How the department overseeing the trade descriptions act have not intervened in the use of the term \u2018Super Thursday\u2019 when the Bank of England posts its inflation report and interest rate decision, is somewhat baffling. Anyway, the smart money is on another \u2018no change\u2019 in interest rates, followed by plenty of questions about the darkening global outlook, deflation fears, and whether Britain could follow Japan and the eurozone into imposing negative interest rates. Ed Conway, writing for Sky News today, points out that borrowing costs could be cut this year. Households should prepare themselves for a possible UK interest rate cut this year, with investors betting that there is now a greater chance that the next move in borrowing costs is down not up. Money markets are now putting a one-in-four probability on the Bank of England reducing its official rates below the 0.5% level they have been sitting at since 2009. It follows a dramatic shift in their expectations for interest rates. For the majority of the post-crisis recovery, markets were betting that 0.5% would be the floor for borrowing costs, which would rise in the coming years. Now they are not pricing in a full increase in Bank rate until August 2018 - two months after Mark Carney\u2019s five year term as Bank Governor is due to end... Back in Brussels, Pierre Moscovici has explained that his latest forecasts don\u2019t factor in the prospect of Britain\u2019s leaving the EU. Why not? Because everyone\u2019s committed to avoiding such an outcome. Moscovici has also defended the EC\u2019s more rosy forecasts for Greece (well, less gloomy, anyway): Shares in London have been lurching around like a well-refreshed journalist leaving The Inkwell after last orders (I imagine). After jumping almost 90 points at the open, the FTSE 100 index slowly subsided until it was only up 20 points, before getting a second wind and romping ahead again. Mining companies are still leading the way, with Anglo American leaping by 11%, BHP Billiton gaining 8% and Antofagasta up 7.5%. It makes for a tricky morning for traders: So why the wild lurches? Investors are trying to decide how much optimism to take from the rally in the oil price, and the sudden weakness in the US dollar. This could mean that the turmoil in the commodity market is reaching a bottom, especially if the US Federal Reserve is backing away from raising American interest rates several times this year. The City is also waiting for the Bank of England to deliver its quarterly inflation report, in an hour\u2019s time. Ilya Spivak, currency strategist, at DailyFX, says markets expect a \u201cdovish outcome\u201d. Traders are currently pricing in a 64% chance that rates remain unchanged over the next year, and a 36% probability that rates are cut to 0.25%, he adds. Commissioner Pierre Moscovici is briefing the media now, about the EC\u2019s new economic forecasts. My colleague Jennifer Rankin is tweeting the key points: I can\u2019t believe *anyone* is euphoric, given the last few years. But do carry on, Pierre... The FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel is also ferreting out some important facts: Despite those headwinds from China and refugees, the European economy is now entering its fourth year of recovery, says the EC. Today\u2019s report states: Growth continues at a moderate rate, driven mainly by consumption. At the same time, much of the world economy is grappling with major challenges and risks to European growth are therefore increasing. A flurry of news is flying our way from Brussels, as the European Commission releases its new economic forecasts. The headline event is that the EC has slashed its forecast for inflation this year to just 0.5%, from 1% three months ago. That\u2019s partly because of the oil price, and also because \u201cwage growth remains subdued\u201d. It has also trimmed its growth forecast for 2016 to 1.7%, down from an earlier forecast of 1.8%. The EC still expects eurozone GDP to rise by 1.9% in 2017, as the slow recovery picks up pace (a little). The Commission blames problems in emerging markets, and also points to the refugee crisis. Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis warns: Europe\u2019s moderate growth is facing increasing headwinds, from slower growth in emerging markets such as China, to weak global trade and geopolitical tensions in Europe\u2019s neighbourhood.\u201d The EC has also revised up its Greek forecasts, saying the economy didn\u2019t actually contract in 2015. It also expects a smaller recession this year. Greece is in the grips of a general strike today as demonstrators renew their protests against the country\u2019s latest bailout deal. Transport links are shut down, shops are closed, and thousands of people are marching through the Greek capital right now. Our Athens correspondent, Helena Smith, reports that the effects are withering. She writes: This is the fifth general strike since the leftist Syriza first came to power but none has been so fully endorsed. In a reflection of the growing anger at all embracing tax and pension reforms, the entire country appears to be paralysed by industrial action supported by every walk of life. In Athens, where almost nothing is open, streets and central boulevards resembled a ghost town this morning with the shutters down on shops, offices and ministerial buildings. Small businesses, which usually turn a blind eye to the pleas of unionists to stay closed, have today heeded their call. \u201cWe have no choice,\u201d said Lakis Antonakis who owns the popular Piazza Duomo caf\u00e9 opposite the capital\u2019s cathedral. \u201cIf they pass these laws more than 50 percent of our earnings will be taxed and I am one of the lucky ones because I can depend on tourists. Other businesses are really struggling. It\u2019s become unsustainable to keep them open. Everyone is very pessimistic.\u201d Unionists, who planned mass protest rallies, attributed the high turn out to the determination of Greeks to ram home the message that they will not accept pension and tax reforms as they now stand. International creditors, led by the IMF, are pushing prime minister Alexis Tsipras for further cuts in pensions to make up for a fiscal shortfall of up to \u20ac4.5bn over the next three years. Grigoris Kalomoiris, of the civil servants union, Adedy, said he also thought Greeks had been encouraged by protesting farmers who have set up roadblocks nationwide. \u201cTheir action over the past two weeks has had a ripple effect. Everything is close even the state audit office,\u201d he told me. \u201cFarmers are leading the way. People are very determined to stop this pillaging because pillaging is what it is. Greece and Greeks cannot go on being pushed like this in the name of debt.\u201d The strike, ironically, has the full support of Syriza \u2013 although government officials, who will soon be called to vote on the reforms, are keeping mum. Apparently the solution to monetary policy paralysis is taller central bank governors: You might have expected the euro to fall this morning, after Mario Draghi guilefully declared that central banks shouldn\u2019t stop taking action to fight deflation. But the single currency didn\u2019t take the hint. Instead, the euro has hit a three-month high against the US dollar, at $1.116. And that\u2019s starting to weigh on European markets, pushing shares down from their earlier highs.... Sales of Volkswagen cars slumped by almost 14% in the UK last month, suggesting that the company is still suffering from the emissions scandal. Just 12,055 VW-branded cars were registered in January, down from 13,993 in January 2015, according to new figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. That cuts VW\u2019s market share to 7.1%, from 8.5%. Other Volkswagen brands also had a bad month. Sales of Seat cars slumped by 25%, from 4,137 to 3,119. This is the fourth month in a row that VW car sales have dropped, following last year\u2019s revelations that it used cheat software to get around emissions tests. Overall, the UK\u2019s new car market got off to a positive start in January, according to the SMMT. Registrations rose by 2.9% compared with the same month in 2015 to reach an 11-year high of 169,678 units. Goldman Sachs has weighed into the Brexit debate, predicting that the pound would slump by around 15% if Britain vote to leave the EU. In a new research note, it argues that investors would be put off from putting capital into the UK if the public reject David Cameron\u2019s new deal. And if the domestic economy also suffered, sterling would come under sustained pressure - due to the country\u2019s current account deficit. Goldman predicts: In our framework, a decline of 2% in domestic demand would still see close to a 15% drop in the British pound to close the current account deficit. Worth remembering that Goldman isn\u2019t completely impartial in this fight. The Bank has apparently given a six-figure donation to the Britain Stronger in Europe campaign, which is fighting against Brexit. European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi has dropped a clear hint that the ECB embark on fresh stimulus measures next month. Speaking in Frankfurt a few minute ago, Draghi insisted that central bankers can\u2019t just stop trying to hit their inflation goals because \u201cglobal disinflation\u201d is dragging prices down. He declared: There are forces in the global economy today that are conspiring to hold inflation down. Those forces might cause inflation to return more slowly to our objective. But there is no reason why they should lead to a permanently lower inflation rate. What matters is that central banks act within their mandates to fulfill their mandates. In the euro area, that might create different challenges than it does in other jurisdictions. But those challenges can be mitigated. They do not justify inaction. The speech is online here. Double ouch: Ouch. Shares in Credit Suisse have tumbled by around 10% in early trading. The Swiss bank is missing out on today\u2019s rally, after hitting shareholders with a loss of 5.83 billion Swiss francs ($5.8 billion) in the last quarter. That drove the bank into its first annual loss since 2008. Credit Suisse took a bigger-than-expected charge to cover restructuring its investment bank,. as new CEO Tidjane Thaim tries to turn the firm around. Thaim was also quite gloomy about the situation today, warning that: Market conditions in January 2016 have remained challenging and we expect markets to remain volatile throughout the remainder of the first quarter of 2016 as macroeconomic issues persist . Oil is continuing to gain ground this morning, adding to last night\u2019s 8% surge. Brent crude has risen to $35.36, up another 1%. European stock markets are a sea of green, as traders welcome the higher oil price and the weaker US dollar. Up we go! European markets are rallying at the start of trading, breaking three days of declines during this volatile week. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares opened 80 points higher, at 5917. That\u2019s a gain of 1.2%, clawing back Wednesday\u2019\u2019s losses. The German, French, Italian and Spanish markets are also up at least 1%. Mining companies are leading the recovery. The weaker US dollar should spur demand for natural resources, as it will take some pressure off emerging markets. And Shell\u2019s shares are rising, despite the company posting an 87% drop in profits this morning. Investors may have feared an even worse performance, given the slump in the oil price. The key to today\u2019s market moves is that the US dollar took an almighty tumble overnight. After strengthening for months, the greenback suffered its biggest one-day drop since 2011. That followed Wednesday\u2019s disappointing US services sector data, which made investors conclude that US interest rates are unlikely to be hiked anytime soon. Perhaps not until 2017? Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says the dollar fell on hopes that the Federal Reserve will \u201creign in its over-egged hawkishness\u201d. This delivered a welcome overshadowing of global growth concerns for markets hooked on cheap money. And this chart puts the dollar\u2019s weakness into some contect: It\u2019s been another day of wild market action in Asia. Most stock markets have surged overnight, on relief that the oil price has climbed back to over $35 per barrel. Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200 index led the way, jumping by 2%, with investors hoping that the commodity crunch may be bottoming out. Only Japan missed out, because the yen gained against the US dollar (bad news for Japanese exporters) From Melbourne, Chris Weston of IG calls it \u201can incredible night of moves in markets\u201d. And the trigger was the oil price, which has gained almost 10% since yesterday afternoon. What we have seen is one of the most amazing one day moves in oil one will ever see, with US and Brent oil rallying 9% and 8% from yesterday\u2019s ASX 200 close. Oil is benefitting from a weaker dollar, rumours that OPEC might pull an emergency meeting to cut production, and suggestions that the selloff has simply gone too far. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s Bank of England Super Thursday -- that time of the quarter when the UK central bank sets interest rates, and also releases its latest inflation report. \u201cSuper\u201d could be pushing it, though. We\u2019re expecting rates to remain unchanged at 0.5% (of course). The BoE will probably also lower its forecasts for growth and inflation, reflecting recent turmoil and rising pessimism about the world economy. Governor Mark Carney will then face the cream of the economic press pack, who will presumably try to get him to admit that interest rates are highly unlikely to rise this year (despite Carney\u2019s recent pronouncements). Might they even be cut to fresh record lows, governor?... Also coming up today... It\u2019s going to be another lively day in the markets. European shares are expected to rally strongly, after three days of falls, and oil is looking perkier too (more on that shortly) European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi is giving a speech in Frankfurt this morning; could that include fresh hints about ECB stimulus in March? In the corporate world, we\u2019re getting results from oil group Shell and mobile network operator Vodafone, among others. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

The tables were turned in the UK stock market today with recent winners suffering from profit-taking, while the miners were virtually the only stocks to keep their heads above water.</p> <p>The collapse in the oil price has been a big shock to the financial system and its effects are still being absorbed by international stock markets, in particular the implications for global demand. Financials have been really badly hit of late, and in a sign of how dire things have got, some European banks are trading lower than they did during the depths of the financial crisis.

London\u2019s FTSE-100 has posted a 2.7% sell-off, pushing the benchmark index squarely back into bear-market territory, but losses across mainland Europe have been even more pronounced. The fact that WTI crude tested territory below $30/barrel once again has done nothing to help matters but we\u2019ve got this overriding fear that another global slow down is imminent and many investors are adjusting portfolios to suit. The theme of risk aversion is buoying precious metals... as gold eyes a break above $1200 an ounce for the first time in over six months.</p> <p>But 25 stocks [in the FTSE 100 are] sporting losses in excess of 5% on the day, underlying the sense of panic that is creeping in. Economic data remains thin on the ground tomorrow but given at least some of the downside in stocks can be attributed to that renewed weakness in oil, this remains a metric worth watching closely.

In a new note he says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We struggle to remember many occasions when investor sentiment was quite as bearish and widespread as it feels today. Sure, 2008 was worse as the global financial crisis and fears of global depression created panic in markets, but today\u2019s cool disdain for risk assets still takes some beating. When we were asked by a client this week what reason bullish investors were citing for their optimism, we had to confess that we couldn\u2019t answer as we hadn\u2019t met any in recent times. The collective noun for a group of bears is a \u2018sleuth\u2019, but it doesn\u2019t take much detective work just now to identify what investors are concerned about. </p> </blockquote> <p>Those concerns revolve around the usual suspects - China, emerging markets, dollar, oil etc - but added to that are the fact that central banks are moving towards negative interest rates, which is not particularly positive for equity markets.

                "bodyText":"That\u2019s all from us until tomorrow, after another day dominated by wild swings in the markets and angst over the global economy. Will Tuesday be different? Come back tomorrow and find out. Goodnight! GW Wall Street has closed for the night, after a day of turmoil in the major stock markets. The Dow Jones industrial has finished down 177 points, or 1.1%, at 16,027, as gloom over global growth hit financial stocks. The S&amp;P 500 index, which covers more US stocks than the Dow, shed 1.4% and the Nasdaq finished down 1.8%. Serious losses, but better than the lowest points of the day. Wall Street was dragged up by a late rally in energy stocks. Credit card firm Visa was the biggest faller on the Dow, followed by Goldman Sachs: Tech firms had a bad day - with social media network Twitter dropping by over 5% to a new record low: As we\u2019ve been covering for the last 14 hours, that followed hefty losses in Europe. The FTSE 100 plunged by 2.7%, or 158 points, wiping \u00a340bn off the blue-chip London index. And European markets fell further, hit by fears over the banking sector and the global economy. Greece was the worst performer, though, hitting its lowest level in 25 years! Owen Callan, senior analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, said investors are increasingly anxious about the \u201cfundamental picture\u201d of the world economy. Callan said: \u201cPeople are worried about the global economy and particularly now we are beginning to look at the banks. \u201cYou are seeing more and more people saying: \u2018Is this 2008 again?\u2019 Maybe not quite as severe, but do we need to be worrying about the banking sector and risk assets on a bigger level?\u201d Here\u2019s our news story about today\u2019s selloff: Hello..... the US stock market is staging a late rally, bouncing off its earlier lows. The Dow is now down just 150 points, or 0.9%, having been down almost 400 points a couple of hours ago: Some big names are leading the Wall Street fallers, with 20 minutes until the closing bell is rung. Investment bank Goldman Sachs is down 5.8%, mirroring the selloff in global banking stocks. Visa is close behind, down 5.6%, followed by Nike (5%), Home Depot (4.6%) and Boeing (3%). Here\u2019s a few photos from Wall Street today, as traders faced another day of chunky losses. Deutsche Bank\u2019s soothing statement about its bond repayments may have calmed investors nerves a little. Shares are creeping back from their lows on Wall Street, meaning the Dow is now only down 269 points, or 1.7%. Good news, there\u2019s only one hour to go until Wall Street closes and Manic Monday is over. Bad news, the US stock market is still heavily in the red. The Dow is down 2.17%, or 351 points to the bad, with the S&amp;P and Nasdaq in deeper trouble: Newsflash: Deutsche Bank has just issued a statement, saying it can meet a crucial debt repayment in April. The Frankfurt-based bank, which was at the heart of today\u2019s market turmoil, says it has a \u201cpayment capacity\u201d of around \u20ac1bn. That will cover the \u20ac350m due in April on its CoCo bonds -- debt which converts into shares, or is wiped out, if a bank hits financial problems and defaults. As we covered this morning (details here), some analysts fear Deutsche could miss a CoCo payment in 2017, if economic conditions worsen. Deutsche says it will probably have a \u201cpayment capacity\u201d of \u20ac4.3bn next year in 2017, depending on its operating performance this year. Here\u2019s Deutsche\u2019s statement: Deutsche Bank publishes updated information about AT1 payment capacity The stock market turmoil risks blowing a multi-billion pound black hole in the UK government\u2019s fiscal plans. That\u2019s the warning from the IFS thinktank, which published its Green Budget today, one month ahead of the official budget. Here\u2019s the story: Britain\u2019s leading experts on the public finances are warning that the turmoil on global stock markets threatens to leave a \u00a32bn black hole in George Osborne\u2019s deficit-reduction plans that could force the chancellor to raise taxes or make fresh cuts in spending to hit his budget targets. On a day in which share prices crashed in Europe and the US, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said Osborne\u2019s plan to put the UK back in the black by the end of the current parliament was vulnerable to a protracted financial market panic. The IFS said tumbling share prices \u2013 which wiped more than \u00a340bn off the value of the companies quoted on the FTSE 100 Index on Monday \u2013 were one of a number of factors that could blow the chancellor\u2019s plan off course in the next four years. Forecasts that wages growth will be lower than previously expected could knock another \u00a35bn hole in his budget, the thinktank said. And here\u2019s the full story: The Telegraph\u2019s Mehreen Kahn points out that the European banking sector has lost a sixth of its value in the last month. Here\u2019s her take on today\u2019s market mayhem: Global stocks were gripped by a fresh bout of panic selling on Monday raising fears over the health of the world\u2019s banking system for the first time since the financial crisis. European markets slumped to their lowest level in more than two years amid an unremittingly bleak outlook for the global economy and concerns over the resilience of the world\u2019s biggest lenders. The Euro Stoxx 600 index of leading bank shares fell as much as 6pc in Monday\u2019s trading, closing down 5.6pc, plumbing depths not seen since August 2012. The continent\u2019s lenders have now lost 17.3pc of their value of the last 30 days.... (more here) Anxious investors are continuing to pile into gold, sending it up to $1,200 per ounce for the first time in over seven months: So far this year, shares in America\u2019s largest banks have slumped by at least 15% as investors fear a global downturn. The biotech boom has speedily unwound, too.. There\u2019s no sign, yet, that Wall Street might recover from its early selloff. The Dow is stubbornly down around 344 points, or 2.1%, at 15,860 points. The broader S&amp;P 500 is down 2.3%, and the tech stock-packed Nasdaq has shed 2.9%. That\u2019s nearly as bad as the European selloff, and suggests we\u2019re facing yet more market turbulence. \u201cYelp\u201d indeed..... US technology stocks are being hit hard today. Tesla, the electric car company, have slumped by 9% today, dropping below $150 for the first time in two years. Global markets suffered a bad start to the week, with the Chinese new year proving as turbulent as the slump in the early days of January. Although the Chinese markets were closed, that did not end the recent spate of volatility facing investors. Fears about a slowdown in global growth returned with a vengeance, while banking shares were among the poorest performers on worries about the outlook, and the effect of negative interest rates on their business. On top of that came a cocktail of other concerns, from the prospect of Britain leaving the European Union to concerns about the review of Greek\u2019s progress in meeting its bailout targets. The rout was widespread, with the Greek market at its lowest for around 25 years and the Eurofirst300 dropped to a near two and a half year low. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 158.7 points or 2.7% to 5689.36 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 3.3% to 8979.36 with Deutsche Bank 9.5% lower France\u2019s Cac closed 3.2% lower at 4066.31 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 4.09% to 16,441.2 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 4.44% at 8122.1 In Greece, the Athens market lost 7.87% to 464.23 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 323 points or 2%. There seems little justification for the day\u2019s slump in banking shares, said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: Markets are clearly worried about a global economic downturn at a time when central banks have little dry powder left to fight off recessionary forces. The tables were turned in the UK stock market today with recent winners suffering from profit-taking, while the miners were virtually the only stocks to keep their heads above water. The collapse in the oil price has been a big shock to the financial system and its effects are still being absorbed by international stock markets, in particular the implications for global demand. Financials have been really badly hit of late, and in a sign of how dire things have got, some European banks are trading lower than they did during the depths of the financial crisis. There doesn\u2019t seem to be much justification for such a dismal outlook, but markets appear to be stuck in a negative feedback loop at the moment. A sense of panic seems to be setting in, but any increase in the oil price might help markets, said Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct: Equities across the globe have kicked off the week in a deeply downbeat mood. London\u2019s FTSE-100 has posted a 2.7% sell-off, pushing the benchmark index squarely back into bear-market territory, but losses across mainland Europe have been even more pronounced. The fact that WTI crude tested territory below $30/barrel once again has done nothing to help matters but we\u2019ve got this overriding fear that another global slow down is imminent and many investors are adjusting portfolios to suit. The theme of risk aversion is buoying precious metals... as gold eyes a break above $1200 an ounce for the first time in over six months. But 25 stocks [in the FTSE 100 are] sporting losses in excess of 5% on the day, underlying the sense of panic that is creeping in. Economic data remains thin on the ground tomorrow but given at least some of the downside in stocks can be attributed to that renewed weakness in oil, this remains a metric worth watching closely. Anything that fundamentally impacts on supply could be all it takes to instil some confidence in markets, but in the absence of any better news the bears are likely to remain in control. One reason for the current market problems is the US Federal Reserve ending its quantitative easing programme, says Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Bloomberg has the story: Ever since the Federal Reserve began to withdraw monetary stimulus, liquidity has steadily been drying up. Therein lies the crux of the broader stress in financial markets, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which have seen violent selloffs occur following the surprise revaluations of currencies in Switzerland and China, as well as Japan\u2019s introduction of negative interest rates. Head of U.S. Mortgages Chris Flanagan and Strategist Mao Ding don\u2019t necessarily lay blame for market dislocations squarely on U.S. monetary policymakers. The two observe, however, that since early 2014\u2014when the Fed began winding down its open-ended asset purchases\u2014liquidity stress has \u201cpersistently risen\u201d and served as the proximate cause of the episodic spikes in Merrill Lynch\u2019s Global Financial Stress Index that have since occurred. [They said:] \u201cThis persistence suggests to us that deteriorating liquidity is at the heart of and may be the primary driver of broader rising financial stress.\u201d Full story here: Bank of America: This Chart Shows \u2018Deteriorating Liquidity\u2019 Is at the Heart of Market Carnage More turbulence in the banking sector, which has been by worries about negative interest rates, the outlook for profits and slowing global growth. Trading in Barclays shares was halted briefly after volatile movements. Now resumed, the shares are down 5.4%. With China\u2019s markets closed for the new year holiday, it is a worrying sign that share prices elsewhere continue to tumble, says Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG: The selling that began this morning has gathered pace across the globe this afternoon, as the US joins in the one-way move. Chinese investors will feel relieved that their market has taken the week off, but the absence of the volatility provided by Shanghai sends a worrying message \u2013 investors in the US and Europe are worried by many things, not least the current interest rate outlook in the US. Recent surveys of fund managers may indicate rising cash balances, but so far these appear to be remaining on the side lines, pulling the rug from under what remains of this bull market. In a week when economic data is relatively light, it is becoming increasingly apparent investors are struggling to find any positive news on which to create a rally. Then there are the banks. Jasper Lawler at CMC Markets said: Banking shares across Europe buckled under the pressure of global growth concerns in concert with the ugly spectre of negative interest rates. Weak earnings from European banks, notably that of Deutsche Bank have seen investors significantly reassess the chance of an earnings turnaround after years of regulatory fines for past misdeeds. The disappointing earnings across the sector from the big US firms to Credit Suisse whose chief executive asked to have his bonus cut by as much as 50% is refocusing investor attention on bad loan books which have not been addressed since the European crisis. In the days after Deutsche Bank issued a surprise profit warning, credit default swap spreads ballooned as investors started to question the bank\u2019s ability to fund itself. The CDS jump has caused a sharp drop in Deutsche Bank shares. Markets continue to slide, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now down around 300 points. Meanwhile in Greece, the Athens market has closed down 7.87% to 464.23, its lowest level in at least 25 years. Banks - as elsewhere - are among the biggest fallers, down up to nearly 30% in some cases. Greece\u2019s finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos said he expected the review of the country\u2019s bailout programme to restart next week, and conclude two weeks later. But with worries about planned pension and tax reforms - which have seen major protests in recent days - have unnerved investors. Manos Hatzidakis of Beta Securities told Reuters: The market is pricing in financial and political instability, and delays in the review. Sterling has hit a one week low, falling to $1.4393 amid worries about the outlook for banks and concerns about the effects of any vote from Britain to leave the European Union. It is also at a 13 month low against the euro. The recent move by central banks to push interest rates into negative territory is bold but unco-ordinated and could lead to a \u201crace to the bottom,\u201d according to Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s. The ratings agency said: Four European central banks--in Switzerland, Denmark, and Sweden, plus the European Central Bank--have adopted negative policy rates, and Japan surprisingly joined the club on January 29 this year. \u201cThe Bank of Japan\u2019s decision to follow suit on negative rates is likely to reinforce the trend toward shrinking yields in core government bond markets, as the search for yield spreads from Japan into Europe,\u201d said Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s economist Sophie Tahiri... \u201cThe bold venture into negative interest rates signals to market participants that central banks will use all tools at their disposal to meet inflation targets,\u201d said Ms Tahiri. \u201cThe problem is that all developed markets\u2019 central banks face the same deflationary pressures from weak commodity prices and have the same incentive to use their exchange rate to combat those pressures.\u201d This increasing competition between developed markets\u2019 central banks to stem currency appreciation signals a new phase in the extended aftermath of the global financial crisis. Independent attempts to weaken exchange rates could lead to an undesirable \u201crace to the bottom\u201d among central banks. Here\u2019s a snapshot of the Dow movers, mainly down of course: Amid the current worries about the global economy, Europe could start moving up the list according to strategist Graham Secker at Morgan Stanley. In a new note he says: We struggle to remember many occasions when investor sentiment was quite as bearish and widespread as it feels today. Sure, 2008 was worse as the global financial crisis and fears of global depression created panic in markets, but today\u2019s cool disdain for risk assets still takes some beating. When we were asked by a client this week what reason bullish investors were citing for their optimism, we had to confess that we couldn\u2019t answer as we hadn\u2019t met any in recent times. The collective noun for a group of bears is a \u2018sleuth\u2019, but it doesn\u2019t take much detective work just now to identify what investors are concerned about. Those concerns revolve around the usual suspects - China, emerging markets, dollar, oil etc - but added to that are the fact that central banks are moving towards negative interest rates, which is not particularly positive for equity markets. Secker said he feared any moves higher by stock markets, prompted by relief rallies on positive new, would \u201cprove short-lived as investors increasingly question the value and effectiveness of further central bank action.\u201d And then there is Europe: Recent investor caution tends to focus on fears of excess US dollar strength, low oil prices and/or China, but we think it is quite plausible that Europe moves back up the pecking order (to its more usual place some would say!) as we move through 2016. The UK\u2019s forthcoming referendum on EU membership, likely to take place in June, may appear the most plausible catalyst in the short term to raise regional risk premia, but the ongoing migrant issue risks eroding political cohesion over the medium term and political uncertainty is rising in the periphery. Greece has a daunting debt repayment due this summer, Spain is currently without a government, new European regulations are preventing Italy from adopting an effective \u2018bad bank\u2019 solution and the recently elected socialist government in Portugal is reversing course on prior austerity and competitiveness improvements. During a cyclical upswing, markets are prone to overlook such concerns, but the opposite would be true if growth starts to relapse. US markets have followed Europe into the red, as fears about the global economy continue to rattle investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 220 points or 1.3% while the S&amp;P 500 is down just over 1% and the Nasdaq has fallen 1.7% at the open. With the Greek stock market at its lowest since at least 1990 and banks bearing the brunt of the selling, here is the huge damage done to the four biggest since the start of the year: Readers in America should brace themselves. The selloff that began in Europe this morning is heading your way. Wall Street is expected to fall sharply when trading begins in 20 minutes time, as fears over the global economy reach New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is tipped to fall by over 1%, while US crude oil is flirting with the $30/barrel mark. Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis, told Reuters that investors will remain nervous until the oil price picks up. \u201cEquities are in a \u2018go-nowhere-fast\u2019 mode, with a downward bias in the near term. Some analysts are concerned that Deutsche Bank may struggle to repay some of its bonds, if economic conditions continue to deteriorate. That\u2019s helps explains why its shares have slumped 5%, as investors also drive up the cost of insuring its debt. The key is Deutsche\u2019s CoCo bonds, or contingent convertible bonds, which are written down or converted to equity when a bank\u2019s capital falls to a certain level. CoCo bonds have been introduced since the 2008 financial crisis, to spare governments from funding another bailout. They pay a decent return, to encourage investors to hold them, in return for shouldering the risk if things go wrong. Bloomberg\u2019s John Glover has the story: Deutsche Bank may struggle to pay coupons on its riskiest bonds next year if operating results disappoint or litigation costs are higher than expected, according to analysts at CreditSights Inc. Bonds and stock of Germany\u2019s largest bank have plunged this year, with the shares shedding 35% of their value and its contingent convertible bonds -- known as CoCos, or additional Tier 1 securities -- turning in a similar performance. The cost of protecting the company\u2019s subordinated debt from default for five years using credit-default swaps has more than doubled since the end of 2015, rising to 420 basis points, a four-year high, from 187. \u201cWhile we are confident about 2016 coupons, we are less so about coupon payments in 2017,\u201d CreditSights analyst Simon Adamson wrote in a note to clients today. Deutsche Bank will do \u201ceverything in its power to pay them\u201d because it will need to issue such bonds in the future, he said. Full story: Deutsche Bank\u2019s Woes Threaten CoCo Coupons, CreditSights Says The selloff is gathering pace in Frankfurt. The German DAX index has just slumped through the 9,000 point mark for the first time in 16 months, down 3.2%. Bank stocks are leading the DAX further down.... Stock market wizards like to tell you that \u2018buy and hold\u2019 is a solid strategy, that allows shareholders to ride out turbulence. Shares outperform other assets in the long term, they chant. Well, tell that to a Greek investor. The Athens market has just slumped to its lowest level in at least 25 years. Greek bank shares are being pulverised today, with Eurobank down 27%, National Bank of Greece down 25% and Piraeus down 20%. It\u2019s only three months since the Greek banking sector was recapitalised, getting \u20ac14bn of new funding to help stabilise the economy. China has lost its claim to be the world\u2019s fastest-growing major economy, to India. New government figures from Delhi show that Indian gross domestic product grew by 7.3% in the last quarter of 2015, compared with a year earlier. That beats China, which expanded by 6.8% over the same period. India\u2019s statistics body also estimated that GDP will expand by 7.6% in the year through March. That would also outpace Beijing, which is aiming for growth close to 7%. Caution is needed with these figures. Many economists suspect China is growing rather slower than the official readings. And some have told Reuters that India\u2019s figures are surprisingly strong. Almost every company on the FTSE 100 index has fallen this morning, during another bout of heavy selling across Europe\u2019s stock markets. Worries over the state of the world economy continue to drive shares lower. Only five companies are defying the rout, including gold producer Randgold and silver producer Fresnillo, who are both benefitting from the panic. That has left the FTSE 100 languishing at 5,735 points, down 112 points or 1.9% today. Other European markets are deeper in the red, losing around 2.4% on average, and hitting their lowest level since October 2014. Conner Campbell of Spreadex has summed up the situation (I\u2019ve added links to key points in this blog): A slow start soon turned disastrous this Monday, with many of the European indices plunging to lows not seen since October 2014. With Citigroup warning of a potential \u2018death spiral\u2019 if investors behave irrationally to the stronger dollar/weaker commodities/harmed emerging markets cycle that the world appears to be trapped in at the moment, the markets have taken another kicking this Monday. It doesn\u2019t help, of course, that the day\u2019s economic calendar is so sparse, with investors left pondering the purely negative side of things as the morning continued. The FTSE sank by nearly 2%, plummeting past 5800 in the process as Brent Crude fell back towards the $33 per barrel mark. The DAX, always the liveliest index in instances like this, lopped off a whopping 2.6% in value as the morning progressed, and is in serious danger of falling below the 9000 mark; the CAC, meanwhile, matched its dramatic German peer with its own 2.5% drop. The Eurozone had the added negative of a 10 month low Sentix investor confidence figure, the reported 6.0 far lower than the 9.6 announced in January, whilst the German index has the extra burden of a dismal morning from Deutsche Bank. The FT\u2019s Joel Lewin has a handy explanation of why bank shares are falling today. Fears surrounding non-performing loans and other deep-rooted issues in the Italian banking sector have driven nerves, while a slew of weak earnings from large banks such as Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank have added to concerns. Weak growth provides an unsupportive backdrop, as does the possibility of more deeply negative benchmark interest rates. And that\u2019s why Commerzbank has dropped by 4.7%, Deutsche Bank is down 3.4%, and BNP Paribas has lost 3.3%. UK banks are also suffering, with Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland both down 1.7% In another sign of angst, the gold price has just hit a three month high. Bullion is swapping hands at $1,171 per ounce, the most since the end of October. It has already gained around 10% since the start of 2016, as concerns over the world economic outlook have grown. The OECD think tank has issued new economic indicators for investors to digest (in between hammering the SELL button). It sees \u2018tentative\u2019 signs that the Chinese economy is bottoming out, but slowing growth in the US. The OECD is also quite upbeat about Europe, saying: In the euro area as a whole, and in Germany and Italy, the composite leading indicators signal stable growth momentum while in France the outlook is for firming growth.\u201d We\u2019ll find out on Friday if they\u2019re right, when the latest eurozone GDP figures are published (starting at 6.30am GMT, so set your alarm clocks). How worried should we really, really be about a global recession? No-one knows for sure. But investment bank Goldman Sachs reckons it is still unlikely, despite fears that the recent market turmoil will feed into the \u2018real economy\u2019. They have estimated that there is an 18% chance that the United States goes into recession over the next year, rising to 23% over the next two years. For the eurozone, it\u2019s a 24% risk this year, up to 38% by the end of 2017. So hardly a done deal. Goldman\u2019s Jan Hatzius agues that \u201cThe recent market weakness should provide good risk-adjusted opportunities for those brave enough to defy Mr. Market\u2019s gloomy prognosis about the world economy.\u201d The selloff in European markets this morning suggests Mr Market isn\u2019t convinced.... The Greek stock market is still falling, and now down over 6%. That\u2019s pretty worrying, given the political tensions in Athens. Wall Street is expected to suffer losses when trading begins in New York, in just over three hours time. According to the future market, the Dow Jones industrial average will fall 1.2% at the open. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index is being called down 1.6%. The oil price is falling again, hit by concerns over the global economy. Brent crude has dropped by 1.7% to $33.47 per barrel, wiping out last week\u2019s rally. Confirmation that Germany\u2019s stock market is at a 15-month low: The Greek stock market has slumped by 5% to its lowest level since 2012 - when it nearly left the eurozone. That\u2019s partly due to the general wave of worry today, but it also reflects the standoff over Greece\u2019s bailout. Creditors are pushing the government to make deeper pension reforms, while protestors flocked to the streets last week to call for less austerity. European banking shares are bearing the brunt of today\u2019s rout. In Germany, shares in Deutsche Bank have tumbled by 4.35%. And the cost of insuring Deutsche\u2019s debt against default, using a credit default swap or CDS, has hit the highest level since July 2012. That underlines how much nervousness is in the markets today: Last month, Deutsche announced that it suffered a loss of \u20ac6.7bn last year. New CEO John Cryan said it was \u2018sobering\u2019, and some analysts fear Cryan will struggle to turn Deutsche around in the current market turmoil. As well as the huge loss, Deutsche also reported falling revenues. According to Bloomberg, that could indicate the bank will struggle to hit its capital ratio targets. As shares slide, investors are scrambling to get their hands on safe-haven assets such as German government debt today. And that has driven the yield, or interest rate, on German bunds into deeper negative territory. In other words, traders are willing to pay more than the face value of the bonds and accept a guaranteed loss - unless they can offload them onto someone even more desperate..... A wave of selling is gripping Europe\u2019s stock markets, as this morning\u2019s stream of bad news hits traders. In London, the FTSE 100 index is suddenly down by 101 points, or 1.7%. And there are steeper losses across Europe, where the benchmark FTSeurofirst 300 index has shed 2%. That means European stocks are at their lowest point since October 2014, as money pours out of shares and into safe-haven bonds. Concerns over the weakness of the global economy appear to be rippling through trading floors again. The sharp fall in eurozone investor confidence reported a few minutes ago is contributing to the bad mood: Alastair McCaig, Market Analyst at IG. says: Stock markets in Europe are in full retreat... with the disappointing Sentix figures triggering a mid-morning selloff. The news that UK business morale has hit a three-year low isn\u2019t helping either. More gloom! Economic sentiment among investors across the eurozone has fallen sharply this month, as the problems in the global economy hit Europe. Sentix, the Frankfurt-based think tank, has just reported that its index of investor morale has hit a 10-month low in February, dropping from 9.6 to 6.0. And its sub-index of economic expectations hit its lowest level since November, 2014, sliding from 6.3 to just 1.5. Manfred Huebner, Sentix\u2019s managing director, warns: The euro zone proves it is not immune to the enormous loss of momentum in the global economy. The global economy is thus currently on the brink, led by a US economic downturn! Sentix blamed \u201cthe loss of dynamism\u201d in Germany and the United States, while Latin America and Eastern Europe are in a worse state. And Sentix singles out the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate increase last December, which is \u201cnow considered a big mistake by the majority of investors\u201d. It also pointed to the slump in commodity prices, and its impact on emerging markets. Wall Street bank Citigroup has contributed to the sombre feeling in the markets, with a research note last week warning that we could face a \u2018death spiral\u2019. The bad news, according to Citi, is that the dollar could keep strengthening, driving commodity prices lower, hurting emerging markets (EM), and thus pushing the dollar higher etc etc. The good news is that it probably won\u2019t happen though, if \u2018rational behaviour\u2019 kicks in . CNBC has the details: \u201cThe world appears to be trapped in a circular reference death spiral,\u201d Citi strategists led by Jonathan Stubbs said in a report on Thursday. \u201cStronger U.S. dollar, weaker oil/commodity prices, weaker world trade/petrodollar liquidity, weaker EM (and global growth)... and repeat. Ad infinitum, this would lead to Oilmageddon, a \u2018significant and synchronized\u2019 global recession and a proper modern-day equity bear market.\u201d Stubbs said that macro strategists at Citi forecast that the dollar would weaken in 2016 and that oil prices were likely bottoming, potentially providing some light at the end of the tunnel. \u201cThe death spiral is in nobody\u2019s interest. Rational behaviour, most likely, will prevail,\u201d he said in the report. Great headline - but maybe the report is a little overblown? One money manager thinks so.... The Economist Intelligence Unit is also concerned about the economic situation. Their managing director, Robin Bew, tweets that they think UK interest rates will remain at 0.5% until 2019 In another sign of unease, shares in UK chipmaker ARM Holdings have slipped by 4% to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard. ARM reports results on Wednesday, and analysts fear it is suffering from the slowdown in the US technology sector. Last week, Apple predicted that sales of the iPhone (which uses ARM chips) will start to fall later this year. Another UK tech firm called Imagination, which designs chips, warned this morning it will make an operating loss this year. It blamed a slowing market, and uncertainty over China. Peter Elston, chief investment officer at Seneca Investment Managers, argues that we\u2019re unlikely to be entering a recession yet. Recessions generally start because central banks are trying to restrain economies, he told Bloomberg TV this morning. But right now, inflation pressures are very low, and economies are still some way from full capacity. \u201cThis would be an extremely unusual place for a global recession to start.\u201d True. But arguably, we\u2019ve been in an \u201cextremely unusual place\u201d since the financial crisis, with central bank stimulus has been underpinning growth. Ultra-low interest rates helped struggling firms limp on and quantitative easing pumped up the stock market. Still, though, global growth is weak and vulnerable to the impact of higher US interest rates - unless the Fed changes course.... Shares in engine maker Rolls Royce have shed 2% at the start of trading, as the City braces for further problems. After hitting shareholders with five profit warnings in two years, Rolls-Royce could now slash its dividend when it posts its annual results on Friday. My colleague Graham Ruddick explains: The company has been hurt by cuts to defence spending by western governments, a fall in demand for corporate jets, and a slump in the oil price. European stock markets have begun the new week rather gingerly. The FTSE 100 index has gained 20 points, or 0.4%, but Germany\u2019s DAX is only up 0.1% and the French CAC is slightly lower. This fall in UK business confidence will only fuel concern that the global economy is slowing. Chris Weston of financial spread-betting firm IG says this is the biggest issue in the markets today. Will we see a recession in the US and other developed nations? There is little doubt this is the number one question being asked right now. He points out that insurance against company\u2019s defaulting has spiked in value recently, especially for banks. And the stock market turbulence, and the recent surge in the US dollar, show how financial conditions have deteriorated. If that feeds through to the real economy, we could be in serious trouble. As Chris puts it: The strong fear is this stress \u2013 that is clearly being felt in the financial markets \u2013 will start to filter through to Main Street. We have some worrying news to start the week -- confidence among UK executives has hit its lowest level since 2013. Concerns over Britain\u2019s upcoming EU referendum are adding to worries over the global economy. And business leaders now fear their companies are suffering. That\u2019s according to a regular survey conducted by BDO, the professional services firm. It warns that the UK is now suffering from problems in the global economy, particularly China\u2019s slowdown and signs of weakness in America. The turmoil in the Middle East is also hitting confidence. Peter Hemington, partner at BDO LLP, warns: \u201cGlobal headwinds are finally hitting business confidence and the added uncertainty of EU referendum just round the corner is fuelling concerns. This knocked BDO\u2019s Business Optimism Index \u2013 which predicts growth six months ahead \u2013 down to 100.0. That\u2019s the tipping point below which firms expect their output growth to drop under the long term trend rate. So what can be done? One option, the BDO says, is for the government to introduce a zero-rate of VAT on companies that sell their goods to exporters. Manufacturers could certainly use some help. The sector is already in recession, even though the wider UK economy grew by a solid-enough 0.5% in the final quarter of 2015. BDO found that manufacturing output contracted again this month, which it attribued to \u201cdecreasing global confidence\u201d. Dr Gerard Lyons, the Mayor London\u2019s economic advisor, points out that other measures were less gloomy: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It looks like a quiet start to the week, as investors wait to hear from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen. Yellen testifies to Congress on Wednesday and Thursday, and will give her take on the recent turmoil in the financial markets, and the state of the global economy. She\u2019s also likely to be questioned on whether the Fed was right to raise interest rates in December, and whether future hikes are now on the back-burner. It could be a tricky balancing act for Yellen; she won\u2019t want to fuel the current market angst, but nor can she sound complacent. Thomas Costerg, of Standard Chartered Bank in New York, predicts that Yellen will keep her options open regarding future interest rate rises: \u201cShe may emphasize the positives in the U.S. economy, particularly the still-strong labor market. Looking ahead, she may sound more cautious, and she will likely highlight that the negatives are mostly from abroad and that they are watching the global picture closely.\u201d City traders are also digesting the news that China burned through another $99.5bn in foreign exchange reserves last month, defending the yuan. That takes China\u2019s FX reserves down to their lowest level since 2012, although Beijing still has $3.23 trillion fo firepower. Those figures haven\u2019t alarmed Chinese investors, though, as they are now on holiday for the Chinese New Year. We\u2019re expecting a quiet start to trading in Europe, with the main indices expected to rise. And there\u2019s not much in the economic calendar today, apart from the monthly survey of eurozone Investor Confidence, from Sentix, at 9.30am GMT.",

                "bodyText":"Inside the offices that nestle within the old warehouse buildings of Liverpool\u2019s Baltic Triangle, which house many of the city\u2019s nascent digital technology companies, there\u2019s a sense of purpose and industry. Liverpool is classed as having a tech cluster, which means, according to a report out this Thursday, its digital industries stand a good chance of growing faster and generating higher salaries than in much of the rest of the country. \u201cThere\u2019s money here,\u201d says Leo Cubbin, co-founder of Liverpool-based Ripstone, the creator of computer games such as Pure Chess and Ironcast. Fellow founder, Phil Gaskell, nods in agreement. The pair are talking in a small meeting room about the 14 or so private shareholders who have backed his company. Many of them are high net worth individuals based locally and a well-known figure from the football industry is advising on future finance. Ripstone, which seeks \u00a32m for further growth, is located in the heart of the Triangle, a development area overlooking the river Mersey with a skyline on one side dominated by the city\u2019s imposing Anglican cathedral.

However, Studio Liverpool, famous for its Wipeout series of racing games, closed in 2012, leaving about 100 games experts looking for jobs or companies to found. Now it is home to a cluster of games companies that feature prominently in the narrative of the state of Britain\u2019s digital economy as portrayed in the Tech Nation report by Tech City UK, the government-backed initiative.

They\u2019re been very popular, because they provide a better interest rate than many other bonds. BUT.... that\u2019s because they could potentially be turned into shares, or even wiped out.</p> <p>Deutsche\u2019s CoCos have been slumping in value recently, on fears that the bank will struggle to get enough cash to meet the repayments (last night, it insisted the April 2016 payment was safe).</p> <p>Want to know more? Great.<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-09/how-the-bank-debt-that-everyone-is-talking-about-works-q-a\"> Bloomberg has published a useful Q&amp;A</a>.</p> <p>Here\u2019s a flavour:</p> <h2>So how does it work?</h2> <p>CoCos typically allow a bank to stop interest payments when it runs into trouble, like when its capital ratios breach levels considered dangerous (that\u2019s the \u201ccontingent\u201d part). If the bank\u2019s financial health deteriorates further, CoCos can force losses on bondholders. The bonds can lose their value entirely or change into common stock (that\u2019s the \u201cconvertible\u201d part).</p> <h2>How do banks determine whether they can pay?</h2> <p>This is where it gets really technical. To make optional payments such as dividends, bonuses and coupons on CoCos, banks must calculate their \u201cavailable distributable items,\u201d or ADIs. Deutsche Bank, which has to make the calculation based on its audited, unconsolidated accounts under German GAAP, has thinner coverage than other major banks, prompting the current volatility. </p> <h2>Why did regulators create CoCos?</h2> <p>During the financial crisis, taxpayers had to inject billions of dollars into failing banks, while investors in those lenders\u2019 bonds were often fully repaid. Officials wanted to create ways to avoid this in the future.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the full piece:<br></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-09/how-the-bank-debt-that-everyone-is-talking-about-works-q-a\">How the Bank Debt That Everyone Is Talking About Works: Q&amp;A </a></h2> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56ba3131e4b0a789c640efe1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-09T18:36:30.405Z\">6.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It\u2019s tough being a bank right now:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SkyIanKingLive/status/697126142206152705\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">As bank shares slump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomstevenson63\">@tomstevenson63</a>, investment director <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Fidelity_UK\">@Fidelity_UK</a> tells <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IanKingSky\">@IanKingSky</a> low rates are squeezing lenders&#39; margins</p>&mdash; Ian King Live Team (@SkyIanKingLive) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SkyIanKingLive/status/697126142206152705\">February 9, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SkyNewsBiz/status/697126563855343616\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/patrickjenkins_\">@patrickjenkins_</a> asst editor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FT\">@FT</a> says European banks are in the &quot;eye of the storm&quot; with Deutsche especially in focus</p>&mdash; Sky News Business (@SkyNewsBiz) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SkyNewsBiz/status/697126563855343616\">February 9, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Chins up, though.

And chair Yellen is known to put particular emphasis on the JOLTS data. Accordingly, she should mention them tomorrow in the context of an improving labor market. </p> <p>Skeptics may argue that these numbers are backward looking, and that spillovers from tighter financial conditions or the energy slump will curb labor market dynamics in the months to come. This is certainly a risk, and one important reason, why the Fed is currently sitting back and wait. But why should this happen now, when it hasn\u2019t over the past several months? After all, oil prices have started to fall in mid-2014, and most of the adjustment occurred in the first half of 2015. Investment in mining structures has plummeted by 51% in 2015, with more than half of the drop occurring in the first half of the year. Similarly, the rig count plunged by more than 70% since the peak in September 2014, with almost 80% of that drop before the middle of last year. Since then, more than half a year has passed without any negative spill-overs to other parts of economy. Quite the contrary: The employment situation has improved further and workers are now feeling it. </p> </blockquote> <p><a><br></a><br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56ba0d9de4b01b57bb994011\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-09T16:03:32.786Z\">4.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>JP Morgan has worked out what it thinks are the exposure of European and US banks to the struggling oil and gas sector - and it amounts to $250bn:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ReutersJamie/status/697086898792226816\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Bank exposure to oil &amp; gas sector $250B ($170B European, $80B US).

But the current market falls were overdone. Scott Corfe, director and head of macroeconomics at Cebr, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Markets have somewhat belatedly woken up to the underlying state of economic reality. We will be in a world of sluggish growth, loose monetary policy and low commodity prices for some time.</p> <p>As usual with the markets, it is either feast or famine. Our best view of the current circumstances is that, despite all the risks, we should avoid another financial crisis. In particular, Chinese policymakers have sufficient fiscal and monetary ammunition to revitalise the world\u2019s second largest economy. More quantitative easing in the Eurozone, and possibly the US, should also help.<br></p> <p>So the most likely scenario is modest growth in the world economy this year. When the reality of this is understood and if there is further monetary relaxation, it is quite likely that the markets will turn.

                "bodyText":"It\u2019s only Tuesday, but many investors may feel they need a break after two days of dramatic swings. But instead, they need to get ready for Wednesday - when Janet Yellen, head of the US Federal Reserve, will testify to Congress. America\u2019s top central banker can expect a lot of questions about the financial markets and the global economy. Especially as some investors think the Fed is going to cut interest rates this year, having only just raised them in December. Here\u2019s a quick recap of today\u2019s events. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index has fallen to a three-year low. The blue-chip index lost 1%, or 57 points, to 5632. Mining shares led the rout, with Anglo American losing 11%, as fears of a global recession keep swirling. After a turbulent session, Wall Street has closed pretty flat tonight. The Dow finished down just 12 points, with consumer goods, healthcare and industrial stocks rallying. But as Marketwatch reports, there is a lot of angst out there: \u201cThe fear is palpable,\u201d said Kent Engelke, chief economic strategist at Capitol Securities Management, pointing to the heightened volatility in the stock market. \u201cYou feel smart for three seconds and then you get humbled again.\u201d Oil has stumbled. Brent crude has lost 2% to $30.79 per barrel, while US crude dropped below $29/barrel. Deutsche Bank is in the eye of the storm, buffeted by fears over its financial strength. The FT is reporting tonight that Deutsche is considering buying back several billion euros of its debt, to shore up its value. But it\u2019s not clear that will stem concerns over Deutsche\u2019s CoCo debt, which could default if the crisis worsens. The turmoil actually began 15 hours ago, when Japan\u2019s Nikkei index suffered its biggest one-day drop in three years. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow to pick up all the action again. Thanks for reading, and all the comments. Goodnight! GW One late story breaking... Disney has just announced record quarterly earnings for the last three months. The entertainment company made $1.73 per share, beating forecasts of $1.45 per share. And it attributed the success to the new Star Wars film, The Force Awakens. Disney says: Driven by the phenomenal success of Star Wars, we delivered the highest quarterly earnings in the history of our company. It\u2019s over.... And after a lively Shrove Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average has closed as flat as a pancake. After being down 145 points, then up 100 points, the Dow finished down just 12 points. The S&amp;P 500 was also unchanged, while the Nasdaq dropped by 0.36%. Healthcare , materials, and biotech firms did well today, but energy stocks were kicked again, as concerns over global growth continue to mount. And New York still remained nervous, given the widespread worries about the global economy. As Steven Baffico, chief executive officer at Four Wood Capital Partners in New York, put it: It\u2019s difficult to find a lot of momentum to the upside for any sustained period of time. The US stock market appears to be recovering its nerve.... With an hour to go until the closing bell, US retail giant Home Depot is leading the Dow Jones industrial average, by gaining 1.6%. Famous names such as Nike, Visa, McDonald\u2019s and Coca-Cola have also turned green, as Wall Street traders regain their nerve after a couple of wild sessions. But other companies are still sliding. Energy group Chevron is leading the Dow fallers, shedding 3.5%, mirroring the slump in the oil price today. IT giant IBM are also down, reflecting losses across the tech sector. Here\u2019s the risers and fallers on the Dow, which is now up 46 points or 0.3%. Remarkable scenes on Wall Street....the Dow Jones index is now up! Only by 17 points, or a meagre 0.1%, but it\u2019s a start.... Here\u2019s our City editor, Jill Treanor, on the escalating concerns about the banking sector, which hit shares across Europe again today: Growing anxiety about whether banks can withstand continued low interest rates and fears of a re-run of the 2008 financial crisis continued to stalk markets when shares fell to a three-year low and bank shares remained volatile. As shares in Deutsche Bank plumbed new depths on Tuesday and the bank\u2019s chief executive had to reassure its 100,000 staff that it was \u201crock solid\u201d, concerns mounted about the health of the global banking sector. \u201cMany are asking \u2018crisis\u2019 questions: \u2018Is there risk of a financial crisis re-run\u2019 and \u2018can a large European bank face a liquidity event\u2019?\u201d said analysts at Goldman Sachs. The Goldman analysts reckon the alarm bells are ringing too loudly. They recognise that market confidence is \u201cfast deteriorating\u201d but point to the \u20ac800bn (\u00a3625bn) of capital that European banks have raised since the 2008 crisis as evidence that the fears are overdone \u2013 together with the fact that customers are continuing to make deposits and there are no signs of strain in the crucial money markets. The collapse in confidence in the banking sector since the start of the year has been dramatic. Shares in Deutsche Bank have slumped by almost 40%, UniCredit of Italy is down more than 40% while Credit Suisse is down 37% . The Europe-wide Stoxx 600 banking index is down 27%..... And here\u2019s the full story: Another dose of turbulence on Wall Street is driving shares higher! The Dow is now down just 11 points, having been down more than 100 points earlier. The cloud of worry hovering over Deutsche Bank has sent investors, analysts and (especially) journalists dashing to swot up on a newish financial instrument, called CoCos. These contingent convertible bonds were introduced after the 2008 financial crisis, to give European banks an extra wall of protection. They\u2019re been very popular, because they provide a better interest rate than many other bonds. BUT.... that\u2019s because they could potentially be turned into shares, or even wiped out. Deutsche\u2019s CoCos have been slumping in value recently, on fears that the bank will struggle to get enough cash to meet the repayments (last night, it insisted the April 2016 payment was safe). Want to know more? Great. Bloomberg has published a useful Q&amp;A. Here\u2019s a flavour: So how does it work? CoCos typically allow a bank to stop interest payments when it runs into trouble, like when its capital ratios breach levels considered dangerous (that\u2019s the \u201ccontingent\u201d part). If the bank\u2019s financial health deteriorates further, CoCos can force losses on bondholders. The bonds can lose their value entirely or change into common stock (that\u2019s the \u201cconvertible\u201d part). How do banks determine whether they can pay? This is where it gets really technical. To make optional payments such as dividends, bonuses and coupons on CoCos, banks must calculate their \u201cavailable distributable items,\u201d or ADIs. Deutsche Bank, which has to make the calculation based on its audited, unconsolidated accounts under German GAAP, has thinner coverage than other major banks, prompting the current volatility. Why did regulators create CoCos? During the financial crisis, taxpayers had to inject billions of dollars into failing banks, while investors in those lenders\u2019 bonds were often fully repaid. Officials wanted to create ways to avoid this in the future. Here\u2019s the full piece: How the Bank Debt That Everyone Is Talking About Works: Q&amp;A It\u2019s tough being a bank right now: Chins up, though. It could be worse: Here\u2019s that sudden slide in the Brent crude oil price, back down to $30.60/barrel. That may alarm crude producers, as they gather in London for International Petroleum Week. And the oil slide is getting worse. Brent crude is now down 6% at $30.92 a barrel on reports that US stockpiles will show an increase in the latest weekly figures, adding to fears of lack of demand and a continuing supply glut. According to a Reuters survey, crude stockpiles are expected to have risen by 3.9m barrels last week. Meanwhile the Energy Information Administration said it had cut its forecasts for oil demand in 2016 by 110,000 barrels a day and by 260,000 barrels in 2017. That seems to have pushed Wall Street even lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now down 136 points or 0.8%. Oil prices continue to fall, with Brent crude now down 3.8% at $31.63 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - down 2.2% at $29.01. Earlier the International Energy Agency said the world will be stockpiling excess oil for most of 2016, and cut its forecast for demand this year, meaning the supply glut will continue for some while yet. Global markets, as measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index, are close to a bear market, that is, 20% below their recent peak: In yet another volatile day, European markets were firmly in the red once more as investors shied away from risk. With Japanese 10 year bond yields turning negative in another sign of the growing fear of a global recession, poor German industrial figures and a widening trade gap in the UK, there was no shortage of downbeat news. Banks were in the firing line again on worries about their exposure to struggling sectors and the implications of negative interest rates, in particular Deutsche Bank despite its attempts to calm worries about the state of its business. The Stoxx Europe 600 banking index - which includes the likes of Deutsche Bank, Barclays, and HSBC lost another 3.97% and is now down more than 27% on the year. Wall Street is also in a turbulent mood, opening lower, recovering into positive territory after reasonable US jobs data and a rebound in technology stocks, before falling once more. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently arouind 70 points or 0.4% lower, but the US market performance did help pull European markets away from their worst levels. So in Europe the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 57.17 points or 1% to 5632.19, a new three year low. Earlier it dropped as low as 5596 Germany\u2019s Dax lost 1.1% to 8879.4 France\u2019s Cac closed down 1.69% at 3997.54 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 3.21% to 15913.12 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 2.39% lower at 7927.6 In Greece, the Athens market is down another 2.89% to 450.83 Risk analyst and author of the bestseller The Black Swan, Nassim Nicholas Taleb on Deutsche Bank: More on the latest jobs data from the US, ahead of Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen testifying to Congress on Wednesday. Economist Harm Bandholz at UniCredit said: Following Friday\u2019s solid employment report, today\u2019s JOLTS report was another display of strength: Job openings rose to 5.6m, the second highest since the beginning of the series in 2001, while the number of quits \u2013 i.e. voluntary separations by employees \u2013 rose to 3.1m, the highest since late 2006. The latter suggests a growing number of more profitable job opportunities for workers as the labor market is approaching full employment. This notion is consistent with the recent pick-up in average hourly earnings at the turn of the year. These underlying statistics, which usually get less attention that payroll gains or the unemployment rate, help to complete the assessment of the labor market situation. And chair Yellen is known to put particular emphasis on the JOLTS data. Accordingly, she should mention them tomorrow in the context of an improving labor market. Skeptics may argue that these numbers are backward looking, and that spillovers from tighter financial conditions or the energy slump will curb labor market dynamics in the months to come. This is certainly a risk, and one important reason, why the Fed is currently sitting back and wait. But why should this happen now, when it hasn\u2019t over the past several months? After all, oil prices have started to fall in mid-2014, and most of the adjustment occurred in the first half of 2015. Investment in mining structures has plummeted by 51% in 2015, with more than half of the drop occurring in the first half of the year. Similarly, the rig count plunged by more than 70% since the peak in September 2014, with almost 80% of that drop before the middle of last year. Since then, more than half a year has passed without any negative spill-overs to other parts of economy. Quite the contrary: The employment situation has improved further and workers are now feeling it. JP Morgan has worked out what it thinks are the exposure of European and US banks to the struggling oil and gas sector - and it amounts to $250bn: The FTSE 100\u2019s fall to three year lows is an overreaction, according to the Centre for Economics and Business Research. The research group said it had been warning about the weakness of the global economy for some time, and said in particular that the US Federal Reserve\u2019s rate rise in December was premature. But the current market falls were overdone. Scott Corfe, director and head of macroeconomics at Cebr, said: Markets have somewhat belatedly woken up to the underlying state of economic reality. We will be in a world of sluggish growth, loose monetary policy and low commodity prices for some time. As usual with the markets, it is either feast or famine. Our best view of the current circumstances is that, despite all the risks, we should avoid another financial crisis. In particular, Chinese policymakers have sufficient fiscal and monetary ammunition to revitalise the world\u2019s second largest economy. More quantitative easing in the Eurozone, and possibly the US, should also help. So the most likely scenario is modest growth in the world economy this year. When the reality of this is understood and if there is further monetary relaxation, it is quite likely that the markets will turn. They tend to be a useful lagging indicator. Here\u2019s a quick snapshot of how top banks have performed since the start of the year (spoilers: badly), courtesy of David Buik of Panmure Gordon: Some positive news on US jobs. The number of job openings increased to 5.6m in December, up from 5.43m in the previous months and compared to expectations of a dip to 5.41m. The quits rate - which the US Federal Reserve considers a sign of worker confidence in the jobs market - rose to 3.1m. Those figures seemed to calm Wall Street for a moment, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average moving into positive territory before slipping back again. Here are the moves in the Dow Jones Industrial Average: Wall Street is stabilising a little, but the main indices are still down. The New York opening bell is ringing, getting trading underway on Wall Street. And shares are dropping. The Dow Jones has lost 137 points in an early bout of selling, sending the index down 0.8% to 15,893. The S&amp;P 500 index (the broadest measure of US shares) has lost 0.75% And the Nasdaq index (heavy with tech stocks) is down 1.39% The European selloff is gathering speed, as investors brace for Wall Street to open any moment... The FTSE 100 is now down 89 points at 5600, which by my reckoning is the lowest since July 2012 Germany finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, has just weighed in, telling Bloomberg TV that he has \u2018no concerns\u2019 about Deutsche Bank. That\u2019s the most senior intervention yet, coming shortly after CEO John Cryan told staff the bank \u201cremains absolutely rock-solid\u201d. Here\u2019s the details: German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble said he isn\u2019t worried about Deutsche Bank, amid rising investor concern over the bank\u2019s finances. \u201cI have no concerns about Deutsche Bank,\u201d he told Bloomberg Television after a press conference in Paris. Sch\u00e4uble was attending a joint meeting of French and German finance ministers and central bank chiefs in Paris. Make that 5%..... As we flagged up this morning, Deutsche Bank is one of several banks who is now trading significantly below its book value -- what its portfolio of assets, liabilities, capital reserves, etc is actually worth. Deutsche Bank\u2019s shares have now lost another 3.5%, hitting \u20ac13.30. That\u2019s just below the lowpoint set in early 2009, after Lehman Brothers failed, and is the lowest since at least 1992 (my data doesn\u2019t go back any further). Wall Street is still expected to open in the red, at 9.30am New York time (2.30pm GMT). According to IG, the Dow will shed around 150 points at the open, a drop of 0.9%. They also predict that the VIX \u201cfear\u201d index, which tracks volatility, will jump by over 4%. That shows rising nervousness, although not a full-blown panic. European stocks are now languishing at their lowest level since September 2013, as the market rout continues to ripple across trading floors. The benchmark FTSeurofirst 100 index has lost 1.9% today, driven down by banking shares. The European banking index is down 3.4%, hit by fears over Italy\u2019s financial sector, and by Deutsche Bank (now down 3% since that \u2018rock solid\u2019 memo). The selloff puts more pressure on the European Central Bank to announce new stimulus measures next month, as Reuters explains: The banking index was set for its biggest weekly losing streak since 1998 as investors fret over the threat to banks\u2019 profitability and capital strength from compressed interest rate margins. \u201cThe mood is clearly negative. What is needed is a strong and clear message from the ECB,\u201d said Activtrades chief market analyst Carlo Alberto De Casa. Shares in London are falling at a faster pace now, dragging the FTSE 100 down to its lowest intraday level since late 2012. The blue-chip index has shed 76 points now, as jitters over the global economy rear up again. The FTSE is now down at 5,613 points, a drop of 1.3% today, smashing through the previous three-year low set last month (when London slumped into a Bear Market amid a wave of panic selling). The London market is being dragged down by mining shares, reflecting concerns about economic prospects: The biggest faller is Antofagasta, a major copper producer, followed by Anglo American - whose interests include iron ore, nickel, and coal. Their shares have been under pressure for months, as emerging market problems have hit demand for commodities. Deutsche Bank\u2019s claim that it is \u201crock-solid\u201d doesn\u2019t appear to have stabilised the markets. And the prospect of losses on Wall Street today is adding to the nervous feeling in the City, as traders reach for their metaphorical tin hats. Wall Street is expected to suffer fresh losses when trading begins in under two hours time. The futures market is predicting that the Dow will drop by 121 points, or 0.75%, with similar falls on the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500. FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga says investors have no appetitive for risk assets right now, given fears over a global recession. It must be understood that confidence towards the global economy remains strikingly low, while the bitter decline in oil prices has soured risk appetite consequently obstructing any solid recovery in the stock markets. I\u2019m not sure Deutsche Bank should really be speculating about whether the market selloff has gone too far.... Deutsche Bank\u2019s chief executive has issued an open letter to staff, in an attempt to calm fears over the company. John Cryan, who took over last year, told employees that Deutsche is \u201cabsolutely rock solid\u201d. Last week, at one of our scheduled off-sites, the Management Board talked about progress on our strategy, and how recent market volatility and forecasts for slowing economic growth might impact our clients and us. Volatility in the fourth quarter impacted the earnings of most major banks, especially those in Europe, and clients may ask you about how the market-wide volatility is impacting Deutsche Bank. You can tell them that Deutsche Bank remains absolutely rock-solid, given our strong capital and risk position. On Monday, we took advantage of this strength to reassure the market of our capacity and commitment to pay coupons to investors who hold our Additional Tier 1 capital. This type of instrument has been the subject of recent market concern. The market also expressed some concern about the adequacy of our legal provisions but I don\u2019t share that concern. We will almost certainly have to add to our legal provisions this year but this is already accounted for in our financial plan. Cryan also explains how he wants to turn Deutsche into \u201ca trusted and successful bank\u201d. It has been involved in several scandals in recent years, and was fined for doing business with US-sanctioned countries like Iran and Syria. The letter is online here. Cryan is obviously keen to douse concerns that Deutsche is struggling, after it reported a \u20ac6bn loss last October. Shares in Deutsche Bank are falling, though. After a solid start, they\u2019re now down 1%, adding to yesterday\u2019s 9% tumble. Mining companies are leading the selloff in London: Heads-up, UK readers. The Economist Intelligence Unit has predicted that British interest rates will stay on hold until 2020! The EIU argues that the UK recovery is much more vulnerable than previously thought. US economy will experience a downturn in 2019, they predict, while rising levels of indebtedness in China will pose another challenge. And that means: We no longer expect tightening to begin in the final quarter of this year. We now expect the Bank of England to hold off on tightening for the next four years at least. That\u2019s a pretty dovish forecast. Many economists reckon the first rate hike will come in 2017 or 2018. European markets are falling deeper into the red, as lunchtime approaches. The Stoxx 600 index, which tracks the 600 largest companies across Europe, has dropped by 0.7% to a new 16-month low. Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB has lost another 1.7%, the French CAC is down 1% and the German Dax has lost 0.6%, despite the forced-looking air of jollity among the fancy-dressed traders. In London, the Footsie 100 is down 31 points or 0.5%, as traders continue to be depressed by the slump in Japan overnight. Achilles Macris has just issued a response to the FCA\u2019s decision to fine him \u00a3792,000 today for not being open over the London Whale case. Macris claims it\u2019s a \u201cmajor climbdown\u201d by the regulator, because the FCA has belatedly accepted that he never intentionally misled them. He declares: The Final Notice issued to JP Morgan by the FCA in 2013 wrongly and unfairly accused me of deliberately misleading the FSA. That Notice was released to the public without the FCA ever having properly heard my side of the story. Today the FCA has finally accepted that this allegation against me was utterly wrong. Today\u2019s result also vindicates my actions in bringing my third party reference seeking to have this allegation removed from the JP Morgan Notice. The FCA demonstrated a total disregard for my rights as an individual in its haste to issue the JP Morgan Notice and impose a large fine on the firm. Macris is also taking his case to the Supreme Court, and wants the FCA to expunge that original Notice. The FCA has had several opportunities to admit its mistakes, but instead, at every turn, it has until now sought to defend and justify its position, wasting public funds. Yikes. The yield (interest rate) on Greek 10-year bonds has hit its highest level since last August. Some investors are losing faith in Greece\u2019s ability to implement its third bailout and get debt relief. Talks with its creditors over pensions reforms are bogged down, farmers are blockading roads to demonstrate against austerity, and exporters are suffering from the capital controls imposed last summer. Although European markets are rather calmer than yesterday, there\u2019s an awful lot of jitteriness around. Ironically, the Asian Lunar New Year appears to have actually made things worse, rather than just remove the volatile Chinese indices from the mix. Kit Juckes, experienced currency strategist at French Bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, explains: The absence of many Asian market participants just adds to woeful liquidity conditions, while concerns about commodities, Chinese currency policy and global slowdown haven\u2019t gone away at all. Add to that sharp widening in subordinated European bank spreads and we have the makings of a very nervous market. Wondering whether to be fearful or cheerful today? Our video runs though the reasons to panic, or be optimistic The banking sector likes to argue that it has mended its ways since the financial crisis struck. Critics aren\u2019t convinced. So it\u2019s worth noting that Britain\u2019s City watchdog has just slapped a \u00a3792,900 fine on a former senior JP Morgan banker, over one of the biggest scandals of recent years. Achilles Macris, the ex head of CIO International for JPMorgan Chase Bank, has been sanctioned for failing to be \u201copen and co-operative\u201d with regulators over the \u201cLondon Whale trades\u201d which ultimately cost them \u00a313bn. The London Whale was Bruno Iksil \u2013 whose bullish and complicated trades turned sour in 2012. Despite the potential risks, Macris didn\u2019t tell the Financial Conduct Authority the full extent of the problems, they say. This made it harder for the FCA to judge the situation, and also made it harder for more junior staff to be open and cooperative. Mark Steward, director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, says: \u2018A failure to communicate openly with us can affect the well-running of markets and cause unnecessary harm to investors, especially in times of financial stress or crisis. Regulators need open communication with firms so that better decisions can be made sooner. Mr Macris should have explained the position more squarely especially when he knew the Synthetic Credit Portfolio\u2019s losses had worsened.\u2019 What a shame that the review in to Britain\u2019s banking culture has been shelved.... Here\u2019s a reminder of the most astonishing development of the day (so far) -- investors are now paying for the privilege to lend to the Japanese government for the next decade: Yield is the interest rate on a bond. A high yield means a bond is riskier, while safe-haven assets yield less. Short-term German and Japanese bonds have been negative for a while, reflecting the fact that they\u2019re a solid place to put your money (especially as there are negative interest rates in Japan and the eurozone). But for a 10-year bond to be negative? That shows investors are pricing in weak economic growth, and turmoil, for some time. Nice summary of the situation from Bloomberg: if you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s our latest news story on the upheaval in the global markets: The huge selloff in Japan overnight has hit sentiment hard in the City today. Investors had been hoping that the Chinese New Year holiday would bring some calm; instead, traders have been staring at a 918-point tumble on the Nikkei. Alastair McCaig of spread-betting firm IG explains: Any hope investors might have had that the absence of China would enable markets to reduce volatility and rebalance some of the overly bearish sentiment has been quashed by Japan. In London, the Footsie is struggling to hold onto any gains, while there are further losses across Europe - on top of Monday\u2019s rout. The Italian market has lost another 1%, as fears over its banking sector mount up (see this earlier post for details) The government debt of some peripheral European countries, including Portugal and Greece, is coming under pressure today. Is the eurozone debt crisis rearing up again?.... McCaig says it\u2019s another worry: The situation in Greece was never resolved, merely delayed until later. Greek 10-year sovereign debt is now yielding over 10% \u2013 a jump of 25% in little over a month, and 50% from its lows in November last year. The gap between what Britain imports and exports has hit a record high, in a worrying signal. During 2015, the UK imported around \u00a310bn more physical stuff than it exported each month. And that means Britain posted a trade in goods deficit of \u00a3125bn last year, up from last year\u2019s all time high of \u00a3123.1bn. Worryingly, UK good exports fell by \u00a38.1bn last year, while imports of goods fell by \u00a36.2bn. That was partly balanced by Britain\u2019s a \u00a390bn surplus in service sector trade (the City does have its uses). But overall, the annual trade deficit widened to \u00a334.7bn in 2015, up \u00a30.3 billion from 2014. Here\u2019s the report. In December alone, the trade gap came in at \u00a32.7bn. And this is bad news for the economic recovery, as net trade is continuing to drag on growth. It knocked one whole percentage point off GDP growth in the third quarter of 2015, for example. The ONS also warns that growth in UK exports to China slowed last year... It says: The slower growth in UK exports to China may reflect the easing in output growth and domestic growth in China, lowering the demand for UK goods and services. There\u2019s no prospect of the global oil glut ending anytime soon. That\u2019s the latest warning from the International Energy Agency. The IEA has just predicted that the world will be stockpiling excess oil for most of 2016, as the price war launched by OPEC has failed to kill the US shale industry. The IEA also cut its forecast for oil demand this year, which will only add to the glut. And as for prices, the IEA says it is \u201cvery hard to see how oil prices can rise significantly\u201d, if crude oil stockpiles continue to grow. Oil is currently changing hands at $33 per barrel -- good news for consumers, and countries who import the stuff. But it\u2019s already having a serious impact on petro-producers such as Russia and Saudi Arabia, energy companies, and the banks who have lent to them.... Has the stock market selloff gone too far? Banking analyst Sandy Chen argues that there are bargains out there. He points out that some banks, including Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays and HSBC, are now trading significantly below their \u2018book value\u2019 (their market capitalisation is below the actual value of their assets). Chen says: Looking at valuations, it appears that another Global Financial Crisis is already priced-in. These low valuations were only seen in the depths of the 2008/9 financial crisis, after Lehman Brothers failed. So the City is pricing in some \u201chorrendous losses\u201d. Clearly the situation in China isn\u2019t pretty, as Beijing tries to avoid a hard economic landing. But Chan argues the Chinese banks and regional authorities will absorb the brunt of the losses. So, this could be a good moment for \u2018value investors\u2019 to dip back into the market. Or, the City might be right, and the financial sector could be heading into another big crisis. Caveat emptor.... Banks are being hit by a \u201cdangerous cocktail\u201d of risks, warns Mike van Dulken of City firm Accendo Markets. Those risks include: slowing economic growth (the IMF downgraded its forecasts last month) more widespread use of negative interest rates (now in Japan and the eurozone) financial market turbulence (major stock markets have lost between 8% and 15% since January 1st) a protracted commodity market depression (oil hit a 13-year low last month) rising bad loans (from commodity exposure) which could affect their ability to repay debt. And that\u2019s why European bank shares have lost a quarter of their value this year. Curious scenes in Frankfurt today, where traders have dressed up in carnival costumes for Shrove Tuesday.... European banks are coming under the cosh this morning, as investors anticipate further problems ahead. The Stoxx 600 Banks index, which tracks financial stocks across Europe, has fallen by 1.7% already today. That follows a 5.6% fall yesterday. The sector has now lost 25% of its value since the start of 2016, as fears of a global downturn have savaged market valuations. Italian banking stocks are leading the fallers, reflecting concerns that they are bogged down with bad loans. Prime Minister Renzi\u2019s government is pushing Italian banks to clean up their balance sheets, but an economic downturn could make the problem even worse. Mining stocks are taking a hammering this morning, dragging the Footsie into the red again: That positive London open didn\u2019t last long. The FTSE is now down 15 points..... Shares in Deutsche Bank have risen by 2%, as investors gingerly return to the Frankfurt trading floor. Deutsche plunged by 9% yesterday, prompting the bank to insist last night that it can meet an April repayment on its riskiest bonds. These are the CoCos, or contingent convertible bonds, which pay an attractive interest rate - but will be converted to shares if the bank hits trouble. European stock markets are open....and staggering back from yesterday\u2019s turmoil. In London, the FTSE 100 has risen by 35 points, or 0.6%. Insurance firm Legal &amp; General is leading the way, up 3.5%, followed by retailers Kingfisher (which runs the B&amp;Q DIY chain) and Next, both up 2%. But mining shares are leading the fallers, with copper producer Antofagasta down 3.3%, Anglo American down 2.4% and Rio Tinto off 1.9%. They\u2019re all vulnerable to a global downturn, which will push commodity prices down even further.... Traders on the Philippine Stock Exchange had an interesting day -- a crowd of lion dancers and dragons popped in, to celebrate the Lunar New Year. Despite this excitement, though, the main Philippine stock index fell by 1.9%. We have bad news from Germany -- industrial production at the eurozone\u2019s powerhouse economy tumbled by 1.2% in December. That\u2019s much worse than expected; economists had pencilled in a 0.4% rise in factory output. It suggest the slowdown in emerging markets is now hitting Europe, threatening its fragile recovery since the eurozone crisis. The fall was driven by a 2.6% slump in the manufacturing of investment goods, while energy production fell by 3% percent and consumer goods output fell 1.4%. ING economist Carsten Brzeski isn\u2019t prone to exaggeration, but even he is alarmed: He writes: While the industry had been able to stomach the cooling of the Chinese economy, the slowdown of emerging markets, the euro crisis and geopolitical risks, it now seems as if extremely low oil prices and the slowdown of the US economy are simply two risks too much for the industry. Germany already has plenty to worry about, given the uncertainty over Deutsche Bank. Falling factory output could hit public confidence, warns that Economist Intelligence Unit: In another alarming development, the yield (interest rate) on Japanese 10-year government bonds has turned negative for the first time. That means investors are prepared to pay Tokyo for the privilege of lending to it for the next decade. That shows how much anxiety has built up in the markets right now, and also shows the impact of Japan\u2019s new negative interest rates (which penalise banks for leaving money in the Bank of Japan\u2019s vaults) Japanese manufacturers were also hit hard today, as the yen strengthened against the US dollar (hurting exporters). Car makers were singled out - with Honda falling by 6.4%, Nissan losing 6.8% and Toyota dropped 5.9%. Kei Okamura, assistant investment manager at Aberdeen Investment Management, says investors are fretting about weak Japanese economy, which forced the Bank of Japan to impose negative interest rates last week. \u201cI think this sort of succession of events is feeding through to pessimism in the market,\u201d Okamura said (via Reuters) Kaneo Ogino, director at foreign exchange research firm Global-info Co in Tokyo, says there was a \u201cpanic situation\u201d in Asian markets today. Here\u2019s Justin McCurry\u2019s report of the turmoil which wiped almost 1,000 points at one stage. Fears of a global recession have sparked a wild selloff in Japan today. After plunging through the day, the benchmark Nikkei index has closed down 5.5% in a wave of panicky selling. That wiped 918 points off the Nikkei, leaving it at 16,085. That\u2019s the biggest one-day plunge in three years, as full-blown angst grips the markets. Jo Masters, a senior economist at ANZ, says: \u201cSentiment towards risk assets remained extremely bearish and price action reflected a market that may be capitulating.\u201d Banks led the rout, hit by the concerns over the world financial sector. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group sank 8.7% and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group plunged by 9.0%. Other markets were badly hit too, with Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200 shedding 2.8%. It was a \u201cday of trauma\u201d for bullish investors, says Chris Weston at IG. He fears that the market rout is going to continue, with banks pulled deeper into the line of fire: There is huge demand for portfolio protection in all asset classes and it just doesn\u2019t feel like we are going to see a major turn anytime soon. One can then do a sense check as to what will effectively turn this juggernaut of pain around and this is not a question that is readily answered. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. No prizes for guessing what we\u2019ll be covering today. After Monday\u2019s stock market rout, which wiped \u00a340bn of leading shares in London, fears over the state of the global economy and the financial sector are gripping the markets again today. It\u2019s been a wild day in Asia, as investors in Japan caught up with the slump in Europe and on Wall Street yesterday. And European shares are expected to keep falling when trading begins: Michael Hewson of CMC Markets sets the scene: If investors were hoping for a quiet week away from concerns about China with Chinese markets closed for Chinese New Year, they got a very rude awakening yesterday as stock markets sold off hard, and there was no respite in Asia markets either despite a late rebound off the lows in the US and as such we could well see European markets open lower today. The catalyst appeared to come from the European banking sector as screens flashed red across the board in scenes of total carnage, with equity markets selling off hard across the board over concerns about the future profitability of the whole sector, in an era where interest rates look set to go further into negative territory. Germany\u2019s Deutsche Bank is in the spotlight - last night, it issued a statement reassuring investors that it can meet bond payments in April. The big fear is that this turbulence starts feeding through to businesses and the public dragging the global economy downwards. And concern is already building that the UK government is facing a nasty black hole in its fiscal plans, as our front page shows: If you missed the IFS story yesterday, it\u2019s here. What\u2019s coming up today? Well, there are two pieces of economic data that could shift the dial: 7am GMT: New German industrial production data 9.30am: UK trade figures for December. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

However, that is sounding rather hollow right now. We see the continued inclusion of this text as an attempt to portray an open mind about the recent activity slowdown, and not to present a self-fulfilling picture of gloom at the Fed. Financial markets may see this as dovish speech overall, though probably not out of line with expectations.<br></p> <p>There was also a somewhat defensive paragraph justifying the December rate hike \u2013 we expect that once the questioning starts, Chair Yellen will come in for some stick from disgruntled members of Congress, some of whom may be facing a hostile electorate later this year.<br></p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-02-10T14:24:16.282Z\">at 2.24pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-56bb457ae4b084d24a9f080f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-10T14:14:49.558Z\">2.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One interpretation of Yellen\u2019s remarks on rates is that she is admitting they were raised too soon, says Augustin Eden at Accendo Markets.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A not unusually muted reaction to Fed Chair Janet Yellen\u2019s testimony this afternoon, given that she\u2019s come out and said \u2018financial conditions in the US have recently become less supportive of growth.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t take a 1<sup>st</sup> class physicist to recognise that this is essentially another way of saying \u2018we raised interest rates before we should have.\u2019</p> <p>Nothing had fundamentally changed in December, but the Fed decided to ignore the fundamentals and move US monetary policy to a place that\u2019s less supportive of growth.

In addition, the Committee recognized that it takes time for monetary policy actions to affect economic conditions.</p> <p>If the FOMC delayed the start of policy normalization for too long, it might have to tighten policy relatively abruptly in the future to keep the economy from overheating and inflation from significantly overshooting its objective. Such an abrupt tightening could increase the risk of pushing the economy into recession.</p> <p>It is important to note that even after this increase, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56bb413fe4b0dde64e262b88\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-10T13:56:21.252Z\">1.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Janet Yellen has also said that the Fed would slow the pace of interest rate hikes, if the threats to the US economy materialise.</strong></p> <p>She tells the Committee on Financial Services that:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In particular, stronger growth or a more rapid increase in inflation than the Committee currently anticipates would suggest that the neutral federal funds rate was rising more quickly than expected, making it appropriate to raise the federal funds rate more quickly as well.</p> <p>Conversely, if the economy were to disappoint, a lower path of the Federal funds rate would be appropriate. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-02-10T14:01:42.581Z\">at 2.01pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-56bb40aae4b0cc2320172517\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-10T13:53:23.888Z\">1.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The full testimony is <strong><a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/yellen20160210a.htm\">here</a></strong>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56bb3f58e4b0cc2320172512\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-10T13:51:11.148Z\">1.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Yellen: We'll probably only raise rates gradually</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Janet Yellen has also touched on the big issue dominating the markets - how quickly will interest rates rise?</strong><br></p> <p>She sounds cautious, but neither rules anything in or out (classic central banker)</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe FOMC anticipates that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate. </p> <p>In addition, the Committee expects that the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below the levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>(the FOMC, or Federal Open Market Committee, meets eight times a year to set US monetary policy)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Riccanomix/status/697412693775540224\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Yellen hints of slower rate hikes, hewing to tone of gradualism, but does not signal Fed on hold.</p>&mdash; Carl Riccadonna (@Riccanomix) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Riccanomix/status/697412693775540224\">February 10, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Riccanomix/status/697414195680251904\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Yellen acknowledges risks, but signals Fed on appropriate course--could move slower, but not turning back.</p>&mdash; Carl Riccadonna (@Riccanomix) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Riccanomix/status/697414195680251904\">February 10, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56bb3e3fe4b0dde64e262b77\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-10T13:46:31.039Z\">1.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Yellen: China slowdown could hurt America</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Janet Yellen has also warned that \u201cforeign economic developments\u201d could harm the US economy.</strong><br></p> <p>In her testimony to Congress, the Fed chair singles out concerns about the slowdown in China. </p> <p>That has already caused \u201cincreased volatility in global financial markets\u201d, and \u201cexacerbated concerns about the outlook for global growth\u201d, says Yellen.</p> <p>She adds: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>These growth concerns, along with strong supply conditions and high inventories, contributed to the recent fall in the prices of oil and other commodities.

                "bodyText":"That\u2019s all for tonight, after another lively day. A quick reminder of the key points. Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen has warned that the turmoil in the markets could hurt the US economy. She hinted the interest rates will only rise slowly, but tried to dampen speculation that the Fed could cut borrowing costs. Here\u2019s our summary of her testimony to Congress. The Dow Jones index closed down 99 points after Yellen spoke. The dollar weakened, as traders anticipated more dovish monetary policy this year. European markets had rallied back from two-year lows, on hopes that the recent selloff had gone to far. Bank shares led the rebound, with Deutsche Bank gaining 10%, after Germany\u2019s heavyweight began planning to buy back debt to strengthen its financial position. Credit Suisse boss Tidjane Thiam became the latest top bank executive to call for calm. He argued that banks are in much better shape than before the 2008 crisis. But Australia\u2019s market earlier fell into bear territory, having lost 20% since its recent high last April. Japan\u2019s Nikkei also suffered losses on Wednesday. The International Monetary Fund threatened to pull the plug on Ukraine\u2019s bailout. It wants its government to cleans our corruption and implements reforms. And new data showed that Europe\u2019s factory sector had a bad December; Britain\u2019s industrial output fell by 1.1% during the month. Goodnight! GW It now seems pretty unlikely that the Fed will risk raising interest rates in March, for fear of throwing fuel on the fire. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, says: As most analysts spotted, the key phrase in Janet Yellen\u2019s testimony was when she said conditions in the US had become \u201cless supportive of growth\u201d. That suggested a Fed belief that the drop in share prices will slow the economy but not derail it completely. Yellen\u2019s wait-and-see approach means that a March increase in interest rates is now off the agenda, but the Fed will require more evidence before abandoning its strategy of cautious tightening. With the spectre of 2008 looming larger, that evidence may not be long in coming. Here\u2019s our US colleague\u2019s Jana Kasperkevic\u2019s take on Janet Yellen\u2019s testimony: And here\u2019s a flavour: In her first major speech for two months, Yellen sought to tread a fine line, acknowledging the threat posed by the financial tremors while at the same time pointing out that the US had continued to recover from the deep recession of 2008-09. The Fed chief said: \u201cThe economy is in many ways close to normal.\u201d Specifically, Yellen pointed out that the unemployment rate had declined to below 5%, which many of her Fed colleagues consider to be full employment, and that inflation was likely to move up to 2%. What was not normal, she said, were the federal funds rates, which had to be held for seven years at \u201cexceptionally low levels\u201d. Yellen added that oil prices, steady job creation and faster wage growth should support growth of incomes and consumer spending. \u201cAgainst this backdrop, the committee expects that with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace in coming years and that labour market indicators will continue to strengthen,\u201d she said....(click here for more) Janet Yellen makes the front page of the Financial Times, with her warning about deteriorating financial conditions threatening the US recovery: Another turbulent day in the financial markets is over! And the Dow Jones index has finished in the red, losing 99 points or 0.6% to finish at 15,914, as investors digested Janet Yellen\u2019s testimony. As we covered earlier (summary here), the Fed chair warned that financial conditions have worsened, which could mean future interest rate hikes come more slowly. But she also said she didn\u2019t see rates being cut again. The broader S&amp;P 500 index was unchanged, while the Nasdaq inched up a bit. That means Wall Street failed to match the early rally in Europe, where shares rebounded from two year lows. That followed a weak Asia-Pacific region; earlier, Australia\u2019s market fell into bear territory, and Japan\u2019s Nikkei lost another 2%. Janet Yellen\u2019s hearing at Congress was also attended by a group of protesters from the Fed Up campaign, who oppose December\u2019s rate hike. Wearing green t-shirts reading \u201cRecovery, What Recovery?\u201d, they sat behind the Fed chief during the session in a reminder that the public aren\u2019t too happy about economic conditions right now. A quiet end to the session? That would be too much to ask. A sudden bout of selling has hit Wall Street, sending the Dow down around 100 points, or 0.6%.... The dollar has fallen against the yen, hitting a 15-month low. That indicates traders are calculating that the Fed will be more cautious about interest rate rises, after Yellen said financial conditions had become less supportive for growth. Yellen also managed to reassure investors, says Richard Sichel, chief investment officer of Philadelphia Trust Co. Sichel told Reuters that the Fed chair managed to spur some bargain hunting, even through she also flagged up economic risks: \u201cWhat Yellen said has been taken positively. Stocks in general are cheaper now than they were three days ago or three months ago, so there\u2019s an opportunity to step in.\u201d Cornerstone Macro analyst Roberto Perli believes Janet Yellen managed to leave her monetary policy options open, even though few investors expect many rate hikes this year. Perli says: \u201cThe general message she intended to deliver is that additional rate hikes remain the base case, but markets have to stabilize before we see more.\u201d The US stock market is holding onto its earlier gains, after Janet Yellen completed her appearance at Congress. The S&amp;P 500 is up almost 1%, following the earlier rally in Europe. Joshua Mahony, Market Analyst at IG, says Yellen gave a \u201cmixed testimony\u201d. Her acknowledgement that a Chinese-centred slowdown is detrimentally impacting US growth expectations was offset by yet another reference to a plan for steady and gradual rate rises going forward. A few photos of today\u2019s session: Capital Economics says that Janet Yellen is still more hawkish about interest rate policy than the markets. They write: Fed Chair Janet Yellen\u2019s testimony to Congress today revealed that, while the FOMC might not be ready to raise interest rates for a second time in March, she still anticipates a \u201cgradual\u201d series of rate hikes over the next couple of years. That view is clearly at odds with futures markets, which imply that any additional rate hikes are almost now off the table. Let\u2019s recap the main points from today\u2019s hearing at the Financial Services committee over the last three (long...) hours. 1) Janet Yellen has warned Congress that the global financial turbulence is threatening the US economic recovery. She cited the weakening financial conditions in America, following recent turmoil in the financial markets. \u201cThese developments, if they prove persistent, could weigh on the outlook for economic activity and the labour market, although declines in longer-term interest rates and oil prices provide some offset.\u201d One analyst saw that as an admission that the Fed perhaps shouldn\u2019t have raised interest rates two months ago. 2) But despite this, the Fed chair did not suggest she will reverse course on interest rates. She defended December\u2019s rate hike, arguing that the economy was strong enough to support slightly higher borrowing costs. And she also insisted that any future rises will be heavily dependent on economic performance -- if things deteriorate, the Fed rate will stay exceptionally low for longer. She doesn\u2019t expect to actually cut rate, though, which suggests the Fed isn\u2019t panicking about the situation. 3) But could the Fed go negative, following Japan and the eurozone? Crucially, Yellen indicated that this isn\u2019t really on the agenda yet. She pointed out that the Fed may not have the legal authority to impose negative rates; you\u2019d think this would have been cleared up, if the Fed was really worried. This was the key quote: \u201cI am not aware of anything that would prevent us from doing it but I am saying that we have not fully investigated the legal issues - that still needs to be done.\u201d 4) Yellen have her clearest warning yet about China. She said the financial instability, and plunging commodity prices, caused by its slowing economy was a key threat to the US. 5) But she also tried to remain positive about economic conditions, saying she sees signs of wage growth increasing. \u201cThere are some hopeful signs but I think if the labor market continues to progress we are very hopeful we will see faster progress on wages.\u201d She also argued that families are better off than in 2008, when the financial crisis struck. 6) The Committee raised several other important issues with Yellen; they fear that small challenger banks are being disadvantaged, and want the Fed to release the transcripts of its meetings from 2012, to assist a leak inquiry. Despite Sean Duffy\u2019s best efforts, he only got a holding reply from the Federal Reserve\u2019s top official. The Fed was also criticised for not doing enough to bring down African-American unemployment, and for never even having an African-American regional bank chief. Yellen agreed this is disappointing. And several Representatives challenged Yellen over the state of the domestic economy, pointing out that not enough well-paying \u2018middle-class\u2019 jobs are being created. One was even moved to verse (yes, it was that kind of day....) Congress chair Jeb Hensarling says members have five days to submit further questions for Yellen to respond to. And with that the meeting is adjourned. John Delaney of Maryland says when rates were raised in December, it was based on an improving economy. A lot has happened since then in the markets. When you look at the data now, does it change your view on economic activity and gowth Yellen: The answer is maybe, but the jury is out. We continue to see progress in labour market. GDP growth clearly slowed a lot in the fourth quarter. My expectation is it will pick up in this quarter but financial conditions have tightened which could have implications. Then, we said the risks to outlook were balanced. In January said we were assessing the implications. This is what we\u2019re doing at this point. Has there been a contraction in credit availability recently? Yellen: We haven\u2019t seen this really at this stage. Spreads on lower graded bonds have been widening... When we surveyed banks we\u2019ve seen a tightening of.. loans. This is something that bears watching. There will be additional data before we meet in March [The next Fed meeting}. Andy Barr of Kentucky is asking about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and its funding. Yellen seems unsure of the answers, and starts packing her bag. Keith Ellison of Minnesota also brings up the subject of the high levels of black unemployment. He says this needs the attention of the Fed chair. Is there adequate discussion of Afro-American workers within Fed discussions and if not, what can be done. Yellen: It is of course important we look at different groups, particularly those suffering most in the labour market. Our tools are not ones that can be targeted at particular groups in labour market. Ellison wants Fed to realise not all US citizens are experiencing this upturn. Yellen: We should pay adequate attention to different groups. Unemployment rate is only one measure of what\u2019s happening, appropriate for us to do more detailed assessment. Congressman Ed Perlmutter of Colorado ( a Democrat) praises Yellen (and the President) and asks how we can do better. Yellen: Our objective is to try to make sure the picture shows continuing improvement. The signs of wage growth increasing are tentative but hopeful.. and we will try to keep that progress growing. Inflation [should] move up over time [towards our target]. Some of burden should also be on Congress. Job training, educational programmes... are Congress\u2019s job to address. Perlmutter: Soft spot in the economy is oil and gas. Saudis are pumping like crazy into an oversupplied market. Good for pump prices but causes job losses. Yellen: We\u2019re taking account of fact that energy sector is hard hit, we\u2019re losing jobs there. But it is a pretty small sector of the workforces. It is rippling through to manufacturing. But average household is saving $1000 a year {so that is having a positive effect} Robert Pittenger of North Carolina says the economic recovery is dismal despite all these accommodative policies. Is real unemployment not 10% not 4.9%? Yellen barely gets a chance to begin answering before Pittenger steps in again and his time runs out. Wiliam Clay of Missouri says the Fed is more focussed on inflation than unemployment. Yellen: We have both targets and take issue with idea we are not focussed on the unemployment objective... We continue to have accommodative monetary policy. Mia Love of Utah asks about implications of European financial instability, and ECB and Fed using different policies Yellen: The ECB is dealing with inflation falling well beyond their goal...US has done better, is among the strongest economies. It\u2019s put [upward] pressure on dollar, harming manufacturing and exports. Maxine Waters is back and is back with the topic of big banks receiving support from the Fed. Yellen: It\u2019s an essential tool we need to adjust the rate of short term interest rates. We have 2.5trn dollars of reserves compared to 20 to 30 billion during the financial crisis. If we have to use another technique, we will be likely forced to shrink our balance sheet and.. it would have adverse effects on the economy. David Scott of Georgia disagrees when Yellen says Fed can\u2019t target unemployment, pointing out the large unemployment rate among Afro-Americans. He says Fed has historically downplayed unemployment, nor has Fed ever had an Afro-American as head of one of the regional Fed banks. Yellen: We recognise how serious the problems are and we take our employment mandate extremely seriously, we have been doing everything to promote a strong labour market which would benefit Afro-Americans. She agrees there should be an Afro-American head and regrets there has not been. Ed Royce from California: Are negative rates a tool in the tool box? (He says a recent bank stress test from the Fed suggests this might be being looked at). Yellen: ECB and Japan have gone to negative rates. We have had periods of market stress where we see flight into US Treasury bonds as safe haven. We have set stress tests for banks to look at if Treasuries go negative, this may happen without Fed necessarily setting negative rates. Ruben Hinojosa of Texas asks what else could we do to boost economy. Yellen: Productivity growth has been disappointing since the financial crisis. The debt situation facing the country needs to be addressed by Congress. As population ages debt to GDP ratio will be on an unsustainable course. Hinojosa asks about addressing inequality. Yellen: We don\u2019t have policies that target specific groups, main thing we can do is make sure labour market is working well. There is further to go. Sean Duffy of Wisconsin, as head of oversight committee is complaining Yellen does not always respond to requests from the committee on compliance issues (in particular documents on possible leaks) and says she has ignored subpoenas. Yellen: We have some concern with providing transcripts since they relate to monetary policy. We will consider this and get back to you. Duffy: This is about a leak, will you let me know why I am not entitled to these documents? I sent a letter a year ago. You knew I would ask. Why will you not provide documents. This is about the internal working of the Fed, not market moving documents. Yellen: I think we have complied fully.. Duffy: What would you do if you wanted this from a bank [but were ignored]. I can imagine what Fed would do. I expect these documents to come over. The discussion ends after a point of order is made about the subpoena and dismissed. European markets are closing in positive territory but on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has now slipped back and is down around 12 points. Gregory Meeks of New York asks if Yellen thinks the position is better now than in 2008. Yellen: I believe it is. We\u2019ve made a lot of progress although there are a lot of challenges, a lot of households are suffering. Elsewhere oil is on the rise - Brent is now up 2.7% at $31.15 a barrel - after US crude stockpiles fell unexpectedly last week. Crude inventories dropped 754,000 barrels compared to expectations of a 3.6m barrel rise. Blaine Luetkemeyer from Missouri asks what Fed could do if there is another downturn. Yellen says there are a number of tools including interest rates, but Luetkemeyer rightly points out that rates are almost as low as they can go (even with the recent hike). Brad Sherman of California: Are you going to break up the too big to fail institutions? To make sure it\u2019s not \u201ctoo big to jail\u201d? Yellen: We are using our powers to make sure a systemically important institution could fail without having a systemic effect. Maloney asks: Given the market turmoil and slowing US economy, some analysts are suggesting a possible recession. What would it take to cut rates again? Yellen: Our commitment is to achieve goals of maximum employment and price stability. I do not expect the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) will soon be in a situation to cut rates. The Labour market continues to perform well. Many of the factors factors holding down inflation are transitory. There is always a risk of recession, global developments could produce a slowdown, but don\u2019t want to jump to premature conclusions. I don\u2019t think it will be necessary to cut rates. But if it turned out to be necessary, the FOMC would do what was necessary. Carolyn Maloney of New York asks: Has the turmoil in global markets changed your view on the pace of interest rate rises? Yellen: We are watching very carefully what is happening in global financial markets. The stresses we have seen since the turn of the year relate to uncertainties over Chinese exchange rate policy, the price of oil.. We have not seen shifts that seem significant enough to have driven the sharp move in markets. It seems to be increased fears of recession risk. We have not yet seen a sharp drop off in growth, globally or in the US. Global market developments bear watching. We recognised these developments may have implications for the outlook, which we are currently assessing. Monetary policy is not on a preset course. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina: Does Fed have legal authority to move into negative rates. Yellen: The FOMC considered this around 2010, we were exploring our options. We decided not to lower interest rates into negative territory. Didn\u2019t fully look at legal issues. We would stilll need to investigate more thoroughly. Don\u2019t know any restriction that would prevent us doing it. But we have not fully investigated legal issues. Moore says is there moral hazard in not a single person involved in 2008 crash going to jail. Yellen: I do not think individuals guilty of wrongdoing should escape appropriate penalties. We cannot put in place criminal penalties. We can make sure they are not allowed to work at banking organisations where they committed misdeeds, and in many cases they can be banned from working. We always co-operated with Department of Justice. Gwen Moore from Wisconsin is concerned about small banks. She asks how the rules should have been tailored for small banks, saying \u201cstress tests, capital constraints are killing our small banks.\u201d Yellen says: Community banks and their vitality are exceptionally important. The burden on community banks is intense. We are focussed on doing everything we can to reduce that. What will the world have to look like for a rule based system, asks Mulvaney. Yellen says guidelines from rules are looked at but we should not mechanically follow rules, we need to take into account a large set of indicators. Following on from that, Mick Mulvaney asks if the economy is now normal. Yellen says: The economy in many ways is close to normal... inflation is below 2% but there is a good reason to think it will move up over time. But the neutral level of federal funds rate is by no means normal. We have needed for 7 years to hold the federal funds rate at exceptionally low levels to achieve growth of 2% and in that sense it is not normal. Maxine Waters asks what alternative processes could there be to the Fed paying billions to banks on excess reserves when it raises interest rates. The Fed uses IOER (interest on excess reserves) and Yellen defends the use of this system even though it pays commercial banks above market interest rates. Now for the questions. Chair Jeb Hensarling brings up a recent bill that would require the Fed to follow a rules-based monetary policy, which Yellen opposes but a number of economists have backed in a letter. Yellen is against it because it could jeopardise its independence from political pressure. The two sides are basically just repeated their existing stance on the issue. Markets are moving much higher now even though Yellen has just so far repeated her statement. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 151 points or 0.9%. (Unsurprisingly it\u2019s taking longer than five minutes - the statement is here if you want to follow along). Yellen now gets five minutes to present her testimony, and is reading her statement. The session is underway, and can be viewed live here. Opening remarks come from chairman Jeb Hensarling - who says he will not use the session to criticise the Fed\u2019s decision to raise rates - followed by a number of members of Congress including Maxine Waters and Soth Carolina\u2019s Mick Mulvaney. Congress, waiting for Yellen. The US economy is strong enough to see through this period of turbulence, says economist Harm Bandholz at UniCredit after Yellen\u2019s testimony: In a nutshell: Chair Yellen has, correctly in our view, highlighted the solid fundamentals of the US economy. Accordingly, her baseline outlook for both the economy and monetary policy have not changed. That said, recent developments in financial markets as well as in the global economy have clouded the picture. In this environment, Fed officials prefer to take a step back and wait. Once the clouds have lifted, the gradual normalization of interest rates will continue. Yes, there are risks out there \u2013 and the longer the financial market rout lasts, the bigger the risk that it will become self-fulfilling \u2013, but we believe that fundamentals are solid enough to carry the economy through this period. And this also seems to be the Fed\u2019s view. Accordingly, the fact that financial markets do not expect the next rate hike before the second quarter of 2017 seems well overdone. Well, it\u2019s not a ringing endorsement of Janet Yellen\u2019s comments but US markets have opened in positive territory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 59 points or 0.39%, while at the open the S&amp;P 500 added 0.5%. But the tech-heavy Nasdaq has outperformed, up 1.1%. The dollar has reacted to Yellen\u2019s comments as if more rate rises this year - perhaps even in March - could indeed be on the cards despite the worries about global growth. The US currency has risen 0.25% against a basket of currencies, up from a near four month low on Tuesday. The euro fell 0.5% after the release of the testimony, while sterling has dropped from $1.4560 to $1.4484. Janet Yellen\u2019s testimony might appear to leave the door open for further rate rises, but she is likely to be quizzed sharply about the last one, says Rob Carnell at ING Bank. In his initial thoughts he says: In summary \u2013 Yellen retains an open mind on the need for further tightening, though with a heavy skew of risks to the downside, and was defensive about the December rate hike: The mercifully short prepared statement of Fed Chair Yellen to the House Committee on Financial Services did not contain much that was new from earlier speeches, statements or minutes. To the extent that any new material was used, this was mainly an expansion of the risks from softer overseas demand, with China explicitly mentioned, and also from financial market tightening (stronger USD, higher yields on riskier assets and lower equity prices, offset to some extent by lower bond yields and oil prices). The testimony retained the text about the possibility that rates might have to be increased at a faster than anticipated rate if growth and inflation were stronger than expected. However, that is sounding rather hollow right now. We see the continued inclusion of this text as an attempt to portray an open mind about the recent activity slowdown, and not to present a self-fulfilling picture of gloom at the Fed. Financial markets may see this as dovish speech overall, though probably not out of line with expectations. There was also a somewhat defensive paragraph justifying the December rate hike \u2013 we expect that once the questioning starts, Chair Yellen will come in for some stick from disgruntled members of Congress, some of whom may be facing a hostile electorate later this year. One interpretation of Yellen\u2019s remarks on rates is that she is admitting they were raised too soon, says Augustin Eden at Accendo Markets. A not unusually muted reaction to Fed Chair Janet Yellen\u2019s testimony this afternoon, given that she\u2019s come out and said \u2018financial conditions in the US have recently become less supportive of growth.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t take a 1st class physicist to recognise that this is essentially another way of saying \u2018we raised interest rates before we should have.\u2019 Nothing had fundamentally changed in December, but the Fed decided to ignore the fundamentals and move US monetary policy to a place that\u2019s less supportive of growth. It now appears the markets chose to ignore the Fed in January, preferring the fundamentals, and what do you know? The markets were right \u2013 they\u2019ve been reacting to this testimony for the past four weeks. An economist\u2019s view on Yellen\u2019s comments: Yellen also, as indeed she has to, defended the December decision to raise interest rates. Many have judged that to be a mistake, especially in the wake of the market turbulence and fears about global growth and stresses on the banks which have dominated the headlines so far this year. Yellen suggested that if a pre-emptive rate rise was not implemented, a sharper increase may well have been necessary in the future which could have pushed the economy into recession: The decision in December to raise the federal funds rate reflected the Committee\u2019s assessment that, even after a modest reduction in policy accommodation, economic activity would continue to expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators would continue to strengthen. Although inflation was running below the Committee\u2019s longer-run objective, the FOMC judged that much of the softness in inflation was attributable to transitory factors that are likely to abate over time, and that diminishing slack in labor and product markets would help move inflation toward 2 percent. In addition, the Committee recognized that it takes time for monetary policy actions to affect economic conditions. If the FOMC delayed the start of policy normalization for too long, it might have to tighten policy relatively abruptly in the future to keep the economy from overheating and inflation from significantly overshooting its objective. Such an abrupt tightening could increase the risk of pushing the economy into recession. It is important to note that even after this increase, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative Janet Yellen has also said that the Fed would slow the pace of interest rate hikes, if the threats to the US economy materialise. She tells the Committee on Financial Services that: In particular, stronger growth or a more rapid increase in inflation than the Committee currently anticipates would suggest that the neutral federal funds rate was rising more quickly than expected, making it appropriate to raise the federal funds rate more quickly as well. Conversely, if the economy were to disappoint, a lower path of the Federal funds rate would be appropriate. The full testimony is here. Janet Yellen has also touched on the big issue dominating the markets - how quickly will interest rates rise? She sounds cautious, but neither rules anything in or out (classic central banker) \u201cThe FOMC anticipates that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate. In addition, the Committee expects that the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below the levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.\u201d (the FOMC, or Federal Open Market Committee, meets eight times a year to set US monetary policy) Janet Yellen has also warned that \u201cforeign economic developments\u201d could harm the US economy. In her testimony to Congress, the Fed chair singles out concerns about the slowdown in China. That has already caused \u201cincreased volatility in global financial markets\u201d, and \u201cexacerbated concerns about the outlook for global growth\u201d, says Yellen. She adds: These growth concerns, along with strong supply conditions and high inventories, contributed to the recent fall in the prices of oil and other commodities. In turn, low commodity prices could trigger financial stresses in commodity-exporting economies, particularly in vulnerable emerging market economies, and for commodity-producing firms in many countries. Should any of these downside risks materialize, foreign activity and demand for U.S. exports could weaken and financial market conditions could tighten further.\u201d Newsflash: The Federal Reserve has just released Janet Yellen\u2019s prepared testimony, ahead of this afternoon\u2019s grilling from Congress in 90 minute time. The Fed chief is striking a cautious note about economic prospects, warning that: \u201cFinancial conditions in the United States have recently become less supportive of growth, with declines in broad measures of equity prices, higher borrowing rates for riskier borrowers, and a further appreciation of the dollar. These developments, if they prove persistent, could weigh on the outlook for economic activity and the labor market, although declines in longer-term interest rates and oil prices provide some offset. But Yellen also points to \u201congoing employment gains and faster wage growth\u201d, which should push real incomes higher. She also suggests that global economic growth should \u201cpick up over time\u201d, helped by \u201chighly accommodative monetary policies abroad\u201d [such as Japan and the eurozone]. And the Fed chief remains confident about medium-term growth prospects, saying: Against this backdrop, the Committee expects that with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace in coming years and that labor market indicators will continue to strengthen.\u201d Inequality is one of the issues of our age. Bernie Sanders is building a presidential bid by fighting it, and charities like Oxfam regularly warn that the rich are taking more and more of the cake. Now, credit ratings agency S&amp;P has warned that quantitative easing (QE), a key weapon used in the financial crisis, is widening inequality and the wealth gap between young and old. Under QE, central banks buy assets such as government bonds with new money, driving up the cost of safe assets and encouraging investors into riskier ones (this is the theor, anyway) But it\u2019s also hurting those who don\u2019t own assets, as S&amp;P explains: Quantitative easing (QE) stabilized the economy but also exacerbated wealth disparity between rich and poor, mainly by boosting financial asset prices and house prices. During the U.K.\u2019s recent \u201cjobs-rich, pay-poor\u201d economic recovery, strong employment gains were accompanied by a further rise of already high wage dispersion and an ever-growing share of part-time employment in lower income groups. Between 2006 and 2008 (before QE) and 2010-2012 (after QE started), average wealth held directly in stocks increased by 55% for the wealthiest 10% and by 130% for wealthiest 1% of U.K. households. In the context of the tight housing market, low interest rates and QE are among the drivers behind the widening wealth and income gap between younger and older generations and between those on the housing ladder and those not on it. European markets are sailing higher, up over 2% on average, reversing six days of steady losses which dragged them to a two year low. But the rally looks could unravel, depending on how the chair of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen, performs at Congress in a couple of hours time. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains: Talk of Deutsche Bank doing an emergency bond-buyback to shore up its finances and relieve worried creditors has seen the German bank\u2019s shares rally by over 10%, lifting the rest of the banking sector. In a way it\u2019s a bit of deju vu from yesterday when markets initially rose thanks to news from Deutsche Bank before financial and commodity sectors led to a spectacular roll-over. There is plenty of scope for another sharp twist in the direction of markets today around 3pm GMT when fed Chair Janet Yellen gives her testimony to the House Financial Services Committee. Investors can\u2019t get enough of Deutsche Bank today. Its shares jumped 17% at one stage this morning, fuelled by reports that it will launch a debt buy-back offer soon. That move would show Deutsche\u2019s financial muscle and calm fears over its ability to meet debt repayments and dividends. Supportive words from Berlin\u2019s finance ministry today may also have helped, along with Deutsche management\u2019s insistence yesterday that the bank is \u201crock solid\u201d. But Deutsche\u2019s problems are not suddenly solved. There are still fears over the quality of the bank\u2019s assets (it is trading at around half its book value). An economic downturn would inflict further losses. Deutsche made a \u20ac6.8bn loss last year, showing the struggles in the banking sector. Newish CEO John Cryan is trying to clean the bank up, following fines for various scandals. But it could face further provisions in the future. There are fears that banks will suffer if eurozone interest rates are cut deeper into negative territory. That would eat into profits, penalising them for leaving cash at the ECB. It would also force prices of government bonds even higher, meaning banks would get an even lower rate of return (if anything). It\u2019s been a bad morning for UK modelmaker Hornby. The miniature train firm, which also owns racing car outfit Scalextric and aeroplane kitmaker Airfix, hit investors with another profit warning today. It also admitted it could breach its loan agreements with its banks - never a good sign. And there was nothing small about the market reaction - Hornby shares have tanked by over 40%. TV presenter James May (who loves toys of a certain generation), has urged the British people to act now, while there\u2019s still time. This might dampen the mood in the markets. The head of the International Monetary Fund has warned that Ukraine could lose financial support unless its government gets serious about cleaning up and reforming its economy. IMF chief Christine Lagarde declared: \u201cI am concerned about Ukraine\u2019s slow progress in improving governance and fighting corruption, and reducing the influence of vested interests in policymaking. Without a substantial new effort to invigorate governance reforms and fight corruption, it is hard to see how the IMF-supported program can continue and be successful. Ukraine risks a return to the pattern of failed economic policies that has plagued its recent history. It is vital that Ukraine\u2019s leadership acts now to put the country back on a promising path of reform.\u201d The IMF agreed to a $17.5bn bailout program for cash-strapped Ukraine last year, but has held back a $1.7bn payment since last autumn due to concerns over corruption. Those fears were inflamed when economy minister Aivaras Abromavicius resigned last week, saying it was impossible to implement reforms. He claimed he was under pressure to appoint government cronies to key positions, continuing Ukraine\u2019s well-known problems with graft and vested interests. Ukrainian government bonds have already tumbled in value recently, to levels suggesting a high risk of default or restructuring. Context is everything.... There are encouraging signs from New York. Wall Street is expected to rally when trading begins, just over three hours time. The Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 are tipped to rise by 1%, while the Nasdaq is being called 1.6% higher. The German government has reiterated that it is not worried about Deutsche Bank. A finance ministry spokeswoman told reporters in Berlin that: \u201cYou heard the short sentence that the minister [finance minister Wolfgang Schuable] said yesterday in Paris that he is not concerned, I don\u2019t have anything to add to that.\u201d European banking shares are surging, lead by Deutsche Bank which has jumped by 15%. Investors seem to be regaining their nerve, having been gripped with worries over the financial sector. Rumours that Deutsche is planning to strengthen its financial position by buying back some debt have also helped the mood. Economic jitters are also being eased, with the oil price up 1.5% today. Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, explains: Despite another poor session overnight, markets in the UK and Europe have rallied impressively. Banks are surging higher, with Deutsche shrugging off the woes of yesterday as investors take the opportunity to buy on weakness once again. A better performance from the oil price and heavily oversold conditions in a number of markets, plus expectations regarding Janet Yellen\u2019s appearance later in the day have provided bulls with the chance to reverse some of the heavy losses seen so far in February. The main European banking index has gained 5% today. A decent rally - but it still leaves shares down 23% so far this year. And although we\u2019ve heard supportive words from Deutsche CEO John Cryan and German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble yesterday, nothing has really changed. The head of Swiss bank Credit Suisse has launched a full-throated defence of the banking sector, in an attempt to calm fears of a new crisis. Tidjane Thiam told the Financial Times that: \u201cThe banking system in general is much stronger than in 2008, 2009 [but] there are a lot of memories of that period. \u201cSome of the scenes we are seeing today are not justified . . . Banks are smaller, they are deleveraged, they are less risky, they are better capitalised.\u201d Thiam was speaking after Credit Suisse shares slumped to their lowest in more than two decades yesterday. He told the FT that Credit Suisse has \u201cno liquidity issues\u201d, and a \u201cstrong balance sheet\u201d. And investors may have heeded his words. Credit Suisse shares have jumped by 5%, as part of a wider rally in bank shares.... The slump in UK industrial production may show that Britain\u2019s economy is weaker than we thought. Economist Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight explains: December\u2019s sharp drop in industrial production will fuel concerns about the UK economic outlook as well as the unbalanced nature of growth. It will also likely harden views that the Bank of England will not be raising interest rates during 2016. However, we believe it remains highly unlikely that the Bank of England will cut interest rates. The ONS estimated last month that the UK grew by 0.5% in the last quarter of 2015. Sky News\u2019s Ed Conway reckons this could be cut: Ouch. Britain has suffered its biggest fall in industrial output since September 2012. It\u2019s another sign of weakening economic demand \u2013 one of the main triggers for the recent market turmoil. UK industrial production shrank by 1.1% month-on-month in December, according to new figures from the Office for National Statistics. That was primarily caused by a 4.6% plunge in oil and gas extraction, and a 4% drop in mining. But British manufacturing also suffered, with output down by 0.2% month-on-month and 1.7% lower than in December 2014. Alarmingly, the UK isn\u2019t alone either. France and Italy have also reported sharp falls in factory output this morning, and Germany did the same yesterday. It fuels fears that the global economy ended 2015 with a whimper, not a bang. Shares across Europe are picking up pace, as investors shake off some of their gloom. The FTSE 100 is now up 43 points, or 0.8%, and there are bigger gains over the channel. Germany\u2019s DAX has leapt by 1.8%, as worries over Deutsche Bank recede this morning. Francois Savary, chief investment officer at Geneva-based Prime Partners, says: \u201cThe rebound in Deutsche Bank is helping to reassure some investors who had been concerned about possible contagion in the banking sector.\u201d The slump in profits at shipping magnate A.P. Moller\u2013Maersk [details] hasn\u2019t caused much alarm. It\u2019s quite a different picture than we saw in the Asia-Pacific markets a few hours ago: But there is still a lot of anxiety around, as investors prepare to hear from the head of the Federal Reserve when she testifies to Congress this afternoon. Janet Yellen may concede that the Fed is unlikely to raise borrowing costs four times this year, as it originally expected. But if she sounds too worried, that could spark another bout of market mayhem. It\u2019s a tricky balancing act, says Ilya Spivak, currency strategist at DailyFX. He reckons Yellen will try to avoid saying too much. it ought to be kept in mind that the markets want to be reassured. This injects a degree of wishful thinking into the equation. F or her part, the Fed Chair will almost certainly refrain from plain-spoken commitment on the direction of policy. Here\u2019s the worst-performing companies in Australia today, who helped to drag its stock market more than 20% below its recent peak. Mesoblast, the biggest faller, is an adult stem cell research firm. Many of the other fallers are natural resource and energy companies (including Liquified Natural Gas, Western Areas, Karoon Gas and Whitehaven Coal) Deutsche Bank is climbing higher! The Wall Street Journal has a good take on how Australia\u2019s banks helped drag the country\u2019s stocks into a bear market today. \u201cThis is the first sustained bear market I have seen since the GFC [global financial crisis],\u201d said Evan Lucas, a market strategist at brokerage IG in Melbourne, noting the S&amp;P/ASX 200 briefly was in bear territory in 2011. Australia\u2019s major banks, which are some of the biggest stocks on the S&amp;P/ASX 200 and have a large index weighting, have been caught in a global bank-share selloff this week, despite their having less exposure to liquidity risks compared with peers in the U.S. and Europe and substantially less reliance on the long end of the bond curve and wholesale funding, Mr. Lucas said. Still, worries about banks globally have only exacerbated a decline for local lenders. The financials subindex has lost 14% this year as brokers have flagged concerns about the sustainability of the industry\u2019s attractive dividends as Australia\u2019s economy remains subdued and signs emerge that the property market is beginning to cool. More here: Australia Shares Fall Into Bear Market It\u2019s not all the fault of the banks, though. Mining stocks have also tumbled, in response to waning demand for commodities from China. BHP Billiton, for example, has fallen 12% since the start of January. Resource companies are now cutting thousands of jobs, in response to falling prices for coal, iron ore, zinc, nickel, copper and bauxite. Australia\u2019s fall into bear market territory today has sent another cloud of gloom over the City of London. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx sums up the mood: Once again the European indices are enduring the aftermath of a rocky Asian session, the Nikkei plunging to a 16 month low following a 2nd day of heavy losses, with the added concern of a bear market-entering night for the Australian markets thrown in for good measure. A red-washed commodity sector is dragging the index down at the moment, though if Brent Crude can see a sustained climb above $31 per barrel (with the US crude inventories arriving this afternoon) sentiment may be able to shift as the day goes on. Danish shipping and oil conglomerate A.P. Moller\u2013Maersk is getting a kicking. Shares in the group have slumped by 7.5%, making it the worst stock in Europe today, after it reported a fourth-quarter net loss due to impairments of $2.6 billion on its oil assets. The global slowdown is hurting the firm. Demand for shipping goods overseas has fallen, just as new ships ordered years ago come into service. Shares in Deutsche Bank have jumped by over 4% at the start of trading, amid rumours that it is planning new steps to reassure investors about its financial health. The Financial Times set the hare running last night, reporting that: Deutsche Bank is considering buying back several billion euros of its debt, as Germany\u2019s biggest bank steps up efforts to shore up the tumbling value of its securities against the backdrop of a broader rout of financial stocks. After European banks suffered a second consecutive day of sharp falls, Deutsche Bank is expected to focus its emergency buyback plan on senior bonds, of which it has about \u20ac50bn in issue, according to the bank. The move was unlikely to involve so-called contingent convertible bonds [cocos] which, along with the bank\u2019s shares, have been the butt of a brutal investor sell-off in recent days, people briefed on the plan said. Banks can generate capital gains by buying back bonds at a discount to their face value. More here: Deutsche Bank considers multibillion bond buyback European stock markets are crawling higher in early trading, after two days of hefty falls. The FTSE 100 index of major blue-chip London shares is 26 points higher (+0.3%), led by mining group Anglo American (up 3%). The other European markets are also gaining a little ground, with Spain\u2019s IBEX up 1.1% and the French CAC up 0.7%. So, not exactly a big rally. Traders will be hoping it lasts, after seeing fears over the global economy take hold on Tuesday. I suspect they\u2019ll try to sit tight until Fed chair Janet Yellen testifies to Congress in 7 hours time. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, says: Once again the FTSE-100 has kicked off the session with a modest bounce, recovering some of yesterday\u2019s gains in the process, but the underlying situation appears little changed. Crude oil prices may be ticking higher but they are still in what could be termed \u2018distressed\u2019 territory below $30/barrel, although despite all this there\u2019s a definite air of risk-on returning to markets. Japan\u2019s stock market also had a rough day, losing another 2.3% and sending the Nikkei to a fresh 16-month low. The selloff was partly fuelled by fears that central bankers are losing the battle to keep economies afloat. My colleague Martin Farrer explains: One analyst said markets could be seeing the start of the \u201cfinal capitulation\u201d as the attempt by central banks to stimulate growth with cheap money since the global financial crisis in 2008 had run its course. \u201cThe artificial support from central banks is at a crossroads,\u201d said Evan Lucas, of IG in Melbourne. \u201cCentral bank intervention will no longer create the holding pattern of the past year; markets now believe banks are out of ammunition.\u201d Here\u2019s Martin\u2019s news story on the Asian selloff: The heavy falls on the Australian stock market has triggered fears that we\u2019re entering another GFC, or Global Financial Crisis. ABC News explains: Stockbroker and author of Marcus Today, Marcus Padley, holds the view that this week\u2019s Australian bank sell-off is more about fear than reality. \u201cThere is fundamentals and there is sentiment, and people are very fearful of another GFC-style event,\u201d he told ABC News Online. This chart shows how the Australian market has now shed more than 20% since last April. Australia\u2019s stock market has been dragged into bear market territory as the the global market rout hit Asia again. The country\u2019s benchmark index, the S&amp;P/ASX 200, endured a rough day and finished down 1.2% at 4775.7 points. That\u2019s more than 20% below last April\u2019s peak, that calm time before fears over the global economy (particularly China) began to hit shares worldwide. It means Australia joins Japan\u2019s Nikkei, China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, and Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 in bear market territory. Financial shares were hit, with Bank of Queensland tumbling by almost 7%, and energy companies also led the selloff. Australian investors are getting spooked by events across the globe, says Reuters: Persistent fears about slowing global growth and the Chinese economy, the health of Europe\u2019s banking sector and concerns that Beijing and major central banks might not be able to turn things around have combined to rattle investors. \u201cWhat\u2019s the scary part about this is we can see things get pretty ugly, pretty quickly,\u201d said Evan Lucas, market strategist at IG in Melbourne. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Hold onto your hats, because it\u2019s going to be another stressful day in the financial world. With concerns over the banking sector mounting, investors have three items on the agenda today. 1) Deutsche Bank. Germany\u2019s biggest lender is fighting back against concerns over its financial strength, which drove its shares to a record low last night. There are reports that Deutsche is considering buying some of its debt back, to reassure investors. 2) Janet Yellen. The head of the Federal Reserve testifies to Congress today (3pm GMT, or 10am local time). She\u2019ll be quizzed about the state of the world economy, the banking sector, and whether she\u2019s considering imposing negative interest rates in America (just two months after raising borrowing costs) 3) Oil. The canary in the global economic coalmine had a bad Tuesday, plunging by around 9% to around $30 per barrel. That\u2019s putting more stress on the energy industry, and also the banks, who could suffer heavy losses if producers default on their loans. London\u2019s stock market hit a three-year low yesterday, but traders are suggesting it could be a calmer morning. Economic-wise, the latest UK industrial production data is released at 9.30am. That will show if British factories suffered from the global slowdown in December. And on the corporate front, we get results from (among others) UK chipmaker ARM this morning, and social media network Twitter late tonight. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

Analyst Connor Campbell at Spreadex said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Initially threatening a 300 point plunge when the bell rang on Wall Street the Dow Jones settled into a more solid, if still troublesome, 175 point drop as the open receded into the background. Whether or not the better than expected, and best since December, jobless claims helped (it probably didn\u2019t) is unclear, though at this point in time in the most worthless piece of positive news is likely appreciated by fear-stricken investors. The Dow was probably saved (and this is all relative, remember) by the fact that the blood loss endured by the US banking sector was nowhere near as gory as the scenes over in Europe, Bank of America the worst hit at around a 4% decline.</p> <p>In Europe things were much the same, i.e. not too good at all. The FTSE just about managed to claw its way back to the 5600 mark, arguably thanks to the fact that Brent Crude is now closer to $31 per barrel than it is to $30. The DAX, meanwhile, tucked under a 2% decline around 40 points away from 8900, whilst the CAC climbed down from its 3.7% nadir to post a 2.7% loss, both indices aided by a (minor) reduction in losses form Deutsche Bank and Societe Generale respectively.</p> <p>The big question now is, does today\u2019s horrorshow continue into Friday? Given just how fearful investors appear to be at the moment it is incredibly hard to tell; one thing tomorrow does have going for it, however, is data. Lots and lots of it. Germany, Italy and the Eurozone as a whole reveal their preliminary fourth quarter GDP figures, whilst the US sees retail sales, import prices and the University of Michigan consumer sentiment number. The markets will be hoping (nay, praying) that, with a bit of distraction (like on Wednesday), the week can end on a slightly more positive note.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56bca05ee4b0e04c43d738da\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-11T15:04:41.284Z\">3.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is back on Capitol Hill to discuss the global outlook and monetary policy with the Senate Banking Committee, the second and last day of her testimony to Congress.</p> <p>The hearing has begun and can be viewed <strong><a href=\"http://www.banking.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/hearings?ID=EBDD6E93-DC93-415D-99E1-0CD84FFA04D5\">here.</a></strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56bca29ce4b0d007e4723bc1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-11T15:03:25.495Z\">3.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Elsewhere Morgan Stanley has agree to pay $3.2bn relating to the sale of mortgage-backed bonds before the financial crisis.</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56bc9e8de4b0e04c43d738d7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-11T14:46:04.557Z\">2.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ahead of Yellen\u2019s testimony, some think it is time for a US rate cut:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/D_Blanchflower/status/697791707002220544\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Global demand collapsing stock markets tumbling &amp;

                "bodyText":"That\u2019s an appropriate moment to stop. Back tomorrow, for another day of market drama - plus the latest eurozone growth figures, starting with France at 6.30am GMT. Here\u2019s our latest news story: Better get some sleep :) Goodnight! GW Today\u2019s selloff in Asia, Europe and America have pulled global stocks into bear market territory. Reuters has the details: Stock indexes worldwide stumbled on Thursday on fears over the health of the global economy, with a global equity benchmark index closing the day more than 20 percent below its record high last May, confirming global stocks are in a bear market. MSCI\u2019s all-country world equity index which tracks shares in 45 nations, was last down 4.73 points, or 1.32%, to 353.35. The index hit its lowest level in more than two and a half years and was down 20.18% from an all-time high close of 442.70 on May 21, 2015. As we\u2019ve been covering today, this fall into bear market territory began with hefty losses in Hong Kong. Its stock market fell by 4%, on the first day\u2019s trading since the Lunar New year holiday. The baton then passed to Europe, which fumbled it. Bank shares had a very poor day indeed, on escalating fears that they will struggle to handle an economic slowdown, and lower negative interest rates. In nervous trading, shares slumped and government bonds soared, while oil took a dive and gold rallied. That tee\u2019d up America for its fifth daily fall in a row, as Fed chair Janet Yellen repeated her concerns that financial conditions are deteriorating. Uncertainty over US monetary policy going forward - will rates be hiked, cut, or even go negative? - weighed on shares again. It looks like the S&amp;P 500 has finished at its lowest closing level since April 2014, at 1829 points. Financial shares in the S&amp;P fell by 3%, bringing 2016 losses to roughly 18%, points out our US business editor Dominic Rushe. Here\u2019s the main movers and shakers: The Dow has lost around 4.6% of its value since last Thursday - the last time it posted a daily rise. The index is down 10.1% since the start of this year. This is the fifth day running in which the Dow Jones index has lost ground. Reminder: Tonight\u2019s losses in New York follow another day\u2019s torrid trading in Europe. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has another day to forget, losing 2.4% as investors raced for safe-haven assets such as German bonds, the yen, and gold. The Footsie, which includes the top 100 companies in London, closed at its lowest level in three and a half years. Our friends at the Daily Telegraph have worked out that \u00a380bn has been wiped off the FTSE 100 index this week. And there\u2019s still one day to go.... Phew! America\u2019s stock market has closed for the night, and the main three indices are all in the red. The Dow ended the day down around 251 points, having clawed back from a 400-point loss an hour or so ago. And the Nasdaq wilted in the final moments, surrendering earlier gains to finish down 0.4%. Shares picked up after the WSJ reported that Opec might be prepared to cut oil production. But financial stocks dragged again, with Goldman Sachs down 4.1%, and JP Morgan losing 3.98%. The biggest Dow faller was Boeing, following reports that regulators are investigating the airline maker. The latest research note from French Bank BNP Paribas just landed in my inbox. Here\u2019s their \u2018big picture\u2019 view: Central-bank action looks uncoordinated and we see few signs of calm ahead. We expect no further action from the Fed in 2016 or 2017 and we think central banks across the world will continue to adopt easier policies in response. It looks like traders are trying to give the Dow a late push. It\u2019s now down 188 points, or half its earlier losses..... Hello hello.... look at the Nasdaq. The tech stock-heavy index has shrugged off its earlier losses, and is now up 7 points (or 0.2%). Leading the way are: TripAdvisor: +13% Cisco +10% Expedia +8.5% Tesla: +6.3% That still leaves the Nasdaq down 6.9% this month, and 13% since the start of the year. Now that today\u2019s OPEC rumour has sunk in, Wall Street is still in red, but off its lowest levels. The Dow is currently down 273 points, or -1.7%, with just 40 minutes until the closing bell. This final hour can be a volatile time.... This is the story that moved the market a few minutes ago, by Summer Said of the Wall Street Journal. OPEC members are ready to cooperate on a cut, but current prices are already forcing producers outside the group to at least cap output increases, says UAE Energy Minister Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazrouei. Non-OPEC supplies are expected to drop up to 800K barrels/day while global demand growth is seen at 1.3M\u2013which will help the market balances itself. \u201cThe positive thing is the current market is forcing everyone not to increase output,\u201d says al-Mazrouei, adding, \u201cI\u2019m optimistic that the balance will happen this year despite the oversupply and stocks overhang.\u201d  Interesting stuff. But it\u2019s not exactly definitive proof that OPEC is about to cave in and axe production. Energy stocks are suddenly spiking, pulling the US stock market off its lowest levels. And it\u2019s triggered reports that the energy minister of the UAE has said Opec members are \u201cready to co-operate\u201d on production cuts. Rumours of this sort have been swirling, and then denied, for some time. But maybe this time it\u2019s different.... Wow. The Dow just lurched through the 400-point loss mark, as news of the latest tumble in the oil price broke. Then it ricocheted back, to \u201cjust\u201d 340 points down in a few moments. Oil has just plumbed new depths, as oversupply fears and global recession worries take their toll again. West Texas Intermediate (US crude oil) has sunk below $26.19 per barrel, to hit the lowest levels since May 2003. There\u2019s no let-up in the market gloom today, with the Dow Jones industrial average still down over 2%. The Dow is currently trading at 15,570, a loss of 344 points. Only two stocks are up - network equipment vender Cisco, and entertainment group Walt Disney (who posted strong results earlier this week). Boeing is the big faller; the aircraft maker has lost 8.9% today following reports that regulators are probing the company\u2019s accounting. Reuters also blames \u201cmounting concerns\u201d about Boeing\u2019s its slowing sales and production. Following close behind in the losers bench are Goldman Sachs (-4.4%) and JP Morgan (-4.2%). They\u2019re tracking the general sell-off in financial stocks today. Two months after the first US rate rise in a decade, the financial markets reckon the Fed is more likely to CUT, rather than risk a second hike. Kit Juckes, top currency strategist at Societe Generale, reckons that the market turmoil has been sparked by a loss of faith in central bankers. In a new note to clients, he writes: We\u2019ve relied on central bankers to fix all the world\u2019s woes, when all they could really do was to get the global financial system back on an even keel. Keeping policy too easy for too long and boosting asset markets in the vain hope that this would deliver a sustainable demand pick-up has meant that even a timid attempt at normalising Fed policy has caused two months of mayhem. Now, a growing realisation that central banks\u2019 powers are waning has prompted a rush into safe havens. And, of course, years of ultra-loose monetary policy have also led us to this point: We\u2019re just getting the stickers saying \u2018Easy Money may cause harmful side-effects if consumed persistently for long periods\u2019 printed.... Yellen\u2019s second and final testimony ends with chairman Richard Shelby suggesting a review of the Fed\u2019s structure. She seems unconvinced but says it is up to Congress. And with that it\u2019s over. A cocktail of concerns has sent markets tumbling again. Worries about a severe global economic downturn, stresses on bank balance sheets, the falling oil price and Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen\u2019s comments about the impact of a slowdown and the market turmoil on the US economy have sent investors scurrying away to havens such as gold. Yellen\u2019s comments about negative interest rates added to the unease as the afternoon wore on. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 fell 135.33 points or 2.39% to 5536.97, its lowest level since the end of July 2012 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 2.93% to 8752.87 France\u2019s Cac closed 4.03% lower at 3896.71 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished down 5.63% at 15,773.00 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 4.88% at 7746.3 In Greece, the Athens market fell 1.89% to 440.88 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 349 points or 2.2%. Charles Schumer of New York says the strength of the US dollar is another form of rates rise so another hike would be a double whammy for the economy. Yellen says the dollar is a factor in interest rate policy, but says although some sectors have been hit by the strength of the US currency the economy has managed to continue creating jobs. Heller: A year ago you said falling oil would be good for the economy. Do you think you made a mistake. Yellen: Clearly declining oil prices have had some negative effects [on the economy]. [But] we are still a net importer of oil, and households are seeing sustantial gains from falling oil price. Dean Heller of Nevada: Different Fed officials saying different things causes confusion to public and markets. Do you see a problem? Yellen: Congress created a system with a large committee with diverse views so we did not fall into groupthink mentality. We have 17 members with a range of views. We have guidelines for communications. It says everyone should make clear they are speaking for themselves, not the committee. The market response to the Fed rate decision for a number of weeks was tranquil, it had been communicated and was expected. At the turn of the year markets saw more volatility. The drivers were China and oil price falls amid weakening global growth, so I don\u2019t think it was our policy. Yellen is asked again about the rate rise at the end of last year. Yellen: We felt in December the economy was moving up and inflation would go up. A lot has gone on since then. We are in the process of assessing how those developments affect our outlook. We will meet in March and have a new set of projections. I\u2019ve not thought that a downturn sufficient to make the next move a cut was a likely possibility. Not seen a shift in economic outlook to make that likely. But she added that if things changed to make that appropriate, the Fed would look at it. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts asks about living wills for banks, which are designed to make sure if they fail there will not be a systemic risk, and says there are 11 where they were deemed not to be sufficient and have been resubmitted. Yellen: We gave detailed guidance about what we want to see in these latest rounds of living wills. We are..evaluting them. If a living will does not address the shortcomings, we are prepared to make the finding that the living will is insufficient. Tom Cotton of Arkansas asks the December rate rise, and Yellen says the Fed wanted to move gradually so that the economy remained on a sustainable growth path. Cotton then asks about when she expects energy prices and the dollar to stabilise. Yellen: Energy prices have continued to move down, eventually they will stabilise. When that happens and the dollar stabilises, inflation will begin to move up but [difficult to predict when.] Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania: I wanted the Fed to normalise policy [ie start raising rates again which happened in December]. Markets now appear to price in no further increases in interest rates. But what are the risks of negative rates? [He lists several including pressure on banks, the prospect of currency war, an effective tax on savings and so on] Yellen: In European countries which have [introduced negative rates], I was surprised it was possible to take them as negative as they did. Don\u2019t think they pass on negative rates to small depositors, which means bank\u2019s margins are squeezed. They [other central banks] were concerned about inflation being below objectives and wanted to stimulate economy. In our context, in 2010 we were concerned about the impact on money market functioning. Before we took such a step we would have to see how they worked in US context. But we don\u2019t even know if clearing and settlement systems would be able to handle negative rates. Toomey asks about the legal position, saying a Fed memo seemed to suggest there could be a probem. Yellen: A memo from 2010 said legal issues had not been studied. I am not aware of any legal restriction that would mean we could not establish negative rates but I haven\u2019t studied legal side of it. Question from Bob Corker of Tennessee : Is Fed out of ammunition unless you go to negative rates? If things go south are you considering negative rates? Yellen: The answer is we had previously considered them and decided they would not work well back in 2010. In light of others [introducing them], we are taking a look at them again because we would want to be prepared. We have not finished that investigation. Not automatic they would work well here. I would not take them off the table, but there is work to do to see if they would be suitable. Senator Jon Tester of Montana: What is Fed seeing in housing sector right now? Yellen: We are seeing recovery in housing, it has gone on for a number of years but is very gradual. House prices have increased quite a bit. [But] the level of new construction remains quite low relative to demographic trends. Quite a significant way for housing to go before it is consistent with demographic trends. It is a support to the economy. Senator Mike Crapo asks: Would you agree liquidity in bond markets may be less available in stressed market conditions. Yellen: Normal conditions haven\u2019t changed that much but perceptions suggest that under stressed conditions liquidity may disappear when its most needed. We are looking at these things... Asked about wages, she says a pick up in wage growth is tentative. She hopes as the economy improves this will increase. Chair Richard Shelby asks if the precipitous decline in the price of 0il and gas plus the rise of the dollar surprised the Fed or could you have predicted it? Yellen says the Fed and the markets have been quite surprised by movements in oil price. In part they reflect supply isssue, demand may also play a role. The stronger dollar we in some ways anticipated as US economy has been performing more strongly than others. But she says they were surprised at how much it has risen. Asked about the economy and recession, she says there is always some chance of recession in any year. But evidence suggests expansions don\u2019t die of old age. We are looking very carefully at global financial developments which create risk... they may influence the trajectory of the economy and monetary policy. It is premature to make a judgement [on a recession this year]. On the strength of banks: We have a more resistent banking system. We have used stress tests to see if firms can support credit needs of our economy even in times of great [financial] stress. We do have a strong banking system and we\u2019ve seen marked improvement. Here\u2019s a chart showing how the chances of a Fed rate rise have dropped sharply since January in the wake of the market turmoil and Yellen\u2019s comments: After opening comments from committee chair Richard Shelby and senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is currently delivering her testimony (identical to yesterday\u2019s speech remember). Meanwhile markets seem to have recovered a little from their worst levels. Analyst Connor Campbell at Spreadex said: Initially threatening a 300 point plunge when the bell rang on Wall Street the Dow Jones settled into a more solid, if still troublesome, 175 point drop as the open receded into the background. Whether or not the better than expected, and best since December, jobless claims helped (it probably didn\u2019t) is unclear, though at this point in time in the most worthless piece of positive news is likely appreciated by fear-stricken investors. The Dow was probably saved (and this is all relative, remember) by the fact that the blood loss endured by the US banking sector was nowhere near as gory as the scenes over in Europe, Bank of America the worst hit at around a 4% decline. In Europe things were much the same, i.e. not too good at all. The FTSE just about managed to claw its way back to the 5600 mark, arguably thanks to the fact that Brent Crude is now closer to $31 per barrel than it is to $30. The DAX, meanwhile, tucked under a 2% decline around 40 points away from 8900, whilst the CAC climbed down from its 3.7% nadir to post a 2.7% loss, both indices aided by a (minor) reduction in losses form Deutsche Bank and Societe Generale respectively. The big question now is, does today\u2019s horrorshow continue into Friday? Given just how fearful investors appear to be at the moment it is incredibly hard to tell; one thing tomorrow does have going for it, however, is data. Lots and lots of it. Germany, Italy and the Eurozone as a whole reveal their preliminary fourth quarter GDP figures, whilst the US sees retail sales, import prices and the University of Michigan consumer sentiment number. The markets will be hoping (nay, praying) that, with a bit of distraction (like on Wednesday), the week can end on a slightly more positive note. Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is back on Capitol Hill to discuss the global outlook and monetary policy with the Senate Banking Committee, the second and last day of her testimony to Congress. The hearing has begun and can be viewed here. Elsewhere Morgan Stanley has agree to pay $3.2bn relating to the sale of mortgage-backed bonds before the financial crisis. Ahead of Yellen\u2019s testimony, some think it is time for a US rate cut: As predicted, the US market has followed the rest of the world lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 243 points or 1.5%, while the S&amp;P 500 has lost 1% and Nasdaq 1.3%. Meanwhile the International Monetary Fund has confirmed that Christine Lagarde has been nominated for a second five year term as managing director unopposed. Her first term ends in July. Well, here\u2019s the answer to the question about whether Janet Yellen would change her testimony from Wednesday\u2019s remarks in the light of the day\u2019s renewed market turmoil. No. The Fed said: Chair Yellen submitted identical remarks to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, on February 11, 201. So if you want to read along with Yellen at 10am EST (3pm GMT) here it is again. Here\u2019s some comments on Portugal and Greece from Slovakia\u2019s finance minister Peter Ka\u017eim\u00edr ahead of the eurogroup: Bloomberg points out another possible reason behind the plunge in bank shares: Oil rich Gulf states have of course been hard hit by the plunge in crude prices. Now here\u2019s a key question about today\u2019s second testimony from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen: Over in Brussels, eurozone finance ministers are telling reporters that the European banking sector is in good shape, as they arrive for a Eurogroup meeting. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem revealed that ministers will consider the market turbulence during today\u2019s session. European commissioner Pierre Moscovici was pretty optimistic too: And Finnish finance minister Alex Stubb was \u201crelaxed\u201d about the situation: Out of the mists of gloom comes some good news, in the shape of the weekly US jobless figures. They show that the number of Americans filing new unemployment claims fell by 16,000 last week, to a seven-week low. The initial jobless claims figure came in at 269,000, down from 280,000. So, US companies kept hiring staff last week, despite the market turmoil. World stock markets are gripped by another bout of feverish selling today. Fears over the global economy and the financial sector have hit shares, driven down (most) sovereign bond yields, and sent wild gyrations through the foreign exchange markets. In London, the FTSE 100 has hit a three and a half-year low. The blue-chip index is currently down 120 points, or 2%. Financial stocks are under real pressure, with Aberdeen Asset Management, Prudential and Barclays all down 6%. Other European markets are being routed too, with the French CAC plunging by 3.5%, Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB losing 5%(!) and German DAX off by 2%. Wall Street is expected to follow suit, with the Dow being called down 280 points or almost 2%. The day began with a big selloff in Asia, as traders returned after the Lunar New Year. Hong Kong\u2019s stock market slid by 4%. Maike Currie, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International, says investors face volatile markets: \u201cFebruary has continued much like January begun, with markets yo-yoing and investor sentiment swinging from one concern to the next. The FTSE 100 broke the 5,500 barrier today \u2013 hitting a new low since July 2012. \u201cInvestors can\u2019t be blamed for feeling unnerved. There is a cocktail of worries clouding the investment horizon from a slowing China, emerging market rout, the unprecedented collapse in the oil prices and more recently, the problems brewing in the banking sector. Bank shares are in the eye of the storm again: France\u2019s Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale has tumbled by 13% after warning that \u201cheadwinds\u201d could hit profitability this year. Deutsche Bank is down by 9%, two days after insisting it was \u201crock-solid\u201d. The dollar has fallen sharply against the yen, before suddenly rebounding, sparking rumours that the Bank of Japan has intervened to weaken its currency. And the British pound has fallen by over a cent against the US dollar to $1.439. Money has poured into German, US and UK government debt. This has driven down Britain\u2019s cost of borrowing to an alltime low. But Portugal\u2019s bonds have weakened, sparking fears that investors are worrying about Lisbon again. Sweden\u2019s central bank fired another shot in the currency wars, surprising the markets by slashing interest rates to a new record low of minus 0.5%. The oil price has weakened again, with US crude oil trading at levels last seen in 2003. But gold has jumped by 2.6% to $1,229 per ounce, a nine-month high. Financial sentiment right now: A rumour is sweeping the trading floors that the Bank of Japan has intervened to weaken the yen, following today\u2019s surge against the US dollar. And the yen has weakened, moving from \u00a5111.5 to \u00a5112 against the $1. America is waking up to the news that Asian and European markets have taken another bath this morning. And they are next in line: Investors are ditching Portuguese government bonds this morning, as the financial turmoil grows. The wave of selling has driven up the yield on Portugal\u2019s 10-year bonds to 4.3%, up from 3.5% yesterday. That\u2019s a remarkable surge, meaning that prices have dropped sharply. It implies that the markets are losing confidence in Portugal again, demanding a higher rate of return for holding its bonds. Shorter-term Portuguese debt is also being hit. The move comes as Lisbon\u2019s new left-wing government begins to reverse some of its predecessor\u2019s austerity policies. Last week, the EU warned that Portugal was \u201cat risk\u201d of breaching Europe\u2019s fiscal rules, after warily approving its 2016 budget. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, reckons fear is driving shares down today, rather than a fundamental shift. He says: The fear surrounding global financial markets has been cranked up further today, as risk assets once more took a battering in favour of defensive plays. The continued deterioration in the FTSE is as much to do with the ongoing fall in oil and the fall in the US dollar against the yen, as the outlook for the UK economy itself, yet with markets in freefall, who is going to argue with a trend? There are many potential causes of the current rout. For example: signs of slowing global growth; fears that negative interest rates severely undermine bank profitability; the bad loans lurking in the European financial sector; suspicions that China is much weaker than the GDP figures show.... All good reasons to worry. But as the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Juliet Samuel flags up, the City isn\u2019t sure what\u2019s really behind it. In a morning of wild and alarming moves, one stands out. The Japanese yen has jumped by 1.7% against the US dollar today, strengthening from \u00a5113.3 to $1, to \u00a5111.5. That\u2019s a chunky daily move. And so far this year, the yen has gained by 7.5% against the US dollar, hitting its strongest point since November 2014. That will surely concern the Bank of Japan, which imposed negative rates last month in its latest attempt to stimulate growth and inflation. A stronger yen is bad for exports, and also deflationary as it makes imported goods cheaper. Yann Quelenn, market analyst at Swissquote Bank, explains: The US dollar printed a fresh 16-month low against the Japanese yen, suggesting that traders believe the BoJ will be unable to further weaken the yen, while betting the Fed will remain sidelined for a longer period of time. But there is also chatter that the BoJ may have to intervene in the markets to weaken the yen. Here, courtesy of David Buik of Panmure Gordon, is a snapshot of the day\u2019s rout (so far) in the banking sector: Britain\u2019s borrowing costs have now hit their lowest level since the late 1600s, thanks to the plunge in bond yields today (details here). So reckons Sky News\u2019s economics editor, Ed Conway, who has checked the historic data. It\u2019s unlikely that Britain\u2019s medieval kings could have borrowed any cheaper either. They were notorious serial defaulters, due to the demands of court life and military ambitions. Mind you, academics at the University of Reading have argued that the picture was more nuanced.... They wrote: It can be difficult to identify medieval interest rates, in part because interest charges had to be disguised to circumvent the Church prohibition on usury, but we found that the king could borrow at 15% annualised interest when his finances were stable but that this could increase to more than 40% during periods of financial pressure, most notably during wartime. Edward I probably had a surplus on his account with the Ricciardi, who collapsed as the result of a \u2018credit crunch\u2019 caused by the unexpected outbreak of war between England and France..... More here: Credit Finance in the Middle Ages: loans to the English crown c.1272-1340 The Greek stock market is suffering another rout, led by its banks: Oil is being thumped by predictions of a growing crude glut, as the world economy slows. The price of US crude has fallen by almost 3% today, to $26.74 per barrel. That\u2019s a one-month low, but also close to the levels ploughed in 2003: Bloomberg\u2019s Caroline Hyde tweets the details: The refusal of oil producers to cut production is fuelling concerns that we may run out of places to put the stuff, as inventory levels keep rising. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains: The threat of further rate hikes from the Fed coupled with diminished prospects for a joint production cut between OPEC and non-OPEC producers have sent US oil prices back down to 12-year lows. The renewed slump in the price of oil has been unfortunate timing for French oil giant Total to report a 20% rise in annual net profits which CEO Patrick Pouyanne proclaimed as the \u201cbest performance\u201d amongst the oil majors. Today\u2019s rout has driven European bank shares down to their lowest level in three and a half years. The Stoxx 600 Banks index, which includes the main lenders in Europe, has shed 6.1% and is now at its lowest level since August 2012. Summer 2012 was the point at which the eurozone debt crisis began to ease, with European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi vowing to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the euro. Today\u2019s rout is being led by Italian banks, and French bank SocGen (after its results missed forecasts today). Britain\u2019s government borrowing costs have just hit an all-time low, according to Reuters data. The yield on 10-year UK gilts, which are the benchmark for UK borrowing, has fallen to 1.29% this morning in a wave of buying. Yield, the interest rate on the debt, fall when prices rise. So this implies Britain can borrow cheaper than at any time before (the data I can see goes back to 1989) That sounds like good news, except that it reflects wider fears over a global recession. If traders were upbeat about growth prospects, they\u2019d be buying shares instead. Investors are scrambling into \u201csafer\u201d eurozone government bonds. That\u2019s another sign that they\u2019re seeking protection against recession and market turmoil. German government bond yields (the interest rate on bunds) has hit a nine-month low this morning - meaning the prices of these bonds has hit the highest level since May 2015. And the yield on US 10-year Treasury bills has hit its lowest in three years, at just 1.62%. That also suggests traders are pessimistic about future growth and inflation prospects. Bank shares are getting a tonking this morning. Deutsche Bank, the source of so much worry, is down by 6.3% in Frankfurt, with Commerzbank close behind. After a rough start to trading, European stock markets are deep and turbulent sea of red. Italy is the worst performer, with its FTSE MIB index slumping by over 4%: FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga says Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is partly to blame. He reckons investors are disappointed that Yellen didn\u2019t rule out interest rate rises, when she appeared at Congress yesterday: Although the economic environment has transformed for the worst since the start of the year with ongoing China woes and violent declines in oil prices exposing the US economy to downside risks, in defiance the Fed continues to hold the view of raising rates at a gradual pace. While Yellen also emphasized that financial conditions in the US have become less supportive of growth, this was counterbalanced with the impressive labour report which in the eyes of the Fed opened doors for a potential rate rise in March. Yellen will get a second bite at the cherry later today, when she continues testifying to US lawmakers. Wall Street is expected to take a tumble later today: Nour Al-Hammoury, chief market strategist at ADS Securities in Abu Dhabi says: Asia and Europe equities remain weak following the Feds acknowledgment that they have concerns over global markets. European financial risk indices continue to rise, which is keeping demand high for safe haven assets. Ahead of the open we\u2019re currently calling the DOW down 275 15640 and the S&amp;P down 32 at 1820 Sweden\u2019s central bank has cut the country\u2019s interest rates deeper into negative territory, in another sign of the turbulence in the financial world. The Riksbank has just announced that the headline rate will fall to -.50%, from -0.35%. The move is designed to drive inflation up and stimulate growth. The bank says: The economy continues to strengthen but inflation is expected to be lower during 2016 than previously forecast. The rate cut will also weaken the Swedish currency. It is already hitting the Swedish Krone hard, sending the euro surging against the krone. Only 3 economists surveyed by Bloomberg has expected such a deep cut (8 thought rates would stay at minus 0.35%, and 7 predicted a cut to minus 0.45%) Tony Cross, analyst at Trustnet Direct, says fears over the world economy are hitting shares hard, and also pushing the oil price down. Any hopes that yesterday\u2019s modest rally for the FTSE-100 would mark something of a turning point have been dashed. WTI crude oil prices tested territory below $27/barrel, whilst the return to work after the Lunar New Year break saw traders in Hong Kong lacked any signs of optimism. Janet Yellen\u2019s words yesterday have clearly done nothing to calm sentiment \u2013 yes the next US rate hike may have been pushed back, but the challenge now is managing the US recovery against a potential global slowdown. The London selloff is accelerating, wiping 130 points off the Footsie. The index of major blue-chip shares has now hit its lowest level since July 2012: Over in Paris, French bank Societe Generale has plunged by 9%. It missed City forecasts this morning, with net income coming in around 31% below analyst forecasts. SocGen also warned that \u201cheadwinds\u201d could hamper its efforts to hit profitability targets this year. That wipes out yesterday\u2019s recovery: Money is pouring into safer assets, and out of shares. The gold price has risen to $1,211 per ounce, its highest since May 2015. And the Japanese yen has hit its highest level against the British pound since November 2013. Down we go again! European shares are falling at the start of trading. The FTSE 100 has shed 101 points, or 1.7%, to 5,570 points. Germany\u2019s DAX has lost 1.5%, and the French CAC is off by 1.6% Most London shares are down, but mining stocks are leading the selloff reflecting ongoing gloom about the global economy. Rio Tinto has slumped by 6.7%, after it abandoned its \u201cprogressive dividend\u201d policy this morning (a promise to pay more shareholders in future years). This follows a late-selloff on Wall Street last night, and the slumps in Asia earlier today. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says: The weakness stems from Fed chair Janet Yellen warning on current financial market turbulence and suggesting further rate hikes could be delayed, which added to already raised anxiety about the health of the global economy to hold back risk sentiment. It\u2019s never great returning to work after a holiday. But the mood in Hong Kong was particularly grim, as investors watched shares tumble. Nitin Dialdas, chief investment officer at Mandarin Capital in Hong Kong, told Reuters that 2016 will be tough. \u201dI think this is going to be a difficult year for investors and even a fledgling U.S. economic recovery looks to be snuffed out by global markets development.\u201d Charles Li, chief executive of the Hong Kong Stock exchange, was also gloomy: \u201cThere is very little good news and continuous bad news and this is a test of market confidence.\u201d Hong Kong\u2019s stock market is suffering its worst start to the Lunar New Year since 1994. A wave of selling has hit shares as traders return to their desks after this week\u2019s holiday. They were swift to catch up with the turmoil in European and US markets, with Asian markets having been shut since Friday. The Hang Seng index has lurched down, losing 795 points or nearly 4% to 18,535. That\u2019s its biggest one-day loss in six months. As this chart from Bloomberg shows, that\u2019s the worst start to a Lunar New Year in over two decades: There were similar losses in other Asian markets. South Korea\u2019s Kospi staged its biggest daily drop in nearly four years, down 2.9 percent to finish at 1,861.54. Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital in Sydney, blamed fears over the global slowdown, and the oil price slump, adding: \u201cWhat started in January as mainly China based worries has clearly broadened back out to concerns about global growth\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s no end in sight to the market turmoil. European stocks are expected to fall at the start of trading, with worries over the global slowdown centre-stage again. The futures market suggests the main indices, including London\u2019s FTSE 100, will lose around 1% at the opening - wiping out Wednesday\u2019s small rally. Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is testifying to Congress for the second day running (at 3pm GMT). She\u2019ll probably repeat her concerns about the turmoil in the markets, which could prevent the Fed from hiking rates this year. We\u2019ll hear from another central bank today, too. At 8.30am, Sweden\u2019s Riksbank announces its monetary policy decision, and some economists believe it will cut interest rates deeper into negative territory. And Eurozone finance ministers are meeting in Brussels; Greece\u2019s struggling bailout talks will be on the agenda, as Athens and its creditors continue to argue over its austerity plan. In the corporate world. oil giant Total, holiday firm Thomas Cook, insurance group Zurich and mining giant Rio Tinto are all reporting results (more on them shortly....) We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

Oil jumped on renewed hopes that producers would agree to meet to cut output (although we have heard this many times before), which helped lift energy companies. Nicholas Hyett, investment analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Oil stocks are rallying today on speculation that Opec might be willing to cut production. It will need to be a big cut though; some US storage facilities are at 90% of capacity with new production still to come online this year.</p> </blockquote> <p>Banks also came back from their beaten-down levels, after better than expected figures from Commerzbank, news that JP Morgan\u2019s Jamie Dimon was snapping up the bank\u2019s shares and Deutsche Bank\u2019s plan to buy back debt.</p> <p>Wall Street also helped, moving higher after better than expected US retail sales, while there appeared to be no real shocks in the eurozone GDP figures, albeit Greece moved back into recession.</p> <p>Investors are already looking ahead to Monday, when Chinese markets re-open after a week\u2019s holiday for New Year.

He says:</p> <blockquote> <p>In principle, cutting policy rates into negative territory should boost growth and inflation. But central banks have not communicated these benefits clearly, and the hesitant way in which they have been introduced has undermined confidence, raising the risk that negative rates do more harm than good.</p> <p>Although markets are rebounding today, the sharp falls in equity prices and in particular bank shares since the beginning of the year have led many to claim that negative rates are damaging global economic prospects. Markets have focused on three main concerns.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <ul> <li>First, negative deposit rates impose a direct financial cost on banks, harming their profitability and thus their willingness to make new loans...[But] we estimate that negative policy rates in the four European economies that have applied them are costing the banking sector around \u20ac3bn a year. That is a trivial fraction of their assets and is not a game-changer for their profitability either...</li> <li>The second fear is that the rush to impose negative policy rates is the latest front in a futile currency war. There is some truth to this argument as a weaker exchange rate is a key channel through which negative rates can operate. But there is little evidence that the major central banks are competing to weaken their currencies, and insofar as they are, the result will be looser global monetary policy which should be positive for global growth.</li> <li>Perhaps the biggest worry though is that cuts to policy rates have added to the sense that the world economy is slowing sharply and that policymakers are running out of options. Policy loosening has fuelled, rather than soothed, market fears...Central banks themselves are partly to blame for this response because they have repeatedly claimed that policy rates could not be lowered further, only to surprise the markets by cutting rates weeks later. No central bank has given a clear idea of how low interest rates on excess reserves could go, adding to the perception that they are flying blind. Nonetheless, claims that monetary policy has reached its limits are exaggerated. After all, there is still plenty of scope for further quantitative easing.</li> </ul> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56bdfc1be4b0eba06ed5fc41\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-12T15:39:25.406Z\">3.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The University of Michigan survey suggests a falling outlook for inflation:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Lavorgnanomics/status/698167972662288388\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">5-10yr <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/inflation?src=hash\">#inflation</a> expectations in the U. of Mich. survey fell 0.3% to 2.4% - lowest reading in the history of the series</p>&mdash; Joseph A.

Lower oil prices have certainly helped, with the US consumer benefitting from cheaper gas to the tune of $80m per day. The labour market continues to strengthen and consumer confidence hasn\u2019t been shaken, all of which bodes well for the domestic economy.</p> <p>What really matters though, is how well the US weathers the global risks in the long-term: namely, Chinese devaluation and the exacerbating effect of the stronger US dollar. Clearly, the tentacles of the Chinese slowdown are spreading, and the lack of a clear enough policy is a red flag to ongoing volatility.

He repeated that debt relief - a bone of contention among some of the country\u2019s creditors - needed to be a key element of the programme. He wrote in <strong><a href=\"https://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/2016/02/11/greece-toward-a-workable-program/?hootPostID=406cd1348e266ebe45426232bdc79335\">a new IMF commentary</a></strong>:</p> <blockquote> <p>The IMF does not want Greece to implement draconian fiscal adjustment in an already severely depressed economy. In fact, we have time and again been the ones arguing for a fiscal adjustment path that is more supportive of recovery in the near term and more realistic in the medium term.</p> <p>We have yet to see a credible plan for how Greece will reach the very ambitious medium-term surplus target that is key to the government\u2019s plans for restoring debt sustainability. This emphasis on credibility is crucial for generating the investor confidence that is critical to Greece\u2019s revival. A plan built on over-optimistic assumptions will soon cause Grexit fears to resurface once again and stifle the investment climate.</p> <p>The overriding objective of the IMF\u2019s engagement with Greece is to help the country put itself back on a path of sustainable growth that benefits the Greek people. The IMF will support the Greek authorities and their European partners in developing a program of reforms and debt relief that adds up. There are difficult choices to be made, but it is important to make them so that Greece\u2019s efforts over the last six years are not wasted.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the need for both reforms and debt relief, he said:</p> <blockquote> <p>It is argued that the IMF has made its participation dependent on socially draconian reforms, especially of the pension system. This is not the case. Ultimately a program must add up: the combination of reforms plus debt relief must give us and the international community reasonable assurances that by the end of Greece\u2019s next program, after almost a decade of dependence on European and IMF assistance, Greece will finally be able to stand on its own. This implies an inverse trade-off between ambition of reforms and strength of debt relief\u2014we can certainly support a program with less ambitious reforms, but this will inevitably involve more debt relief.</p> <p>This said, no amount of pension reforms will make Greece\u2019s debt sustainable without debt relief, and no amount of debt relief will make Greece\u2019s pension system sustainable without pension reforms. Both need to come about. There is no doubt that both Greece and its European partners will face politically difficult decisions in the coming months to arrive at a program that is viable\u2014one that adds up.</p> </blockquote> <p>And on pensions, he said Greece is too poor to afford its present pension system:</p> <blockquote> <p>Despite the pension reforms of 2010 and 2012, Greece\u2019s pension system remains unaffordably generous. For instance, the standard pensions in nominal Euro terms are broadly similar in Greece and Germany, even though Germany\u2014measured by the average wage\u2014is twice as rich as Greece. Add to this that Greeks still retire much earlier than Germans and that Germany is much better at collecting social security contributions. The result is that the Greek budget needs to transfer some 10 percent of GDP to cover the gaping hole in the pension system, compared to a European average of some 2\u00bd percent. Clearly, this is unsustainable.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-02-12T14:24:28.771Z\">at 2.24pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-56bdd9b1e4b0999485acbd94\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/larryelliott\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-12T13:12:21.639Z\">1.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The next phase of the eurozone crisis is about to begin, to judge by the latest GDP figures, argues our economics editor Larry Elliott.

                "bodyText":"Finally, more on New York Fed president William Dudley playing down talk of negative interest rates in the US, in the wake of Janet Yellen\u2019s comments this week. Edward Helmore writes: New York Fed president William Dudley has dismissed speculation that the US Federal Reserve could adopt negative interest rates as \u201cextraordinarily premature\u201d. Speaking a day after Fed chair Janet Yellen concluded two days of congressional testimony during which she left open questions on whether the US could follow central banks in Europe and Japan by adopting negative rates, Dudley, a voting member on the Fed\u2019s policymaking committee, struck an optimistic tone. He said US households and banks are better able to absorb shocks than they were when the last recession hit. Against a backdrop of supportive US consumer and household debt data released Friday, Dudley added US monetary policy remains \u201cquite accommodative\u201d after the Fed\u2019s decision to raise interest rates in December. \u201cKey sectors of the US economy, such as the household sector, seem to be in good shape,\u201d he said, repeating Yellen\u2019s assertion that despite market turmoil that\u2019s caused the S&amp;P 500 to lose 10% of its value this year, economic expansions do not simply \u201cdie of old age\u201d. The full story is here. On that note we\u2019ll close up, and say thanks for all your comments. See you again soon. Worries about a global slowdown, falling oil prices and the effect of negative interest rates on banks have combined to produce another traumatic week for stock market investors. But the week ended with sentiment much improved, with European markets showing significant gains. Oil jumped on renewed hopes that producers would agree to meet to cut output (although we have heard this many times before), which helped lift energy companies. Nicholas Hyett, investment analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said: Oil stocks are rallying today on speculation that Opec might be willing to cut production. It will need to be a big cut though; some US storage facilities are at 90% of capacity with new production still to come online this year. Banks also came back from their beaten-down levels, after better than expected figures from Commerzbank, news that JP Morgan\u2019s Jamie Dimon was snapping up the bank\u2019s shares and Deutsche Bank\u2019s plan to buy back debt. Wall Street also helped, moving higher after better than expected US retail sales, while there appeared to be no real shocks in the eurozone GDP figures, albeit Greece moved back into recession. Investors are already looking ahead to Monday, when Chinese markets re-open after a week\u2019s holiday for New Year. Will its stock market move higher or play catch up with the falls elsewhere in global markets? With Wall Street closed on Monday, it could be another volatile day. Meanwhile the final scores in Europe ahead of the weekend showed: The FTSE 100 jumped 3.08% or 170.63 points to 5707.60, its biggest one day rise since August Germany\u2019s Dax added 2.45% to 8967.51 France\u2019s Cac climbed 2.52% to 3995.06 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 4.7% up at 16,514.87 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 2.25% better at 7920.8 In Greece, despite the protests and a slump back into recession, the Athens market added 3.04% to 454.29 In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 227 points or 1.4% higher. More pictures from Greece, where farmers are protesting outside parliament. And more proof of the volatile week markets have just suffered: Deutsche of course had been hit by worries about its balance sheet and the effect of negative interest rates, like others in the sector, as well as pressure on its contingent convertible bonds. But along with the recovery in bank shares, Deutsche has also been lifted by news it planned to buy back debt. The FTSE 100 has jumped 3.08%, its biggest one day rise since 27 August. As of Thursday, some \u00a380bn had been wiped off the UK\u2019s leading index. With today\u2019s recovery that has been cut to \u00a336bn. More on oil: Despite the current market rally, leading shares still have some way to go to mount a major recovery. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said: The week finishes in much better form than it began, with stock markets in Europe and the US clawing back losses, with even some better US retail sales figures adding to the merry mood. European markets in particular can look forward to more positive momentum on Monday, when the US is out of action for Presidents Day. That of course is the short-term picture, and for the FTSE 100 even a significant recovery in coming weeks, similar to that seen in January, would still leave the market in a firm downward move. Oil prices have been on another tear higher today, which has provided a firm base on which to build the broader stock market rally. However, pessimists (and there are many around at the moment) will be quick to point out that there\u2019s little sign of an actual meeting between major oil producers, and that Saudi intransigence on production cuts remains the chief, and currently insuperable, obstacle to tackling the problem of huge oversupply. At least the banks are doing better today, with both the FTSE banking sector and its European counterparts racing away. After all, even if rates aren\u2019t going higher, there\u2019s always the hope of more ECB largesse to sweeten the outlook somewhat... The return of China to the market fray after their holiday could also be key for further gains, although a couple of days of volatility as they play catch-up cannot be ruled out. US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen floated the idea the bank could look at negative rates in her testimony to Congress this week. But one of her colleagues is not so sure. New York Fed President William Dudley said negative rates elsewhere - ie in Japan and Europe - would have little effect on the US economy, reports Reuters, adding that negative rates \u201cshould not be part of the conversation right now in the US.\u201d He also said US bank were in good shape despite the share price falls in the sector in recent days. Negative interest rates should help lift growth and inflation but if the market turmoil continues, the economic consequences could outweigh the benefits, says Michael Pearce at Capital Economics. He says: In principle, cutting policy rates into negative territory should boost growth and inflation. But central banks have not communicated these benefits clearly, and the hesitant way in which they have been introduced has undermined confidence, raising the risk that negative rates do more harm than good. Although markets are rebounding today, the sharp falls in equity prices and in particular bank shares since the beginning of the year have led many to claim that negative rates are damaging global economic prospects. Markets have focused on three main concerns. First, negative deposit rates impose a direct financial cost on banks, harming their profitability and thus their willingness to make new loans...[But] we estimate that negative policy rates in the four European economies that have applied them are costing the banking sector around \u20ac3bn a year. That is a trivial fraction of their assets and is not a game-changer for their profitability either... The second fear is that the rush to impose negative policy rates is the latest front in a futile currency war. There is some truth to this argument as a weaker exchange rate is a key channel through which negative rates can operate. But there is little evidence that the major central banks are competing to weaken their currencies, and insofar as they are, the result will be looser global monetary policy which should be positive for global growth. Perhaps the biggest worry though is that cuts to policy rates have added to the sense that the world economy is slowing sharply and that policymakers are running out of options. Policy loosening has fuelled, rather than soothed, market fears...Central banks themselves are partly to blame for this response because they have repeatedly claimed that policy rates could not be lowered further, only to surprise the markets by cutting rates weeks later. No central bank has given a clear idea of how low interest rates on excess reserves could go, adding to the perception that they are flying blind. Nonetheless, claims that monetary policy has reached its limits are exaggerated. After all, there is still plenty of scope for further quantitative easing. The University of Michigan survey suggests a falling outlook for inflation: The US consumer confidence figures are not too bad under the circumstances, reckons James Knightley at ING Bank: US consumer confidence as measured by the University of Michigan dipped to 90.7 in February versus 92.0 in January. This is a bit weaker than the 92.3 consensus, but isn\u2019t too bad given the scale of equity market sell-off. Indeed, strong employment gains, rising real incomes and a firm housing market are providing enough offsetting effects for now and with retail sales having come in stronger than expected (when upward revisions are included) it looks a reasonably encouraging consumer spending story for now. However, equity markets don\u2019t seem particularly interested unfortunately and the longer that this goes on the greater the risk that it feeds negatively into the real economy through weaker sentiment and tighter financial conditions. And after the US retail sales, here is some less positive news in terms of consumer confidence. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index has missed expectations with a fall from 92 in December to 90.7. The consensus forecast was for a reading of 92 for January. The index of consumers expectations fell from 82.7 to 81, a four month low. Meanwhile business inventories rose 0.1%, in line with forecasts. Oil continues to rebound, on renewed hope of production cuts to stem the supply glut. Apparently helping the rally were reported comments from United Arab Emirates oil minister Suhail Al Mazrouei that producers were ready to work together. But we have been here many times before, and he was also reported as saying that there would be no cuts unless there was full co-operation among producers. There have been several optimistic reports suggesting Opec might be ready to talk to other producers such as Russia about limiting output, but so far no real progress. Nevertheless, Brent crude is now up 5% at $31.59 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is 6% better at $27.79. And that is one of the factors helping to support stock markets as they bounce back from recent lows. Another cut in the European Central Bank\u2019s deposit rate in March has strong support among the central bank\u2019s governing council, Reuters is reporting. Any cut could come as part of a broader package including some changes to the bank\u2019s asset purchase programme, but there is little appetite for more radical action . Reuters says markets are pricing in at least two rate cuts by the end of the year, taking the deposit rate from -0.3% to -0.55%. Banking groups are unlikely to be happy, since their shares have been hammered this week by fears about the effects of the wave of negative rates on their balance sheets and margins. Reuters reports one policymaker as saying: \u201cCutting the deposit rate by more than 10 basis points would hurt bank profitability, not a popular idea right now, especially given what\u2019s happening in the banking sector.\u201d With markets elsewhere moving ahead after the recent turmoil (the Nikkei was the exception), the US has joined in the more optimistic mood. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 140 points or 0.9% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.6% higher and the Nasdaq added 1%. Energy and financial stocks were among the early gainers. It appears there is some disagreement over the earlier comments about Greece from the IMF\u2019s Poul Thomsen: But: The US retail sales show consumer spending remains important to the country\u2019s economy but the key question is how it will cope with the global problems, says Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management: Consumer spending has played a starring role in supporting growth in the US\u2019 service-led economy, and the latest retail figures suggest this is set to continue. Lower oil prices have certainly helped, with the US consumer benefitting from cheaper gas to the tune of $80m per day. The labour market continues to strengthen and consumer confidence hasn\u2019t been shaken, all of which bodes well for the domestic economy. What really matters though, is how well the US weathers the global risks in the long-term: namely, Chinese devaluation and the exacerbating effect of the stronger US dollar. Clearly, the tentacles of the Chinese slowdown are spreading, and the lack of a clear enough policy is a red flag to ongoing volatility. Equally, the dollar has been strengthening due to the robustness \u2013 until recently \u2013 of the US recovery and the Fed\u2019s decision to hike rates in December. However, it does drag down exports and adds to the already widening trade deficit. While it\u2019s not yet a case of stunting US growth, all eyes will remain on Yellen to soothe where she can. For now, as hinted in her testimony to Congress, she\u2019ll continue to put any immediate rates rise on hold. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said the US retail sales showed some positive signs: With US data on the whole far from convincing following the interest rate rise, Fed Chair Janet Yellen will be pleased with the green shoots shown in today\u2019s retail sales figures. Any positive figure is a step in the right direction, and onlookers still await an uptick in consumer activity prompted by continuing low fuel and energy prices. Yellen will still be wary given that the numbers have been given a leg-up from the holiday season, and she should expect there to be further strain on the US economy in the coming months. Overall, US retail sales rose 0.2% in January, while the December figure has been revised upwards from a 0.1% fall to a gain of 0.2%, said the Commerce Department. Cheaper fuel prices as the oil price tumbled seemed to encourage spending, although it also cut back revenues at petrol stations, while spending at bars and restaurants was hit by the severe winter weather. But clothing stores saw sales rise 0.2% and online retailers saw a 1.6% jump (the effect of harsh weather again presumably). Over in the US and signs that consumers may be spending again as retail sales beat expectations. Core retail sales - which exclude cars, fuel, building materials and food services - increased 0.6% in January after a 0.3% fall in the previous month. Analysts had forecast an increase of around 0.3%. Deutsche Bank has confirmed earlier reports it may buy back some of its debt, an idea which has been supporting its share price after its falls earlier this week. Deutsche has said it will offer to buy up to \u20ac3bn of European debt and $2bn of US debt. Ahead of Greece falling into recession and the new protests in Athens, the International Monetary Fund has said that fears of the country leaving the eurozone will increase unless a credible reform plan is put together. And Poul Thomsen, head of the IMF\u2019s European department, said it had not yet seen such a plan. He repeated that debt relief - a bone of contention among some of the country\u2019s creditors - needed to be a key element of the programme. He wrote in a new IMF commentary: The IMF does not want Greece to implement draconian fiscal adjustment in an already severely depressed economy. In fact, we have time and again been the ones arguing for a fiscal adjustment path that is more supportive of recovery in the near term and more realistic in the medium term. We have yet to see a credible plan for how Greece will reach the very ambitious medium-term surplus target that is key to the government\u2019s plans for restoring debt sustainability. This emphasis on credibility is crucial for generating the investor confidence that is critical to Greece\u2019s revival. A plan built on over-optimistic assumptions will soon cause Grexit fears to resurface once again and stifle the investment climate. The overriding objective of the IMF\u2019s engagement with Greece is to help the country put itself back on a path of sustainable growth that benefits the Greek people. The IMF will support the Greek authorities and their European partners in developing a program of reforms and debt relief that adds up. There are difficult choices to be made, but it is important to make them so that Greece\u2019s efforts over the last six years are not wasted. On the need for both reforms and debt relief, he said: It is argued that the IMF has made its participation dependent on socially draconian reforms, especially of the pension system. This is not the case. Ultimately a program must add up: the combination of reforms plus debt relief must give us and the international community reasonable assurances that by the end of Greece\u2019s next program, after almost a decade of dependence on European and IMF assistance, Greece will finally be able to stand on its own. This implies an inverse trade-off between ambition of reforms and strength of debt relief\u2014we can certainly support a program with less ambitious reforms, but this will inevitably involve more debt relief. This said, no amount of pension reforms will make Greece\u2019s debt sustainable without debt relief, and no amount of debt relief will make Greece\u2019s pension system sustainable without pension reforms. Both need to come about. There is no doubt that both Greece and its European partners will face politically difficult decisions in the coming months to arrive at a program that is viable\u2014one that adds up. And on pensions, he said Greece is too poor to afford its present pension system: Despite the pension reforms of 2010 and 2012, Greece\u2019s pension system remains unaffordably generous. For instance, the standard pensions in nominal Euro terms are broadly similar in Greece and Germany, even though Germany\u2014measured by the average wage\u2014is twice as rich as Greece. Add to this that Greeks still retire much earlier than Germans and that Germany is much better at collecting social security contributions. The result is that the Greek budget needs to transfer some 10 percent of GDP to cover the gaping hole in the pension system, compared to a European average of some 2\u00bd percent. Clearly, this is unsustainable. The next phase of the eurozone crisis is about to begin, to judge by the latest GDP figures, argues our economics editor Larry Elliott. He writes: Greece is back in recession. Italy is barely growing. Portugal expanded but only at half the expected rate. The message could hardly be clearer: the next phase of the eurozone crisis is about to begin. On the face of it, the performance of the eurozone economy in the final three months of 2015 looks solid if unspectacular, with growth as measured by GDP up by 0.3%. But scratch beneath the surface and the picture looks far less rosy. The beneficial impacts of the European Central Bank\u2019s quantitative easing programme have started to wear off, as has the effect of the big drop in oil prices in the second half of 2014. The eurozone peaked in the second quarter of 2015 and the trend was starting to weaken even before the recent turbulence on the financial markets... In the short term, further stimulus from the ECB is a bolt-on certainty next month, either through cuts in interest rates or an expansion of its QE programme, or more likely both. In the longer term, a summer of crisis eurozone summits to discuss the fate of Greece looms. Probably not what David Cameron wants as he contemplates how to win his Brexit referendum. Larry\u2019s full comment is here: Here\u2019s our full report on the eurozone GDP figures: More on the yen: Europe\u2019s stock markets continue to shrug off the sight of protests in recession-hit Greece, and lacklustre growth in the euro area. Bank shares are still rallying, with Deutsche Bank up 9% and Commerzbank 17% higher after it announced its first dividend since 2007 today. Here\u2019s the lunchtime scores: FTSE 100: up 100 points at 5636, + 1.8% German DAX: up 136 points at 8,891, + 1.5% French CAC: up 47 points at 3,944, +1.2% David Lamb, head of dealing at the forex specialists FEXCO, says European investors are pinning their hopes on more stimulus from the European Central Bank: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine how the sense of deja-vu could be any stronger. The confirmation that Greece has slumped back into recession came as rioters stalked the streets of Athens to protest against government austerity. \u201cGrowth in the Eurozone\u2019s biggest economies remains weak too, so at first glance it\u2019s a puzzle that both European stocks and the Euro should rally in response to such a bleak picture. \u201cThe reason is the now racing certainty that the ECB will soon restart the Euro\u2019s printing presses. Mario Draghi has dropped ever heavier hints that more QE is coming - and on this evidence it may come as soon as March. Here\u2019s a round-up of the latest eurozone GDP data, from Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight: Fourth-quarter Eurozone GDP growth was limited by lacklustre German GDP growth of 0.3% quarter-on-quarter, which matched the third-quarter performance. German growth was reportedly held back by negative net trade in the fourth quarter as exports fell and imports rose. In addition, French GDP growth edged down to 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter from 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter, as it was held back slightly by a hit to economic activity from the Paris terrorist attacks in November. Particularly disappointingly, Italian barely grew in the fourth quarter as GDP edged up just 0.1% quarter-on-quarter. This continued a disappointing slippage in growth through 2015, as quarter-on-quarter GDP expansion came down from 0.2% in the third quarter, 0.3% in the second quarter and 0.4% in the first. Seemingly, unlike most Eurozone countries, Italian GDP was reliant on net trade in the fourth quarter as domestic demand was reported to have been a drag. On a more positive note, Spanish GDP growth held up well at 0.8% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter, having edged back to this level in the third quarter from a peak growth rate of 1.0% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter. Among the other Eurozone countries, there were modest pick-ups in quarter-on-quarter GDP growth in the fourth quarter in the Netherlands (to 0.3% from 0.1%), Belgium (to 0.3% from 0.2%) and Portugal (to 0.2% from 0.0%). Cyprus grew by 0.4% quarter-on-quarter, which was down slightly from 0.5% in the third quarter. Additionally, there was robust expansion in Slovakia (up 1.0% quarter-on-quarter, as it had been in the third quarter) and Estonia (up 1.2%). However, Greece moved into recession as GDP contracted by 0.6% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter after a drop of 1.4% in the third quarter as it continued to be hampered by fiscal austerity and capital controls Finland also moved into recession as GDP fell 0.1% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter after a drop of 0.6% in the third quarter. Furthermore, Austrian GDP was only flat quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter, as it had been in the third quarter. Greece\u2019s protesting farmers are digging in for the long haul. Athens correspondent Helena Smith reports that there are \u201cextraordinary scenes\u201d in the capital, ahead of a major anti-austerity protest later today. She writes: The area outside the agriculture ministry now resembles a war zone after farmers - mostly from Crete - fought pitched battles with police. Have just spoken to Manolis Gazakis, a farmer from the district of Rethymnon, who told me: \u201cWe said it would be war and we meant it. The government has to understand that it is us or them. We are not going to back down over measures that amount to our survival. Just the taxes they are proposing would kill us.\u201d The protestors are threatening to cut off major arteries in and around the city centre. Dozens of units of riot police have been deployed. Concern is such that road checks are even being conducted on trucks for fear that tractors may be hidden inside! Farmers, now pouring into the capital from other parts of the country, are said to be in negotiation with authorities ahead of a major rally later today. Greece\u2019s fall back into recession came as riot police clashed with farmers in Athens. They are holding a big anti-austerity rally, to urge prime minister Alexis Tsipras to withdraws its proposed social security and pension reform plan. Those reforms, though, are demanded by Greece\u2019s creditors in return for bailout funds - and eventual debt relief. Greece has lurched back into recession following the economic and political crisis last summer which saws its banks shuttered and capital controls imposed. Eurostat reports that Greek GDP fell by 0.6% in the last three months of 2015. That follows a 1.4% slump in output in the third quarter, and wipes out growth of 0.2% in April-June. Fourth-quarter GDP was a whopping 1.9% lower than a year earlier, Eurostat says. That\u2019s a serious slump, showing the damage suffered by Greece during the long standoff between Athens and its creditors last year. Greek companies have been warning for months that capital controls are hurting them badly, and these figures appear to back that up. Growth of 0.3% is quite mediocre, frankly, given the eurozone benefitted from substantial (and long-awaited) monetary stimulus last year. Lower energy bills should also have given consumers a lift. These charts from Eurostat show how eurozone growth remained at 0.3% in the fourth quarter of last year. Growth also slowed on an annual basis, across both the EU and the eurozone. Breaking: The eurozone economy grew by 0.3% in the final three months of 2015. Capital Economics isn\u2019t impressed with Portugal\u2019s growth rate: Breaking: Portugal also struggled in the last quarter of 2015. New growth figures from Lisbon show that Portuguese GDP only increased by 0.2% in the final quarter of 2015. Economists had hoped for growth of +0.4%. On an annual basis, Portugal\u2019s economy only expanded by 1.2% over 2015, below expectations of 1.4% growth. Italy\u2019s slowing economy will fuel concerns that Europe\u2019s recovery is running out of puff. Holger Sandte of Nordea Markets has tweeted this graph, showing how the eurozone lost momentum during 2015: We\u2019re expecting the overall euro area GDP figures to show an increase of 0.3% for the last quarter (they are released in 30 minutes). There\u2019s a clear downward trend in Italy\u2019s quarterly growth over the last year. ABN Amro economist Nick Kounis reminds us that Italy has been struggling for a while: Oh deary, deary me. Italy\u2019s economy only grew by 0.1% in the final three months of 2015, new data show. That\u2019s only half as fast as in July-September, when Italy expanded by 0.2%. It dashes hopes that growth might accelerate to +0.3%, and underlines the weakness of the eurozone economy. It appears that poor domestic demand held Italy back. The FT\u2019s Rome correspondent, James Politi, sounds worried: A flurry of new GDP data is hitting the wires. Poland has posted decent-looking growth, with GDP gaining 3.9% in the last year, or 1.1% quarter-on-quarter. And Bulgaria has grown by 3.1% annually, and 0.8% in the last quarter. Deutsche Bank is scrambling off the mat - shares are up by around 4%, and the cost of insuring its bonds against default has dipped. Greece and Italy share the dubious distinction of the worst-performing stock markets in 2016. Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB has lost a quarter of its value since January 1, while the Athex Composite has plunged by 30%. Spain, Germany and Austria are also lagging, with losses of around 17% each. Back to eurozone GDP, and Finland remains in recession after contracting by 0.1% in the last three months. That follows a 0.5% contraction in the July-September quarter, and means Finland\u2019s economy is still smaller than in 2008. It has suffered from falling demand for its paper industry, the decline of Nokia, and the impact of sanctions on its neighbour, Russia. And as a member of the eurozone, Finland hasn\u2019t been able to devalue its currency. There are remarkable scenes in Athens right now, as farmers protesting against pension cuts and austerity measures clash with riot police. After weeks of protests, which closed motorways, the farmers have decamped to the Greek capital for a mass rally. More than 300 famers have made the trip from Crete, to urge Alexis Tsipras\u2019s government not to impose reforms to social security system. Here\u2019s a video clip which appears to show farmers chasing the riot police down an Athens street: Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, says we should be cautious about today\u2019s rally: London\u2019s FTSE-100 is positively flying as the week\u2019s final session gets underway, with almost 100 points having been tacked on already. A late rally on Wall Street and a relatively measured day\u2019s trade across most of Asia \u2013 aside from Japan \u2013 is helping throw a little confidence into the mix as we run towards the weekend break. Oil is also working its way a little higher off recent lows, which will be helping sentiment for stocks - but critically the fundamentals haven\u2019t changed. As such, this still looks more like bargain hunting than the market turning its back definitively on the run lower. London\u2019s shares are surging higher, pushing the FTSE 100 up by 96 points. The other European indices are also higher, helped by those bank and mining shares. Financial shares are rallying across Europe, pushing the Stoxx 600 bank index up by 2.7%. Commerzbank can take some of the credit. Early today the German lender announced its first dividend since 2007, after posting better-than-expected fourth quarter profits. Hold onto your hats! Shares are rallying at the start of trading in London. In London the FTSE 100 has jumped by 62 points, a gain of 1.1%. Most shares are gaining ground, including mining companies and banks who have been badly hit by this week\u2019s panicky selling. Rolls-Royce is leading the rally, after sparing investors another profits warning this morning (although it did slash its dividend). Remember, the Footsie plunged by over 2% yesterday, so this is only a partial recovery after a pretty rough week. Pedestrians in Toyko stopped to stare as their stock market plunged by 5% today, in its worst weekly rout since 2008 today. VP Bank Group chief economist Thomas Gitzel says the 0.3% rise in German GDP was \u201cnot exhilarating\u201d but also not a reason to worry. He told Reuters that: \u201cSlow but steady was the retrospective motto for 2015\u201d The Financial Times points out that Germans have rarely had it so good: Back in the markets, gold is on track for its best week since October 2011 as investors scurry for safety. Gold bugs will be rubbing their hands, after seeing the spot price of bullion jump 6% since Monday. It hit a one-year high of $1,260 per ounce overnight, before dipping a little. Gold\u2019s failing as investment vehicle is that it doesn\u2019t pay a return. But when capital preservation is the name of the game, people pile in. Is Germany getting a refugee boost? ING economist Carsten Brzeski warns that 2016 could be harder for Germany than many people expect. He writes: On top of the well-known risk factor like slowing China and emerging markets or a still struggling Eurozone, low oil prices and the possible weakness of the US economy could give the German economy a hard time. In particular, any slowdown of the US economy could turn out to be a double whammy for Germany. The direct impact through weaker demand from last year\u2019s most important trading partner and the indirect impact through a stronger euro are in our view currently the biggest risks for the German economy. To some extent, there are similarities between Germany\u2019s showcase soccer team Bayern Munich and the Eurozone\u2019s showcase economy. At first glance, both performances look impressive and flawless. At second glance, however, weaknesses have emerged recently. These weaknesses have clearly increased the risk for both Bayern Munich and the German economy to surprisingly be knocked off their respective pedestals in the coming weeks and months. Here\u2019s Carsten\u2019s full take on this morning\u2019s GDP figures. Bloomberg economist Maxime Sbaihi\u2019s eagle eye has spotted something important in the German data (which is online here) Germany\u2019s trade with the rest of the world weakened in the last quarter. Destatis reports that: The development of foreign trade had a downward effect on growth because the exports of goods were down on the previous quarter. Imports decreased, too, though less strongly. Johannes Gareis, economist at French investment bank Natixis, confirms that this held back growth: The German economy achieved \u201cmoderate growth\u201d in the last quarter, says Destatis. And it appears that Germany relied on domestic demand. Destatis explains: General government final consumption expenditure was markedly up, while household final consumption expenditure rose slightly again. A positive development was also observed for capital formation. And this chart shows German growth since the debt crisis began: Here we go! The German economy grew by just 0.3% in the final three months of the year. That matches economist forecasts - and confirms that Europe\u2019s largest economy is only expanding quite modestly. It\u2019s not the robust growth that politicians would like to see - on the other hand, Germany is also avoiding being pulled into recession by the global downturn. Over in Tokyo, traders are catching their breath after riding out the worst week in over seven years. Today\u2019s 4.8% plunge means that the Nikkei has shed 11.1% this week, the biggest weekly drop since October, 2008. Recession fears stalked the markets. Tsuyoshi Shimizu, chief strategist at Mizuho Asset Management, explains: The markets are clearly starting to price in a sharp slowdown in the world economy and even a recession in the United States. \u201cI do not expect a collapse or major financial crisis like the Lehman crisis but it will take some before market sentiment will improve,\u201d he added. Here\u2019s our story on the latest Asian rout: Eurozone GDP day usually starts with French growth numbers. But not today, because INSEE actually reported two weeks ago that the eurozone\u2019s second-largest economy grew by only 0.2% in October-December, down from 0.3% in the summer. That weak performance bolstered fears that the French economy was stuttering. IG are calling the European stock markets slightly this morning: But given the volatility this week, who knows? After a wild week, economists hope that today\u2019s eurozone growth figures could provide some relief to the financial markets. Then again, it could make things worse: Good morning. We\u2019re tracking two important stories today - the ongoing turmoil in the world financial markets, and the release of eurozone growth figures for the last quarter. Last night, global markets sank into \u2018bear territory\u2019, when fresh falls on Wall Street dragged world stocks 20% below their recent high: Global stocks enter bear market after another rout - as it happened And the selling hasn\u2019t stopped. Already today, Japan\u2019s stock market has tumbled by another 4.8%, following Thursday\u2019s big selloff in Europe. The selloff appears to being driven by continued fears of a global downturn, and the health of the banking sector - as analysts warn that negative interest rates could seriously threaten their business model. And we\u2019ll get a good insight into the European economy this morning, with a flurry of new growth figures from most of the major EU countries. Here are the main events to watch out for:: Germany: 7am GMT / 8am CET Italy: 9am GMT / 10am CET Portugal: 9,30am GMT / 10.30am CET Greece: 10am GMT / 11am CET The eurozone: 10am GMT / 11am CET Economists predict that eurozone growth remained sluggish at just 0.3%. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events though the day....",

Helena Smith reports from Athens:</p> <blockquote> <p>A month into their protests over pension and tax reforms, the powerful bloc of farmers that have brought chaos to Greece intensified their action, announcing that tractor blockades would be stepped up around Thessaloniki airport this afternoon. </p> <p>More than 66 % of Greece\u2019s import and export trade is carried by road to Europe with the economy suffering huge damage as a result of the blockade. </p> <p>Indicative of a situation described as increasingly \u201cout of control,\u201d the agriculture minister attempted to place the protestors this morning announcing that the Greek prime minister would meet the farmers at noon on Monday but few believe the likelihood of a breakthrough is imminent.

That implies borrowing of \u00a37.0 billion over the next two months, compared with \u00a314.8 billion in the same period last year. Our November forecast does assume stronger growth in receipts in the remainder of the year (particularly income tax and stamp duty land tax) but local authority borrowing as measured in the statistical bulletin looks likely to exceed our November forecast. Considerable uncertainty remains over prospects for the remaining two months of the financial year, while data on local authority borrowing are often subject to substantial revisions over subsequent months.</p> <p>Public sector net debt (PSND) in January 2016 is estimated to have fallen by 0.1 per cent of GDP relative to January 2015. A major contributor to the drop over the past 12 months has been the Government\u2019s programme of financial asset sales, including multi-billion pound sales of Lloyds shares and UK Asset Resolution mortgage assets.

Previously reported figures from the British Retail Consortium were good, with footfall up, but even when taking this into account, these figures were very strong. The large rise was fairly broad based and was led by demand for clothing and computers, helped along by post-Christmas price cuts.

Indeed, as job creation remains strong, this trend looks set to continue over the coming months.</p> <p>Despite this strong data, the focus today will remain firmly on <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/feb/19/eu-summit-all-night-negotiations-deal-cameron-live\">the EU Leader\u2019s Summit in Brussels.</a></strong> If the UK is able to agree a deal, the press is reporting that David Cameron could return to London tonight and announce the referendum date, which will most likely be set to take place on June 23rd. This will essentially mark the formal start of campaigning and with the polls likely to remain tight, we could see a loss of economic momentum over the next couple of quarters as uncertainty prompts firms to temporarily hold off on hiring and investment plans.</p> <p>With headline inflation likely to remain low in the near-term, the Bank of England has room to leave rates unchanged until the Brexit uncertainty subsides. However, if the UK votes to remain in the EU, we think there is a strong chance of a November rate hike given that consumer spending remains strong (as demonstrated by this data) and a weaker sterling is likely to help push up inflation in the medium-term.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56c6e84fe4b0410d50000b41\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-19T10:07:22.236Z\">10.07am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The public finance figures will have an impact on March\u2019s Budget, says Maike Currie, investment director for Personal Investing at Fidelity International:</p> <blockquote> <p>January tends to be a good month for tax revenues as self-assessment tax returns are due this month, normally leaving the Treasury in the black in the first month of the year.

But there could be more of this to come should the referendum date be confirmed either today or early next week. The main issue is the behaviour of overseas investors in UK assets, of which there are increasing numbers given the UK\u2019s persistent current account deficit. January\u2019s price action was indicative of overseas investors both lightening up on sterling exposure and also hedging their asset positions. Such action could well accelerate into a Brexit referendum mid-year, not because investors are taking a view on the outcome, more that they are reacting to the on-going uncertainty created, given that polls are not decisive either way.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"005234d7f9a8fb17c7caee2657f4e148428ab7b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/005234d7f9a8fb17c7caee2657f4e148428ab7b7/0_0_575_340/500.jpg\" alt=\"Sterling against the dollar so far this year.\" width=\"500\" height=\"296\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sterling against the dollar so far this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-02-19T08:50:21.691Z\">at 8.50am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-56c6cbb1e4b0f276c5add2d9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-19T08:15:32.012Z\">8.15am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>An interesting chart from RBS on US oil production, showing a large fall in the number of active rigs but a lower drop in actual output:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RBS_Economics/status/700588103673614340\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Rig count down 63%, production only down 10%.

                "bodyText":"A slide in oil prices on concerns about oversupply - notwithstanding the recent proposal from producers to freeze output at January levels - continues to take the shine off this week\u2019s stock market rally. US markets have followed Europe lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 70 points or 0.4% in early trading. As well as oil, investors were unsettled by higher than expected inflation numbers, which could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise rates sooner than forecast. The S&amp;P 500 dipped 0.3% and Nasdaq is down 0.4% at the market open. In Europe the FTSE 100 is now down 38 points or 0.6% while Germany\u2019s Dax has dropped 0.99% and France\u2019s Cac is 0.85% lower. Brent crude is currently down 2.6% at $33.38 a barrel, in the wake of an increase in US inventories. But the FTSE 100 is still up nearly 4% since Monday, on course for its best weekly performance since October 2015. Meanwhile the FTSEEurofirst 350 has added 3.8% this week. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. Another point about US inflation: Over in Greece, protesting farmers have upped the ante, expanding roadblocks nationwide ahead of what some are calling make-or -break talks with prime minister Alexis Tsipras on Monday. Helena Smith reports from Athens: A month into their protests over pension and tax reforms, the powerful bloc of farmers that have brought chaos to Greece intensified their action, announcing that tractor blockades would be stepped up around Thessaloniki airport this afternoon. More than 66 % of Greece\u2019s import and export trade is carried by road to Europe with the economy suffering huge damage as a result of the blockade. Indicative of a situation described as increasingly \u201cout of control,\u201d the agriculture minister attempted to place the protestors this morning announcing that the Greek prime minister would meet the farmers at noon on Monday but few believe the likelihood of a breakthrough is imminent. Under unprecedented pressure by both the EU and IMF to complete reforms, the leftist-led government has almost no room for manouevre. Instead officials are hoping that farmers, who perforce must be back in the fields by March, will run out of steam. With tempers becoming increasingly frayed, Bulgaria, Greece\u2019s neighbor to the north, accused Athens of \u201cpurposefully tormenting Bulgarians\u201d after it emerged that it was losing up to \u20ac400,000 worth of trade every day on account of the blockade. The main Greek-Bulgarian checkpoint and customs post has been closed to traffic since Tuesday. In a tit-for-tat move Bulgarian truckers sealed off all six checkpoints along the country\u2019s land border with Greece today with diplomats saying the dispute was now in danger of electrifying the country\u2019s relations with its Balkan neighbours. Turning back to the UK public finances, the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government\u2019s independent economic analysts, said there was uncertainty over the outcome for the rest of the year: On the current data, meeting our full-year forecast for 2015-16 would require borrowing to fall by \u00a318.4 billion in the year as a whole. That implies borrowing of \u00a37.0 billion over the next two months, compared with \u00a314.8 billion in the same period last year. Our November forecast does assume stronger growth in receipts in the remainder of the year (particularly income tax and stamp duty land tax) but local authority borrowing as measured in the statistical bulletin looks likely to exceed our November forecast. Considerable uncertainty remains over prospects for the remaining two months of the financial year, while data on local authority borrowing are often subject to substantial revisions over subsequent months. Public sector net debt (PSND) in January 2016 is estimated to have fallen by 0.1 per cent of GDP relative to January 2015. A major contributor to the drop over the past 12 months has been the Government\u2019s programme of financial asset sales, including multi-billion pound sales of Lloyds shares and UK Asset Resolution mortgage assets. But the nominal GDP estimate used to calculate the debt ratio is in part still a forecast, so it remains to be seen if debt is still shown to fall on this basis in the year to January in future outturn estimates. Still, the higher than expected US inflation numbers may not prevent the Federal Reserve from sitting on its hands in terms of any imminent rate rises, says Rob Carnell of ING Bank: US CPI for January came in a little stronger than had been expected, with the headline rate unchanged on the month, and the core rate rising by 0.3% month on month. Headline inflation in January is now double that in December at 1.4% year on year, with the core rate now at 2.2% (up from 2.1%). Inflation has been one of the factors the Fed has cited for its cautious stance towards monetary policy changes. But despite these latest inflation increases, concerns over the ebbing strength of domestic activity may start to provide more of an excuse for further foot dragging, whilst external demand and financial market turbulence provides yet another excuse for the Fed to do nothing for the foreseeable future. Further, without a more noticeable pick up in energy and commodity prices, the base effects, which are an important part of the latest year on year pick up inflation, will be much less supportive in the coming months, and we expect to see headline inflation heading back below 1% year on year as we move into the second quarter of the year, giving the Fed the excuse it needs to keep doing nothing, even if growth does begin to look a little better. In the meantime, recent chatter about negative rates in the US, and the downwards impact this has had on rate expectations and yields, may begin to ease a little, at least pending the decisions of other major central banks \u2013 most notably the ECB\u2019s forthcoming March rate meeting. The US data does seem to show a trend: The US consumer price index climbed by 1.4% year on year in January, compared to expectations of a 1.3% increase. Excluding food and energy the rise was 2.2%, better than the forecast 2.1%. The news has seen the dollar climb, since the figures give more fuel to those expecting another US rate rise before too long. Is the recent rally sustainable? Perhaps not... UK retail sales soared in January as shoppers snapped up bargains in the clearance sales, while the public finances showed the biggest January surplus since 2008. After a positive weak, European stock markets are flagging as the oil price slips once more. Meanwhile Russia\u2019s deputy energy minister Alexey Texler has been speaking about the proposal agreed with Saudi Arabia to freeze oil production at January\u2019s levels. Analyst Alexandra Russell-Oliver at Caxton FX said the pound was paying more attention to the EU negotiations than the day\u2019s data: Sterling has weakened against the euro heading into today\u2019s session, as EU negotiations continue. The UK\u2019s EU Referendum continues to be a source of volatility for the pound. Brexit concerns have contributed substantially to recent sterling weakness and the referendum is set to remain a risk to sterling strength going forward. These concerns may continue to limit or off-set any gains by sterling in reaction to positive data, such as the jump in January Retail Sales out this morning. European markets are running out of steam after a positive week, as we head into the weekend. The correlation with the oil price continues, with equities slipping as crude dips again. Brent crude is down 1.6% at $33.7 a barrel on renewed concerns about oversupply despite the recent proposal from Saudia Arabia and Russia to limit production to January levels. So the FTSE 100 is down 0.5%, Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac have fallen 1.1%. More on the oil deal to freeze production at January levels, which was agreed between Saudi Arabia and Russia, and seemingly supported by Iran. Iran of course has only just returned to the export market after sanctions were lifted, and so was unlikely to want to cut production. But the producers have realised they needed to do something to tackle the supply glut which, along with falling demand, has seen crude prices tumble. Now Russia\u2019s deputy energy minister Alexey Texler has said the freeze is useful and necessary, according to Reuters. He said the oil market was oversupplied by 1.8m barrels a day and the deal could cut that in half. But he admitted questions remained over Iran\u2019s participation in the agreement, and added that any country could join the freeze but not all of them would. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, agrees there is more to be done: For the second month in a row the public finances are showing some gradual improvement, after months of disappointing performance. While it seems likely that borrowing in this financial year will be lower than in the previous one, there is still uncertainty as to whether the OBR\u2019s forecast for government borrowing made in the Autumn Statement will be met. Lower revenues from Britain\u2019s banking and oil and gas sectors have reduced the UK\u2019s ability to generate tax receipts, making the task of repairing our public finances more difficult. More must be done to strengthen and broaden our tax base by boosting business growth if are we to achieve a budget surplus by the end of this parliament. And here\u2019s the Chancellor on the public finances: Back with the retail sales, and James Smith at ING Bank says the strong data could pave the way for a rate rise later this year if the UK votes to stay in the European Union: After a disappointing Christmas run-up, retail sales surged by 2.3% month on month in January (way above expectations of 0.8%), bringing the annual comparison up to 5.2%. Previously reported figures from the British Retail Consortium were good, with footfall up, but even when taking this into account, these figures were very strong. The large rise was fairly broad based and was led by demand for clothing and computers, helped along by post-Christmas price cuts. Over the past year, rising real wages and more recently, cheaper energy costs, have helped boost consumer confidence and spending. Indeed, as job creation remains strong, this trend looks set to continue over the coming months. Despite this strong data, the focus today will remain firmly on the EU Leader\u2019s Summit in Brussels. If the UK is able to agree a deal, the press is reporting that David Cameron could return to London tonight and announce the referendum date, which will most likely be set to take place on June 23rd. This will essentially mark the formal start of campaigning and with the polls likely to remain tight, we could see a loss of economic momentum over the next couple of quarters as uncertainty prompts firms to temporarily hold off on hiring and investment plans. With headline inflation likely to remain low in the near-term, the Bank of England has room to leave rates unchanged until the Brexit uncertainty subsides. However, if the UK votes to remain in the EU, we think there is a strong chance of a November rate hike given that consumer spending remains strong (as demonstrated by this data) and a weaker sterling is likely to help push up inflation in the medium-term. The public finance figures will have an impact on March\u2019s Budget, says Maike Currie, investment director for Personal Investing at Fidelity International: January tends to be a good month for tax revenues as self-assessment tax returns are due this month, normally leaving the Treasury in the black in the first month of the year. Last year figures were boosted by record self-assessment income tax receipts of \u00a312.3 billion. This year\u2019s number was even higher, ticking up to \u00a312.4 billion. Today\u2019s numbers are likely to have a significant impact on March\u2019s Budget announcement, not least given Chancellor George Osborne\u2019s announcement in the Autumn Statement back in November that public finances over the next five years were looking \u00a327 billion stronger, thanks to a combination of better tax receipts and lower interest payments on debt. But since then the world has changed dramatically with concerns over China and global growth leading to tumbling stock markets and the governments\u2019 postponement of the sale of Lloyds Banking Group. Between the November 2015 Autumn Statement and the end of January 2016, equity prices fell by 7\u00bd%. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), if they were to remain 7\u00bd% below the OBR\u2019s latest forecast, this could reduce capital tax receipts in 2020\u201321 by around \u00a32 billion. As the IFS has pointed out*, budget surpluses are rare events. Ignoring the immediate post-war period, when large surpluses were run, since 1952 there have only been eight out of 63 years in which the UK government has spent less than it has received in revenues, and it has never done so for more than three consecutive years. The Chancellor may have painted himself into a dangerous corner with his deficit elimination promise, after all total debt matters far less than debt affordability and currently record low interest rates means that we have never seen Britain\u2019s debt as cheap. Here is a chart from the Office for National Statistics showing the increase in the UK\u2019s national debt since the end of the tax year in March last year: Here\u2019s Reuters report on the UK borrowing figures: Britain recorded the largest public finances surplus for any January since 2008, while retail sales growth surged at a much faster rate than expected, according to official figures published on Friday. The Office for National Statistics said the January surplus, excluding banks, rose to \u00a311.210bn from \u00a310.217bn a year earlier. Still, the surplus was some way short of \u00a312.65bn forecast in a Reuters poll. January is usually a surplus month due to self-assessment tax return receipts. Deficit reduction has been the key economic policy of the Conservative-led government since it came to power in 2010, but progress in cutting the budget gap has been slow through most of the current financial year. Government borrowing for the current tax year stands at \u00a366.5bn. To meet the goal of cutting the budget deficit to \u00a373.5bn - or 3.9% of gross domestic product - by the end of the tax year in March, government borrowing will need come in at \u00a37bn or less in February and March. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: After an underwhelming Christmas for British retail, economists will be encouraged to see the sector return to growth in January. British consumers are a key driver of the economy at a time when external demand has been weak, and fortunately big-ticket items such as furniture and electricals appear to have been on plenty of January shopping lists. The news will likely push the pound upwards but the recovery might be short lived. Spending looks set to lose momentum as inflation strengthens and job growth fades, which is bound to persuade more consumers to keep their wallets in their pockets. Indeed the pound hit a day\u2019s high of $1.4358 before dropping back to its opening levels. Back with the retail sales, and the year on year figure for January showed a 5.2% rise as the clearance sales brought shoppers back after a poor December. The value of online sales increased by 10.4% in January 2016 compared with January 2015 and increased by 2.7% compared with December 2015, according to the Office for National Statistics. Here is a breakdown of the sector contribution: Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight said: Amid the recent heightened concerns over the UK economy, this is a major boost to first quarter GDP growth prospects. However, it will be tempered by concern that the UK economy remains unbalanced and too dependent on consumer spending and the services sector. Meanwhile the UK public finances for January showed a smaller than expected surplus of \u00a311.2bn, the largest surplus for the first month of the year since 2008. Shoppers were out in force in January with UK retail sales up 2.3% month on month compared to expectations of a 0.8% rise. In December there was a 1.4% fall. How long will negative interest rates last? Bloomberg has polled a group of economists on the subject: The Dax is underperforming other European markets after worse than expected producer prices figures. They dropped 0.7% month on month in January compared to expectations of a 0.3% dip and a 0.5% fall in the previous month. Not good news for the European Central Bank which is attempting to deal with low inflation and is widely expected to introduce more stimulus measures at its March meeting. As the negotiations about Britain\u2019s future in the European Union grind on, the pressure on the pound could continue when the outcome is finally reached. Simon Smith, chief economist at FxPro, said: By the end of today, we should have a decent idea whether the UK is set to have a referendum on EU membership this year and also the deal on the table in terms of the UK\u2019s revised relationship with Europe. This matters for sterling, which has certainly shown strong signs of concern so far this year. In January, it was one of the weakest currencies on the majors as the uncertainty weighed. But there could be more of this to come should the referendum date be confirmed either today or early next week. The main issue is the behaviour of overseas investors in UK assets, of which there are increasing numbers given the UK\u2019s persistent current account deficit. January\u2019s price action was indicative of overseas investors both lightening up on sterling exposure and also hedging their asset positions. Such action could well accelerate into a Brexit referendum mid-year, not because investors are taking a view on the outcome, more that they are reacting to the on-going uncertainty created, given that polls are not decisive either way. An interesting chart from RBS on US oil production, showing a large fall in the number of active rigs but a lower drop in actual output: As expected, the dip in the oil price has taken the shine of what has been a good week for stock markets. The FTSE 100 has dipped 10 points or 0.16%, Germany\u2019s Dax has dropped 0.4% and France\u2019s Cac is o.07% lower. The FTSEEurofirst is off 0.23% . But with hopes of moves from oil producers to stem the supply glut, along with the promise of more central bank stimulus, markets are on track for a positive week overall. The FTSE 100 has gained more than 4% while the FTSEEurofirst 300 is up nearly 5% since Monday. And the crude price, although down 0.6% to $34.06 a barrel on the day, is up around 2% on the week. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. A positive week on the markets is ending on a more downbeat note, with Asian markets slipping back and Europe expected to open fairly mixed. The Nikkei 225 is down 1.4%, the Hang Seng has dipped 0.5% but China is virtually unchanged, with the CSI300 down just 0.04%. Here are the European opening calls: Even so the FTSE 100 is on course for a more than 4% rise on the week, which would mark its best performance since October. As usual in recent times, the oil price is dominating investor sentiment. Brent crude is currently down 0.8% at $34 a barrel as another rise in US inventories reinforced fears of a supply glut, notwithstanding this week\u2019s agreement by Saudi Arabia and Russia to freeze production at January levels, with even Iran praising the idea. On the economic front, we have UK retail sales and public finances, and later, US inflation. Retail sales are expected to rise by around 0.8% in January, boosted by clearance sales, after a 1% fall in the previous month. Public finance figures are expected to show a surplus excluding banks of some \u00a313.9bn. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The slowdown in the UK economy has pulled the rug out of Chancellor George Osborne\u2019s relatively generous Autumn statement which saw him scrap plans to cut tax credits. The risk is that Mr Osborne is forced to raise taxes and/or raid pensions in the next budget after having relied too heavily on economic growth for his spending plans, which will act to further curtail future growth. While positive surprises in economic data are naturally positive for sterling, it has been PM David Cameron\u2019s Brexit talks that have dictated the state of play. A weak or no deal with Europe would add to uncertainty over the referendum result and could see cable get another jolt lower to fresh six-year lows beneath 1.41. As for US inflation, it is expected to climb 1.3% year on year with core prices rising by 2.1%. They will be watched for the implications for US interest rates, after the Federal Reserve increased borrowing costs in December, before the recent market turmoil.",

                "bodyText":"A slide in the oil price as Saudi Arabia seemed to rule out hopes of production cuts sent stock markets sharply lower again after Monday\u2019s rally. Brent crude is currently nearly 4% lower at $33.32, while West Texas Intermediate is down almost 5%. Meanwhile the pound continued to come under pressure on Brexit fears, falling to $1.4022. Commodity companies were among the day\u2019s big fallers, on renewed concerns about a slowdown in China and news that BHP Billiton was slashing its dividend. Standard Chartered was also a big faller, down nearly 7% after reporting its first loss in 26 years amid worries about its exposure to emerging markets. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 75.42 points or 1.25% lower at 5962.31, despite a near 14% rise in London Stock Exchange shares on news of a proposed merger with Deutsche B\u00f6rse Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.64% to 9416.77 France\u2019s Cac closed down 1.4% at 4238.42 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.95% to 17,163.46 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.42% lower at 8267.6 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.2% to 493.97 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 178 points or just over 1%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Sterling has hit a new seven year low against the dollar of $1.4044, following Bank of England governor Mark Carney\u2019s comments suggesting UK interest rates could be cut. The UK currency has also come under renewed pressure on the uncertainty over the forthcoming referendum on whether Britain should leave the European Union, which Carney also referred to. Crude continues to weaken as Saudi oil minister Ali Al-Naimi suggested production cuts were not on the cards. He told a conference in Houston that cutting production would not happen, but major producers would freeze output to help the market rebalance. Saudi Arabia and Russia recently agreed to freeze output at January levels in an effort to deal with the supply glut which has sent crude prices tumbling. He said in Houston that he hoped there would be more agreements on freezing in March, when more meetings will be held. He said \u201cmost of the countries that count\u201d would freeze, according to Reuters. Earlier Iran had apparently dismissed the proposal as ridiculous, despite the country seeming to support it last week. Al-Naimi said the price rout would ease although he did not know when. And he added that he was not banking on cuts \u201cbecause there is less trust than usual\u201d, said Reuters. Brent is currently down 3% at $33.62 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is 4% lower at $32.03. Jasper Lawler at CMC Markets said: Oil prices turned lower after the Iranian oil minister\u2019s colourful description of the output freeze between Russia and Saudi Arabia as \u201cridiculous.\u201d Iran and its plans to ramp up output after the lifting of sanctions is proving a thorn in the side of other producing counties which appear to be reaching consensus that production should stay at current levels. Tensions are clearly rising in the cartel as the Saudi oil minister reposted that \u201cnot all the countries will freeze. The ones that count will.\u201d The day\u2019s confidence figures show how fragile sentiment is at the moment, says analyst Connor Campbell at Spreadex: Whilst the [US] existing home sales figure actually saw a mild increase month-on-month, from 5.45 million to 5.47 million, more notable was the sharp decline in the CB consumer confidence number. Coming in at 92.2 against the 97.4 last month the figure, like this morning\u2019s year-low German Ifo business climate data, highlights just how entrenched the market\u2019s current fears are, despite the sporadic surges that have taken the global indices to a variety of recent highs. There was to be no such surge this afternoon, however, the Dow Jones dropping over 100 in light of that literal knock to the index\u2019s confidence. Over in the UK the FTSE fell past its earlier lows as the afternoon progressed, declining around 50 points to trickle underneath the 6000 mark following the weak US open, a drop exacerbated by Brent Crude slipping under $34 per barrel once again. Back with the London Stock Exchange, and analysts at Numis point to a number of problems facing its proposed merger with Deutsche B\u00f6rse: This represents the third time the LSE and DB have attempted to merge, first in 2000 then in 2004. Although no details were given, a merger is expected to provide enhanced growth, significant customer benefits as well as substantial revenue and cost synergies. However, we see a number of challenges in completing this deal, namely: (1) the competition authority is likely to ask a number of questions as it would create a dominant player in exchanges and clearing in Europe \u2013 the EC blocked a similar deal between Deutsche B\u00f6rse and NYSE Euronext in 2012 citing competition concerns; (2) both have differing views on how to structure their respective clearing businesses \u2013 LSE backs open access (i.e. trading and clearing can occur on different platforms) whereas DB does not; (3) national pride \u2013 would UK politicians be happy with the main UK exchange being owned by a foreign entity. So whilst we see the obvious benefits from such a deal (namely cost and revenue synergies), we remain mindful of the challenges that would need to be overcome for it to complete. The Richmond manufacturing index has also disappointed, coming in at -4 compared to the 2 which analysts had been looking for. However US existing home sales have beaten expectations, up 0.4% in January compared to a forecast fall of 2.5%. US consumer confidence figures for February have come in much lower than expected, as the recent market volatility outweighs the benefits of cheaper oil. The index fell from 97.8 in January - itself revised down from 98.1 - to 92.2. Analysts had been expecting a figure of 97. This is the lowest level since July. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said Despite relatively healthy numbers over recent months, onlookers will be concerned with the worrying dip in this month\u2019s consumer confidence data. It\u2019s surprising that US shoppers have kept their wallets in their pockets for another month, especially considering that low gas prices continue to help them save. While the slip may have a short-term negative affect on the US Dollar, if gas continues to stay low, it\u2019s only a matter of time before US consumers get the spending bug again. Meanwhile US stock markets have opened lower, in line with the dips on European exchanges. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 40 points or 0.2% after another fall in oil prices - West Texas Intermediate is around 2% lower after a report Iran\u2019s oil minister called the proposed output freeze ridiculous. At the open the S&amp;P 500 is 0.3% lower and Nasdaq down 0.4%, ahead of the latest US consumer confidence figures. Back in Europe the FTSE 100 is currently down 22 points or 0.3%, but would be another 4 points or so lower if not for the 16% jump in the shares of the London Stock Exchange. It was not always so friendly between the LSE and Deutsche B\u00f6rse: And here\u2019s the BBC\u2019s story from the time. Here\u2019s our first take on the LSE-Deutsche B\u00f6rse merger plan: The London Stock Exchange is in talks to merge with Germany\u2019s Deutsche B\u00f6rse in a deal that would seal an alliance first discussed at the turn of the millennium. The LSE confirmed on Tuesday it was in detailed discussions with its German rival about an all-share merger. Under the proposed structure, Deutsche B\u00f6rse shareholders would own 54.4% of the combined company and LSE shareholders would hold 45.6%. The UK exchange said: \u201cThe boards believe that the potential merger would represent a compelling opportunity for both companies to strengthen each other in an industry-defining combination, creating a leading European-based global markets infrastructure group.\u201d The exchanges have considered combining forces before. They agreed to merge in 2000 before a rival bid for the LSE from Sweden\u2019s OM Gruppen scuppered the deal, but was then rejected. The LSE then rejected a formal \u00a31.3bn offer from Deutsche B\u00f6rse in January 2005. The full story is here: David Cheetham of City trading firm XTB.com says a merger between the LSE and Deutsche Borse would create one of the world\u2019s biggest financial trading platforms. \u201cShares in London Stock Exchange Group have soared by over 17% in the past hour as news that they\u2019re in talks with Deutsche Boerse have been confirmed. If the deal were to go ahead it would create a clear market leader for European and one of the largest exchanges in the world for trading and risk managing derivatives. The timing of this development appears coincidental as the possibility of a Brexit has become increased in recent days now that a referendum date has been set and Boris has joined the Out campaign.\u201d The news that Britain\u2019s stock exchange could soon merge with its German rival has startled the City, especially given the upcoming EU vote. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, tweets: It\u2019s official! The London Stock Exchange has just confirmed that it is talking to Deutsche B\u00f6rse about a merger deal. It says: Further to the recent movement in LSE\u2019s share price, the Board of LSE and the Management Board of Deutsche B\u00f6rse confirm that they are in detailed discussions about a potential merger of equals of the two businesses. This would create \u201ca leading European-based global markets infrastructure group\u201d, it claims, adding: The combination of LSE and Deutsche Boerse\u2019s complementary growth strategies, products, services and geographic footprint would be expected to deliver an enhanced ability to provide a full service offering to customers on a global basis. Under the plan, Deutsche B\u00f6rse shareholders would hold 54.4% of the new company, while LSE shareholders would hold 45.6%. The LSE\u2019s shares are now up 17%, valuing the group at almost \u00a39.5bn. Deutsche B\u00f6rse shares have also jumped, by around 3%, following the reports of merger talks with Britain\u2019s LSE. And Euronext, another stock market operator, has seen its shares rally by 4%. Investors may be anticipating a bidding war. Here\u2019s the Reuters story that sparked the move: BREAKING: Takeover speculation has just driven shares in the London Stock Exchange up by 9%, to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard. It has been trigger by a Reuters report, that the LSE is in talks over a possible merger with German rival Deutsche B\u00f6rse. Nothing official yet, though. More than a decade ago, the LSE rejected Deutsche B\u00f6rse\u2019s advances.... The timing of these talks is quite intriguing, given the uncertainty which the EU referendum is casting over the City.... Analysts at Scotia Bank have predicted that the UK pound could slump to just $1.30 if the Out campaign win June\u2019s vote. That would be its lowest level in around 30 years, worse than the selloff after the 2008 financial crisis. They have also suggested that consumer confidence would be badly hit, as economic growth slowed sharply.. Sterling is dropping back towards the seven year low it struck on Monday. The pound has lost half a cent against the US dollar, dipping below the $1.41 mark. Yesterday, it weakened to $1.4057, before a late revival. Mark Carney\u2019s warning that investors are protecting themselves against future sterling weakness (details here) may have reminded traders that we face months of uncertainty. Dominic Stewart, sales trader at ETX Capital, says: Sterling has remained vulnerable after falling nearly 2% yesterday - its biggest one day drop in almost six years - amidst fears that Britain may leave the European Union. The Treasury Committee session is now over, and Mark Carney and colleagues have been released back into the wild. But if you want more EU referendum action, check out our Politics Live blog. Andy Sparrow is on deck, covering a speech from David Cameron right now: Cameron: EU referendum is a \u2018once in a generation\u2019 decision - Politics live Guardian readers have known for a while that the Bank of England was working on contingency plans for the EU referendum. Back in May 2015, the Bank of England accidentally emailed us the details of Project Bookend, including how to deny it existed. #oops We wrote at the time that: The email indicates that a small group of senior staff are to examine the effect of a Brexit under the authority of Sir Jon Cunliffe, who as deputy director for financial stability has responsibility for monitoring the risk of another market crash. Cunliffe also sits on the board of the City regulator, the Prudential Regulatory Authority. James Talbot, the head of the monetary assessment and strategy division, is involved in Project Bookend, drawing on his past work as an adviser on European economic policy. The Bank of England is engaged in contingency planning for the EU referendum, Mark Carney tells the Treasury committee. He also reveals that the Prudential Regulation Authority is keeping abreast of the contingency plans that UK banks are making ahead of the June 23 vote. Further details will discussed on March 8, when the governor testifies to the committee specifically about the referendum. [The PRA supervises Britain\u2019s financial sector, to ensure they are \u201csafe and sound\u201d, so they will be keen to avoid any firms being caught out by the referendum]. Rachel Reeves MP asks Mark Carney whether he expects the recent falls in sterling to continue. The governor reiterates that investors have been buying downside protection to protect themselves against falls against the pound, especially against the US dollar [rather than the euro, because it could also suffer if Britain leaves the EU]. Governor Carney concludes: It is safe to say that an element of referendum premium has come into sterling. Rachel Reeves MP reminds Carney that the latest Inflation Report states that interest rates are likely to rise, not fall. How can he can so confident? Mark Carney gives a rather dovish answer, says the Bank expects interest rates to rise, gradually, over the forecast horizon. But of course, if risks increased and the global economy deteriorated, that would have implications. So do you expect the next move to be up, not down? Carney replies that the UK domestic economy is positive, but that must be balanced with disappointing signs from abroad. We must weigh the two up, and we\u2019re not taking a policy decision today. Mark Carney moves swiftly to crush speculation that the Bank of England could hit UK banks with negative interest rates. We have absolutely no intention, no interest, in doing that [imposing negative rates]. He adds that mortgage rates in Switzerland have actually gone up, even though the Swiss central bank have imposed negative borrowing costs. Can you explain the impact of negative interest rates on banks in simple terms, Steve Baker asks? MPC member Gertjan Vlieghe outlines how banks have assets, which are loans, and liabilities, which are deposits. They make a profit by charging borrowers more than they pay to savers. So far, no commercial bank has passed on negative interest rates to its depositors. So...as you lower interest rates more and more, the return on the assets goes down and down but there is no way to balance that with lower returns to savers. In conclusion: The lower interest rates go, the harder it is for banks to make a profit. Q: And do you need to abolish cash to allow negative interest rates to be imposed? Deciding whether people are allowed to hold cash is not one of our tools, Vlieghe replies. Steve Baker MP asks what the distributional impact of negative interest rates would be. It\u2019s too early to say, replies deputy governor Minouche Shafik. Central banks in several areas, including Switzerland, Denmark, Japan and the eurozone, now charge banks to leave money with them. However, this has not generally fed through to consumers - so we don\u2019t have the data to show the impact on the public. Gertjan Vlieghe adds that it\u2019s very hard to say how banks will react to negative interest rates - it depends on each institution. Mark Carney also insists that the Bank could launch fresh stimulus measures. It could cut interest rates closer to zero, from 0.5% today, or buy more assets though QE. Martin Weale says the Bank of England has more tools in the toolbox to stimulate the UK economy if needed. That could include fresh asset purchases though its QE programme [which the Bank has used to buy \u00a3375bn of UK government debt]. Jacob Rees-Mogg MP asks whether the recent fall in bank share prices reflects the macro-economic environment. Or something else? Mark Carney says it is primarily due to the macro picture. He cites \u2018mildly disappointing\u2019 data and uncertainty about the policy stance in emerging and advanced economies. That caused a \u201crenewed appreciation\u201d that we are in an environment of low nominal growth -- a difficult environment for banks. On top of that, Carney adds, there are some concerns in investing circles about the impact of negative interest rates on bank profitability. Dr Gertjan Vlieghe, a member of the Monetary Policy Committee, now warns MPs that the uncertainty over the In-Out EU referendum could hurt the UK economy. Asked about the impact of the weaker pound, he says that on its own, a weaker currency should boost inflation and growth. But the current situation is more complex, given the possibility of Brexit . Vlieghe tells the Treasury Committee that: We think the exchange rate is falling because of increased uncertainty about what\u2019s going to happen in the period leading up to, or the period following, the referendum. It is possible at some point that increased uncertainty from foreign exchange investors also ends up manifesting itself in increased uncertainty by households and businesses which may, or may not, delay or reduce their spending. So far we haven\u2019t seen very clear evidence of that, but we are watching very carefully. So it\u2019s not at all obvious that a weaker pound is a net boost to the economy, concludes Vlieghe, who worked for a hedge fund before being appointed to the MPC last summer. Back to the pound.... and Martin Weale says the recent fall in sterling should push inflation up (as it makes imports more expensive) Mark Carney says he agrees, adding that the recent fall in the pound is partly due to the EU referendum [reminder, it hit a seven year low on Monday]. Carney addes that the Bank \u201cwill take the exchange rate as given\u201d --[ie, it will not make predictions about the referendum result, and its impact on sterling]. And the Bank\u2019s agents across the UK will be watching for signs that business confidence has been hit by exchange rate moves. The committee is keen to find out whether the Bank of England will make a profit or a loss on its bond-buying quantitative easing programme. After all, the richest households have certainly benefitted, because QE drives up asset prices. And we know who holds them..... Tyrie then turns to Britain\u2019s banks - is Carney confident that they are robust enough to rise out another crisis? He points out that Sir John Vickers, who conducted a major inquiry into the UK financial sector after the 2008 crisis, has warned that the banks haven\u2019t gone far enough. What\u2019s your view, governor? Carney insists that the UK banks have met the new capital requirements. So why have bank shares fallen so sharply? Carney blames worries about profitability, not solvency: Since the start of the year bank stocks have been under pressure. There are a variety of causes of that but what is not a cause, what it does not indicate in my view is concerns about the resilience of the institutions. \u201cThe fundamental concerns are about the returns of the institutions.\u201d Andrew Tyrie does have one question on the EU referendum: Q: Has the Bank modelled the impact on sterling if the Out campaign win, given what\u2019s been going on in the markets in recent days? Mark Carney says the bank will treat the June 23rd referendum \u201cexactly like we treat any other political event\u201d. That means the Bank will monitor developments in markets and confidence, and feed those changes into its models. The Bank won\u2019t take any judgements about who will win, or assess the consequences of a leave vote. Q: So what would I see if I looked at your models? We don\u2019t make forecasts about the future value of the pound as part of the model, Carney says. But he then points to the recent volatility in the foreign exchange and options markets, as investors brace for the In-Out referendum in four month\u2019s time. There have been movements, obviously, in sterling, since the timing of the referendum became clear, says governor Carney, adding: Particularly, there has been a sharp increase in risk reversals - buying more downside protection against future falls in sterling around the referendum date as opposed to upside protection. They have spiked to levels consistent with around the height of the Scottish referendum. And they\u2019ve been particularly concentrated against cable...the sterling/dollar options market. That\u2019s as far as Carney will go today - we may need to wait until next month\u2019s hearing for more.... Andrew Tyrie, committee chairman, says he doesn\u2019t want to linger on the Brexit issue for long - as Carney is going to testify about it on 8 March. Panic averted - the session is starting now... The FT\u2019s Emily Cadman reports that Mark Carney is behind schedule.... Looks like there\u2019s a small delay with the web feed of Mark Carney\u2019s session at parliament (hurry up chaps!). Helpfully, Reuters are on the case -- with some comments from deputy governor Minouche Shafik: She\u2019s predicted that UK interest rates will rise, in due course, rather than being cut to fresh record lows. BANK OF ENGLAND DEPUTY GOVERNOR SHAFIK SAYS IF LABOUR MARKET CONTINUES TO TIGHTEN, EXPECT WAGE GROWTH WILL PICK UP BANK OF ENGLAND\u2019S SHAFIK SAYS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT TIMING OF WAGE PICK-UP BANK OF ENGLAND\u2019S SHAFIK SAYS BELIEVES NEXT INTEREST RATE MOVE WILL BE UP The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, is about to take his seat in the Thatcher Room at the Houses of Parliament. He\u2019ll be quizzed by the Treasury committee about the Bank\u2019s latest inflation report, in which it slashed its UK growth forecasts and suggested interest rates may not rise this year. But we\u2019re also hoping to hear Carney\u2019s views on the UK\u2019s EU referendum. You can watch the hearing live, here (right-click to open in a new tab). Carney is accompanied by: Dr Minouche Shafik, Deputy Governor, Markets and Banking, Dr Gertjan Vlieghe, External Member of the Monetary Policy Committee Martin Weale, External Member of the Monetary Policy Committee Bloomberg economist Maxime Sbaihi is alarmed by the fall in German business confidence this month: The euro just hit a three-week low, losing 0.3% to $1.0993 against the US dollar. The single currency is being dragged down by this morning\u2019s weak German business confidence report and the knock-on effect of Britain\u2019s EU referendum (as discussed earlier) Morale among Germany\u2019s business leaders has hit a one-year low, after falling at its fastest rate in over four years this month. IFO, the Munich-based think tank, has reported that German corporate chiefs are much gloomier about future prospects, due to the slowdown in China and recent stock market volatility. IFO\u2019s business sentiment index has fallen for the third month running, to 105.7 from 107.3 in January. That\u2019s the lowest since December 2014. It was driven by a slump in business expectations, suggesting firms are worried about prospects this year. Carsten Brzeski of ING is calling it a \u201cwake-up call\u201d, adding: Global events have finally reached German companies\u2019 boardrooms..... Expectations have taken another sharp hit from recent market turmoil, the adverse impact of low oil prices and renewed concerns about a slowing of the Chinese economy, dropping to 98.8 in February, from 102.3 in January. There\u2019s a lot of chatter that the Britain\u2019s EU referendum could spark a sterling crisis. And that\u2019s because the pound (like the English cricket team) has a worrying history of occasionally collapsing under pressure. Hat-tip to Bank of New York Mellon, and Bloomberg, for this chart: The pound is hovering around $1.413 this morning, having hit a seven-year low of $1.4057 yesterday. FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga believes the pound could fall further in the run-up to June\u2019s vote, and take the euro with it. The growing speculation that a Brexit may spillover to the Eurozone and threaten the future of the European Union has already encouraged bearish investors to attack the Euro across the global currency markets. Shares in Standard Chartered are sliding sharply after it posted its first annual loss since 1989. The bank has lost $1.5bn, and warned that it faces a \u201cbroad range of challenges and uncertainties....notably China and commodities\u201d. The loss is partly due to a $1.8bn restructuring charge as Standard Chartered tries to address the slowdown in emerging markets (the bank is a big player in Asia). The City aren\u2019t impressed -- shares slumped by 11% as investors digested the details. They\u2019re currently down 6%. More to follow later... Over in Frankfurt, the German DAX has slid by 103 points, or over 1%. Investors aren\u2019t impressed by the first fall in German exports since 2012. Each of the 30 companies on the DAX is down, led by energy and utility firm RWE (-2%). Deutsche Bank has shed 1.5%. European stock markets are sliding in early trading. In London, the FTSE 100 has shed 48 points, or 0.8%. The blue-chip index is being dragged down by mining shares, after BHP Billiton reported that \u00a34bn loss and warned that commodity prices will remain weak. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx says BHP\u2019s decision to slash its shareholder payout has shocked investors: It doesn\u2019t help that the mining sector got its own unwelcome surprise; whilst it was expected that BHP Billiton would post its first half year loss in 16 years (coming in \u00a34 billion in the red) analysts were still looking for a 31p dividend. Instead BHP slashed its interim payout by 75% to 16p, whilst also sacrificing its progressive dividend policy in order to protect its credit rating. The company\u2019s subsequent 3.5% slide helped ensure its mining peers started the day at a loss, dragging the FTSE down by nearly 50 points after the bell. Ralph Solveen, an economist at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt, is concerned that German exports fell by 0.6% in the last quarter of 2015. He told Bloomberg that: \u201cInvestment was rather solid. On the other hand, given the rather weak development of exports, you can see that there\u2019s a problem for the German economy.\u201d Germany has suffered a fall in exports as the powerhouse European economy is hit by the global downturn. The Federal Statistical Office has revealed that exports shrank by 0.6% in the final three months of 2015. Economists had expected a dip of 0.3%. That, according to the Financial Times, is the first decline in three years. Imports rose by 0.5% during the quarter, suggesting that Germany was propped up by its domestic economy. ING\u2019s Carsten Brzeski fears that German consumers might struggle to sustain this performance in 2016: Today\u2019s figures also confirmed that Germany grew by an unspectacular 0.3% in the final three months of 2015, with growth dragged back by its negative trade performance. Government spending grew by 1% during the quarter - perhaps partly due to the cost of helping the refugees who arrived in Germany last year. Asian stock markets have fallen today, as the recent rally in shares subsided. And it could be a downbeat day in Europe too, with the main indices expected to fall. Shares are being pulled down by the oil price, which has dipped by almost 2% this morning - erasing its own recent gains. And mining giant BGP Billiton has added to the pessimism, by reporting a stonking loss of \u00a34bn for the last six months - and slashing its dividend by three-quarters. Reuters has the details from Asia: MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.2%, after earlier rising 0.4% to its highest level since January 8. Japan\u2019s Nikkei erased morning gains to close down 0.4%. Korea\u2019s Kospi, which started the day higher, and Australia\u2019s ASX 200, which opened little changed from Monday\u2019s three-week high close, both ended the day with losses. Chinese stocks , which opened little changed, were last trading down almost 1%. Oil markets jumped as much as 7% on Monday as speculation about falling U.S. shale output fed the notion that crude prices may be bottoming after their 20-month collapse. But they retreated on Tuesday on concern that any cuts to U.S. production may be countered by rising output from Iran. U.S. crude futures fell 1.9%, and the international benchmark Brent slid 1.6% on Tuesday. City firm IG reckons European markets will fall at the open. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Coming up today..... Britain\u2019s In-Out EU referendum continues to cast a shadow over the markets, after Brexit fears sent the pound sliding to a seven year low yesterday. The prospect of months of heated debate and uncertainty over the UK\u2019s future is already weighing on the pound in early trading, as some investors continue to sell sterling. Overnight, a group of UK business chiefs have signed a letter backing the In campaign. But crucially, others have declined to get involved. The bosses of Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrison all remain firmly on the fence.... Bank of England governor Mark Carney should be quizzed about the European vote, when he testifies to MPs at 10am GMT on the Bank\u2019s latest inflation report. Deputy governor Minouche Shafik, and fellow interest rate-setters Martin Weale and Gertjan Vlieghe should be providing support. On the economics front, new German trade data is being released this morning. We also get the latest IFO measure of business confidence in the eurozone\u2019s largest economy, at 9am GMT. Standard Chartered, the bank with a big exposure to emerging markets, is reporting results at 8.15am. And in the afternoon, the latest US consumer confidence figure are released. They\u2019ll show how much damage has been caused by the stock market turmoil earlier this year. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

                "bodyText":"The Chinese leadership has tried to reassure other governments and the financial markets that they support more transparent decision-making and understand the impact Beijing\u2019s policies can have on the fragile global economy. Shares in China plunged on Thursday afternoon as investors waited nervously on the eve of a two-day summit in Shanghai of G20 finance ministers and central bankers expected to discuss the recent market turmoil and global economic slowdown. Amid continued speculation that China could be forced to devalue the yuan this year, Zhu Guangyao, China\u2019s vice finance minister, said Beijing would seek to keep the exchange rate stable while maintaining its current \u201cmanaged float\u201d regime. \u201cWe do recognise the risk the global economy faces,\u201d he said at a conference on Thursday held by the Institute of International Finance linked to the G20 summit. \u201cWe also understand how important it is to correctly communicate with the market,\u201d he added. The Shanghai meeting is already being compared with the G20 meeting in April 2009 when officials agreed on coordinated stimulus to prevent a worldwide depression during the global financial crisis. However, few expect this year\u2019s conference to produce similar results. \u201cCalls for co-ordinated policy easing ahead of this weekend\u2019s G20 meeting will almost certainly come to nothing,\u201d wrote Andrew Kenningham, senior global economist at Capital Economics in London. China, however, appears to be positioning itself for aggressive fiscal stimulus, hoping it can migrate its economy away from overdependence on low-end export manufacturing to something more sophisticated without setting off a wave of layoffs. Zhu also said that China had room to increase its fiscal deficit this year and would take necessary measures to deal with systemic risks while communicating with the market. According to Bloomberg, he also said that the more fiscal stimulus was needed to kickstart flagging growth in the world economy. \u201cCountries with room to make fiscal expansion should take action,\u201d Zhu said. \u201cWe cannot just rely on monetary policy. Fiscal policy must play a role.\u201d Such increases would have to be approved by Premier Li Keqiang at the annual meeting of parliament which begins March 5, he said. Zhu\u2019s comments followed similar remarks earlier in the day at the same conference by the head of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) Jiang Jianqing, who said there was no market basis for further yuan weakness. However, similar calls in the past have had little impact in fending off bearish pressure against the currency, with international investors such as George Soros publicly arguing that the currency is set to decline further. US treasury secretary Jack Lew, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, said China had to make it clear that there was no \u201cmajor devaluation\u201d in the pipeline. The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) conducted a surprise one-off devaluation of the official guidance rate in August, which it argued would allow the market to reset at its natural level, but investors have continued to move out of the currency since and the exchange rate has slid further. In a speech at the Shanghai conference, central bank vice governor Yi Gang said that investors could expect more fluctuations by the yuan against the dollar as the PBOC tried to put more emphasis on measuring the yuan\u2019s value against a basket of currencies. The equity markets remained under pressure on Thursday with a fall in the oil price refocusing attention on the weakness of the global economy. The Shanghai Composite index closed down 6.41% while the CSI300 index of leading Shanghai and Shenzhen shares was down 6.14%. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong finished down 1.65%. Bourses elsewhere fared better with the Nikkei in Japan up 1.41% and the Kospi in South Korea 0.32% to the good. Brent crude for April delivery skidded 1.1% to $34.04 a barrel and US crude fell 0.9% to $31.86 a barrel after Saudi Arabia dampened expectations of a coordinated production cut to shore up prices. China\u2019s industry ministry said during a separate press conference in Beijing on Thursday that China\u2019s exports and currency remain under pressure, adding the ministry would invest 100 billion yuan ($15 billion) over two years to relocate workers during China\u2019s industrial restructuring. The onshore currency market remained relatively flat in morning trade after the comments, changing hands at around 6.53 per dollar, having softened around 0.6 percent since markets reopened after a week-long holiday earlier in the month. The offshore yuan firmed slightly in morning trade but remained weaker than the onshore rate.",

For a start, policymakers still have room to cut deposit rates further and expand their QE programmes, which should help to support activity and lift inflation. And if growth and inflation fall further, we suspect that governments and central banks would, eventually, adopt more radical policies to revive their economies.</p> </blockquote> <p>What could these more radical policies be: <br></p> <blockquote> <p>Perhaps the most straightforward option would be to raise the inflation target, which would in theory cause real interest rates to fall. As Japan\u2019s experience shows, though, it can be very difficult to raise price pressures when low inflation expectations are engrained. </p> <p>A much more radical and powerful policy would be for the central bank to directly finance government spending, often referred to as a helicopter drop. Unlike QE, this would be very effective in pushing money into the economy and could be quickly stopped if inflation rises too far. </p> <p>There is little appetite for more radical policies at the moment, not least because the world is not currently in a crisis situation. But policymakers have proven that they are willing to change course if they are consistently missing their mandates. And if economic conditions were to deteriorate significantly, political opposition to such policies would surely soften. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56cf268be4b03897ffe23b48\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-25T16:10:42.897Z\">4.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The price of crude continues to slide</strong>.

And this data will buoy hopes that the slowdown in US GDP growth that culminated in a rate of only 0.7% (annualised) in the fourth quarer of 2015 (and will likely be revised lower on Friday), may be turning the corner. </p> <p>This is choppy data at the best of times, so one month\u2019s data has to be taken with a pinch of salt. But these figures, which provide one of the best insights into the business investment environment, are especially important right now. This is because if the US is heading into recession, as some commentators maintain, then we suspect that this decline will be led by investment, with the labour market and consumer spending following in its wake with some lag.</p> <p>However, despite a decent headline figure, and bounces in some of the core indicators (we tend to focus on these core measures to shed some of the volatility of this data), the trend in orders and shipments is not giving a particularly clear message, and we will have to see more data before we can reach any firm conclusions. For example, the three month moving average for core capital goods orders fell further to -6.2%, and core capital goods shipments improved, but from -4.7% to only -4.2%, so still remain deeply depressed.</p> <p>With yet another inconclusive set of data, markets will make of this whatever they want. But the fact remains, the direction of the US economy at this juncture remains far from clear. And in consequence, the Fed\u2019s response remains in the balance, though we feel the hurdles for further tightening are high, so at the very least, this data provides no excuse for a near term tightening. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56cf0777e4b03786d8023071\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-25T13:55:09.818Z\">1.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The good US data of course could also prompt renewed talk of a Federal Reserve rate rise. David Morrison at Spread Co said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The US dollar rose a touch as did equities after durable goods (both including and excluding transportation items) blasted above market expectations. Weekly jobless claims were in line with expectations.</p> <p>It was a knee-jerk reaction which appeared to be algo-driven and it doesn\u2019t feel as if there\u2019s much follow-through to the initial move.</p> <p>Strong data may point to some robustness in the US economy but of course that\u2019s a double-edged sword. After all, it also raises the possibility of further rate increases from the Federal Reserve.

                "bodyText":"Despite continuing falls in oil prices, the rally in European markets stayed the course. Putting aside worries about China, faltering global growth and volatile commodity prices, investors took heart from a series of positive company updates, not least Lloyds Banking Group, RSA Insurance, Axa and Deutsche Telekom. Wall Street managed to shake off some early uncertainty by the time Europe closed, but there is likely to be further nervousness around the G20 finance ministers meeting in Shanghai which starts later. For the moment, the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 145.63 points or 2.48% higher at 6012.81 Germany\u2019s Dax added 1.79% to 9331.48 France\u2019s Cac closed 2.24% higher at 4248.45 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 2.3% at 17,104.54 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 2.52% higher at 8215.6 In Greece, the Athens market added 2.05% to 483.98 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 49 points or 0.3%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. It has been suggested that with QE and low (and in some cases negative) interest rates, central banks risk running out of ammunition to boost the global economy. But Capital Economics disagrees. The research company\u2019s Nikita Shah said: There is undoubtedly less scope for policy easing than there was a few years ago, but the charge that central banks are now powerless is, in our view, exaggerated. For a start, policymakers still have room to cut deposit rates further and expand their QE programmes, which should help to support activity and lift inflation. And if growth and inflation fall further, we suspect that governments and central banks would, eventually, adopt more radical policies to revive their economies. What could these more radical policies be: Perhaps the most straightforward option would be to raise the inflation target, which would in theory cause real interest rates to fall. As Japan\u2019s experience shows, though, it can be very difficult to raise price pressures when low inflation expectations are engrained. A much more radical and powerful policy would be for the central bank to directly finance government spending, often referred to as a helicopter drop. Unlike QE, this would be very effective in pushing money into the economy and could be quickly stopped if inflation rises too far. There is little appetite for more radical policies at the moment, not least because the world is not currently in a crisis situation. But policymakers have proven that they are willing to change course if they are consistently missing their mandates. And if economic conditions were to deteriorate significantly, political opposition to such policies would surely soften. The price of crude continues to slide. Earlier, data from the US showed stockpiles at the Cushing hub in Oklahoma for oil deliveries has reached new highs. Inventories rose by 503,000 barrels to more than 67.5m barrels between 19 and 24 February, according to Reuters. Brent crude is now down 2.3% at $33.59 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - has dropped 3%. The UK Treasury is not drawing up plans to deal with the fallout if Britain leaves the EU after the forthcoming referendum. Attending a conference on market liquidity, Charles Roxburgh, director general for financial services at the Treasury, said: It\u2019s the government\u2019s policy not to do contingency planning. So we will not be doing contingency planning \u2014 that\u2019s consistent with the position we had on Scotland. The contingency planning is instead being done by the Bank of England. After a bright start, US markets have slipped back after another drop in the oil price, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now up just 12 points. But European markets have held on to much of their gains and are still up around 2%. Connor Campbell at Spreadex said: Whilst not quite at their afternoon highs the FTSE, DAX and CAC have kept up a staggering pace this Thursday; the Dow Jones, meanwhile, has lagged far behind, US investors not quite as eager to pour back into the market as their European peers... It is interesting to see such divergence between the two regions, especially the chasm in trading sentiment currently separating the FTSE and the Dow. Both have a tendency to be weighed down by their respective commodity sectors, the latter seeing an especially volatile session last night thanks to the choppy movements in the oil price. Yet whilst the UK oil and mining stocks (bar the odd anomaly like Rio Tinto and Premier Oil) are largely in the green, ignoring Brent Crude\u2019s latest decline, their US counterparts are far more bearish this Thursday, Chevron (down 1.5%), ExxonMobil (slipping around 0.8%) and Caterpillar (falling roughly 1%) all preventing the Dow from joining the day\u2019s rebound. It appears that the US index is sorely missing the earnings-focused gains the FTSE has seen today, with the incredible, dividend driven, performances of Lloyds and RSA Insurance helping overcome any potential negative sentiment following a rough Asian session. Tomorrow, however, does see the US shift back into the limelight after the UK GDP and Eurozone inflation focused trading of Thursday. Not that that will necessarily be a good thing; already coming in at a disappointing annualised rate of 0.7% for the fourth quarter, Friday\u2019s second estimate US GDP figure is set to drop to 0.4%, something that may only exacerbate the Dow\u2019s current dreariness. After a rebound in US markets late in Wednesday\u2019s session, the trend is continuing in early trading. Taking its lead from a bounce in Europe - helped by well received results from financial groups Lloyds, RSA Insurance and Axa - the Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed 72 points or 0.4%. Meanwhile the S&amp;P 500 is up 0.2% and Nasdaq 0.27% at the open. Over in Europe, the FTSE 100 has jumped 2.6% - back above the 6000 level - while Germany\u2019s Dax is up 2.3% and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 2.67%. Part of the reason for a tumble on Wednesday, before Wall Street\u2019s late revival, was a falling oil price on growing US inventories and further consideration of Saudi Arabia\u2019s comments suggesting producers were unlikely to cut output. But crude prices have stabilised to give some support to markets, with Brent down just 0.4% at $34.26 a barrel. But the durable goods data is more mixed than it first appears, says Rob Carnell at ING, and gives no reason for an early rate rise: US durable goods orders data showed a strong rebound in January, rising 4.9% month on month against expectations for a rise of only 2.9%. And this data will buoy hopes that the slowdown in US GDP growth that culminated in a rate of only 0.7% (annualised) in the fourth quarer of 2015 (and will likely be revised lower on Friday), may be turning the corner. This is choppy data at the best of times, so one month\u2019s data has to be taken with a pinch of salt. But these figures, which provide one of the best insights into the business investment environment, are especially important right now. This is because if the US is heading into recession, as some commentators maintain, then we suspect that this decline will be led by investment, with the labour market and consumer spending following in its wake with some lag. However, despite a decent headline figure, and bounces in some of the core indicators (we tend to focus on these core measures to shed some of the volatility of this data), the trend in orders and shipments is not giving a particularly clear message, and we will have to see more data before we can reach any firm conclusions. For example, the three month moving average for core capital goods orders fell further to -6.2%, and core capital goods shipments improved, but from -4.7% to only -4.2%, so still remain deeply depressed. With yet another inconclusive set of data, markets will make of this whatever they want. But the fact remains, the direction of the US economy at this juncture remains far from clear. And in consequence, the Fed\u2019s response remains in the balance, though we feel the hurdles for further tightening are high, so at the very least, this data provides no excuse for a near term tightening. The good US data of course could also prompt renewed talk of a Federal Reserve rate rise. David Morrison at Spread Co said: The US dollar rose a touch as did equities after durable goods (both including and excluding transportation items) blasted above market expectations. Weekly jobless claims were in line with expectations. It was a knee-jerk reaction which appeared to be algo-driven and it doesn\u2019t feel as if there\u2019s much follow-through to the initial move. Strong data may point to some robustness in the US economy but of course that\u2019s a double-edged sword. After all, it also raises the possibility of further rate increases from the Federal Reserve. In its economic projections back in December the central bank pencilled in 100 basis points-worth of rate hikes in 2016. That would be hard to stomach given the market turmoil since the beginning of the year. Sticking with America.... and US factories have just reported a surge in demand for machinery and heavy-duty equipment last month. It suggests the US economy is stronger than some economists feared . Orders for US capital goods jumped by 4.9% in January, after falling by 5% in December. That smashes forecasts of a 3% rise, and is the biggest monthly jump since March 2015. The weekly jobs figures have also been released, and they show a small increase in people filing new unemployment benefit claims. Not a major shock, though, and the total is still low in historic terms: Over in America, one of the country\u2019s top central bank officials isn\u2019t too worried about the prospect of Britain leaving the EU. James Bullard, president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve President, argued that Brexit isn\u2019t a threat to the US economy, as it would take years for the details to be sorted out. Bullard said (via Reuters): \u201cI don\u2019t think it is a risk event for the US because even if British voters decide to quit the EU there will be years for markets and investors to adjust.\u201d Britain\u2019s blue-chip stock index just burst back through the 6,000 point mark, as investors welcome today\u2019s GDP figures. The FTSE 100 index, which tracks the leading blue-chip shares in London, has jumped by 2.3% or 137 points to 6,004. That wipes out the losses suffered on Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday, when traders were fretting about the global economic slowdown. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, says the \u2018special dividend\u2019 announced by Lloyds today has improved the mood in the City. Dividend increases are all the rage this morning, as Lloyds, RSA and St James\u2019s Place all opt to flash their cash to keep shareholders happy. A 10% rally in Lloyds, along with a decent bounce for the rest of the sector has seen the FTSE add over 100 points within the first couple of hours of trading. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, says Britain\u2019s economy was \u201cwholly dependent on domestic activity\u201d for growth in the last quarter. And without the service sector, there wouldn\u2019t have been any growth at all either, as industrial production fell by 0.5%, and construction contracted by 0.4%. \u201cDomestic demand rose by 0.8% on the previous quarter, with consumer spending and a rise in inventories each accounting for roughly half this increase. Disappointingly, total investment fell slightly, with business investment dropping by 2.1% the biggest fall since the first quarter of 2014. \u201cThe bad news came on the net trade side, which knocked 0.3 percentage points off GDP. At the same time exports were down by 0.1% in the quarter and imports rose by 1.2%. German bank Berenberg reckons that the UK growth rate will slow this year, as the EU referendum approaches. Kallum Pickering, their senior UK economist, explains: Uncertainty hurts confidence and despite strong domestic demand growth toward the end of last year growth is likely to soften in the coming quarters. Economic performance depends on sentiment as much as on fundamentals. The combined effect of heightened global economic worries plus the reality of a possible Brexit - the referendum will take place on 23 June - will likely hit economic performance. As flagged up earlier, some economists think the UK could fall into recession if it votes to leave. He also produced this handy table, showing the details of Britain\u2019s growth over the last 18 months. Some international context: John Hawksworth, PwC\u2019s chief economist, says Britain\u2019s economy performed relatively well last year - encouraging people to move to the UK in search of work. \u201cToday\u2019s data confirmed that the UK economy slowed from 2.9% in 2014 to 2.2% in 2015, but remained the second strongest G7 economy last year after the US. \u201cRelatively strong growth in private sector services continues to drive UK growth despite much weaker trends in manufacturing and construction output in the second half of 2015. This has generated a lot of new jobs and helps to explain why net migration to the UK remained at near record levels of 323,000 in the year to September 2015. The UK jobs market remains a powerful magnet for workers from other slower growing countries in the EU and beyond. That 323,000 figure was released this morning - here\u2019s our news story on it: Hawksworth also agrees that consumers are providing the bulk of the growth: \u201cThe expenditure data for the fourth quarter suggest that steady growth in consumer spending remains the mainstay of the UK recovery. Investment growth seems to have stalled in the second half of 2015, however, and imports grew much faster than exports over this period. But these figures are only preliminary at this stage and may well be revised significantly later, so not too much should be read into them.\u201d Britain\u2019s economic recovery is rather less impressive once you adjust for population changes. On a per capita basis, GDP only grew by 0.3% in the last quarter. And on that measure, the economy is barely larger than in 2008 - before the financial crisis struck. Give yourselves a round of applause, UK consumers. You\u2019re keeping the economy afloat. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the international payments company, World First, explains: We had thought that weaker output numbers from industrial and construction sectors through Q4 would have dragged the overall growth number lower but, once again, consumer expenditure has remained resilient. Thank God for the British disposition to buy anything that isn\u2019t nailed down and to at least offer a few quid for the things that are.\u201d \u201cNet trade was also a drag on output although we can but hope that the recent GBP weakness we have seen will allow exporters to gain orders and hedge at currently attractive levels.\u201d Cook also fears that the \u201cbluster and pantomime over the EU referendum\u201d will arm the economy, by hurting business investment and consumer spending. Britain\u2019s trade balance is rarely a pretty sight, as the country sucks in more goods than it sells to the rest of the world. And today\u2019s growth report shows that the deficit has widened again, from \u00a314.7bn in Quarter 3 2015 to \u00a316.6bn in the fourth quarter. The ONS explains that British companies suffered a small drop in exports in the last quarter, while imports continued to climb. Following a 0.5% decrease in Quarter 3 2015, exports decreased by 0.1% in the latest quarter, while imports increased by 1.2% in Quarter 4 2015 following a 2.7% rise in Quarter 3 2015. Today\u2019s GDP report also confirms that Britain is heavily reliant on its service companies for growth. The service sector grew by 0.7% in the last quarter, meaning it has expanded steadily for three years. Manufacturing, though, was stagnant after shrinking for the previous three months: Shares are pushing higher, as investors express relief that Britain\u2019s growth rate hasnt\u2019 been revised down. The ONS has also confirmed that Britain grew by 2.2% during 2015. Household spending and business investment provided the bulk of the growth, while the UK trade deficit was a drag. The GDP report also shows that UK firms reined in their spending in the last quarter. The ONS says that business investment shrank by 2.1% in the October-December period, the biggest drop in almost two years. Breaking: The UK economy grew by 0.5% in the final three months of 2015. That confirms the initial estimate of GDP growth from the Office for National Statistics. That means Britain grew faster than Germany (which posted GDP growth of 0.3%), France (+0.2), and the United States (+0.2%). Details to follow... Tension is building in the City as we await the second estimate of UK growth in the last quarter, due in 10 minutes time..... The danger of Britain slumping back into recession will jump sharply if the public vote to leave the EU in June. So claim a group of economists surveyed by Bloomberg, who fear that confidence and spending would be knocked by a Brexit victory. Here\u2019s the details: As Britons contemplate their place in the 28-nation bloc before June\u2019s referendum, respondents to a Bloomberg survey said the probability of a slump spikes to 40% in the event of an \u201cout\u201d vote. That compares with just a 13% risk predicted in the most recent monthly poll.... Chris Hare, an economist at Investec Plc, warned: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty likely that we\u2019ll see volatility in financial markets, possibly a tightening in U.K. credit conditions, a hit to business and household confidence and all those things combined should drag on the economy.\u201d Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit doesn\u2019t believe governments will heed the IMF\u2019s latest call for action: BT shares have jumped by 3% this morning, as the stock market gives its verdict to Ofcom\u2019s review of the communications sector. Although the regulator is forcing BT to open up its network to rivals to build new fibre networks, it has backed away from the nuclear option of breaking up the company. That\u2019s a relief for BT, given the criticism it faces over Britain\u2019s patchy super-fast broadband coverage. My colleague Rob Davies explains: BT has been told to let rivals use its infrastructure to lay fibre cables that are faster than its own copper network, as part of a review of Britain\u2019s broadband needs by regulator Ofcom. In a once-in-a-decade review, the regulator stopped short of recommending that BT be forced to split off Openreach, the division that owns the broadband infrastructure. The verdict will be a blow to rivals including Sky and TalkTalk, which have said BT should lose control of the network. But Ofcom left open the possibility of revisiting that nuclear option if BT does not toe the line on a string of issues. It also gave a series of recommendations, including automatic compensation for customers and businesses when the Openreach network experiences problems. The regulator wants to introduce league tables and make it easier for customers to switch provider. Lloyd\u2019s surging share price has helped to push the FTSE 100 index up by 91 points, or 1.5%, to 5956. RSA, the insurance group, is also helping. Its shares are up 7.6%, after it posted a 43% jump in operating profits. CEO Stephen Hester cheered the City, by reporting that his turnaround plan is largely complete. RSA had also been hit by the winter floods in the North of England - taking a \u00a376m charge to cover insurance claims. Sterling has hit a new 14-month low against the euro this morning, as concern over the EU referendum bubbles away. The pound fell to \u20ac1.2609 against the single currency, which should make UK exports a little more competitive in Europe. Shareholders in Lloyds Banking Group have endured some tough years. Seven tough years, indeed, since the bank had to be bailed out after rescuing HBOS during the 2008 financial crisis. But there\u2019s better news this morning - Lloyds has announced it will pay them a special dividend (a princely 0.5p per share) on top of the full-year dividend of 2.25p. Lloyds only resumed paying dividends last year, and the news of an extra payment has sent shares soaring by almost 10% this morning. Chief executive Anto\u0301nio Horta-Oso\u0301rio should also be cheerful - he\u2019s picked up an \u00a38.5m pay deal, even though Lloyds profits dipped last year. China\u2019s stock market has had a bad day. The Shanghai stock market lurched downwards by 6% today, dogged by new anxiety over the Chinese economy. Fears of a possible devaluation also hit confidence, as Martin Farrer explains: Amid continued speculation that China could be forced to devalue the yuan this year, Zhu Guangyao, China\u2019s vice finance minister, said Beijing would seek to keep the exchange rate stable while maintaining its current \u201cmanaged float\u201d regime. \u201cWe do recognise the risk the global economy faces,\u201d he said at a conference on Thursday held by the Institute of International Finance linked to the G20 summit. \u201cWe also understand how important it is to correctly communicate with the market,\u201d he added. Overnight, the International Monetary Fund threw its weight behind calls for fresh action to ward off a global slump. The Fund is worried that the global economy is faltering as financial conditions worsen, emerging markets face tougher times, and the oil industry suffers from cheaper crude prices. In a statement ahead of the G20 finance minister\u2019s meeting in Shanghai, starting tomorrow, the IMF said: These developments point to higher risks of a derailed recovery, at a moment when the global economy is highly vulnerable to adverse shocks\u201d It added that warned governments that they can\u2019t simply rely on central bankers - they need to consider spending more to help their economies. \u201cA comprehensive approach is needed to reduce over-reliance on monetary policy.\u201d \u201cIn particular, near-term fiscal policy should be more supportive where appropriate and provided there is fiscal space, especially through investment that boosts both the demand and the supply potential of the economy.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We get a new health-check on the UK economy this morning. At 9.30am, the second estimate of British GDP for the last three months of 2015 is released. It may confirm that the economy grew by 0.5% during the quarter - unspectacular, but better than most major rivals. But some economists reckon it could be revised down to just 0.4%, if nervous businesses have cut their spending. A disappointing number could inflame worries over the UK, in a week where Brexit fears have already sent the pound sliding to seven-year lows. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: In a rather strange twist of fate one of the best performing economy\u2019s in Europe over the past 12 months has found its currency take an absolute hammering in the past few weeks as investors take a rather one eyed and alarmist perspective on the potential negative consequences of a British exit from the EU in a referendum vote scheduled for June this year. Later this morning we get the latest iteration of UK Q4 GDP and expectations are for growth of 0.5%, unchanged from the previous reading, and an annualised number of 1.9%, though we could see some evidence that business investment is starting to slow from the previous 2.2% to 0.6%, though the annualised measure is expected to increase to 6.4% from 5.8%. Also coming up today: There\u2019s a flurry of company news hitting the wires, including results from Lloyds Banking Group, theme park group Merlin, and insurance firm RSA. More on all those shortly. And Ofcom, the telecoms regulator, is outlining its plans to create more competition and improve Britain\u2019s broadband network. BT, the former state monopoly, is being ordered to open its network to its rivals, to help them build their own high-speed fibre services. However, BT has also dodged the threat of being broken up - although it\u2019s still an option if things don\u2019t improve. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

                "bodyText":"The head of China\u2019s central bank has dropped a strong hint that Beijing is preparing to launch another round of stimulus as he sought to reassure the financial markets about the country\u2019s flagging economy. China had more room and tools in its monetary policy to tackle downward pressure in the economy, and its fiscal policy would be more proactive, central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan said on Friday. Zhou, speaking at a conference held by the Institute of International Finance in Shanghai in conjunction with a G20 meeting of central bank governors and finance ministers, also said that the direction of China\u2019s reforms would not change, but that the pace might change. \u201cWhile the reform direction is clear, managing the reform pace will need windows (of opportunity) and conditions ... The pace will vary, but the reform will be set to continue and the direction is not changed,\u201d Zhou said in English. At the same time, policy makers need to strike a balance between growth, restructuring and managing risks to the economy. Zhou\u2019s comments helped stock markets rise around Asia with Chinese shares rising strongly a day after falling more than 6%. The Shanghai Composite index was up 0.54% at 3.15am GMT on Friday while the CSI300 index of leading Shanghai and Shenzhen shares was up 0.78%. In Japan the falling cost of fuel kept inflation at 0%, well below the central bank\u2019s target of 2% and highlighting the daunting task policymakers face in attempting to lift Japan out of stagnation. However, the Nikkei rose 1.2% helped by gains on Wall Street and the ASX/S&amp;P200 in Australia was up 0.2%. In a bid to end speculation about a possible devaluation of the yuan, Zhou added that there was no basis for persistent depreciation of China\u2019s yuan and that foreign reserves would be kept at \u201cadequate\u201d levels. Later he said that the world was overly concerned about the state of China\u2019s $3 trillion foreign reserves and whether it could protect the yuan from increasing capital flight. But Angus Nicholson of online trader IG said that Zhou\u2019s comments were contradictory because any monetary easing would increase pressure on the yuan and therefore foreign reserves. \u201cWhile all of these statements are reassuring to the market, only two out of three of those statements can be true in the long term,\u201d Nicholson said. \u201cIf there is further monetary policy easing, the pressure for further yuan depreciation will sap foreign reserves if the currency isn\u2019t allowed to weaken. \u201cWhile China has the means to pause the exchange rate at current levels for a few months, once FX reserves drop below US$3 trillion, it is only a matter of time before a major one-off devaluation becomes the best course of action.\u201d But as global financial markets continued to fret about the real state of China\u2019s economy \u2013 IMF chief Christine Lagarde told delegates that the country faced an \u201coverwhelming\u201d structural reform agenda \u2013 the bank said in a later statement that its economic fundamentals remained sound and there were signs of demand picking up again. China has cut interest rates six times since November 2014 in an effort to stimulate its economy which last year grew at its slowest rate for 25 years. Although the last of those rate cuts was in October, Beijing has resorted to a variety of other methods to encourage growth and expand credit, including by increasing bank liquidity and massaging reserve requirements. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, told delegates in Shanghai that the G20 had failed to do enough to boost global growth and he rejected suggestions that central banks had run out of options to respond to continued slow growth. \u201cSeveral commentators are peddling the myth that monetary policy is \u2018out of ammunition\u2019. This is wrong, but the widespread absence of global price pressures demands that our firepower be well aimed,\u201d Carney said. The Bank of Japan recently joined the European Central Bank, the Danish central bank, the Swedish Riksbank and the Swiss National Bank in cutting rates to below zero to rescue their economies from deflation and the prospect of recession.",

The global economic and financial situation may have become more grim and complex. It is time for countries to stand together to tide over difficulties,\u201d Li said in a video message at the opening of the meeting.</p> <p>Several other policymakers have urged better coordination, but there was disagreement about what steps to take, making it unlikely that concrete action points will emerge from the meeting.</p> <p>\u201cTalking about further stimulus just distracts from the real tasks at hand,\u201d Germany\u2019s Minister of Finance Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble said, rebuffing a recommendation from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that the G20 should start planning now for a coordinated stimulus programme.</p> <p>\u201cWe, therefore, do not agree on a G20 fiscal stimulus package as some argue, in case outlook risks materialise.\u201d</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"51a9e765c5d546359e25b5bfb085d109b9f80613\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51a9e765c5d546359e25b5bfb085d109b9f80613/0_0_4294_2575/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sch\u00e4uble at the G20\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sch\u00e4uble at the G20</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pool/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>Lew had a similar message, saying there was a great deal of economic uncertainty at present but no crisis.</p> <p>\u201cIt would not be reasonable to expect a crisis response in an environment that is not a crisis,\u201d he said told reporters.</p> <p>Overhanging the summit of major economy finance ministers and central bankers are global concerns about China\u2019s ability to manage its domestic markets, currency and commitment to wider restructuring reforms.

The bank will be slightly relieved to see that consumers\u2019 inflation expectations picked up to a 7-month high in February, although they were still well below long-term norms. Furthermore, pricing expectations rose slightly for retailers and were stable among retailers. However, they weakened among manufacturers</p> <p>In addition to the marked drop in Eurozone consumer and business confidence in February, pressure for appreciable ECB stimulus in March has been ramped up by early Eurozone consumer price data for February which suggests that a return to deflation is very possible as a consequence of lower oil, commodity and food prices. Specifically, Spanish deflation widened sharply to 0.9% in February (the sharpest since last October) from 0.4% in January while France saw consumer prices fall 0.1% year-on-year after an increase of 0.1% in January.</p> <p>There is clearly now a very real risk that the Eurozone returned to deflation in February despite consumer price inflation rising to an eight-month high of 0.3% in January. While this would be primarily due to lower oil and commodity prices, it would likely reinforce ECB concerns about potential second round effects on wages and price setting.</p> <p>We expect the ECB to trim its deposit rate by a further 10 basis points to -0.40% at its March meeting and believe it could very well step up its monthly purchase of assets (perhaps by \u20ac20bn-\u20ac30bn from the current level of \u20ac60bn. There are reports that the ECB is considering introducing a double tier on its deposit rate in order to ease the pressure on banks\u2019 profitability from another cut. The higher negative rate would only be charged on banks\u2019 deposits with the ECB above a certain level</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56d028f0e4b0bd5a0524cb80\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-26T10:31:55.586Z\">10.31am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Will the weak confidence data mean consumers and businesses keep their hands in their pockets? Bert Colijn at ING Bank says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Economic sentiment... was worse than analysts expected and reflects the somber mood about the Eurozone economy in the beginning of the year, although the indicator is still above its long-term average. The weak external environment is clearly impacting the business sector, as both manufacturing and services indicated weakening sentiment. Consumers even experienced the largest one-month drop in confidence since 2012. Both businesses and consumers are clearly spooked by concerns about the strength of the global economy and financial markets, geopolitical risks and a looming Brexit.</p> <p>For manufacturing, the global weakness is impacting current business, as orders, production and exports went down. The service sector indicated in this survey that recent demand was actually better than in January, but that expectations about future demand went down.</p> <p>Without any hard data for the first quarter, it is difficult to say how the downbeat survey results translate to output growth. Will consumers and businesses act on their negative sentiment or in other words: are they walking the walk or just talking the talk? Last summer, consumer confidence declined on the latest leg of the Greek crisis and the Chinese stock market crash, but consumption growth accelerated in the third quarter. With unemployment coming down, oil prices low and a weak euro, quite a few conditions for growth are benign, but large downside risks remain apparent. In a sense, the Eurozone currently resembles a 50-year old overweight smoker: there are a lot of downside risks, but the base case for the short-term remains fairly decent.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56d028c3e4b0d38537b1f5f4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-26T10:28:37.403Z\">10.28am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/samueltombs/status/703161147449434114\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">EC Econ Sentiment Index for UK, covering whole-econ, fell in Feb to 31-month low &amp; below EU ave.

Ahead of the GDP figures later, UBS concludes it is not.</p> <p>Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer at UBS Wealth Management said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Financial markets are right to be concerned about a slowdown in the world\u2019s largest economy. We expect just 1.5% growth for the US this year, reflecting a contraction in manufacturing activity, tighter credit conditions, the effects of a strong dollar in weaker international markets, and wealth losses due to recent stock market volatility.</p> <p>But markets would be wrong, in our view, to assume that this deceleration represents the start of a recession. Unemployment is under 5%. Average hourly earnings are growing at their fastest pace since 2009. Mortgage rates are just 3.7%, and gasoline prices are the cheapest they\u2019ve been in years. Household debt relative to GDP has dropped a full 20 percentage points over the past six years.

Consumer confidence fell to a 14-month low in February as people became more worried about the state of the UK economy and about its prospects over the next 12 months, according to market research company GfK. Its monthly confidence barometer, taking in the views of 2,000 people, also showed that consumers were less confident about making big purchases such as furniture or electrical goods.

                "bodyText":"Another indicator that a US rate rise could come sooner than expected comes with a bigger than expected rise in consumer spending. The Commerce Department said consumer spending climbed by 0.5% in February, compared to expectations of a 0.3% increase. Meanwhile there was also a 0.5% rise in income, the largest increase since June. And the final release of the University of Michigan consumer confidence survey rose to 91.7, up from 90.7. But Rob Carnell at ING Bank said it was still difficult to judge the current state of the US economy: As we head into payrolls week next week, there is still a distinct lack of clarity about where the US economy is headed. And given the nature of the non-farm payrolls jobs release, we may not be much the wiser by next Friday, and in consequence, there is likely to still be considerable uncertainty about the direction the Fed will be taking. Markets dislike uncertainty. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back again on Monday. After a brief revival, the pound is slipping back to seven year lows against the dollar, on a combination of the better than expected US GDP figures and continuing uncertainty over the UK referendum on whether to leave the European Union. Sterling is now down at $1.3925, heading back towards the seven year low of $1.3878 it reached on Wednesday. US markets have followed their European counterparts higher, boosted by rising oil prices and better than expected American GDP figures. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed around 90 points or 0.5% in early trading, while the S&amp;P 500 is up 0.3% and Nasdaq 0.7% higher at the open. Hopes of co-ordinated global policy measures from the G20 finance ministers meeting in Shanghai seem to be fading. Reuters reports: China sought to restore confidence in its economy as financial leaders from G20 nations gathered in Shanghai on Friday, and Premier Li Keqiang urged greater global coordination and consideration of policy spillovers. But Germany appeared to all but rule out coordinated stimulus to counter a deepening global chill, and U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said there was no need for a crisis response, as in 2009 when the Group of 20 (G20) major economies agreed on coordinated stimulus to prevent a worldwide depression. While the health of the world\u2019s second-largest economy, which hosts the G20 presidency this year, is a key talking point around the two-day summit, the threat of the UK leaving the European Union and its political and economic implications have also surfaced as concerns among participants in the meeting. \u201cMacroeconomic policy coordination needs to be strengthened. The global economic and financial situation may have become more grim and complex. It is time for countries to stand together to tide over difficulties,\u201d Li said in a video message at the opening of the meeting. Several other policymakers have urged better coordination, but there was disagreement about what steps to take, making it unlikely that concrete action points will emerge from the meeting. \u201cTalking about further stimulus just distracts from the real tasks at hand,\u201d Germany\u2019s Minister of Finance Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble said, rebuffing a recommendation from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that the G20 should start planning now for a coordinated stimulus programme. \u201cWe, therefore, do not agree on a G20 fiscal stimulus package as some argue, in case outlook risks materialise.\u201d Lew had a similar message, saying there was a great deal of economic uncertainty at present but no crisis. \u201cIt would not be reasonable to expect a crisis response in an environment that is not a crisis,\u201d he said told reporters. Overhanging the summit of major economy finance ministers and central bankers are global concerns about China\u2019s ability to manage its domestic markets, currency and commitment to wider restructuring reforms. Concerns about its slowing economy and confusion over its currency policy were among the factors which sowed turmoil in global markets in January. The case for further policy stimulus amid rising debt levels and already extremely low interest rates was a hard sell among some other G20 members. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned cutting rates below zero carried serious risks, and blamed the recent global slump in shares and other assets on the failure of governments to make bold economics reforms. Schaeuble said the debt-financed growth model had \u201creached its limits (and) is even causing new problems, raising debt, causing bubbles and excessive risk taking, zombifying the economy.\u201d And Japan\u2019s Finance Minister Taro Aso shrugged off calls from some quarters for Tokyo to roll out fresh fiscal stimulus. Japan\u2019s central bank stunned investors by adopting negative interest rates last month. The dollar has strengthened following the US GDP data, with sterling now at $1.3960 having earlier regained the $1.4 level. Dennis de Jong, managing directorat UFX.com, said: A dreary Dow Jones is likely to be perked up by today\u2019s better than expected US GDP figures, with annualised growth jumping up to the 1% mark. Financial markets were expecting a slowdown in the world\u2019s largest economy, so much so that conversations about a recession weren\u2019t far away. Yet, with unemployment remaining low and wages increasing at their fastest rate since 2009, growth is back on the agenda. Add to that cheap fuel prices and low mortgage rates, and it may only be a matter of time until disposable incomes are fully realised and growth continues to speed up. The better than expected US GDP figures should at least calm fears the country is heading into a recession. The US economy saw a slowdown in growth in the fourth quarter, but not as much as first thought. In its second revision, the Commerce Department said GDP grew at an annual rate of 1%, compared to the initial forecast of 0.7%. Analysts had been expecting the figure to be revised down to 0.4%. But this is still a slowdown on the 2% growth reported in the previous three months. The revision came as businesses seemed less aggressive in their efforts to reduce inventory. More signs of weak inflation across the eurozone. German\u2019s harmonised consumer price index is up 0.4% month on month, but down 0.2% year on year, compared to expectations of a flat figure. This is the lowest annual level since January 2015. Downbeat data from Greece: More for the ECB to think about, with German inflation set to go into negative territory. Reuters reports: German inflation turned negative in February for the first time in five months, preliminary state data indicated on Friday, giving proponents of further monetary policy easing more ammunition for a European Central Bank meeting next month. Consumer prices fell below zero on the year in five German states, the data showed. In the most populous state North Rhine-Westphalia, annual inflation slowed to 0.1 percent from 0.6 percent in January. The state readings will feed into nationwide inflation data due at 1300 GMT (08:00 a.m. EST). Capital Economics analyst Jessica Hinds said the state data suggested that pan-German EU-harmonized consumer price inflation (HICP) dropped to -0.1 percent from +0.4 percent in January. The market rally is continuing, helped by renewed strength in the oil prices. Brent crude is up 2% at $36.03 a barrel on hopes that a meeting between Saudia Arabia, Russia and Venezuela could tackle the low oil price. Analyst Connor Campbell at Spreadex said: The global indices continued to strive for recent highs this Friday, their growth sustained by a $36 per barrel crossing surge from Brent Crude. However, if expectations of a miserly US fourth quarter GDP figure this afternoon are accurate the US open may end up slightly spoiling the end of week party. Currently, at least, the Dow Jones is joining in with its galloping European peers, the futures promising a 110 point rise when the bell rings on Wall Street, something that would leave the index at its highest point since the first week of January. Yet the spectre of this afternoon\u2019s latest fourth quarter GDP reading may temper investors\u2019 enthusiasm, analysts forecasting a downward revision from an already awful annualised 0.7% to 0.4%. And here\u2019s more for the ECB to think about: European confidence and inflation figures make a strong case for further stimulus measures from the European Central Bank at its March meeting, says Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight: Certainly, the marked drop in overall business and consumer confidence across the Eurozone to an 8-month low heightens concern about faltering growth. However, price developments in the survey did offer a little bit of good news for the ECB. The bank will be slightly relieved to see that consumers\u2019 inflation expectations picked up to a 7-month high in February, although they were still well below long-term norms. Furthermore, pricing expectations rose slightly for retailers and were stable among retailers. However, they weakened among manufacturers In addition to the marked drop in Eurozone consumer and business confidence in February, pressure for appreciable ECB stimulus in March has been ramped up by early Eurozone consumer price data for February which suggests that a return to deflation is very possible as a consequence of lower oil, commodity and food prices. Specifically, Spanish deflation widened sharply to 0.9% in February (the sharpest since last October) from 0.4% in January while France saw consumer prices fall 0.1% year-on-year after an increase of 0.1% in January. There is clearly now a very real risk that the Eurozone returned to deflation in February despite consumer price inflation rising to an eight-month high of 0.3% in January. While this would be primarily due to lower oil and commodity prices, it would likely reinforce ECB concerns about potential second round effects on wages and price setting. We expect the ECB to trim its deposit rate by a further 10 basis points to -0.40% at its March meeting and believe it could very well step up its monthly purchase of assets (perhaps by \u20ac20bn-\u20ac30bn from the current level of \u20ac60bn. There are reports that the ECB is considering introducing a double tier on its deposit rate in order to ease the pressure on banks\u2019 profitability from another cut. The higher negative rate would only be charged on banks\u2019 deposits with the ECB above a certain level Will the weak confidence data mean consumers and businesses keep their hands in their pockets? Bert Colijn at ING Bank says: Economic sentiment... was worse than analysts expected and reflects the somber mood about the Eurozone economy in the beginning of the year, although the indicator is still above its long-term average. The weak external environment is clearly impacting the business sector, as both manufacturing and services indicated weakening sentiment. Consumers even experienced the largest one-month drop in confidence since 2012. Both businesses and consumers are clearly spooked by concerns about the strength of the global economy and financial markets, geopolitical risks and a looming Brexit. For manufacturing, the global weakness is impacting current business, as orders, production and exports went down. The service sector indicated in this survey that recent demand was actually better than in January, but that expectations about future demand went down. Without any hard data for the first quarter, it is difficult to say how the downbeat survey results translate to output growth. Will consumers and businesses act on their negative sentiment or in other words: are they walking the walk or just talking the talk? Last summer, consumer confidence declined on the latest leg of the Greek crisis and the Chinese stock market crash, but consumption growth accelerated in the third quarter. With unemployment coming down, oil prices low and a weak euro, quite a few conditions for growth are benign, but large downside risks remain apparent. In a sense, the Eurozone currently resembles a 50-year old overweight smoker: there are a lot of downside risks, but the base case for the short-term remains fairly decent. Eurozone economic sentiment slipped in February, according to new figures from the European Commission. The sentiment index fell from 105.1 in January to 103.8, below an expected 104.3. Consumer confidence was -8.8, down on January\u2019s -6.3 but in line with forecasts. In the run-up to the UK referendum on Europe, we should expect some dramatic moves in sterling, says Caxton FX analyst Nicholas Laser-Ebisch: As June 23rd approaches, it is likely that the strength of the pound will correlate highly with opinion polls discussing Britain\u2019s EU membership. However, the uncertainty surrounding the EU referendum and possible Brexit - the UK\u2019s most historically unprecedented event of the last few decades - means that the coming months could see quite random currency movements. A main factor of this will be the variety of opinions (both in the UK and outside) centring around the merits of staying in the EU, versus leaving. As beliefs clash, and political rhetoric ramps up, we will likely see exchange rate swings of up to 5% in the next 4 months leading up to the referendum (we have already seen 6% and 8% movements with the pound/dollar and the pound/euro respectively this year). More from George Osborne\u2019s interview with the BBC. The UK chancellor has said the risks to the global economy are at their worst since the financial crisis, making it the worst possible time to be contemplating leaving Europe. Osborne tweeted: The concerns about the global economy echo a speech Osborne made in January, when he warned of \u201ca dangerous cocktail of threats\u201d to the UK. Is the US heading for a recession? Ahead of the GDP figures later, UBS concludes it is not. Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer at UBS Wealth Management said: Financial markets are right to be concerned about a slowdown in the world\u2019s largest economy. We expect just 1.5% growth for the US this year, reflecting a contraction in manufacturing activity, tighter credit conditions, the effects of a strong dollar in weaker international markets, and wealth losses due to recent stock market volatility. But markets would be wrong, in our view, to assume that this deceleration represents the start of a recession. Unemployment is under 5%. Average hourly earnings are growing at their fastest pace since 2009. Mortgage rates are just 3.7%, and gasoline prices are the cheapest they\u2019ve been in years. Household debt relative to GDP has dropped a full 20 percentage points over the past six years. These factors should enable real disposable incomes to increase at a sufficient pace to sustain consumption growth, and keep the US out of recession. Furthermore, with unemployment now so low, improved wage-bargaining power should translate into continued income growth, even if jobs growth slows from last year\u2019s 221,000 per month pace. Overall, it would be highly unusual for the US economy to contract against a backdrop of such strong labor markets. There seems to be a bit of playing down G20 expectations going on. Reuters is quoting a senior US Treasury official saying meetings like the G20 are for the gradual shifting of policies, and 20 economies can not be driven from a central meeting. Earlier the head of Italy\u2019s central bank said the most important aim of the meeting wsa to improve the ability to stimulate growth. But he added, according to Reuters, that we should \u201cnot expect concrete action to come from the G20 meeting.\u201d Here\u2019s our report on the latest developments in the London Stock Exchange\u2019s proposed merger with Deutsche B\u00f6rse: The planned merger of the London Stock Exchange (LSE) with Germany\u2019s Deutsche B\u00f6rse will result in a combined company with its main public listing in the UK capital. LSE chief executive Xavier Rolet is set to retire and his Deutsche B\u00f6rse counterpart Carsten Kengeter will take the same role at the new company, according to further details of the proposed merged released on Friday. It emerged on Tuesday that the LSE is in talks about an all-share merger with its German rival which would result in a group worth over \u00a321bn. In Friday\u2019s statement the LSE said the new combined group will be a UK plc domiciled in London, with headquarters in both the British capital and Frankfurt. The board will have equal numbers from each business, a move that was expected. Rolet, who has been credited with rejuvenating the company and embarking on an acquisition spree, will step down. The combined company will seek a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange and a prime standard listing on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Full story here: Here are the gainers and losers so far on the FTSE 100: More on eurozone inflation: Although most European markets look set for a fall over the month - the FTSEurofirst 300 is currently down 3% in February - the London market has edged marginally higher. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: The FTSE-100 is charging higher again at the open, paced by a strong finish in Wall Street last night and the fact we\u2019ve seen no repeat of that big down leg in Chinese stocks, but it\u2019s worth noting that the London index is only just back to where we started the month. As we run down to the weekend break, it\u2019s looking relatively quiet in terms of the domestic economic calendar although German inflation and US GDP readings could provide some broad direction. Any further signals out of the G20 meeting in Shanghai which runs again tomorrow will also gave the ability to shift sentiment \u2013 February may look as if it\u2019s going to conclude on an upbeat note, but it\u2019s certainly been a wild ride to get here. Meanwhile consumer confidence in the UK fell to a 14 month low in February, while export orders fell sharply in the last quarter of 2015, according to new figures out this morning. Katie Allen reports: We have known for some time that the UK economy has been largely relying on consumer spending for growth - something confirmed in Thursday\u2019s GDP figures. Economists are warning that\u2019s a dangerous position to be in given that households\u2019 real incomes look set to slow this year. On top of that, there are fears that the EU referendum and ongoing global economic gloom will prompt consumers to rein in spending over coming months. Fresh figures out today suggest Britons are already becoming more cautious about the economic outlook. Consumer confidence fell to a 14-month low in February as people became more worried about the state of the UK economy and about its prospects over the next 12 months, according to market research company GfK. Its monthly confidence barometer, taking in the views of 2,000 people, also showed that consumers were less confident about making big purchases such as furniture or electrical goods. But consumer remained upbeat about their personal financial situation. \u201cDespite the positive impact of continued low interest rates and subdued inflation on our day-to-day household budgets, the feeble outlook for growth and a variety of economic uncertainties since the start of the year has depressed our New Year optimism,\u201d says Joe Staton at GfK. Separate figures on exporters also point to more challenging times ahead. Export sales and orders across both manufacturing and services sectors fell significantly in the last quarter of 2015, according to this morning\u2019s report from the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) and DHL. \u201cBritish exporters have faced considerable challenges in recent months. Slowing growth in China and the US, along with the continued weakness in the eurozone, have made it harder for firms to build momentum,\u201d said BCC director general John Longworth. Labour has seized on the BCC report to argue the UK needed a new industrial strategy to tackle challenges around access to finance, skills and infrastructure. \u201cThese figures show that George Osborne has been asleep at the wheel, he\u2019s leaving our economy insufficiently resilient to advancing global threats and not in a high-enough state of readiness to seize on the fast-approaching opportunities to make sure that Britain benefits most,\u201d said Kevin Brennan MP, Labour\u2019s shadow minister for trade, investment and intellectual property. UK chancellor George Osborne has been speaking to the BBC on the referendum and the prospect of Brexit: The French deflation figure of course puts more pressure on the European Central Bank to provide further stimulus at its meeting next month, since it is well shy of its inflation target. ECB president Mario Draghi has already promised he will not hesitate to act, and he may well have to. The recent rally is indeed continuing, with European markets making a bright start on the last trading day of the week. The FTSE 100 has jumped 1% or 64 points to 6077, despite an 8% slump in Royal Bank of Scotland following its figures. Germany\u2019s Dax has opened up 1.5%, France\u2019s Cac has climbed 1.1% and the FTSEEurofirst 300 has risen 0.8%. Elsewhere the London Stock Exchange has just said that following its proposed merger with Deutsche B\u00f6rse, the combined group would be a UK plc domiciled in London. The news is likely to help appease some fears that the German exchange was gaining greater control of the business. But Carsten Kengeter, the German banker running the Frankfurt exchange, will become chief executive. The group also said it was setting up a joint committee to look at the implications of the UK referendum on Europe. But first we have French fourth quarter GDP, which is better than expected. The economy grew by 0.3% in the final three months of the year compared to the previous quarter, which has been revised up from the initial estimate of 0.2%. The INSEE statistics agency said consumer spending and household investment fell less than had previously expected, Reuters reported. Meanwhile French consumer prices fell 0.1% in February, pushing the 12 month inflation rate into negative territory, down -1% compared to estimates of an increase of 1%. Here\u2019s the schedule for the main economic data due later: 10.00 am (GMT) Eurozone consumer confidence 13.00 pm German consumer price index 13.30 pm US GDP (fourth quarter) As far as the US figures are concerned, the second reading of GDP is expected to see a revision down from 0.7% to 0.4%. Royal Bank of Scotland is the latest bank to report its results, and it has announced a \u00a32bn loss, its eighth consecutive year of losses. But chief executive Ross McEwan still received a pay package of \u00a33.9m. Our full story is here: Global markets are being buoyed again by hopes of more stimulus from central banks and reports that oil producers will meet again to discuss the slump in crude prices. As G20 finance ministers meet in Shanghai, the head of China\u2019s central bank hinted the country was preparing to launch another round of stimulus as he sought to reassure the financial markets about the country\u2019s flagging economy. Our full story is here: Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said: The recent rebound in the yuan does appear to have assuaged concerns that the Chinese appear intent on sharply devaluing their currency, however given the timing and location of this week\u2019s meeting, it seems to me merely good policy to avoid criticism from fellow G20 members. It would not be unexpected to see the yuan start sliding again once this weekend\u2019s meeting is in the rear view mirror. The recent call by the IMF earlier this week, followed by the OECD this morning, for the G20 to take bold action at their meeting this weekend could also be a factor behind the rebound in the latter part of this week, at a time when data showed that global trade slowed sharply in 2015, led largely by a slowdown in emerging markets. But he added: It is highly unlikely that the G20 finance ministers will be able to deliver on anything more substantial than mere warm words and empty rhetoric, though I\u2019m sure UK officials will somehow be able to shoehorn a mention into the statement about the risks of a \u201cBrexit\u201d as \u201cProject fear\u201d continues to get ramped up by the various vested interests in the global economy as well as big business. Indeed the Financial Times is reporting (\u00a3) that US chancellor George Osborne is pressing for the G20 to warn of the dangers of Brexit in its official communique due on Saturday. Meanwhile Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said central banks had not run out of ammunition to boost the global economy, as was sometimes suggested, but he also called on the G20 to adopt more positive measures to help growth. So ahead of a raft of data later, notably US GDP figures, markets are continuing their recent rally, with the NIkkei up 0.3% and the Hang Seng 1.8% better. In China the CSI300 is up 1%. European markets are also expected to open higher: This follows a 1.2% gain overnight on Wall Street, as crude prices climbed on reports that Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Russia planned to meet next month. But any major deal seems unlikely following this week\u2019s comments from Saudi suggesting oil producers would not cut production.",

                "bodyText":"The recent economic slowdown in the US may have been less severe than previously estimated, according figures released by the Commerce Department on Friday. US gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 1% in the fourth quarter of 2015, up from initial estimates of 0.7%. The upward revision surprised economists and analysts who had expected the figure to be revised down to 0.4%, helping to lift stocks in early trading. The new figures suggest the US economy may be able to withstand a global slowdown better than many economists anticipated despite problems in the once booming shale oil industry.

In a career which has spanned Goldman Sachs, UBS and currently Deutsche B\u00f6rse \u2013 which he heads \u2013 he has navigated the peaks of corporate finance but also been witness to some of the most controversial scandals that have dogged banking in the past decade. Now the chief executive in waiting of the proposed merger between the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and Deutsche B\u00f6rse, the 48-year-old German\u2019s new position will add to a lengthy CV. Educated at Middlesex University and the London School of Economics, Kengeter joined Goldman Sachs in 1997 and progressed to partner by his mid-30s.

Kengeter was in charge of UBS\u2019s investment banking operations when Kweku Adoboil racked up eventual losses of more than \u00a31.5bn. Last year the trial of Tom Hayes, the former UBS trader sentenced to 14 years for fraud for his part in manipulating the Libor rate, heard Kengeter had been at a meeting where plans to manipulate the market were discussed. Hayes told prosecutors that Kengeter was present along with other senior UBS executives at a meeting in Tokyo where Hayes discussed how he was going to influence submitters setting the rate. Kengeter left UBS in 2013 and was appointed chief executive of Deutsche B\u00f6rse in 2014, a position he took up last June and to which he commutes from the west London home he shares with his wife and three children. While at UBS, he said he liked to be at his desk by 7am but tried to fit in sports activitiesat weekends.

Osborne said fellow finance ministers and central bank chiefs had unanimously concluded that a vote to leave the EU by Britain would be one of the biggest economic dangers this year. According to a draft communique, the meeting in Shanghai also agreed to use all policy tools to lift sluggish global growth, despite German disquiet over fiscal and monetary stimulus. The G20 ministers were seeking policy solutions amid growing concern about the headwinds facing the global economy, principally concerns about growth in China and the US. After years of money printing and historic low interest rates across much of the developed world, the outlook for growth is still uncertain and the communique seen noted that monetary policy alone could not bring balanced growth, the reports said. \u201cThe global recovery continues, but it remains uneven and falls short of our ambition for strong, sustainable and balanced growth,\u201d it said. \u201cMonetary policies will continue to support economic activity and ensure price stability ... but monetary policy alone cannot lead to balanced growth.\u201d The draft suggested that markets\u2019 recent ructions have been overreactions to economic anxieties that do not reflect economic fundamentals, the reports said, not helped by threats such as Britain\u2019s possible exit from the EU and the European refugee crisis. The draft\u2019s noted \u201cthe shock of a potential UK exit from the European Union\u201d in the seventh line of its text. It added: \u201cWhile recognising these challenges, we nevertheless judge that the magnitude of recent market volatility has not reflected the underlying fundamentals of the global economy.\u201d It added that ministers pledged not to engage in beggar-thy-neighbour currency devaluations which could unleash a wave of dangerous deflation through the global economy. Osborne said in a statement that G20 finance ministers and officials were unanimous that a possible British exit from the European Union would be a shock to the global economy. \u201cHere at the G20, finance leaders and central bank governors of the world\u2019s biggest economies have raised serious concerns about the risks posed by a UK exit from the EU,\u201d Osborne said in a statement from Shanghai. \u201cThey have concluded unanimously today that what they call the shock of a potential UK vote to leave is among the biggest economic dangers this year.\u201d The G20 Brexit warning will be welcomed by the prime minister David Cameron as he tries to make the case for the UK to stay in the EU when the referendum is held on 23 June. His cause has been dealt a blow by the declaration of the London mayor Boris Johnson for the leave camp. But the G20 statement would come with the endorsement of not only Osborne but also Bank of England governor Mark Carney and would be the latest in a series of red flags from the business world. Others have included the The credit agency Moody\u2019s and IMF chief Christine Lagarde. Earlier, Osborne also warned in Shanghai that problems were brewing for the world economy and that could impact Britain\u2019s economy. He said: \u201cThe storm clouds are clearly gathering in the world economy and that has a consequence for lots of countries including Britain. Now we are weathering it better than most, but we\u2019ve just had confirmation that our own economy is not as big as we had hoped. \u201cSo we may need to undertake further reductions in spending because this country can only afford what it can afford and we will address that in the budget, because I\u2019m absolutely clear we\u2019ve got to root our country in the principle that we must live within our means and we have economic security.\u201d",

More speculatively, there may even be some positives for the world economy \u2013 notably the additional pressure for more growth-friendly policies in the remainder of the EU.</p> <p> In our view... while Brexit would have global ramifications, these should not be overstated, nor need they all be negative. For a start, we doubt the disruption to the UK economy would be as large as many fear. In particular, the uncertainties about the UK\u2019s relations with the rest of Europe could be reduced during the period of negotiations before exit actually takes place. And unlike some potential euro departures, the UK already has its own currency and would be opting to leave rather than being pushed out. The UK would surely also swiftly reassert its commitment to international organisations like NATO and to cooperation with other Western powers in areas of common geopolitical interests.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, even if the UK economy does initially struggle following Brexit, it only accounts for around 4% of world GDP. Indeed, some of the feared costs to the UK \u2013 such as the relocation of international companies to the Continent \u2013 would not have any net impact on the global economy...</p> <p>[And] it is surely inconsistent to argue \u2013 as some do \u2013 that Brexit would both be a disaster for the UK and encourage other member states to quit the EU as well. It is even possible \u2013 though perhaps only wishful thinking at this stage \u2013 that Brexit would be the catalyst for much-needed structural reform in the remainder of the EU, as well as a shift away from austerity. In this (admittedly rosy) scenario, Brexit might yet prove to be a long-term positive both for the UK and for the world economy. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56d45c17e4b0d38537b1fc9b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-29T14:59:00.513Z\">2.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Meanwhile there are more signs of weakness in the US economy, with the Chicago purchasing managers index coming in lower than expected.</p> <p>The index fell from 55.6 in January to 47.6 in February, compared to forecasts of a figure of 53.

We map out where the pound could go in the event of a \u201cBrexit\u201d, how much of a rebound is likely with a vote to \u201cRemain\u201d, and the potential for further currency weakness between now and June. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>What happens to EUR/GBP if the UK votes to stay in the European Union?</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We think that EUR/GBP should revert to the 0.73 level, near which it spent most of last year. In our view, the largest part of the weakness in sterling since November can be attributed to increased concern over the possibility of exit from the EU. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>What happens to EUR/GBP if the UK votes to leave (\u201cBrexit\u201d)?</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We estimate the exchange rate level that would accommodate a sharp correction in the UK\u2019s current account deficit and find that EUR/GBP could go to parity. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>What probabilities do we assign to each outcome?</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We assign a 60% probability to the UK staying in the EU and up to 40% probability of a vote to leave, as we have argued previously based on published opinion polls.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Our baseline forecast is 0.73 for the end of 2016</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We think that the result of the referendum will be one of the UK to remain in the EU, thus our forecast is that sterling will eventually strengthen back to 0.73. However, we expect some further weakness of sterling between now and the vote on 23 June. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>But a vote to leave would push EUR/GBP to 1.00</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The price action so far makes it clear that sterling would weaken in the event of an exit vote. We think that the market would re-price to parity \u2013 and to the extent that it could accommodate a shift in the current account by 2.7% of GDP.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <br> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-02-29T09:55:52.339Z\">at 9.55am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-56d41064e4b0bd5a0524d15f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-29T09:36:12.289Z\">9.36am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK mortgage approvals hit two-year high</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Breaking: UK mortgage approvals have hit their highest level in two years.</strong></p> <p>A total of 74,600 new home loans were approved last month, implying that the British housing market remains pretty robust.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DavidRobinson2K/status/704237433530011648\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">UK mortgage rates hit new record low at avg. 2.96% in Jan as mortgage approvals rise to 2 yr high <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bankofengland\">@bankofengland</a>.</p>&mdash; David Robinson (@DavidRobinson2K) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DavidRobinson2K/status/704237433530011648\">February 29, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/moved_average/status/704237617899036672\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/UK?src=hash\">#UK</a> | JAN MORTGAGE APPROVALS: 74.6K V 74.0KE <a href=\"https://t.co/ZC7UwNU8Lu\">pic.twitter.com/ZC7UwNU8Lu</a></p>&mdash; Ioan Smith (@moved_average) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/moved_average/status/704237617899036672\">February 29, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56d407dfe4b0bd5a0524d156\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-29T09:20:53.010Z\">9.20am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"446bd22b00e3e80b24f3434eb94ae7df4dfe7d23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/446bd22b00e3e80b24f3434eb94ae7df4dfe7d23/0_0_3500_2438/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A closed steel foundry in Tangshan, China, today.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"697\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A closed steel foundry in Tangshan, China, today.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kim Kyung-Hoon/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Here\u2019s a jaw-dropping fact -- China is planning to lay off almost two million workers from its coal and steel industry.</strong><br></p> <p>It\u2019s part of Beijing\u2019s attempts to cut capacity in the sector in response to slowing demand, and to rebalance the wider economy towards consumption.</p> <p>Reuters has the details:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Yin Weimin, the minister for human resources and social security, told a news conference on Monday that 1.3 million workers in the coal sector could lose their jobs, plus 500,000 from the steel sector.</p> <p>China\u2019s coal and steel sectors employ about 12 million workers, according to data published by the National Bureau of Statistics.</p> <p>\u201cThis involves the resettlement of a total of 1.8 million workers.

                "bodyText":"Despite continuing worries about the global economy, as well as disappointment that there were no new stimulus measures announced by G20 finance ministers following their meeting in Shanghai, shares held up pretty well on the last day of the month. A rise in crude prices after comments from Saudi Arabia about wanting to limit volatilty helped support markets, as did news that China was acting to try and boost bank lending and reduce borrowing costs. So the final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished 1.08 points or 0.02% higher at 6097.09, up 0.22% on the month Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.19% to 9495.40 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.9% at 4353.55 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.8% to 17,623.07 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.34% at 8461.4 In Greece, the Athens market rose 1.89% to 516.71 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 49 points or 0.3%. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow for, among other things, the February manufacturing PMIs and Barclays results. As European markets close in mixed fashion, Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: London\u2019s FTSE-100 is finishing up the day\u2019s session broadly flat \u2013 we\u2019re still below where we started the year, but sentiment does appear to be on the up. There was disappointment that we didn\u2019t see more clarity out of the G20 meeting at the weekend, so it\u2019s arguably quite surprising that we haven\u2019t seen additional downside pressures as a result. ... Where March takes the market remains to be seen \u2013 the tide does appear to have turned with regard to London\u2019s FTSE-100 now being well beyond bear market territory and critically oil prices appear to be nudging higher, too. That said, the support we\u2019re seeing for gold does suggest that there\u2019s still a lack of confidence when it comes to the medium term view. An unexpected drop in US home sales adds to the weak data already seen. Reuters reports: Contracts to buy previously owned U.S. homes fell to their lowest level in a year in January, likely weighed down by harsh weather and a shortage of properties for sale, a report showed on Monday. The National Association of Realtors said its pending home sales index declined 2.5 percent to 106.0, the lowest level since January of last year. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast contracts rising 0.5 percent last month. Pending home contracts become sales after a month or two, and January\u2019s unexpected drop suggested home resales will likely weaken after rising only 0.4 percent last month. Contracts were up 1.4 percent from a year ago. The rally in stock markets could continue despite today\u2019s uncertain performance, says Chris Beauchamp at IG: February is going out on a dull note, with markets around the globe ending the month in mixed form. Europe and the UK are broadly lower, with an absence of heavyweight economic and corporate news (after all, who wants to publish data on a leap day?) adding to the general lack of direction. The real fireworks come later in the week, with China data galore and then US non-farms on Friday. As a result, some of the month\u2019s gains are being booked with an eye to buffing up returns for February. However, while this rally has been in effect for two weeks now, it doesn\u2019t really show much sign of stopping, especially since we are hitting a strong historical period for stocks. So long as everyone keeps looking for a reason for the next selloff, the default direction for the market is upwards. The performance of crude oil remains the most important element in this market, and with both Brent and WTI holding up well today there is every reason to expect more upside. Too many traders have been caught out trying to short the market over the past week or so, with little sign so far that the bounce has run its course. China will kick off the manufacturing PMI numbers for February tonight, and there could well be a big impact on market sentiment: More downbeat data from the US: The planned merger between the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche B\u00f6rse poses competition issues, according to France\u2019s economy minister Emmanuel Macron. The deal would hit smaller exchanges such as Euronext Paris. Macron told reporters (quotes courtesy Reuters): We will assess the consequences in strategic terms for Paris\u2019 financial centre. He also raised doubts about the impact of any British exit from Europe on the deal: I think we should assess the possible consequences of a Brexit on such a merger. The G20 was right to list a UK exit from the European Union as a potential risk to the global economy in its statement following last week\u2019s meeting of finance ministers in Shanghai, says Capital Economics. But the research group\u2019s chief global economist Julian Jessop said: However, the negative impacts of \u2018Brexit\u2019 are likely to be smaller than many fear, including the short-term costs to the UK itself. More speculatively, there may even be some positives for the world economy \u2013 notably the additional pressure for more growth-friendly policies in the remainder of the EU. In our view... while Brexit would have global ramifications, these should not be overstated, nor need they all be negative. For a start, we doubt the disruption to the UK economy would be as large as many fear. In particular, the uncertainties about the UK\u2019s relations with the rest of Europe could be reduced during the period of negotiations before exit actually takes place. And unlike some potential euro departures, the UK already has its own currency and would be opting to leave rather than being pushed out. The UK would surely also swiftly reassert its commitment to international organisations like NATO and to cooperation with other Western powers in areas of common geopolitical interests. What\u2019s more, even if the UK economy does initially struggle following Brexit, it only accounts for around 4% of world GDP. Indeed, some of the feared costs to the UK \u2013 such as the relocation of international companies to the Continent \u2013 would not have any net impact on the global economy... [And] it is surely inconsistent to argue \u2013 as some do \u2013 that Brexit would both be a disaster for the UK and encourage other member states to quit the EU as well. It is even possible \u2013 though perhaps only wishful thinking at this stage \u2013 that Brexit would be the catalyst for much-needed structural reform in the remainder of the EU, as well as a shift away from austerity. In this (admittedly rosy) scenario, Brexit might yet prove to be a long-term positive both for the UK and for the world economy. Meanwhile there are more signs of weakness in the US economy, with the Chicago purchasing managers index coming in lower than expected. The index fell from 55.6 in January to 47.6 in February, compared to forecasts of a figure of 53. The PMIs for the US as a whole are due on Tuesday (along with the data for Europe and the UK among others). US markets are marginally higher in early trading, helped by a rise in the oil price. Brent crude is currently up 1.9% at $35.78 a barrel on hopes that oil producers could act to stem the slide in prices. That was helped by Saudi Arabia saying in a statement that it \u201cseeks to achieve stability in the oil markets and will always remain in contact with all main producers in an attempt to limit volatility and it welcomes any co-operative action.\u201d Saudia Arabia and Russia agreed a proposal earlier this month to freeze output at January levels, but Iran is keen to increase production now sanctions against the country have been lifted and it has renewed access to export markets. Iran said on Monday it had increased exports sharply over the past month. So despite continuing worries about the global economy, notably China, and no new stimulus measures agreed by G20 finance ministers over the weekend, US markets have made a vaguely positive start, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average currently up 18 points or 0.1%. Directors at Royal Bank of Scotland must be hoping the shares have reached their bottom. Chief executive Ross McEwan and finance director Ewen Stevenson have both spent nearly \u00a3450,000 or 223p a share on buying 200,000 shares, while chairman Howard Davis has snapped up 40,000 at 222p each. So far their faith is not reaping much reward. RBS shares are currently down 0.6p at 226p. With the eurozone falling back into deflation, the odds on the European Central Bank acting at its meeting next week are growing. Time for a quick recap. Britain has been warned that the pound could slide to parity with the euro if the public votes to leave the EU. Analysts at UBS predicted that sterling would lose around 20% of its value after Brexit, but would strengthen if the Remain side win. They warned that the pound has also been hurt by the EU referendum, pushing it down to 78p to the \u20ac1. In our view, the largest part of the weakness in sterling since November can be attributed to increased concern over the possibility of exit from the EU. ... We think that the result of the referendum will be one of the UK to remain in the EU, thus our forecast is that sterling will eventually strengthen back to 73p. However, we expect some further weakness of sterling between now and the vote on 23 June. And if Britain chooses to Leave the EU, the pound would slide to parity against the euro, UBS reckons. Here\u2019s the key forecast: In other news.... China has eased monetary policy, as Beijing tries to protect its economy from a hard landing. The People\u2019s Bank of China cut the Reserve Requirement Ratio on its banks by 50 basis points (0.5 percentage points), to boost liquidity and credit availability. Economists say more will be needed, though, to cushion the economy. The former governor of the Bank of England has claimed that the eurozone is doomed to failure. In a new book, Lord Mervyn King warned that the public will revolt against mass unemployment and perpetual austerity, if policymakers try to impose closer political union to tackle its problems. He says: Monetary union has created a conflict between a centralised elite on the one hand, and the forces of democracy at the national level on the other. King also argued that Greece needs major debt relief, and a cheaper currency, to end its long economic woes. Campaigners have welcomed the move, arguing that Athens creditors must swallow reality Investors are expecting more stimulus measures from the European Central Bank, after the euro ares slipped back into deflation. Prices fell by 0.2% annually this month, the first negative move since last September. Back in the UK, Amazon has sent shivers through the supermarket sector through a new deal with Morrisons. Under the tie-up, the web giant will sell hundreds of Morrison\u2019s food products to its Amazon Prime customers. This is a fillip for Morrisons, helping the struggling group to sell more items across the UK. Its shares are up 4% so far today. But it\u2019s a blow to Ocado; shares in the online supermarket chain have slumped by 9% as the City sees Amazon eating its market share. And Tesco is also being hit - its shares have lost 2.6% today. John Ibbotson of the retail consultants, Retail Vision, says Amazon could be a serious threat to the major markets: It\u2019s now game on for the rest of the Big Four, who suddenly don\u2019t look so big after all. Tesco could soon be about to find out what it\u2019s like to be David rather than Goliath.\u201dThe problem for the Big Four is that if you pay \u00a379 a year for Amazon Prime, you get the delivery free. Amazon seems content to deliver at a loss indefinitely. Gerard Lyons, chief economic advisor to London mayor (and Brexit campaigner) Boris Johnson, is tweeting about the Chinese RRR cut too. He believes it should help the economy, but also warns it could intensify talk of a currency war (the yuan hit a three-week low when the news was announced) Philip Uglow, chief economist at MNI Indicators, suggests China was right to cut the reserve requirements on its banks today, given its weakening economy. He says: \u201cGiven the continued slowdown in the Chinese economy, it was not too surprising to see the central bank step in once again and loosen policy. The reserve requirement still remains at a relatively high level and there is plenty of room for more easing if needed. Our own survey data showed a significant weakening in February, with the MNI China Business Sentiment Indicator dipping below the all-important 50 mark. The Westpac MNI China Consumer Sentiment Indicator also turned lower in February, clouding the outlook for spending over the coming months.\u201d Britain\u2019s smaller City banks and investment companies are being spared new European rules on bonuses, designed to avoid excessive risk-taking. The UK\u2019s financial regulators have just announced that the rules, which restrict bonuses to 100% of base salary, will only be imposed on big banks and financial firms who are \u201csystemically important\u201d. In a statement, the Bank of England argues that a \u2018blanket ban\u2019 on bonuses would be counter-productive, by pushing up basic pay. Since the introduction of the bonus cap, a number of firms have markedly increased fixed pay as a percentage of total pay, whilst total pay remained stable during the same period. The PRA and FCA believe that the shift to fixed remuneration makes it more difficult for firms to adjust variable remuneration to reflect their financial health, and limits deferral arrangements that put remuneration at risk should financial or conduct risks subsequently come to light. City AM has a good early take: Smaller UK banks and investment firms will not have to abide by EU bonus cap rules \u2013 FCA and PRA And Juliet Samuel of the Wall Street Journal tweets: Money is continuing to pour into Eurozone government debt this morning. This is driving down the interest rate, or yield, on safe-haven bonds. German 10-year bunds have hit a yield of just 0.12%, a 10-month low, meaning investors are accepting virtually no return on their money. It\u2019s another sign of pessimism in the markets, with investors primarily worried about keeping their money safe rather than growing it. Debt campaigners have welcomed Mervyn King\u2019s warning that a \u201csignificant proportion\u201d of Greece\u2019s debts must be written off. But Tim Jones, economist at the Jubilee Debt Campaign, also warns that the current proposals for debt relief fall short: \u201cLord King\u2019s comments are yet another acknowledgment that Greece needs substantial debt cancellation, both for its own recovery, and the wider European economy. Yet even if implemented, the current discussions on debt relief for Greece would not reduce payments for at least 15 years, and would leave them 10 times higher than Germany was paying after it had substantial debt cancellation in 1953.\u201d It takes more than a global market rout to alarm Warren Buffett. The billionaire US investor is sounding remarkably relaxed this morning, as he appears on CNBC. Buffett has revealed that his Berkshire Hathaway fund has been buying shares in 2016, despite the heavy falls on some markets. According to the 85-year old, \u201cnot much\u201d happened in the markets recently. He\u2019s also expecting the \u201cpositive effects of low oil prices\u201d to help the world economy in the months ahead. \u201cNot much\u201d is an interesting way of summing up the recent market moves. So far this year, the Nasdaq has lost 7.8% of its value while the Dow Jones Industrial average is off 5%. Across the globe, the German DAX has lost 12% and Japan\u2019s Nikkei has shed almost 16%. But Buffett made his name, and his fortune, by buying and holding stocks, so he knows what he\u2019s doing..... Today\u2019s surprise cut in China\u2019s Reserve Requirement Ratio will help stabilise the Chinese financial system, says Duncan Innes-Ker of the Economist Intelligence Unit. But it isn\u2019t enough on its own, he adds: \u201cThe latest cut in the RRR shows the central bank straining to maintain loose monetary conditions in a difficult economic climate. The move will partly offset the effects of capital outflows from China and the provisioning requirements that are forcing banks to lock up more funds as non-performing loans climb. However, the surge in loans in January highlighted concerns that bank lending may be spiralling out of control. Ultimately, China\u2019s economy cannot grow on credit alone. It needs further reforms to unlock productivity growth.\u201d Nordea analyst Aurelija Augulyte reckons China has the capacity to do more, given it still holds over $3trn of foreign exchange reserves: Today\u2019s in deflation figures also show that the ECB\u2019s existing stimulus programme hasn\u2019t actually worked yet. The ECB is buying \u20ac60bn of assets each month, widening its balance sheet, but having little obvious impact on the consumer prices index (CPI) The eurozone\u2019s lurch back into deflation means Mario Draghi is certain to announce new measures to stimulate the European economy in two week\u2019s time. So argues Teunis Brosens of ING, who writes: The weakening of core inflation shows the real and present danger that cheap oil will cause low inflation to become ingrained in Eurozone price and wage dynamics. This is especially bad for debt-laden households, businesses and governments in Southern Europe, which will have little scope to \u201cinflate away\u201d their debt burden by increasing nominal wages. Today\u2019s weak core inflation gives doves the upper hand at next week\u2019s ECB-meeting and therefore pretty much seals the deal on additional monetary easing. In another alarming sign, the eurozone has slumped back into deflation for the first time in five months. Prices across the single currency region fell by 0.2% in February, according to data just released by Eurostat. That\u2019s worse than expected, and is the first negative inflation reading since September. Energy prices were the main factor, but price pressures in other areas of the economy were also weak. Core inflation, which strips out volatile elements such as food and fuel, dropped to just 0.7% from 1% in January. It raises the pressure on the European Central Bank to ease monetary policy again at its March meeting. The Chinese central bank says it cut the RRR rate, to guarantee \u201cample liquidity\u201d in the financial sector, and to encourage \u201cappropriate growth\u201d in the credit market. The 50bp cut lowers the Reserve Requirement Ratio to 17%, meaning banks need to hold fewer assets in reserve and can offer cheaper credit. A lower RRR will give Chinese banks the leeway to lower borrowing costs, and to make more money available to domestic companies and borrowers. Breaking news from China! The People\u2019s Bank of China has just eased monetary policy, by cutting the RRR - or Reserve Rate Requirement. Swiss bank UBS has just piled into the Brexit debate, saying there is a 40% chance that Britain will vote to leave the EU in June. In a new report, UBS predicts that sterling would be hit hard if Britain left the EU. It estimates that the pound would hit parity with the euro, which would help UK exporters but make trips to the continent much pricier. Currently, sterling is trading around \u20ac1.27, meaning one euro is worth roughly 78p. UBS reckons it will weaken to around 84p by June, and could then either sharply recover, or weaken, depending on the result. That\u2019s an interesting call from UBS. Other analysts have predicted that the euro would also be hit by Brexit - as it would raise new fears over the future of the eurozone. Here\u2019s a flavour of UBS\u2019s report: A date for referendum is set and the pound is getting pounded The United Kingdom reached an agreement with the European Union and the UK announced that the referendum vote will take place on 23 June 2016 (see \u201cBrexit: An ever closer referendum\u201d). We map out where the pound could go in the event of a \u201cBrexit\u201d, how much of a rebound is likely with a vote to \u201cRemain\u201d, and the potential for further currency weakness between now and June. What happens to EUR/GBP if the UK votes to stay in the European Union? We think that EUR/GBP should revert to the 0.73 level, near which it spent most of last year. In our view, the largest part of the weakness in sterling since November can be attributed to increased concern over the possibility of exit from the EU. What happens to EUR/GBP if the UK votes to leave (\u201cBrexit\u201d)? We estimate the exchange rate level that would accommodate a sharp correction in the UK\u2019s current account deficit and find that EUR/GBP could go to parity. What probabilities do we assign to each outcome? We assign a 60% probability to the UK staying in the EU and up to 40% probability of a vote to leave, as we have argued previously based on published opinion polls. Our baseline forecast is 0.73 for the end of 2016 We think that the result of the referendum will be one of the UK to remain in the EU, thus our forecast is that sterling will eventually strengthen back to 0.73. However, we expect some further weakness of sterling between now and the vote on 23 June. But a vote to leave would push EUR/GBP to 1.00 The price action so far makes it clear that sterling would weaken in the event of an exit vote. We think that the market would re-price to parity \u2013 and to the extent that it could accommodate a shift in the current account by 2.7% of GDP. Breaking: UK mortgage approvals have hit their highest level in two years. A total of 74,600 new home loans were approved last month, implying that the British housing market remains pretty robust. Here\u2019s a jaw-dropping fact -- China is planning to lay off almost two million workers from its coal and steel industry. It\u2019s part of Beijing\u2019s attempts to cut capacity in the sector in response to slowing demand, and to rebalance the wider economy towards consumption. Reuters has the details: Yin Weimin, the minister for human resources and social security, told a news conference on Monday that 1.3 million workers in the coal sector could lose their jobs, plus 500,000 from the steel sector. China\u2019s coal and steel sectors employ about 12 million workers, according to data published by the National Bureau of Statistics. \u201cThis involves the resettlement of a total of 1.8 million workers. This task will be very difficult, but we are still very confident,\u201d Yin said.... European stock markets have opened lower, amid disappointment that the world\u2019s top finance ministers didn\u2019t announce any concrete measures at their meeting last week. In London, the FTSE 100 has shed 38 points, or 0.6%, to 6057 points. The French and German markets are down around 0.9%, following moderate losses in Asia overnight which clocked 1% off Japan\u2019s Nikkei. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, sums up the mood: Markets are kicking off the last trading day of February on a rather downbeat note with the weekend\u2019s G20 meeting of finance ministers in Shanghai almost appearing to have muddied the waters, rather than provided any clarity. Policymakers appear to be in agreement that they need to act in a coordinated manner, but given the reactions we\u2019ve seen so far, that certainly doesn\u2019t appear to be the case. The G20 meeting ended with a communique which warned that the global recovery was \u201cuneven\u201d and failing to deliver \u201cstrong, sustainable and balanced growth\u201d. But in terms of action, it only committed to \u201cfurther enhancing the structural reform agenda\u201d They also warned against Britain leaving the European Union. But as the Guardian reported yesterday, that was added on the insistence of the UK government..... Mervyn King also warns that Greece needs debt relief and a cheaper currency: As he puts it: It is evident, as it has been for a very long while, that the only way forward for Greece is to default on (or be forgiven) a substantial proportion of its debt burden and to devalue its currency so that exports and the substitution of domestic products for imports can compensate for the depressing effects of the fiscal contraction imposed to date. Athens was promised some debt relief as part of its third bailout, agreed last summer. But those talks are on ice right now, as negotiations with its lenders over implementation of the package continue to grind slowly onwards. The Chinese stock market has closed at its lowest level in a month, as fears over the global economy dogged trading floors again. At one stage, the Shanghai Composite was heading for a 15-month low, before finishing down 2.8%. Ray Attrill of National Australia Bank blamed the lack of firm action at last weekend\u2019s G20 meeting: He told Bloomberg: [Finance ministers delivered an]....admission of downside growth risks but no tangible commitments to fiscal policy action in particular to bolster growth in the short term\u201d As a devoted Aston Villa fan, Lord Mervyn King must have relegation on the brain right now. In his new book, the BoE governor suggests that the eurozone missed a trick in 2012 by now allowing struggling eurozone members to be \u201ctemporarily\u201d shunted down to a lower tier. Then they could have won promotion again once they had established closer convergence with their stronger neighbours. Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble apparently proposed this to Greece last summer -- but the idea was rejected. The big fear (as many football fans can attest), is that once you\u2019re relegated, there\u2019s no guarantee of getting back. And \u2018relegation\u2019 could also encourage traders to force weaker members out of the euro. Duncan Weldon, head of research at Resolution Group, agrees: Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, the Telegraph\u2019s international business editor, reckons King\u2019s intervention is very significant. Otmar Issing was Germany\u2019s representative on the European Central Bank\u2019s governing council, and thus an influential voice . Lord King also suggests that Germany, rather than Greece, might pull the trigger on the eurozone. He writes: Germany faces a terrible choice. Should it support the weaker brethren in the euro area at great and unending cost to its taxpayers, or should it call a halt to the project of monetary union across the whole of Europe? The attempt to find a middle course is not working. One day, German voters may rebel against the losses imposed on them by the need to support their weaker brethren, and undoubtedly the easiest way to divide the euro area would be for Germany itself to exit. Mervyn King, the former governor of the Bank of England, has fired a fierce broadside at the eurozone - claiming the single currency block may be doomed. In a new book, the man who steered Britain\u2019s central bank through (and into) the financial crisis warned that the tensions within eurozone - and the huge debts piled up by struggling members such as Greece - can never be fully resolved. Crucially, King also argues that any moves to harden up the single currency could also backfire. Closer political union (which would make it easier to forgive Greece\u2019s debts) will actually inflame popular anger against the eurozone project. As he puts it: \u201cMonetary union has created a conflict between a centralised elite on the one hand, and the forces of democracy at the national level on the other. This is extraordinarily dangerous.\u201d Breaking up the 18-member strong union may be the only way to allow Europe\u2019s struggling Southern states to regain competitiveness. Here\u2019s more from King, via the Daily Telegraph (who have the serialisation rights): The more likely cause of a break- up of the euro area is that voters in the south will tire of the grinding and relentless burden of mass unemployment and the emigration of talented young people. The counter-argument \u2013 that exit from the euro area would lead to chaos, falls in living standards and continuing uncertainty about the survival of the currency union \u2013 has real weight. If the members of the euro decide to hang together, the burden of servicing external debts may become too great to remain consistent with political stability. But if the alternative is crushing austerity, continuing mass unemployment, and no end in sight to the burden of debt, then leaving the euro area may be the only way to plot a route back to economic growth and full employment. The long-term benefits outweigh the short-term costs. Outsiders cannot make that choice, but they can encourage Germany, and the rest of the euro area, to face up to it. If the members of the euro decide to hang together, the burden of servicing external debts may become too great to remain consistent with political stability. As John Maynard Keynes wrote in 1922, \u201cIt is foolish\u2026 to suppose that any means exist by which one modern nation can exact from another an annual tribute continuing over many years.\u201d Here\u2019s the full piece: Daily Telegraph: Lord Mervyn King: \u2018Forgive them their debts\u2019 is not the answer Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It may be February 29th, but investors aren\u2019t exactly leaping for joy this morning. Asian markets are falling, and European bourses are likely to follow suit. Several issues dominate the trading floors right now, including: The state of the global economy, with China\u2019s weaknesses threatening a wider slowdown. Angst over the US elections. Donald Trump\u2019s success at the Republican caucuses is alarming many observers, while Wall Street fears that Bernie Sanders\u2019 has put inequality firmly in the spotlight. The eurozone: The refugee crisis is piling new stress on the region, with inflation still worryingly weak The Brexit question, with polls suggesting the EU referendum on June 23 could be close. Worries about negative interest rates, and fears that central bankers are running out of ammo. But despite these fears, finance ministers didn\u2019t agree any new measures at their G20 meeting last weekend. And for some investors, that\u2019s a decent reason to keep out of the markets...or cut their holdings. Coming up this morning... There\u2019s not much on the agenda, but we do get fresh eurozone inflation data at 10am GMT. That is expected to show a further weakening in price pressures, with the consumer prices index tipped to drop to 0% from 0.3% in January. And at 9.30, the latest UK consumer credit and mortgage lending figure are out.",
