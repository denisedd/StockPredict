Crude prices were on the slide once more, given there was no sign of any deal between Opec and the likes of Russia to cut production and stem the supply glut. On top of that, sentiment was hit by major losses at BP and a 48% drop in profits at Exxon Mobil.</p> <p>So Brent crude fell as much as 5% before recovering some ground - and helping markets off their worst levels at the same time. It is currently down 2.8% at $33.26 a barrel. West Texas, which slipped below $30 at one point, is now down 1% at $30.6 a barrel.</p> <p>Adding to the downbeat mood came reports that China was imposing new controls to help control outflows of capital from the country, in particular a cap on people buying insurance from overseas.</p> <p>So despite the marginal recovery, the final scores showed some hefty falls:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 fell 138.09 points or 2.2% to 5922.01</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.8% to 9581.04</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac closed down 2.47% at 4283.99</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 3.05% to 17,922.45</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 2.96% at 8528.7</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.84% to 552.5</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 271 points or 1.65%.</p> <p><em>On that gloomy note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow for a busy day of service sector surveys around the globe.</em></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56b0d47de4b048ec83a765e9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-02T16:16:11.050Z\">4.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As European markets head towards the close nursing heavy losses again Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The end of January, when markets raced higher, seems such a long time ago. Major indices are rapidly shedding the gains they made in the second half of January, as a cocktail of worries returns. The first of these is the oil price, which has rediscovered its old habit of diving like a stone, helped in no small part by the absence of any rumours about another OPEC meeting.</p> <p>The session started with oil firms in the red, as BP\u2019s results sent the shares into a tail spin, but the company has been joined at the bottom of the index by miners and insurers. The former are down as economic growth concerns take centre stage, with this concern not helped by warnings from Fed policymakers, while the latter are in retreat thanks to China, which appears to be coming up with new and creative ways to try to stem capital flight. The reaction is probably overdone where the likes of Prudential are concerned, but it is hard to remain positive when the tentative rally of the past two weeks is slipping from your grasp.</p> <p>Adding to concerns was ExxonMobil, which is down 3% as the earnings beat fades amidst the stark reality of a remarkable slump in profits. As crude prices slide once more, thanks to markets suddenly waking up and remembering the massive oversupply story, it looks like this sector will be the trailblazer for any renewed slump in stock markets.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56b0cd3ee4b054341b6d0f04\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-02T15:41:42.361Z\">3.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Back in the UK, and one of the biggest fallers apart from commodity companies is Prudential.</strong></p> <p>The insurance group is down nearly 8% on reports that China might be taking steps to stem outflows of capital. In particular Bloomberg has said the country could impose restrictions on people buying insurance products abroad, with a $5,000 cap per transaction to be imposed from 4 February. Analyst David Morrison at Spread Co said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Amid today\u2019s unsettling stock market action, Prudential stands out as one of the big losers. But this has nothing to do with the announcement that Anne Richards will be joining the Pru from Aberdeen Asset Management later this year.</p> <p>Instead it comes on the back of China\u2019s currency regulator imposing restrictions on its citizens buying overseas insurance products. This isn\u2019t just bad news for the Pru or the insurance sector in general. It raises fears that the Chinese authorities may take further action to limit capital controls. This is a particular worry as we head towards the extended Chinese New Year holiday break.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-02-02T15:42:08.581Z\">at 3.42pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-56b0c8ade4b048ec83a765b2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-02T15:19:25.110Z\">3.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are the Dow movers:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8933fcf4c624135f794f9ec398e4a6b7d066294b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8933fcf4c624135f794f9ec398e4a6b7d066294b/0_0_1133_919/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dow under pressure\" width=\"1000\" height=\"811\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dow under pressure</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56b0c6e6e4b048ec83a765ab\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-02T15:12:24.955Z\">3.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>A sliding crude price and the lack of any major data to give direction have combined to send markets lower, </strong>says financial analyst Connor Campbell of Spreadex:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Things turned ugly this afternoon, with a woeful performance from Brent Crude and a particularly weak open from the US indices seeing the markets double down on the day\u2019s losses.</p> <p>Now down around 4.5% and threatening to fall below $32 per barrel, the resumption of Brent Crude\u2019s decline has been the main catalyst for the day\u2019s dismal trading. And as ever, when the commodities begin to fall the FTSE loses its way in pretty dramatic fashion, the UK index dropping a whopping 150 points as the day went on. The main casualty was BP; plunging by nearly 10% the oil has lost wave upon wave of investors this Tuesday following the revelation of its worst annual losses for 20 years.</p> <p>Whilst the DAX was prevented from posting the kind of absurd losses it is known for thanks to a record low German unemployment rate figure, the CAC was right up there with its UK peer this afternoon, falling around 2.6% as the day wore on. Over in the US, meanwhile, the Dow Jones quickly sank by 250-ish points after the bell rang on Wall Street, exactly what the markets didn\u2019t need following such an awful morning in Europe.</p> <p>The lack of truly significant data likely exacerbated today\u2019s losses, investors left with little other option but to focus on the same fears that have caused the markets to start 2016 in such dire fashion. Tomorrow, then, maybe slightly better, with a cavalcade of services figures around the globe set to distract the markets (however briefly or successfully is unclear) from their current malaise.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56b0bfcce4b048ec83a7658e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-02T14:45:44.300Z\">2.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street drops nearly 250 points, with US crude below $30</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Alphabet success comes as the overall market has moved sharply lower.</p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 241 points or 1.46%, as Wall Street follows other markets lower.

                "bodyText":"The optimism seen at the end of last week seems to have disappeared as quickly as it came. Crude prices were on the slide once more, given there was no sign of any deal between Opec and the likes of Russia to cut production and stem the supply glut. On top of that, sentiment was hit by major losses at BP and a 48% drop in profits at Exxon Mobil. So Brent crude fell as much as 5% before recovering some ground - and helping markets off their worst levels at the same time. It is currently down 2.8% at $33.26 a barrel. West Texas, which slipped below $30 at one point, is now down 1% at $30.6 a barrel. Adding to the downbeat mood came reports that China was imposing new controls to help control outflows of capital from the country, in particular a cap on people buying insurance from overseas. So despite the marginal recovery, the final scores showed some hefty falls: The FTSE 100 fell 138.09 points or 2.2% to 5922.01 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.8% to 9581.04 France\u2019s Cac closed down 2.47% at 4283.99 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 3.05% to 17,922.45 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 2.96% at 8528.7 In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.84% to 552.5 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 271 points or 1.65%. On that gloomy note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow for a busy day of service sector surveys around the globe. As European markets head towards the close nursing heavy losses again Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said: The end of January, when markets raced higher, seems such a long time ago. Major indices are rapidly shedding the gains they made in the second half of January, as a cocktail of worries returns. The first of these is the oil price, which has rediscovered its old habit of diving like a stone, helped in no small part by the absence of any rumours about another OPEC meeting. The session started with oil firms in the red, as BP\u2019s results sent the shares into a tail spin, but the company has been joined at the bottom of the index by miners and insurers. The former are down as economic growth concerns take centre stage, with this concern not helped by warnings from Fed policymakers, while the latter are in retreat thanks to China, which appears to be coming up with new and creative ways to try to stem capital flight. The reaction is probably overdone where the likes of Prudential are concerned, but it is hard to remain positive when the tentative rally of the past two weeks is slipping from your grasp. Adding to concerns was ExxonMobil, which is down 3% as the earnings beat fades amidst the stark reality of a remarkable slump in profits. As crude prices slide once more, thanks to markets suddenly waking up and remembering the massive oversupply story, it looks like this sector will be the trailblazer for any renewed slump in stock markets. Back in the UK, and one of the biggest fallers apart from commodity companies is Prudential. The insurance group is down nearly 8% on reports that China might be taking steps to stem outflows of capital. In particular Bloomberg has said the country could impose restrictions on people buying insurance products abroad, with a $5,000 cap per transaction to be imposed from 4 February. Analyst David Morrison at Spread Co said: Amid today\u2019s unsettling stock market action, Prudential stands out as one of the big losers. But this has nothing to do with the announcement that Anne Richards will be joining the Pru from Aberdeen Asset Management later this year. Instead it comes on the back of China\u2019s currency regulator imposing restrictions on its citizens buying overseas insurance products. This isn\u2019t just bad news for the Pru or the insurance sector in general. It raises fears that the Chinese authorities may take further action to limit capital controls. This is a particular worry as we head towards the extended Chinese New Year holiday break. Here are the Dow movers: A sliding crude price and the lack of any major data to give direction have combined to send markets lower, says financial analyst Connor Campbell of Spreadex: Things turned ugly this afternoon, with a woeful performance from Brent Crude and a particularly weak open from the US indices seeing the markets double down on the day\u2019s losses. Now down around 4.5% and threatening to fall below $32 per barrel, the resumption of Brent Crude\u2019s decline has been the main catalyst for the day\u2019s dismal trading. And as ever, when the commodities begin to fall the FTSE loses its way in pretty dramatic fashion, the UK index dropping a whopping 150 points as the day went on. The main casualty was BP; plunging by nearly 10% the oil has lost wave upon wave of investors this Tuesday following the revelation of its worst annual losses for 20 years. Whilst the DAX was prevented from posting the kind of absurd losses it is known for thanks to a record low German unemployment rate figure, the CAC was right up there with its UK peer this afternoon, falling around 2.6% as the day wore on. Over in the US, meanwhile, the Dow Jones quickly sank by 250-ish points after the bell rang on Wall Street, exactly what the markets didn\u2019t need following such an awful morning in Europe. The lack of truly significant data likely exacerbated today\u2019s losses, investors left with little other option but to focus on the same fears that have caused the markets to start 2016 in such dire fashion. Tomorrow, then, maybe slightly better, with a cavalcade of services figures around the globe set to distract the markets (however briefly or successfully is unclear) from their current malaise. The Alphabet success comes as the overall market has moved sharply lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 241 points or 1.46%, as Wall Street follows other markets lower. Fears of a global slowdown in the wake of weak industrial data this week have unnerved investors once more, while oil continues to slide as hopes fade of a deal between Opec and other oil countries - Russia in particular - to cut production. Brent crude is down 5% at $32.5 while West Texas has slipped below $30 a barrel. Elsewhere the S&amp;P is down 1.4% while the falls on European markets are accelerating. The FTSE 100 is now down 154 points or 2.5% while Germany\u2019s Dax is down 1.35% and France\u2019s Cac has lost 2.1%. Alphabet shares have jumped more than 4% at the open, valuing it at around $545bn. In contrast Apple is down almost 1% to give it a market capitalisation of around $530bn. Wall Street has opened and Alphabet has indeed overtaken Apple to become the world\u2019s largest listed company. UK energy group British Gas has announced it will axe 500 jobs as part of a cost cutting programme by its parent company Centrica. It did not say where or when the cuts would be made, according to Reuters which quotes British Gas chief executive Mark Hodges as saying: British Gas is well positioned to grow but we must ensure that our costs allow us to be competitive for our customers. Back with big oil, and Exxon Mobil has unveiled a 48% drop in its fourth quarter profit to $2.78bn and said it would cut spending this year by a quarter. That follows news that BP has made its biggest ever loss and plans 7,000 job cuts. The sell-off in stock markets is continuing, with the FTSE 100 now down 116 points or 1.9%. BP, now down 8.4%, has contributed around 21 points to the fall. Oil and mining companies as a whole have knocked some 50 points off the index. In Europe Germany\u2019s Dax is down 1.3% and France\u2019s Cac is 2% lower. At the moment, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are showing a 128 point loss on the US index when Wall Street opens. Whether that has an impact on Google - sorry Alphabet - overtaking Apple as the world\u2019s most valuable listed company remains to be seen. Worried about China? Maybe you\u2019re not worried enough. Royal Bank of Scotland has issued an online research note today, explaining how China\u2019s economy could hit trouble. Senior Economist Marcus Wright fears that China\u2019s economy has slowed more quickly than official data shows, and is struggling to break its addiction to debt (which helped fuel growth in recent years) This means Beijing is struggling to rebalance the economy in the face of a credit boom, triggering recent market turbulence and fears of a disorderly yuan devaluation. Wright predicts that a \u201chard landing\u201d is a serious risk for China, with consequences for countries worldwide. He says: China\u2019s slowdown is already impacting the global economy through the channels of growth, trade, inflation, interest rate expectation and financial linkages. There is more to come on all these fronts. The full presentation is online here. RBS have helpfully tweeted some of the key charts: Our energy editor Terry Macalister has established that BP is actually planning to cut 7,000 more jobs, more than first thought, after reporting an an annual loss of $6.5bn this morning. Terry also reports that CEO Bob Dudley thinks investors are \u201coverreacting\u201d by sending its shares down by 9% so far today.... Over in Greece, the negotiations between Athens and its creditors over its bailout programme have taken a curious twist, as talks resume today. The EU side has apparently hinted that Greece might get an easier ride, if it does a better job processing the refugees arriving on its shores from the Middle East. The Greek newspaper Kathimerini explains: Greek authorities are scrambling to set up screening centers for migrants and refugees as soon as possible as German officials have made it clear to Athens that more efficient management of the refugee crisis could help along creditors\u2019 review of the country\u2019s third bailout, Kathimerini understands. According to sources, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has indicated to Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras that success in tackling the migration crisis could boost the country\u2019s prospects for progress with the review, which Athens hopes could ease the way for debt talks. Combined with a burgeoning debate about Greece\u2019s future in the passport-free Schengen area, the message from Berlin is said to have encouraged action by Greek officials. Blackmail? Bribery? Or an attempt to fix two problems in one go? Currently, some refugees trying to move west from Greece are stranded at the border with Macedonia, due to anti-austerity protests held by farmers. BP\u2019s share price continues to wilt as analysts digest today\u2019s slump in profits/record loss (depending what measure you pick). It is currently down 8.8%, which by my reckoning wipes \u00a35.8bn off its market capitalisation. BP boss Bob Dudley has also warned that other oil companies will follow his lead and slash jobs, in response to the slide in the crude price. ITV\u2019s Joel Hills has the details: The oil sector is churning out the rumours today, as the crude price drops. The latest one is that member of the OPEC cartel are still resisting an emergency meeting where a production cut could be hammered out. That\u2019s despite the pain being suffered across the oil-producing countries, with Saudi facing serious austerity, Nigeria seeking help from the World Bank, and Russia apparently considering privatising various state assets. BP is briefing journalists in London now, after reporting its biggest annual loss in at least 20 years. The oil giant is predicting a volatile 2016, and warning that the cost of the Deepwater Horizon spill disaster is still rising. The oil is continuing to weaken, mirroring the selloff in the equity markets. Brent crude is now off 3.7% or $1.20 at $32.97 per barrel, hit by persistent fears of economic slowdown and oversupply in the oil market. And the Russian rouble is falling in sympathy, as cheaper oil brings more trouble for struggling petro-exporters. Tim Condon, head of Asia research at ING, fears that the oil sector is locked in a vicious downward spiral with factories. Oil companies cut spending last year after crude prices fell sharply, which meant they ordered less from manufacturers. That hit factory growth, and also meant they needed less energy. That hit demand for oil, helping to push stockpiles up and prices down. Or as Condon put it to clients: \u201cManufacturing is (the) leading edge of a global growth slowdown.\u201d \u201cWe think the 50% crash in global oil prices in the second half of 2014 caused the manufacturing slump by crushing commodity producers\u2019 spending. However, we also think that in 2015 weaker manufacturing, especially in China, began to drive down oil prices. The negative feedback loop is causing severe strains.\u201d Mario Draghi and colleagues at the European Central Bank will be relieved that the eurozone jobless rate fell last month, as they ponder whether to take new stimulus measures next month. Alex Lydall, senior sales trader at Foenix Partners, says investors expect action in March. Traders and investors assumed from the latest ECB press conference that further cuts in the deposit rate and perhaps an extension and expansion of Quantitative Easing are potentially on the cards. Today\u2019s selloff has wiped out almost all the spike last Friday, after the Bank of Japan took the dramatic step of introducing negative interest rates. Central bank stimulus packages don\u2019t have the impact they used to, as investors worry that the global economy is heading remorselessly downwards. Brenda Kelly of London Capital Group explains: It would seem that central bank impact is really beginning to lose its charm and the days of buying the dip on the back of stimulus expectations is no longer the winning strategy it once was. We\u2019re back to the same old story today with materials and energy providing a drag on the FTSE as BP delivered what was frankly a terrible set of results \u2013 its worst loss in 20 years. Breaking: The Eurozone unemployment rate has hit its lowest level since September 2011. Eurostat is reporting that the region\u2019s jobless rate dipped in December to 10.4%, from 10.5%. Across the wider EU, the jobless rate remained at 9.0%. Although the fall is encouraging, it still leaves 21.944 million men and women out of work in the 28 members of the EU, including 16.750m in the euro area. There were, as usual, stark difference across Europe too. Among the Member States, the lowest unemployment rates in December 2015 were recorded in the Czech Republic and Germany (both 4.5%), Malta and the United Kingdom (both 5.1%, October data for the UK). The highest unemployment rates were observed in Greece (24.5% in October 2015) and Spain (20.8%). More gloom. Growth in Britain\u2019s building sector has hit a nine-month low, according to new figures from data firm Markit. Markit\u2019s UK construction PMI has fallen to 55.0 in January, from 57.8 in December. That suggests growth slowed to its lowest rate since April 2015. The survey found that:\uf0a7 UK construction sector experiences growth slowdown at the start of 2016 Job creation eases to its slowest for almost two-and-a-half years Construction firms report lowest business confidence since December 2014 Worries about global growth and weak, falling oil prices are back under the spotlight today, warns Arnaud Masset, market analyst at Swissquote Bank. And that\u2019s why the European markets are sliding again. The FTSE 100 is now down 85 points, and being dragged lower by oil companies, banks and miners: Investors are also gloomy after yesterday\u2019s factory data. It showed the US manufacturing sector was not as strong as hoped, while China continued to weaken. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale explains: Yesterday afternoon\u2019s US economic data was pretty consistently below expectations, reinforcing the clear signs that global manufacturing is down in the dumps. BP\u2019s poor results are also a reminder of the havoc playing out in the oil sector, as hopes of a deal between Russia and Saudi Arabia to cut production dwindle. FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga says: Tepid manufacturing data from China, the world\u2019s largest energy consumer, renewed fears that demand may be dwindling. These anxieties added to the rapidly fading expectations around OPEC cooperating with Russia to curb production, while ongoing concerns over the excessive oversupply of oil in the markets continued to haunt investors. BP\u2019s CEO, Bob Dudley, has warned that the oil price will remain volatile until the second half of 2016. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, he predicted spikes - up and down - in the next few months as Iran returns to the oil market. Just in: Germany\u2019s unemployment rate has hit a new record low of just 6.2%. Destatis, the stats body, reports that the German jobless total fell by 20,000 in January, compared to expectations of an 8,000 decline. Another difficult morning is unfolding on the European stock markets. In London, the FTSE 100 has shed 1.3%, or 82 points, to 5977. BP is partly to blame - it has knocked 17 points off the Footsie on it own, and also dragged rival Royal Dutch Shell down too (it reports results on Thursday). Mining shares are also down, with BHP Billiton off 4%. Across the channel, Germany\u2019s DAX is down 0.9% and the French CAC is down 1.3% BP\u2019s stonking loss has hit shares across the energy sector: Shares in BP have slumped at the start of trading, after the energy giant reported its worst loss in 20 years. BP shares fell 5.8%, or 21p, to 345p as investors reacted to the news that it lost $6.482bn in 2015, on a pre-tax basis, compared to a profit of \u00a33.780bn in 2014. That, Reuters reports, is the biggest loss in two decades. Oil companies like to report their results in \u201cunderlying replacement cost profit\u201d terms, to strip out the impact of the fluctuating oil price. But even then, BP\u2019s results are worse than expected. It reported a 91% drop in underlying profits in the last three months, to just $196m. It\u2019s bad news for workers - BP is planning to cut an extra 3,000 jobs in its downstream unit by the end of 2017, on top of 4,000 earlier cuts. After weeks of haggling, Sainsbury has finally secured the takeover of Home Retail - owner of catalogue shopping chain Argus. The two sides reached terms overnight of a \u00a31.3bn merger. This is Sainsbury CEO Mike Coupe\u2019s first big deal -- he\u2019s hoping to repel the march of Amazon, and rising pressure from discount grocers. Assuming shareholders back the deal, Sainsbury will soon be installing Argos outlets in its stores. My colleague Sean Farrell has the details of the deal: Britain\u2019s second-biggest supermarket has proposed paying Home Retail shareholders 55p in cash and 0.321 Sainsbury\u2019s shares for each of their shares, valuing Home Retail at \u00a31.1bn. Under the terms of the proposed deal, Home Retail shareholders would also get a further \u00a3200m from the sale of Homebase, Home retail\u2019s DIY and homewares business. Along with a 2.8p per share payment in lieu of a final dividend, the proposed offer values Home Retail at 161.3p a share or about \u00a31.3bn. Most Asian stock markets lost ground today, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei closing 0.64% lower. China bucked the trend, though, jumping over 2%, after the People\u2019s Bank of China pumped more money into the system. Marketwatch explains why: China\u2019s central bank injected 100 billion yuan ($15.2 billion) in short-term loans to money markets, in a move to stave off potential liquidity squeezes ahead of the weeklong Lunar New Year holiday that starts on February 7. This is the first leg of the bank\u2019s usual twice-a-week money-market operations. Overnight, Australia\u2019s central bank left interest rates unchanged at the record low of 2%. But it also warned it could cut soon if the recent financial market turbulence continues. Worries over the strength of the global economy has pushed the gold price up to its highest level since the start of November. Bullion hit $1,130 per ounce in early reading, as investors scurried for safe-havens in the face of recent weak economic data. Fears over China were also rife, after yesterday\u2019s data showed its factory sector shrinking at the fastest rate since 2012. Japan\u2019s move into negative interest rates on Friday has also caused jitters, as traders wonder whether further unconventional monetary policy will be deployed soon. And this uncertainty is making gold more attractive. Reuters explains: With rates close to zero, the \u201conly option is to move either towards zero or negative rates as the Japanese and selected European countries are already doing in a desperate attempt to force banks to lend\u201d, INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir wrote to clients. \u201cWhatever the case, this should be constructive for gold.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling overage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Worries over the global economy continue to weigh on markets today, after yesterday\u2019s disappointing manufacturing surveys from China and the US. The main European markets are expected to dip, extending yesterday\u2019s selloff: On the data front, we find out at 10am whether Europe\u2019s jobs market improved in December. The main eurozone jobless rate is expected to remain at 10.5% , matching the four-year low reached in November. And at 9.30am, we also get the latest survey of the UK construction sector for January. Last week we learned that the building industry contracted in the last quarter of 2015, so analysts will be hoping for signs of recovery. In the City, oil giant BP and online supermarket Ocado are reporting financial results. As feared, BP has suffered from the slump in the oil price. It\u2019s also outlining significant job cuts. And supermarket chain Sainsbury has been hammering out the terms of a takeover for Home Retail, to get control of its Argos shops.",

                "bodyText":"The Labour MP and tax campaigner Margaret Hodge has described as \u201cdisgusting\u201d a plan to give an executive of online retailer Amazon, one of the companies at the centre of an intensifying row over taxes, a directorship at the Department for Work and Pensions. Hodge was responding to the news, first revealed by Sky News, that Amazon\u2019s head of Chinese operations, Doug Gurr, is to become a non-executive director of the DWP. The DWP said it would issue a statement, which was not available at the time of publication. Amazon declined to comment. Hodge said: \u201cIf people are not putting their proper share into the pot, how can government ever justify giving them prestigious positions?\u201d Amazon\u2019s UK business paid just \u00a311.9m in tax in 2014, even though its Luxembourg unit took \u00a35.3bn from internet sales in the UK. Gurr\u2019s arrival at the department will increase fears that largely US-based technology giants such as Amazon are having an increasing influence on government at a time when there is growing public pressure for them to pay more tax in the UK. Hodge also said it was ironic for the DWP, which is trying to place people in employment, to hire an executive from Amazon. \u201cThey are killing off British business and jobs, partly because they\u2019re not paying sufficient tax and so are able to undercut their rivals,\u201d she said. The multinational tax row has intensified since it emerged that Google had agreed to pay \u00a3130m to cover taxes dating back a decade. Although George Osborne heralded the deal as a success, it was soon derided by critics, who calculated that the payment equated to a tax rate of just 3%. The business secretary, Sajid Javid, said he shared the feelings of many people who felt there was a sense of injustice about the Google deal and described the tax settlement as \u201cnot a glorious moment\u201d for the government. Google has enjoyed a close relationship with the government, with key figures going to work for the US company as well as some executives going from the firm to Whitehall. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: \u201cI am disappointed but not surprised, and taxpayers will be further dismayed, to hear about yet another close relationship between the Tory government and a company with potential questions to answer over its tax liabilities. \u201cOn the back of a fortnight of inaction from the government on tax avoidance, this will do nothing to dispel the feeling that when it comes to tax avoidance the Tories don\u2019t have a credible solution, and don\u2019t care about finding any answers. \u201cThat is why I am today calling for the government to be open and honest over any Tory tax deals with big multinationals so that we can start to find a proper solution to the crisis we face over tax avoidance. Especially after the missed opportunity in the EU negotiations to get a deal on transparency by companies across Europe.\u201d Jolyon Maugham, a tax expert and former adviser to the former Labour leader Ed Miliband, said: \u201cIf we hadn\u2019t had such a revolving door between government and Google, perhaps we would not be asking questions about a sweetheart deal. \u201cGovernment is absolutely right to want to bring business expertise into the heart of government, but it needs to do so in a way that avoids obvious conflicts of interest.

                "bodyText":"Apple has come under pressure to scrap its controversial policy of permanently disabling repaired iPhone 6s when software is upgraded, following a global consumer backlash and claims the company could be acting illegally. At least one firm of US lawyers said it hopes to bring a class action against the technology giant on behalf of victims whose \u00a3500 phones have been rendered worthless by an Apple software upgrade. In the UK, a barrister told the Guardian that Apple\u2019s \u201creckless\u201d policy of effectively killing people\u2019s iPhones following the software upgrade could potentially be viewed as an offence under the Criminal Damage Act 1971. The act makes it an offence to intentionally destroy the property of another. The Guardian revealed on Friday how thousands of iPhone 6 users found an iOS software upgrade permanently disabled their phone, which was left displaying an \u201cError 53\u201d code. Nothing could be done to restore it to working order. The Apple iOS 9 software update which it launched last autumn will, in the jargon, \u201cbrick\u201d the handset if it detects that the touch ID fingerprint recognition and/or the home button is not the original. Some victims had had their phones repaired by third-party contractors. Others had simply damaged their handset. In most cases the phone had been working normally for weeks or months before the software upgrade shut down the handset. Apple has described this as a security feature, but some have suggested the policy could be designed to increase revenues by forcing anyone needing a repair to their home button to pay the \u00a3236 the company charges in the UK. People whose phones have been shut down and have complained at Apple stores have been told that nothing can be done and they must buy a new handset. Within hours of publication of the Guardian story, the Seattle-based law firm PCVA called for victims to get in touch, with a view to bringing a class action suit. Consumers have reacted with disbelief and growing anger. \u201cShow me where, in consumer law, the vendor has the right to render inoperable the hardware you just bought,\u201d said one poster on the Guardian\u2019s website. PCVA said it believed Apple\u2019s stance may violate various consumer protection laws in the US, and is offering to represent victims for free. \u201cWe believe Apple may be intentionally forcing users to use their repair services, which cost much more than most third-party repair shops.

Analyst Connor Campbell at Spreadex said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Initially threatening a 300 point plunge when the bell rang on Wall Street the Dow Jones settled into a more solid, if still troublesome, 175 point drop as the open receded into the background. Whether or not the better than expected, and best since December, jobless claims helped (it probably didn\u2019t) is unclear, though at this point in time in the most worthless piece of positive news is likely appreciated by fear-stricken investors. The Dow was probably saved (and this is all relative, remember) by the fact that the blood loss endured by the US banking sector was nowhere near as gory as the scenes over in Europe, Bank of America the worst hit at around a 4% decline.</p> <p>In Europe things were much the same, i.e. not too good at all. The FTSE just about managed to claw its way back to the 5600 mark, arguably thanks to the fact that Brent Crude is now closer to $31 per barrel than it is to $30. The DAX, meanwhile, tucked under a 2% decline around 40 points away from 8900, whilst the CAC climbed down from its 3.7% nadir to post a 2.7% loss, both indices aided by a (minor) reduction in losses form Deutsche Bank and Societe Generale respectively.</p> <p>The big question now is, does today\u2019s horrorshow continue into Friday? Given just how fearful investors appear to be at the moment it is incredibly hard to tell; one thing tomorrow does have going for it, however, is data. Lots and lots of it. Germany, Italy and the Eurozone as a whole reveal their preliminary fourth quarter GDP figures, whilst the US sees retail sales, import prices and the University of Michigan consumer sentiment number. The markets will be hoping (nay, praying) that, with a bit of distraction (like on Wednesday), the week can end on a slightly more positive note.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56bca05ee4b0e04c43d738da\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-11T15:04:41.284Z\">3.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is back on Capitol Hill to discuss the global outlook and monetary policy with the Senate Banking Committee, the second and last day of her testimony to Congress.</p> <p>The hearing has begun and can be viewed <strong><a href=\"http://www.banking.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/hearings?ID=EBDD6E93-DC93-415D-99E1-0CD84FFA04D5\">here.</a></strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56bca29ce4b0d007e4723bc1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-11T15:03:25.495Z\">3.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Elsewhere Morgan Stanley has agree to pay $3.2bn relating to the sale of mortgage-backed bonds before the financial crisis.</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56bc9e8de4b0e04c43d738d7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-11T14:46:04.557Z\">2.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ahead of Yellen\u2019s testimony, some think it is time for a US rate cut:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/D_Blanchflower/status/697791707002220544\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Global demand collapsing stock markets tumbling &amp;

                "bodyText":"That\u2019s an appropriate moment to stop. Back tomorrow, for another day of market drama - plus the latest eurozone growth figures, starting with France at 6.30am GMT. Here\u2019s our latest news story: Better get some sleep :) Goodnight! GW Today\u2019s selloff in Asia, Europe and America have pulled global stocks into bear market territory. Reuters has the details: Stock indexes worldwide stumbled on Thursday on fears over the health of the global economy, with a global equity benchmark index closing the day more than 20 percent below its record high last May, confirming global stocks are in a bear market. MSCI\u2019s all-country world equity index which tracks shares in 45 nations, was last down 4.73 points, or 1.32%, to 353.35. The index hit its lowest level in more than two and a half years and was down 20.18% from an all-time high close of 442.70 on May 21, 2015. As we\u2019ve been covering today, this fall into bear market territory began with hefty losses in Hong Kong. Its stock market fell by 4%, on the first day\u2019s trading since the Lunar New year holiday. The baton then passed to Europe, which fumbled it. Bank shares had a very poor day indeed, on escalating fears that they will struggle to handle an economic slowdown, and lower negative interest rates. In nervous trading, shares slumped and government bonds soared, while oil took a dive and gold rallied. That tee\u2019d up America for its fifth daily fall in a row, as Fed chair Janet Yellen repeated her concerns that financial conditions are deteriorating. Uncertainty over US monetary policy going forward - will rates be hiked, cut, or even go negative? - weighed on shares again. It looks like the S&amp;P 500 has finished at its lowest closing level since April 2014, at 1829 points. Financial shares in the S&amp;P fell by 3%, bringing 2016 losses to roughly 18%, points out our US business editor Dominic Rushe. Here\u2019s the main movers and shakers: The Dow has lost around 4.6% of its value since last Thursday - the last time it posted a daily rise. The index is down 10.1% since the start of this year. This is the fifth day running in which the Dow Jones index has lost ground. Reminder: Tonight\u2019s losses in New York follow another day\u2019s torrid trading in Europe. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has another day to forget, losing 2.4% as investors raced for safe-haven assets such as German bonds, the yen, and gold. The Footsie, which includes the top 100 companies in London, closed at its lowest level in three and a half years. Our friends at the Daily Telegraph have worked out that \u00a380bn has been wiped off the FTSE 100 index this week. And there\u2019s still one day to go.... Phew! America\u2019s stock market has closed for the night, and the main three indices are all in the red. The Dow ended the day down around 251 points, having clawed back from a 400-point loss an hour or so ago. And the Nasdaq wilted in the final moments, surrendering earlier gains to finish down 0.4%. Shares picked up after the WSJ reported that Opec might be prepared to cut oil production. But financial stocks dragged again, with Goldman Sachs down 4.1%, and JP Morgan losing 3.98%. The biggest Dow faller was Boeing, following reports that regulators are investigating the airline maker. The latest research note from French Bank BNP Paribas just landed in my inbox. Here\u2019s their \u2018big picture\u2019 view: Central-bank action looks uncoordinated and we see few signs of calm ahead. We expect no further action from the Fed in 2016 or 2017 and we think central banks across the world will continue to adopt easier policies in response. It looks like traders are trying to give the Dow a late push. It\u2019s now down 188 points, or half its earlier losses..... Hello hello.... look at the Nasdaq. The tech stock-heavy index has shrugged off its earlier losses, and is now up 7 points (or 0.2%). Leading the way are: TripAdvisor: +13% Cisco +10% Expedia +8.5% Tesla: +6.3% That still leaves the Nasdaq down 6.9% this month, and 13% since the start of the year. Now that today\u2019s OPEC rumour has sunk in, Wall Street is still in red, but off its lowest levels. The Dow is currently down 273 points, or -1.7%, with just 40 minutes until the closing bell. This final hour can be a volatile time.... This is the story that moved the market a few minutes ago, by Summer Said of the Wall Street Journal. OPEC members are ready to cooperate on a cut, but current prices are already forcing producers outside the group to at least cap output increases, says UAE Energy Minister Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazrouei. Non-OPEC supplies are expected to drop up to 800K barrels/day while global demand growth is seen at 1.3M\u2013which will help the market balances itself. \u201cThe positive thing is the current market is forcing everyone not to increase output,\u201d says al-Mazrouei, adding, \u201cI\u2019m optimistic that the balance will happen this year despite the oversupply and stocks overhang.\u201d  Interesting stuff. But it\u2019s not exactly definitive proof that OPEC is about to cave in and axe production. Energy stocks are suddenly spiking, pulling the US stock market off its lowest levels. And it\u2019s triggered reports that the energy minister of the UAE has said Opec members are \u201cready to co-operate\u201d on production cuts. Rumours of this sort have been swirling, and then denied, for some time. But maybe this time it\u2019s different.... Wow. The Dow just lurched through the 400-point loss mark, as news of the latest tumble in the oil price broke. Then it ricocheted back, to \u201cjust\u201d 340 points down in a few moments. Oil has just plumbed new depths, as oversupply fears and global recession worries take their toll again. West Texas Intermediate (US crude oil) has sunk below $26.19 per barrel, to hit the lowest levels since May 2003. There\u2019s no let-up in the market gloom today, with the Dow Jones industrial average still down over 2%. The Dow is currently trading at 15,570, a loss of 344 points. Only two stocks are up - network equipment vender Cisco, and entertainment group Walt Disney (who posted strong results earlier this week). Boeing is the big faller; the aircraft maker has lost 8.9% today following reports that regulators are probing the company\u2019s accounting. Reuters also blames \u201cmounting concerns\u201d about Boeing\u2019s its slowing sales and production. Following close behind in the losers bench are Goldman Sachs (-4.4%) and JP Morgan (-4.2%). They\u2019re tracking the general sell-off in financial stocks today. Two months after the first US rate rise in a decade, the financial markets reckon the Fed is more likely to CUT, rather than risk a second hike. Kit Juckes, top currency strategist at Societe Generale, reckons that the market turmoil has been sparked by a loss of faith in central bankers. In a new note to clients, he writes: We\u2019ve relied on central bankers to fix all the world\u2019s woes, when all they could really do was to get the global financial system back on an even keel. Keeping policy too easy for too long and boosting asset markets in the vain hope that this would deliver a sustainable demand pick-up has meant that even a timid attempt at normalising Fed policy has caused two months of mayhem. Now, a growing realisation that central banks\u2019 powers are waning has prompted a rush into safe havens. And, of course, years of ultra-loose monetary policy have also led us to this point: We\u2019re just getting the stickers saying \u2018Easy Money may cause harmful side-effects if consumed persistently for long periods\u2019 printed.... Yellen\u2019s second and final testimony ends with chairman Richard Shelby suggesting a review of the Fed\u2019s structure. She seems unconvinced but says it is up to Congress. And with that it\u2019s over. A cocktail of concerns has sent markets tumbling again. Worries about a severe global economic downturn, stresses on bank balance sheets, the falling oil price and Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen\u2019s comments about the impact of a slowdown and the market turmoil on the US economy have sent investors scurrying away to havens such as gold. Yellen\u2019s comments about negative interest rates added to the unease as the afternoon wore on. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 fell 135.33 points or 2.39% to 5536.97, its lowest level since the end of July 2012 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 2.93% to 8752.87 France\u2019s Cac closed 4.03% lower at 3896.71 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished down 5.63% at 15,773.00 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 4.88% at 7746.3 In Greece, the Athens market fell 1.89% to 440.88 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 349 points or 2.2%. Charles Schumer of New York says the strength of the US dollar is another form of rates rise so another hike would be a double whammy for the economy. Yellen says the dollar is a factor in interest rate policy, but says although some sectors have been hit by the strength of the US currency the economy has managed to continue creating jobs. Heller: A year ago you said falling oil would be good for the economy. Do you think you made a mistake. Yellen: Clearly declining oil prices have had some negative effects [on the economy]. [But] we are still a net importer of oil, and households are seeing sustantial gains from falling oil price. Dean Heller of Nevada: Different Fed officials saying different things causes confusion to public and markets. Do you see a problem? Yellen: Congress created a system with a large committee with diverse views so we did not fall into groupthink mentality. We have 17 members with a range of views. We have guidelines for communications. It says everyone should make clear they are speaking for themselves, not the committee. The market response to the Fed rate decision for a number of weeks was tranquil, it had been communicated and was expected. At the turn of the year markets saw more volatility. The drivers were China and oil price falls amid weakening global growth, so I don\u2019t think it was our policy. Yellen is asked again about the rate rise at the end of last year. Yellen: We felt in December the economy was moving up and inflation would go up. A lot has gone on since then. We are in the process of assessing how those developments affect our outlook. We will meet in March and have a new set of projections. I\u2019ve not thought that a downturn sufficient to make the next move a cut was a likely possibility. Not seen a shift in economic outlook to make that likely. But she added that if things changed to make that appropriate, the Fed would look at it. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts asks about living wills for banks, which are designed to make sure if they fail there will not be a systemic risk, and says there are 11 where they were deemed not to be sufficient and have been resubmitted. Yellen: We gave detailed guidance about what we want to see in these latest rounds of living wills. We are..evaluting them. If a living will does not address the shortcomings, we are prepared to make the finding that the living will is insufficient. Tom Cotton of Arkansas asks the December rate rise, and Yellen says the Fed wanted to move gradually so that the economy remained on a sustainable growth path. Cotton then asks about when she expects energy prices and the dollar to stabilise. Yellen: Energy prices have continued to move down, eventually they will stabilise. When that happens and the dollar stabilises, inflation will begin to move up but [difficult to predict when.] Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania: I wanted the Fed to normalise policy [ie start raising rates again which happened in December]. Markets now appear to price in no further increases in interest rates. But what are the risks of negative rates? [He lists several including pressure on banks, the prospect of currency war, an effective tax on savings and so on] Yellen: In European countries which have [introduced negative rates], I was surprised it was possible to take them as negative as they did. Don\u2019t think they pass on negative rates to small depositors, which means bank\u2019s margins are squeezed. They [other central banks] were concerned about inflation being below objectives and wanted to stimulate economy. In our context, in 2010 we were concerned about the impact on money market functioning. Before we took such a step we would have to see how they worked in US context. But we don\u2019t even know if clearing and settlement systems would be able to handle negative rates. Toomey asks about the legal position, saying a Fed memo seemed to suggest there could be a probem. Yellen: A memo from 2010 said legal issues had not been studied. I am not aware of any legal restriction that would mean we could not establish negative rates but I haven\u2019t studied legal side of it. Question from Bob Corker of Tennessee : Is Fed out of ammunition unless you go to negative rates? If things go south are you considering negative rates? Yellen: The answer is we had previously considered them and decided they would not work well back in 2010. In light of others [introducing them], we are taking a look at them again because we would want to be prepared. We have not finished that investigation. Not automatic they would work well here. I would not take them off the table, but there is work to do to see if they would be suitable. Senator Jon Tester of Montana: What is Fed seeing in housing sector right now? Yellen: We are seeing recovery in housing, it has gone on for a number of years but is very gradual. House prices have increased quite a bit. [But] the level of new construction remains quite low relative to demographic trends. Quite a significant way for housing to go before it is consistent with demographic trends. It is a support to the economy. Senator Mike Crapo asks: Would you agree liquidity in bond markets may be less available in stressed market conditions. Yellen: Normal conditions haven\u2019t changed that much but perceptions suggest that under stressed conditions liquidity may disappear when its most needed. We are looking at these things... Asked about wages, she says a pick up in wage growth is tentative. She hopes as the economy improves this will increase. Chair Richard Shelby asks if the precipitous decline in the price of 0il and gas plus the rise of the dollar surprised the Fed or could you have predicted it? Yellen says the Fed and the markets have been quite surprised by movements in oil price. In part they reflect supply isssue, demand may also play a role. The stronger dollar we in some ways anticipated as US economy has been performing more strongly than others. But she says they were surprised at how much it has risen. Asked about the economy and recession, she says there is always some chance of recession in any year. But evidence suggests expansions don\u2019t die of old age. We are looking very carefully at global financial developments which create risk... they may influence the trajectory of the economy and monetary policy. It is premature to make a judgement [on a recession this year]. On the strength of banks: We have a more resistent banking system. We have used stress tests to see if firms can support credit needs of our economy even in times of great [financial] stress. We do have a strong banking system and we\u2019ve seen marked improvement. Here\u2019s a chart showing how the chances of a Fed rate rise have dropped sharply since January in the wake of the market turmoil and Yellen\u2019s comments: After opening comments from committee chair Richard Shelby and senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is currently delivering her testimony (identical to yesterday\u2019s speech remember). Meanwhile markets seem to have recovered a little from their worst levels. Analyst Connor Campbell at Spreadex said: Initially threatening a 300 point plunge when the bell rang on Wall Street the Dow Jones settled into a more solid, if still troublesome, 175 point drop as the open receded into the background. Whether or not the better than expected, and best since December, jobless claims helped (it probably didn\u2019t) is unclear, though at this point in time in the most worthless piece of positive news is likely appreciated by fear-stricken investors. The Dow was probably saved (and this is all relative, remember) by the fact that the blood loss endured by the US banking sector was nowhere near as gory as the scenes over in Europe, Bank of America the worst hit at around a 4% decline. In Europe things were much the same, i.e. not too good at all. The FTSE just about managed to claw its way back to the 5600 mark, arguably thanks to the fact that Brent Crude is now closer to $31 per barrel than it is to $30. The DAX, meanwhile, tucked under a 2% decline around 40 points away from 8900, whilst the CAC climbed down from its 3.7% nadir to post a 2.7% loss, both indices aided by a (minor) reduction in losses form Deutsche Bank and Societe Generale respectively. The big question now is, does today\u2019s horrorshow continue into Friday? Given just how fearful investors appear to be at the moment it is incredibly hard to tell; one thing tomorrow does have going for it, however, is data. Lots and lots of it. Germany, Italy and the Eurozone as a whole reveal their preliminary fourth quarter GDP figures, whilst the US sees retail sales, import prices and the University of Michigan consumer sentiment number. The markets will be hoping (nay, praying) that, with a bit of distraction (like on Wednesday), the week can end on a slightly more positive note. Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is back on Capitol Hill to discuss the global outlook and monetary policy with the Senate Banking Committee, the second and last day of her testimony to Congress. The hearing has begun and can be viewed here. Elsewhere Morgan Stanley has agree to pay $3.2bn relating to the sale of mortgage-backed bonds before the financial crisis. Ahead of Yellen\u2019s testimony, some think it is time for a US rate cut: As predicted, the US market has followed the rest of the world lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 243 points or 1.5%, while the S&amp;P 500 has lost 1% and Nasdaq 1.3%. Meanwhile the International Monetary Fund has confirmed that Christine Lagarde has been nominated for a second five year term as managing director unopposed. Her first term ends in July. Well, here\u2019s the answer to the question about whether Janet Yellen would change her testimony from Wednesday\u2019s remarks in the light of the day\u2019s renewed market turmoil. No. The Fed said: Chair Yellen submitted identical remarks to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, on February 11, 201. So if you want to read along with Yellen at 10am EST (3pm GMT) here it is again. Here\u2019s some comments on Portugal and Greece from Slovakia\u2019s finance minister Peter Ka\u017eim\u00edr ahead of the eurogroup: Bloomberg points out another possible reason behind the plunge in bank shares: Oil rich Gulf states have of course been hard hit by the plunge in crude prices. Now here\u2019s a key question about today\u2019s second testimony from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen: Over in Brussels, eurozone finance ministers are telling reporters that the European banking sector is in good shape, as they arrive for a Eurogroup meeting. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem revealed that ministers will consider the market turbulence during today\u2019s session. European commissioner Pierre Moscovici was pretty optimistic too: And Finnish finance minister Alex Stubb was \u201crelaxed\u201d about the situation: Out of the mists of gloom comes some good news, in the shape of the weekly US jobless figures. They show that the number of Americans filing new unemployment claims fell by 16,000 last week, to a seven-week low. The initial jobless claims figure came in at 269,000, down from 280,000. So, US companies kept hiring staff last week, despite the market turmoil. World stock markets are gripped by another bout of feverish selling today. Fears over the global economy and the financial sector have hit shares, driven down (most) sovereign bond yields, and sent wild gyrations through the foreign exchange markets. In London, the FTSE 100 has hit a three and a half-year low. The blue-chip index is currently down 120 points, or 2%. Financial stocks are under real pressure, with Aberdeen Asset Management, Prudential and Barclays all down 6%. Other European markets are being routed too, with the French CAC plunging by 3.5%, Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB losing 5%(!) and German DAX off by 2%. Wall Street is expected to follow suit, with the Dow being called down 280 points or almost 2%. The day began with a big selloff in Asia, as traders returned after the Lunar New Year. Hong Kong\u2019s stock market slid by 4%. Maike Currie, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International, says investors face volatile markets: \u201cFebruary has continued much like January begun, with markets yo-yoing and investor sentiment swinging from one concern to the next. The FTSE 100 broke the 5,500 barrier today \u2013 hitting a new low since July 2012. \u201cInvestors can\u2019t be blamed for feeling unnerved. There is a cocktail of worries clouding the investment horizon from a slowing China, emerging market rout, the unprecedented collapse in the oil prices and more recently, the problems brewing in the banking sector. Bank shares are in the eye of the storm again: France\u2019s Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale has tumbled by 13% after warning that \u201cheadwinds\u201d could hit profitability this year. Deutsche Bank is down by 9%, two days after insisting it was \u201crock-solid\u201d. The dollar has fallen sharply against the yen, before suddenly rebounding, sparking rumours that the Bank of Japan has intervened to weaken its currency. And the British pound has fallen by over a cent against the US dollar to $1.439. Money has poured into German, US and UK government debt. This has driven down Britain\u2019s cost of borrowing to an alltime low. But Portugal\u2019s bonds have weakened, sparking fears that investors are worrying about Lisbon again. Sweden\u2019s central bank fired another shot in the currency wars, surprising the markets by slashing interest rates to a new record low of minus 0.5%. The oil price has weakened again, with US crude oil trading at levels last seen in 2003. But gold has jumped by 2.6% to $1,229 per ounce, a nine-month high. Financial sentiment right now: A rumour is sweeping the trading floors that the Bank of Japan has intervened to weaken the yen, following today\u2019s surge against the US dollar. And the yen has weakened, moving from \u00a5111.5 to \u00a5112 against the $1. America is waking up to the news that Asian and European markets have taken another bath this morning. And they are next in line: Investors are ditching Portuguese government bonds this morning, as the financial turmoil grows. The wave of selling has driven up the yield on Portugal\u2019s 10-year bonds to 4.3%, up from 3.5% yesterday. That\u2019s a remarkable surge, meaning that prices have dropped sharply. It implies that the markets are losing confidence in Portugal again, demanding a higher rate of return for holding its bonds. Shorter-term Portuguese debt is also being hit. The move comes as Lisbon\u2019s new left-wing government begins to reverse some of its predecessor\u2019s austerity policies. Last week, the EU warned that Portugal was \u201cat risk\u201d of breaching Europe\u2019s fiscal rules, after warily approving its 2016 budget. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, reckons fear is driving shares down today, rather than a fundamental shift. He says: The fear surrounding global financial markets has been cranked up further today, as risk assets once more took a battering in favour of defensive plays. The continued deterioration in the FTSE is as much to do with the ongoing fall in oil and the fall in the US dollar against the yen, as the outlook for the UK economy itself, yet with markets in freefall, who is going to argue with a trend? There are many potential causes of the current rout. For example: signs of slowing global growth; fears that negative interest rates severely undermine bank profitability; the bad loans lurking in the European financial sector; suspicions that China is much weaker than the GDP figures show.... All good reasons to worry. But as the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Juliet Samuel flags up, the City isn\u2019t sure what\u2019s really behind it. In a morning of wild and alarming moves, one stands out. The Japanese yen has jumped by 1.7% against the US dollar today, strengthening from \u00a5113.3 to $1, to \u00a5111.5. That\u2019s a chunky daily move. And so far this year, the yen has gained by 7.5% against the US dollar, hitting its strongest point since November 2014. That will surely concern the Bank of Japan, which imposed negative rates last month in its latest attempt to stimulate growth and inflation. A stronger yen is bad for exports, and also deflationary as it makes imported goods cheaper. Yann Quelenn, market analyst at Swissquote Bank, explains: The US dollar printed a fresh 16-month low against the Japanese yen, suggesting that traders believe the BoJ will be unable to further weaken the yen, while betting the Fed will remain sidelined for a longer period of time. But there is also chatter that the BoJ may have to intervene in the markets to weaken the yen. Here, courtesy of David Buik of Panmure Gordon, is a snapshot of the day\u2019s rout (so far) in the banking sector: Britain\u2019s borrowing costs have now hit their lowest level since the late 1600s, thanks to the plunge in bond yields today (details here). So reckons Sky News\u2019s economics editor, Ed Conway, who has checked the historic data. It\u2019s unlikely that Britain\u2019s medieval kings could have borrowed any cheaper either. They were notorious serial defaulters, due to the demands of court life and military ambitions. Mind you, academics at the University of Reading have argued that the picture was more nuanced.... They wrote: It can be difficult to identify medieval interest rates, in part because interest charges had to be disguised to circumvent the Church prohibition on usury, but we found that the king could borrow at 15% annualised interest when his finances were stable but that this could increase to more than 40% during periods of financial pressure, most notably during wartime. Edward I probably had a surplus on his account with the Ricciardi, who collapsed as the result of a \u2018credit crunch\u2019 caused by the unexpected outbreak of war between England and France..... More here: Credit Finance in the Middle Ages: loans to the English crown c.1272-1340 The Greek stock market is suffering another rout, led by its banks: Oil is being thumped by predictions of a growing crude glut, as the world economy slows. The price of US crude has fallen by almost 3% today, to $26.74 per barrel. That\u2019s a one-month low, but also close to the levels ploughed in 2003: Bloomberg\u2019s Caroline Hyde tweets the details: The refusal of oil producers to cut production is fuelling concerns that we may run out of places to put the stuff, as inventory levels keep rising. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains: The threat of further rate hikes from the Fed coupled with diminished prospects for a joint production cut between OPEC and non-OPEC producers have sent US oil prices back down to 12-year lows. The renewed slump in the price of oil has been unfortunate timing for French oil giant Total to report a 20% rise in annual net profits which CEO Patrick Pouyanne proclaimed as the \u201cbest performance\u201d amongst the oil majors. Today\u2019s rout has driven European bank shares down to their lowest level in three and a half years. The Stoxx 600 Banks index, which includes the main lenders in Europe, has shed 6.1% and is now at its lowest level since August 2012. Summer 2012 was the point at which the eurozone debt crisis began to ease, with European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi vowing to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the euro. Today\u2019s rout is being led by Italian banks, and French bank SocGen (after its results missed forecasts today). Britain\u2019s government borrowing costs have just hit an all-time low, according to Reuters data. The yield on 10-year UK gilts, which are the benchmark for UK borrowing, has fallen to 1.29% this morning in a wave of buying. Yield, the interest rate on the debt, fall when prices rise. So this implies Britain can borrow cheaper than at any time before (the data I can see goes back to 1989) That sounds like good news, except that it reflects wider fears over a global recession. If traders were upbeat about growth prospects, they\u2019d be buying shares instead. Investors are scrambling into \u201csafer\u201d eurozone government bonds. That\u2019s another sign that they\u2019re seeking protection against recession and market turmoil. German government bond yields (the interest rate on bunds) has hit a nine-month low this morning - meaning the prices of these bonds has hit the highest level since May 2015. And the yield on US 10-year Treasury bills has hit its lowest in three years, at just 1.62%. That also suggests traders are pessimistic about future growth and inflation prospects. Bank shares are getting a tonking this morning. Deutsche Bank, the source of so much worry, is down by 6.3% in Frankfurt, with Commerzbank close behind. After a rough start to trading, European stock markets are deep and turbulent sea of red. Italy is the worst performer, with its FTSE MIB index slumping by over 4%: FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga says Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is partly to blame. He reckons investors are disappointed that Yellen didn\u2019t rule out interest rate rises, when she appeared at Congress yesterday: Although the economic environment has transformed for the worst since the start of the year with ongoing China woes and violent declines in oil prices exposing the US economy to downside risks, in defiance the Fed continues to hold the view of raising rates at a gradual pace. While Yellen also emphasized that financial conditions in the US have become less supportive of growth, this was counterbalanced with the impressive labour report which in the eyes of the Fed opened doors for a potential rate rise in March. Yellen will get a second bite at the cherry later today, when she continues testifying to US lawmakers. Wall Street is expected to take a tumble later today: Nour Al-Hammoury, chief market strategist at ADS Securities in Abu Dhabi says: Asia and Europe equities remain weak following the Feds acknowledgment that they have concerns over global markets. European financial risk indices continue to rise, which is keeping demand high for safe haven assets. Ahead of the open we\u2019re currently calling the DOW down 275 15640 and the S&amp;P down 32 at 1820 Sweden\u2019s central bank has cut the country\u2019s interest rates deeper into negative territory, in another sign of the turbulence in the financial world. The Riksbank has just announced that the headline rate will fall to -.50%, from -0.35%. The move is designed to drive inflation up and stimulate growth. The bank says: The economy continues to strengthen but inflation is expected to be lower during 2016 than previously forecast. The rate cut will also weaken the Swedish currency. It is already hitting the Swedish Krone hard, sending the euro surging against the krone. Only 3 economists surveyed by Bloomberg has expected such a deep cut (8 thought rates would stay at minus 0.35%, and 7 predicted a cut to minus 0.45%) Tony Cross, analyst at Trustnet Direct, says fears over the world economy are hitting shares hard, and also pushing the oil price down. Any hopes that yesterday\u2019s modest rally for the FTSE-100 would mark something of a turning point have been dashed. WTI crude oil prices tested territory below $27/barrel, whilst the return to work after the Lunar New Year break saw traders in Hong Kong lacked any signs of optimism. Janet Yellen\u2019s words yesterday have clearly done nothing to calm sentiment \u2013 yes the next US rate hike may have been pushed back, but the challenge now is managing the US recovery against a potential global slowdown. The London selloff is accelerating, wiping 130 points off the Footsie. The index of major blue-chip shares has now hit its lowest level since July 2012: Over in Paris, French bank Societe Generale has plunged by 9%. It missed City forecasts this morning, with net income coming in around 31% below analyst forecasts. SocGen also warned that \u201cheadwinds\u201d could hamper its efforts to hit profitability targets this year. That wipes out yesterday\u2019s recovery: Money is pouring into safer assets, and out of shares. The gold price has risen to $1,211 per ounce, its highest since May 2015. And the Japanese yen has hit its highest level against the British pound since November 2013. Down we go again! European shares are falling at the start of trading. The FTSE 100 has shed 101 points, or 1.7%, to 5,570 points. Germany\u2019s DAX has lost 1.5%, and the French CAC is off by 1.6% Most London shares are down, but mining stocks are leading the selloff reflecting ongoing gloom about the global economy. Rio Tinto has slumped by 6.7%, after it abandoned its \u201cprogressive dividend\u201d policy this morning (a promise to pay more shareholders in future years). This follows a late-selloff on Wall Street last night, and the slumps in Asia earlier today. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says: The weakness stems from Fed chair Janet Yellen warning on current financial market turbulence and suggesting further rate hikes could be delayed, which added to already raised anxiety about the health of the global economy to hold back risk sentiment. It\u2019s never great returning to work after a holiday. But the mood in Hong Kong was particularly grim, as investors watched shares tumble. Nitin Dialdas, chief investment officer at Mandarin Capital in Hong Kong, told Reuters that 2016 will be tough. \u201dI think this is going to be a difficult year for investors and even a fledgling U.S. economic recovery looks to be snuffed out by global markets development.\u201d Charles Li, chief executive of the Hong Kong Stock exchange, was also gloomy: \u201cThere is very little good news and continuous bad news and this is a test of market confidence.\u201d Hong Kong\u2019s stock market is suffering its worst start to the Lunar New Year since 1994. A wave of selling has hit shares as traders return to their desks after this week\u2019s holiday. They were swift to catch up with the turmoil in European and US markets, with Asian markets having been shut since Friday. The Hang Seng index has lurched down, losing 795 points or nearly 4% to 18,535. That\u2019s its biggest one-day loss in six months. As this chart from Bloomberg shows, that\u2019s the worst start to a Lunar New Year in over two decades: There were similar losses in other Asian markets. South Korea\u2019s Kospi staged its biggest daily drop in nearly four years, down 2.9 percent to finish at 1,861.54. Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital in Sydney, blamed fears over the global slowdown, and the oil price slump, adding: \u201cWhat started in January as mainly China based worries has clearly broadened back out to concerns about global growth\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s no end in sight to the market turmoil. European stocks are expected to fall at the start of trading, with worries over the global slowdown centre-stage again. The futures market suggests the main indices, including London\u2019s FTSE 100, will lose around 1% at the opening - wiping out Wednesday\u2019s small rally. Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is testifying to Congress for the second day running (at 3pm GMT). She\u2019ll probably repeat her concerns about the turmoil in the markets, which could prevent the Fed from hiking rates this year. We\u2019ll hear from another central bank today, too. At 8.30am, Sweden\u2019s Riksbank announces its monetary policy decision, and some economists believe it will cut interest rates deeper into negative territory. And Eurozone finance ministers are meeting in Brussels; Greece\u2019s struggling bailout talks will be on the agenda, as Athens and its creditors continue to argue over its austerity plan. In the corporate world. oil giant Total, holiday firm Thomas Cook, insurance group Zurich and mining giant Rio Tinto are all reporting results (more on them shortly....) We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

They could make products and offer services worldwide and, especially in the software field, they would make money hand over fist; look at businesses like Microsoft and Oracle in the 1990s. Oil spills, environmental damage, government regulation \u2013 that was something for other sectors.</p> <p>But with the rise of the internet, and companies\u2019 ability to become not just transnational but supranational, active everywhere yet arguing that their responsibilities belong nowhere, attitudes have changed. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/17/apple-challenges-chilling-demand-decrypt-san-bernadino-iphone\" title=\"\">Apple\u2019s row with the FBI over access to a locked iPhone</a> that belonged to the employer of one of the San Bernardino killers is just the latest example of technology businesses discovering that nothing they now do is without consequences.</p> <p>Apple has been excoriated by presidential candidates, and backed into the tightest of corners by the FBI: the moral case for refusing to hack into a terrorist\u2019s phone is hard to make \u2013 particularly in the US over an Isis-inspired attack during an election year.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not just Apple. Google\u2019s Matt Brittin probably wakes up sweating <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/11/google-matt-brittin-salary-public-accounts-committee-tax-deal-grilling\" title=\"\">about his appearance before the Commons public accounts committee</a>, at which he couldn\u2019t remember how much he earned, and the questions about Google\u2019s sweetheart tax deal with HMRC kept coming.</p> <p>More broadly, the EU is considering an antitrust finding against Google for promoting its own products ahead of rivals\u2019 in search results. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/08/france-facebook-data-privacy-safe-harbour-pact\" title=\"\">Facebook has been threatened with fines by the French data commissioner</a>. Twitter is on-again, off-again in Turkey, depending on the mood of the government, which frequently censors its feed. Pakistan banned Google\u2019s YouTube. Uber has made enemies of taxi drivers and even its own drivers in cities around the world as it undercuts the first group, then cuts payments to the latter. Airbnb is under investigation in New York, London and elsewhere over whether its accommodation site breaks short-let laws. Amazon is rebuked by MPs over its revenue-shifting, tax-minimising ways, and by bookshop lovers who have seen it undercut high-street retailers. Spotify (which hails from Sweden) is criticised by fans and players for the tiny amounts musicians get paid when people stream music through it rather than buying a download or \u2013 remember when? \u2013 a CD.</p> <p>And that\u2019s before we get to artificial intelligence, where people fear huge job losses as machines take over more and more complex jobs. Google, again, is at the nexus of that row, with UK company DeepMind (which it bought in 2014) having to try to dampen worries while raising expectations.</p> <p>Technology companies may not create oil spills, but their effects on modern life are suddenly spreading across a gamut of topics \u2013 privacy, tax, regulation, safety, even housing.</p> <p>That\u2019s why the San Bernardino case could be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back. The FBI knows that the publicity from this battle won\u2019t be favourable to Apple, whichever way the courts rule. That worries every other technology company: it\u2019s notable that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sundarpichai\" title=\"\">Google chief executive Sundar Pichai\u2019s tweets on the topic</a> were carefully hedged, while Microsoft\u2019s Satya Nadella was similarly unwilling to stand foursquare behind Tim Cook (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/18/apple-fbi-encryption-battle-iphone-facebook-twitter-san-bernardino-shooting\" title=\"\">unlike WhatsApp\u2019s Jan Koum and Twitter\u2019s Jack Dorsey</a>). Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg has been completely silent, though his company did issue a supportive statement.</p> <p>Apple, of course, wasn\u2019t looking for a row with the FBI when it improved the encryption on its phones. And that is what will worry tech companies. As their influence on our daily lives grows, the effects of new features become less predictable \u2013 but probably greater.</p> <p>What if the next case involves taxis and short lets used for child trafficking? Or tax avoidance turning out to fund terrorism? Those may sound farfetched, but they\u2019re only a form of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melvin_Kranzberg\" title=\"\">Kranzberg\u2019s first law</a>: \u201cTechnology is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral.\u201d</p> <p>This week, the tech business is learning, to its reputational cost, just what that really means.</p> <h2>An old-fashioned fix for the G20<br></h2> <p>When G20 finance ministers and central bank governors meet this week in Shanghai, the failure of low interest rates to stimulate growth in their economies will be top of the agenda.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/18/oecd-calls-for-less-austerity-and-more-public-investment\" title=\"\">The global economy is faltering</a> and the knee-jerk response is the same today as it has been since 2008: extra monetary stimulus. But when it seems clear that cutting interest rates to zero \u2013 or even below, a move already deployed in Europe and Japan \u2013 has the same catalysing force as a weak decaff cuppa, surely it is time for a rethink.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2016/feb/18/oecd-calls-less-austerity-common-sense-prevailed\" title=\"\">The Organisation of Economic Co-operation &amp; Development will be on hand with an alternative</a>, though it will not sound very modern or innovative: it is recommending G20 nations coordinate an increase in spending to upgrade their infrastructure. Countries with the capacity to borrow should do so, and that includes the UK.</p> <p>According to the OECD, the growth this plan induces will more than offset the cost of borrowing and will expand national incomes sustainably.</p> <p>This embrace of Keynesianism is not before time. Economists outside the central banks have known for some time that flooding the financial system with cheap funds is a recipe for stagnation. It neither breeds confidence nor tackles structural imbalances, especially not the growing inequality that robs people on lower pay of decent wages to spend.</p> <p>George Osborne will fight the OECD, primarily to defend his economically nonsensical pitch to voters that the exchequer will benefit from balancing the books by 2020. Likewise, Germany will oppose the plan because its ageing population wants to conserve cash, not spend it for the benefit of the next generation.</p> <p>Other countries will resist for more practical reasons. China is investing like crazy and needs to continue switching to consumption, though it might be better if it encouraged the consumption of healthcare via taxation than the purchase of high street goods.</p> <p>Which illustrates how political forces defeat economic arguments, even when those arguments make sense for almost every country and could end the reliance on increasingly exhausted central banks.</p> <h2>Banks need a nice thick cushion</h2> <p>The words \u201csystemic risk buffers\u201d may cause many eyes to glaze over.

                "bodyText":"Life for technology companies was once, as the Fast Show character used to say, brilliant. They could make products and offer services worldwide and, especially in the software field, they would make money hand over fist; look at businesses like Microsoft and Oracle in the 1990s. Oil spills, environmental damage, government regulation \u2013 that was something for other sectors. But with the rise of the internet, and companies\u2019 ability to become not just transnational but supranational, active everywhere yet arguing that their responsibilities belong nowhere, attitudes have changed. Apple\u2019s row with the FBI over access to a locked iPhone that belonged to the employer of one of the San Bernardino killers is just the latest example of technology businesses discovering that nothing they now do is without consequences. Apple has been excoriated by presidential candidates, and backed into the tightest of corners by the FBI: the moral case for refusing to hack into a terrorist\u2019s phone is hard to make \u2013 particularly in the US over an Isis-inspired attack during an election year. But it\u2019s not just Apple. Google\u2019s Matt Brittin probably wakes up sweating about his appearance before the Commons public accounts committee, at which he couldn\u2019t remember how much he earned, and the questions about Google\u2019s sweetheart tax deal with HMRC kept coming. More broadly, the EU is considering an antitrust finding against Google for promoting its own products ahead of rivals\u2019 in search results. Facebook has been threatened with fines by the French data commissioner. Twitter is on-again, off-again in Turkey, depending on the mood of the government, which frequently censors its feed. Pakistan banned Google\u2019s YouTube. Uber has made enemies of taxi drivers and even its own drivers in cities around the world as it undercuts the first group, then cuts payments to the latter. Airbnb is under investigation in New York, London and elsewhere over whether its accommodation site breaks short-let laws. Amazon is rebuked by MPs over its revenue-shifting, tax-minimising ways, and by bookshop lovers who have seen it undercut high-street retailers. Spotify (which hails from Sweden) is criticised by fans and players for the tiny amounts musicians get paid when people stream music through it rather than buying a download or \u2013 remember when? \u2013 a CD. And that\u2019s before we get to artificial intelligence, where people fear huge job losses as machines take over more and more complex jobs. Google, again, is at the nexus of that row, with UK company DeepMind (which it bought in 2014) having to try to dampen worries while raising expectations. Technology companies may not create oil spills, but their effects on modern life are suddenly spreading across a gamut of topics \u2013 privacy, tax, regulation, safety, even housing. That\u2019s why the San Bernardino case could be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back. The FBI knows that the publicity from this battle won\u2019t be favourable to Apple, whichever way the courts rule. That worries every other technology company: it\u2019s notable that Google chief executive Sundar Pichai\u2019s tweets on the topic were carefully hedged, while Microsoft\u2019s Satya Nadella was similarly unwilling to stand foursquare behind Tim Cook (unlike WhatsApp\u2019s Jan Koum and Twitter\u2019s Jack Dorsey). Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg has been completely silent, though his company did issue a supportive statement. Apple, of course, wasn\u2019t looking for a row with the FBI when it improved the encryption on its phones. And that is what will worry tech companies. As their influence on our daily lives grows, the effects of new features become less predictable \u2013 but probably greater. What if the next case involves taxis and short lets used for child trafficking? Or tax avoidance turning out to fund terrorism? Those may sound farfetched, but they\u2019re only a form of Kranzberg\u2019s first law: \u201cTechnology is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral.\u201d This week, the tech business is learning, to its reputational cost, just what that really means. An old-fashioned fix for the G20 When G20 finance ministers and central bank governors meet this week in Shanghai, the failure of low interest rates to stimulate growth in their economies will be top of the agenda. The global economy is faltering and the knee-jerk response is the same today as it has been since 2008: extra monetary stimulus. But when it seems clear that cutting interest rates to zero \u2013 or even below, a move already deployed in Europe and Japan \u2013 has the same catalysing force as a weak decaff cuppa, surely it is time for a rethink. The Organisation of Economic Co-operation &amp; Development will be on hand with an alternative, though it will not sound very modern or innovative: it is recommending G20 nations coordinate an increase in spending to upgrade their infrastructure. Countries with the capacity to borrow should do so, and that includes the UK. According to the OECD, the growth this plan induces will more than offset the cost of borrowing and will expand national incomes sustainably. This embrace of Keynesianism is not before time. Economists outside the central banks have known for some time that flooding the financial system with cheap funds is a recipe for stagnation. It neither breeds confidence nor tackles structural imbalances, especially not the growing inequality that robs people on lower pay of decent wages to spend. George Osborne will fight the OECD, primarily to defend his economically nonsensical pitch to voters that the exchequer will benefit from balancing the books by 2020. Likewise, Germany will oppose the plan because its ageing population wants to conserve cash, not spend it for the benefit of the next generation. Other countries will resist for more practical reasons. China is investing like crazy and needs to continue switching to consumption, though it might be better if it encouraged the consumption of healthcare via taxation than the purchase of high street goods. Which illustrates how political forces defeat economic arguments, even when those arguments make sense for almost every country and could end the reliance on increasingly exhausted central banks. Banks need a nice thick cushion The words \u201csystemic risk buffers\u201d may cause many eyes to glaze over. But they shouldn\u2019t. This is the extra bit of capital cushion that banks should hold, on top of the regulatory minimum, to help protect them against a system-wide meltdown such as we saw in the 2008 crisis. Sir John Vickers, who in 2011 was charged with finding ways of preventing another taxpayer bailout of the banking system, concluded that banks should hold an extra buffer worth 3% of their assets. Five years on, the Bank of England has set the buffer at around 0.5%. The Bank argues that when it is all added together, the amount of capital banks are required to hold is more than the overall total prescribed by Vickers. Even so, Vickers spoke out last week to urge Threadneedle Street to think again. He says these buffers are as important as ever for the safety of the UK banking sector, which remains bigger than the nation\u2019s GDP. He should be given a good hearing.",

Our background in automotives made us understand that there was a lot of need for innovation there because everything was still made in the same way.\u201d</p> <p>Tin and Yuki, who were both born and raised in Italy, followed their father into the motor industry. They soon became interested in the idea of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/series/circular-economy\">circular economies</a>, in which resources are kept in use for as long as possible. In 2008, Tin was working in Silicon Valley when he came in contact with open-source hardware \u2013 designs for machines and devices that have been publicly released. He applied the principles to cars, where one vehicle would be able to achieve a number of functions.</p> <p> The Tabby Evo is the second version of the skeleton car. Available with two or four seats, the bare vehicle is charged from a plug socket and has a range of 75 miles (120km) , depending on the type of body attached to it, said Yuki. The maximum speed is 80mph (130kmh), but this can be capped at a lower number depending again on what it is being used for.</p> <p>When a company buys fleets of the vehicles \u2013 the minimum is 200 \u2013 they design the final vehicle and then buy and fit the seats, doors and other components separately. Batches of more than 500 four-seater vehicles cost just under $5,000 (\u00a33,500) each, although this price increases if fewer are ordered, according to the company\u2019s chief finance officer, Alberto Loddo.</p> <p>He said: \u201cTo make a new car model from scratch, you would need five to seven years and $100m to $200m.

Its core unit contains the most complex parts of a vehicle, which means it is stable and ready to use, she added. Loddo compares it to the Android operating system for mobile phones, where developers can freely access the software as a base on which to build apps.</p> <p>He said: \u201cThe automotive world and the tech world are merging but the only thing is that the automotive world is very slow and big, and not so fast to adapt to change.\u201d </p> <p>The aim is to remove barriers for entry to the market for smaller companies, which can build different designs on one core vehicle. The two-seat version is comparable to a Smart car, and the four-seater to a Mini Cooper, Loddo added. </p> <p>The company makes money by selling the vehicles and also by designing and engineering final products for firms that want to make new vehicles using the platform. So far, 10 projectsare in development, ranging from fleets of hundreds to those with thousands of cars, although the exact details are under wraps. A two-seater car by an Italian IT company using its own information and entertainment system will be launched in June. Yuki says she expects to see the first vehicles on the roads next year. </p> <p>Several projects are being developed in the Aquitaine region of France, including a car-sharing scheme, a delivery scheme and an agricultural programme, which is supported by the regional council.</p> <p>Among the more bizarre ideas are vehicles that could navigate the surface of Mars or ones that could fly. More realistic suggestions have come from small islands that would benefit from the easy transportation of the parts, said Yuki. </p> <p>Hotel chains are looking into whether fleets of electric vehicles could be used to transport tourists around Mediterranean islands. Future plans include developing the vehicles to saloon, 4x4 and mini-van sizes. \u201cWe are giving the possibility of new vehicles for a niche market,\u201d Yuki said.</p>",

The Tabby Evo is the latest version of a \u201cplatform\u201d car, which provides the bare bones of an electric vehicle \u2013 including the frame, suspension, steering systems, brakes, seats and wheels \u2013 on which companies, relief agencies and universities among others, can build and tweak their own vehicle by adding doors, interiors and a shell. The skeleton cars were created by Yuki\u2019s brother, Tin Hang Liu, and OSVehicle wants them to be an easier route into the automotive industry. This would end the need for years of research and development and hundreds of millions of pounds in investment. Along with vehicles for aid agencies, the company is working on projects where fleets are used for car-sharing or as delivery vehicles for packages. Yuki said: \u201cWe started to think about how to change automotives because it is the most complex industrial product that has not changed for [some] time. Our background in automotives made us understand that there was a lot of need for innovation there because everything was still made in the same way.\u201d Tin and Yuki, who were both born and raised in Italy, followed their father into the motor industry. They soon became interested in the idea of circular economies, in which resources are kept in use for as long as possible. In 2008, Tin was working in Silicon Valley when he came in contact with open-source hardware \u2013 designs for machines and devices that have been publicly released. He applied the principles to cars, where one vehicle would be able to achieve a number of functions. The Tabby Evo is the second version of the skeleton car. Available with two or four seats, the bare vehicle is charged from a plug socket and has a range of 75 miles (120km) , depending on the type of body attached to it, said Yuki. The maximum speed is 80mph (130kmh), but this can be capped at a lower number depending again on what it is being used for. When a company buys fleets of the vehicles \u2013 the minimum is 200 \u2013 they design the final vehicle and then buy and fit the seats, doors and other components separately. Batches of more than 500 four-seater vehicles cost just under $5,000 (\u00a33,500) each, although this price increases if fewer are ordered, according to the company\u2019s chief finance officer, Alberto Loddo. He said: \u201cTo make a new car model from scratch, you would need five to seven years and $100m to $200m. With our platform, we want to shorten that to one and a half to three years, depending on the complexity of the vehicle, and to $3m to $20m.\u201d An alternative is to download the designs for free from the OSVehicle website, in line with the open-source principle on which the company was founded. The motoring industry, which was previously the domain of a small number of established firms, has welcomed several new entrants in recent years. Apple has discussed plans for an autonomous vehicle with California\u2019s department of motor vehicles, while Google\u2019s self-driving car has also been developed. The OSVehicle units consist of parts that can be easily swapped without throwing away other working parts, which expands the vehicle\u2019s lifespan, said Yuki. Its core unit contains the most complex parts of a vehicle, which means it is stable and ready to use, she added. Loddo compares it to the Android operating system for mobile phones, where developers can freely access the software as a base on which to build apps. He said: \u201cThe automotive world and the tech world are merging but the only thing is that the automotive world is very slow and big, and not so fast to adapt to change.\u201d The aim is to remove barriers for entry to the market for smaller companies, which can build different designs on one core vehicle. The two-seat version is comparable to a Smart car, and the four-seater to a Mini Cooper, Loddo added. The company makes money by selling the vehicles and also by designing and engineering final products for firms that want to make new vehicles using the platform. So far, 10 projectsare in development, ranging from fleets of hundreds to those with thousands of cars, although the exact details are under wraps. A two-seater car by an Italian IT company using its own information and entertainment system will be launched in June. Yuki says she expects to see the first vehicles on the roads next year. Several projects are being developed in the Aquitaine region of France, including a car-sharing scheme, a delivery scheme and an agricultural programme, which is supported by the regional council. Among the more bizarre ideas are vehicles that could navigate the surface of Mars or ones that could fly. More realistic suggestions have come from small islands that would benefit from the easy transportation of the parts, said Yuki. Hotel chains are looking into whether fleets of electric vehicles could be used to transport tourists around Mediterranean islands. Future plans include developing the vehicles to saloon, 4x4 and mini-van sizes. \u201cWe are giving the possibility of new vehicles for a niche market,\u201d Yuki said.",
