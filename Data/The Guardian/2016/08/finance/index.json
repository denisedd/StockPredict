But some analysts see plenty of reasons for the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to hold off until after November\u2019s presidential election.</p> <p>Ken Odeluga, analyst at City Index says all eyes will now be on a speech from Fed chair Janet Yellen later this month:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cHeadline U.S. payrolls which beat expectations by about 40%, and jobs market growth that\u2019s showing signs of bursting at the seams, obviously swing the onus back on to Janet Yellen\u2019s Federal Reserve... Federal funds futures had all but priced out another rate hike this year before Friday, but chances are rising that the latest data will encourage Yellen to signal a rate rise as early as September.</p> <p>\u201cWith no Fed meeting this month, the Fed chair\u2019s speech at this year\u2019s Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium, between 25<sup>th</sup>-27<sup>th</sup> August, will be scrutinised closely.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>But markets should interpret anything she says with care. Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, highlights the market\u2019s uneasy relationship with the Fed after previous unrealised hints of action:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cFOMC watchers could be forgiven for thinking the committee has taken a \u201chead in the sand\u201d approach to the US labour market. After saying for years that rates would rise if the labour market continued to improve, the FOMC appears to be holding fire on rate hikes, and as a result markets are very sceptical about the prospects of even today\u2019s strong figures leading to further tightening in the near future. However, complacency can lead to volatility and if the FOMC does finally act in September, the resulting correction in fixed income, commodities and currencies could make for an interesting autumn.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>David Page, senior economist at AXA Investment Managers expects a Fed move in December. He comments:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cAnother solid payrolls continues to suggest a firmer underlying GDP expansion than recorded in Q2 GDP. This is consistent with the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s latest guidance that \u201cnear-term risks \u2026 diminished\u201d. We expect Q3 GDP to record a solid rebound to Q2\u2019s inventory-correction impacted growth. We think this will increase the Fed\u2019s confidence to tighten policy. We consider this unlikely before November\u2019s elections (although we expect the probability of a September hike to grow in market\u2019s minds). We forecast a 0.25% December hike.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57a499f0e4b03b51a99e03c0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-05T14:00:01.351Z\">3.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One part of the US jobs report that confounded expectations to the downside was the unemployment rate.

He highlights political uncertainty, mixed data and external risks:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe outcome of today\u2019s report is supportive of the view that we could see a rate hike before year-end - we have had a couple of Fed officials this week suggest that this is possible. It also backs up the assessment within the latest FOMC statement that \u201cnear-term risks to the economic outlook have diminished\u201d. Nonetheless, we have our doubts it will happen given the mixed nature of the US data flow and political uncertainty relating to the election, while external risks remain a possible constraint.<br><br></p> <p>\u201cAdditionally, with the RBA in Australia and the Bank of England providing more monetary stimulus and Japan boosting its fiscal stimulus we think a majority of Fed officials will be nervous about raising rates given the significant boost it could give the dollar. Instead, we think they will continue to tread cautiously with one rate hike in the first quarter of 2017 and a further one in the second half of next year.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57a48893e4b033cb0795d364\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-05T12:45:09.975Z\">1.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Fresh talk of September rate rise from the US Fed</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Those payroll numbers were much better than forecast in the market and accompanying news of a pick up in wages will bolster expectations of an interest rate rise from the US Federal Reserve in the months ahead.</p> <p>Reactions so far to the news that the US economy added 255,000 jobs in July and more jobs than previously thought in June:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JustinWolfers/status/761541499452612612\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">There are 3 independent measures in a Jobs report:<br>1.

                "bodyText":"A busy week for economic and business news has been capped off with brighter figures from the US, where a forecast-busting 255,000 jobs were added in July. A pick-up in wage growth and jobs gains for June that were stronger previously thought helped raise hopes that the world\u2019s biggest economy is strengthening, putting the prospect of a September interest rate rise from the US Federal Reserve back on the table. Before we go, here\u2019s a summary of today\u2019s main news: The US economy added 255,000 jobs in July, beating economists\u2019 expectations for growth of 180,000 Wall Street has opened higher after those jobs numbers. The Nasdaq is up 1%, the Dow Jones industrial average is up 0.8% and the S&amp;P 500 is up 0.7% The optimism has spread to Europe, where the FTSE 100 is up 0.7%, having briefly broken through the 6,800 mark and set a new high for this year. The FTSE 250 index of midcaps is similarly at new highs for 2016, up 1.3% to 17,462 France\u2019s CAC40 share index is up 1.4%, Germany\u2019s Dax is up 1.1% The Bank of England\u2019s deputy governor Ben Broadbent has defended a rate cut to 0.25% and other measures unveiled on Thursday to ward off a post referendum recession Commercial banks, told by the Bank of England governor Mark Carney they have no excuse not to pass on the base rate cut, appear to be acceding to his call. However, Lloyds, the country\u2019s biggest mortgage lender, is still considering how to proceed Royal Bank of Scotland, the 73%-taxpayer-owned bank, has slumped to a \u00a32bn half-year loss The chief executive of Nissan has warned that future investment decisions about the company\u2019s car plant in the north-east of England will depend on the outcome of Brexit negotiations. With that, we are closing the live blog for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. We\u2019ll be back on Monday with more rolling coverage of business and economics news. The will-they-won\u2019t-they debate over a September interest rate hike from the US Federal Reserve has hotted up in the wake of these stronger than expected payrolls numbers. In stark contrast to the UK, where rates were cut to a new record low on Thursday and more cuts are expected, the US central bank could be raising as soon as next month. But some analysts see plenty of reasons for the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to hold off until after November\u2019s presidential election. Ken Odeluga, analyst at City Index says all eyes will now be on a speech from Fed chair Janet Yellen later this month: \u201cHeadline U.S. payrolls which beat expectations by about 40%, and jobs market growth that\u2019s showing signs of bursting at the seams, obviously swing the onus back on to Janet Yellen\u2019s Federal Reserve... Federal funds futures had all but priced out another rate hike this year before Friday, but chances are rising that the latest data will encourage Yellen to signal a rate rise as early as September. \u201cWith no Fed meeting this month, the Fed chair\u2019s speech at this year\u2019s Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium, between 25th-27th August, will be scrutinised closely.\u201d But markets should interpret anything she says with care. Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, highlights the market\u2019s uneasy relationship with the Fed after previous unrealised hints of action: \u201cFOMC watchers could be forgiven for thinking the committee has taken a \u201chead in the sand\u201d approach to the US labour market. After saying for years that rates would rise if the labour market continued to improve, the FOMC appears to be holding fire on rate hikes, and as a result markets are very sceptical about the prospects of even today\u2019s strong figures leading to further tightening in the near future. However, complacency can lead to volatility and if the FOMC does finally act in September, the resulting correction in fixed income, commodities and currencies could make for an interesting autumn.\u201d David Page, senior economist at AXA Investment Managers expects a Fed move in December. He comments: \u201cAnother solid payrolls continues to suggest a firmer underlying GDP expansion than recorded in Q2 GDP. This is consistent with the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s latest guidance that \u201cnear-term risks \u2026 diminished\u201d. We expect Q3 GDP to record a solid rebound to Q2\u2019s inventory-correction impacted growth. We think this will increase the Fed\u2019s confidence to tighten policy. We consider this unlikely before November\u2019s elections (although we expect the probability of a September hike to grow in market\u2019s minds). We forecast a 0.25% December hike.\u201d One part of the US jobs report that confounded expectations to the downside was the unemployment rate. That held steady in July at 4.9%, missing expectations among economists for it to drop to 4.8%. The unchanged unemployment rate, despite a pick up in new jobs, is explained by a rise in the number of people entering the labour market looking for work. Here are those US jobs numbers in context: Wall Street has opened higher, as expected, after those stronger-than-expected US jobs numbers. Following government data showing 255,000 jobs were added in July, the market feels the outlook for the US economy has brightened and stocks and the dollar are higher. The Dow Jones industrial average is up 0.8%, the S&amp;P 500 is up 0.3% and the Nasdaq is up around 0.5%. In the UK, the effects of a weak pound against the dollar continue to be felt on the FTSE 100. The index, where a significant number of component companies earn revenues in dollars, has hit its highest level since July 2015. Adding to gains made on the back of Thursday\u2019s UK interest rate cut, the bluechip index now stands at 6,799.9. That\u2019s up around 60 points, or 0.9%, on the day. Economists at S&amp;P Global Ratings highlight the rise in the average work week in the US, the pick-up in average hourly earnings and the cumulative solid growth in new jobs in June and July. It\u2019s a welcome boost after a \u201cmixed bag\u201d of corporate earnings these past several days, they say. But they do not see the US central bank acting before November\u2019s presidential election. Beth Ann Bovino and Satyam Panday continue: \u201cA steady pace of hiring, healthier consumer appetites and a bounce in producer sentiment paint a brighter US economic outlook amidst ongoing global woes. A solid August jobs report should allow Federal Reserve officials to breathe a little easier when they meet in September and keep them on track for an interest rate hike likely after the US elections in December.\u201d Wall Street futures are pointing to a strong open for US stocks after those much stronger-than-expected non-farm payrolls numbers. The signs of strength in the US economy and prospect of a rate rise there as soon as next month have also boosted the dollar. That means the pound is down sharply against the US currency. The pound had already weakened markedly on Thursday on the Bank of England\u2019s interest cut and other stimulus measures. It recovered some ground on Friday morning only to now fall back. The pound is currently down 0.5% on the day against the dollar at $1.3045. It stood at $1.3160 before the payrolls data. David Cheetham, analyst at the currency brokerage XTB.com comments: \u201cThe immediate reaction in the markets has seen the GBP-USD drop sharply below yesterday\u2019s low, gold and yields on US government debt both decline whilst US stock futures rallied. Taken together with yesterday\u2019s strong stimulus measure from the BoE the macroeconomic backdrop is now far more rosy than it was immediately post-Brexit and fresh yearly highs for the S&amp;P500 and FTSE could be just around the corner.\u201d Here is the key data on US wages in July. The Bureau of Labor Statistics says: In July, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased by 8 cents to $25.69. Over the year, average hourly earnings have risen by 2.6%. That and the jobs growth has led some to pencil in a rate rise in the US in September. But James Knightley, economist at ING, says there are still plenty of reasons why Janet Yellen and her Fed colleagues will hold off for a while. He highlights political uncertainty, mixed data and external risks: \u201cThe outcome of today\u2019s report is supportive of the view that we could see a rate hike before year-end - we have had a couple of Fed officials this week suggest that this is possible. It also backs up the assessment within the latest FOMC statement that \u201cnear-term risks to the economic outlook have diminished\u201d. Nonetheless, we have our doubts it will happen given the mixed nature of the US data flow and political uncertainty relating to the election, while external risks remain a possible constraint. \u201cAdditionally, with the RBA in Australia and the Bank of England providing more monetary stimulus and Japan boosting its fiscal stimulus we think a majority of Fed officials will be nervous about raising rates given the significant boost it could give the dollar. Instead, we think they will continue to tread cautiously with one rate hike in the first quarter of 2017 and a further one in the second half of next year.\u201d Those payroll numbers were much better than forecast in the market and accompanying news of a pick up in wages will bolster expectations of an interest rate rise from the US Federal Reserve in the months ahead. Reactions so far to the news that the US economy added 255,000 jobs in July and more jobs than previously thought in June: My colleague Jana Kasperkevic in New York reports that the positive figures come after the labour market stumbled in May, adding only 11,000 jobs. Hiring rebounded in June with a net gain of 287,000, but recent economic figures and a faltering European economy had suggested another slowdown. Here is her full news story: In a big upside surprise, the US economy has added 255,000 new jobs in July, according to government data. The forecast was for a July gain of 180,000 jobs. The June rise in jobs was also revised higher today, now seen at 292,000 additional jobs compared with the previous estimate of 287,000. The US unemployment rate was 4.9% in July. With just a few minutes to go to this month\u2019s jobs report from the US, here\u2019s a quick reminder of what markets expect. The government\u2019s US non-farm payrolls figures for July are expected to show a gain of around 180,000, down from June\u2019s bumper 287,000, but above the three-month average of 148,000. The jobless rate is forecast to fall to 4.8%. That\u2019s according to a Reuters poll of economists. And here\u2019s what Twitter thinks: Ben Broadbent, who this morning defended the Bank\u2019s four-pronged stimulus package, told Reuters that as well as cutting rates further the Bank still has more measures up its sleeve to support the economy. He also discussed the Bank\u2019s new Term Funding Scheme (TFS), which will provide loans to commercial banks at low rates to ensure they pass on this week\u2019s base rate cut. The deputy governor rebuffed any suggestion the Bank of England would use the scheme as a a back-door way to introduce negative interest rates - something governor Mark Carney has opposed. Broadbent told Reuters: \u201cThere are limits for us too. We would not want to offer that finance at hugely negative interest rates, because we would be making losses ourselves.\u201d He also echoed Carney and others in noting that monetary policy could not completely offset the likely blow from the decision to leave the EU. \u201cThere are limits to what monetary policy - indeed any demand management policy - conventional fiscal policy as well, to offset what is a structural effect on the economy,\u201d he said. The full report from Reuters is here. And if you want to know more about the ins and outs of the Bank\u2019s new stimulus package, it\u2019s broken out the key points here: The Bank of England\u2019s deputy governor Ben Broadbent has been back out talking to the press after yesterday\u2019s kitchen sink package to avert a post-referendum recession. In an interview with Reuters, Broadbent says he is likely to vote for another rate cut unless economic growth beats expectations. That echoes the tone of yesterday\u2019s minutes from the latest Monetary Policy Meeting, where Broadbent and colleagues voted for a rate cut to 0.25%. The minutes said if economic news proved consistent with the Bank\u2019s latest forecasts then \u201ca majority of members\u201d expected to support a further interest rate cut, potentially taking official borrowing costs as low as 0.1%. Ahead of the US non-farm payrolls data, out at 1.30pm BST, which are expected to show an above-average increase in employment of about 180,000, here\u2019s a quick summary of today\u2019s main developments. Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent has rejected suggestions that the central bank\u2019s bigger-than-expected stimulus package sent out a message of panic. He was \u201cpretty confident\u201d that it would work and provide some support to the economy soon. More here. Meanwhile, his boss, Mark Carney, insisted that the UK would avoid a repeat of the financial crisis. A new survey has shown a sharp deterioration in the UK job market. Carney warned yesterday that another quarter of a million people would lose their jobs in coming quarters following the Brexit vote. Stock markets have risen following the Bank of England\u2019s Super Thursday and solid corporate earnings updates in Europe. The FTSE 100 index in London is up 0.3% at 6762.70, a gain of more than 20 points. The pound has recovered some ground after yesterday\u2019s fall. It is trading 0.4% higher against the dollar at $1.3154. There is further evidence that the luxury property market in London is slowing. The UK capital and New York have fallen behind Rome and Madrid, according to Knight Frank\u2019s latest prime global cities index for the second quarter. Prime house prices fell 0.6% in London in the year to June, and by 0.5% in New York, the upmarket estate agent\u2019s survey showed. Vancouver came top of the list, with 36.4% growth, followed by Shanghai at 22.5%, Cape Town at 16.1% and Toronto at 12.6%. The top ten did not feature a single European city, with Dublin the highest-placed, in 13th place, with 4.9% house price growth. Here\u2019s confirmation from HSBC. An HSBC spokesperson said: Following the Base Rate announcement yesterday we have passed on the full reduction to customers with tracker mortgages today. We will also be passing on the reduction to mortgage customers on our Standard Variable Rate, which is already one of the lowest in the market and will reduce from 3.94% to 3.69% with effect from 1st September. Reuters flash: HSBC says it will pass the Bank of England\u2019s rate cut on to all mortgage customers on standard variable rates from 1 September. Meanwhile, Japanese carmaker Nissan has cast doubt on its long-term investment plans in Britain, following the referendum. The boss of Nissan, Carlos Ghosn, said future decisions about its Sunderland factory, which employs 6,700 people, would depend on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations. He said \u201cmost companies\u201d would be waiting for further news on Britain\u2019s trading status before making decisions about investments. He was \u201creasonably optimistic\u201d that common sense would prevail from both sides and that the UK would continue to be a key partner of the EU. He told the BBC: Well I don\u2019t think today you can talk about any impact before we see what is the new status of the UK. The question of Sunderland - Sunderland is a plant which is a European plant based in the UK. Most of the production out of Sunderland is exported to Europe. So obviously for us the relationship which is going to prevail between the UK and Europe is very important. So the future investment decisions are going to depend a lot into ... Okay, the UK is out of Europe. Fine. But what\u2019s going to be the new status? So you\u2019re going to see a period where most companies are going to be waiting to see what\u2019s going to be the new status. A new UK jobs survey showed this morning that the labour market entered \u201cfreefall\u201d after the Brexit vote. The Recruitment and Employment Confederation said the number of permanent jobs placed by recruitment firms last month fell at the fastest pace since May 2009. Rupert Harrison, chief macro strategist for multi-asset at fund management giant BlackRock, who was chief of staff to ex-chancellor George Osborne, tweeted: Bank of England governor Mark Carney has sought to reassure people that Britain won\u2019t see a repeat of the financial crisis, after the central bank unveiled a big stimulus package yesterday. He told LBC radio: People should not worry about the supply of credit, this isn\u2019t after the global financial crisis, this isn\u2019t during the euro crisis \u2013 this is a modern financial sector that is working. We\u2019re not going through the same experience that the economy went through in 2008/9/10/11/12 when it was tough. Turning our attention to the key US jobs figures out at 1:30pm BST, economists polled by Reuters are forecasting a chunky 180,000 gain in employment. In June, the number of jobs created went up by a massive 287,000. Markets will be scrutinising the data for further cues on potential Federal Reserve rate hikes. The pound has clawed back some ground after the Bank of England\u2019s new stimulus package triggered its biggest daily losses in a month. Sterling gained 0.25% against the dollar to $1.3137. Against the euro, it is now flat at 84.85p, after gaining 0.2% earlier. The Office for National Statistics has put out figures for profitability at UK companies in the first quarter. The profitability of private non-financial firms, as measured by their net rate of return, improved to 12.2% between January and March, up 0.2% from the fourth quarter of last year. At manufacturers, the net rate of return rose to 12.7% from 10.3%, while service companies recorded a rate of 18.2%, a tad lower than the 18.3% in the fourth quarter. The rate of return is calculated by expressing the economic gain, or profit, as a percentage of the capital used to produce it, the ONS explains helpfully. The Bank of England\u2019s actions lifted the FTSE 100 index to a one-year high this morning. The bluechip index rose 1.6% yesterday and a further 0.5% earlier this morning to its highest level since July 2015. It has fallen back a bit, and is now trading 0.2% higher at 6755.83. A market gauge of UK firms\u2019 borrowing costs has hit a record low after the Bank of England\u2019s stimulus package, which includes a new corporate bond-buying scheme. The yield on data provider Markit\u2019s sterling-denominated corporate IBOXX index, which comprises 680 investment-grade bonds, closed at a record low of 2.53% yesterday, compared with 2.76% the day before, Reuters reported this morning. The premium companies would pay over British government borrowing costs dropped to 154 basis points from 162 bps, the lowest level seen so far this year.

Many analysts say the pound has further to fall. Julius Baer economist David A. Meier said: The decisive BoE response to the Brexit fallout allows for inflation overshoots ahead. While foreign exchange markets reacted rather unimpressed, today\u2019s measures and the potential for additions down the road will push the GBP lower gradually. We see further support for our below-consensus 12-month EUR/GBP outlook at 0.95. John Wraith, head of UK rates strategy at UBS, said: The trends of weaker sterling and outperforming gilts have reasserted themselves and are expected to continue to dominate. In equities, despite the deceleration in UK growth we do not see a significant drag to the FTSE-100 given 75% of revenues come from outside the UK. In foreign exchange, we feel comfortable with year-end targets of 0.90 for EUR/GBP and 1.29 for GBP/USD. The path for sterling is also dependent on political considerations, including the timing of the triggering of Article 50, and the evolution of economic data, but the balance of risks is for further weakness. The Bank predicted that house prices would fall over the next year, ending years of strong growth. Prices fell in July, according to the latest Halifax figures, out this morning. The average value of a home fell 1% to \u00a3214,678 last month. The drop was the third this year and mostly offset June\u2019s 1.2% increase. However figures for a single month can be erratic but the quarterly trend shows growth has slowed from earlier in the year. Royal Bank of Scotland is yet to decide whether to pass on the Bank of England\u2019s base rate cut to its borrowers, risking a row with its governor, Mark Carney, writes Jill Treanor, the Guardian\u2019s City editor. As the 73%-taxpayer owned bank slumped to a \u00a32bn half-year loss, the bank admitted it was still reviewing the implications of the historic rate cut to 0.25% which is expected to impede its ability to generate profits as quickly as hoped. Read the full story here. Lloyds Banking Group has not announced a decision yet either, as we reported last night. Other lenders quickly took action after the Bank of England\u2019s cut yesterday, however. Spanish-owned Santander and Nationwide Building Society said they would pass on the reduction in full on the standard variable rates from September. More from Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent, who was quizzed on Radio 4. Confronted with criticism from the Brexiteers that the central bank had acted too soon and risked talking down the economy, he strongly defended the stimulus package. We felt we had ample evidence to act. The referendum no doubt marked a profound change for the UK economy. Responding to other criticism that the Bank\u2019s measures would not work, Broadbent described it as a \u201csubstantial, coherent\u201d package that \u201cwill provide support for the economy\u201d. I\u2019m pretty confident it will have some effect. Pressed whether it would have a real impact soon, the Bank\u2019s deputy governor replied: We\u2019ve already seen many mortgage rates fall. Broadbent also confirmed that there was a real prospect of another interest rate cut before the end of the year. He rejected the suggestion that the Bank\u2019s real intention was to devalue the pound. Compared to sterling\u2019s tumble since the June referendum, yesterday\u2019s move was \u201crelatively small,\u201d Broadbent noted. The pound did fall very sharply immediately after the referendum and has since been relatively stable. Certainly compared with that immediate move, the move yesterday on the announcement of these measures was relatively small. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s the day after the Bank of England unveiled its bigger-than-expected package of measures designed to prevent a post-Brexit recession. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent has just been on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme defending the package. Pressed whether the measures didn\u2019t send out a message of panic, he rejected that suggestion, and said there was no evidence to suggest that \u201ceasing monetary policy made things worse\u201d. I can\u2019t think of one instance where monetary easing was bad for confidence. The surprise package sent the pound down yesterday (it slumped 2 cents against the dollar) and shares soaring. Most Asian stock markets rose, with the Hang Seng in Hong Kong up 1.3%. European stock markets have opened higher today, with London\u2019s FTSE 100 index up 0.6%, to 6782.10 in early trading. France\u2019s CAC is trading 0.7% higher, Spain\u2019s Ibex is 0.9% ahead and Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 1.4%, while Germany\u2019s Dax is 0.3% higher. On \u2018Super Thursday,\u2019 the Bank cut interest rates to a new record low of 0.25% from 0.5% and hinted they could fall further although governor Mark Carney insisted that rates would not go negative. He also unveiled additional funds for banks to help them pass on the base rate cut to households and businesses, along with more government and corporate bond purchases by the Bank for cash, again to stimulate lending and drive borrowing costs lower. The Bank slashed its growth forecast for the UK for next year by an unprecedented amount. The economy is expected to come to a virtual standstill in coming months, although the Bank expects it to escape recession. It predicted job losses of 250,000 and slower wage growth, following the Brexit vote. Read our full story here. Business organisations and many City economists applauded the surprise package but some people were critical. Kate Barker, a former Bank of England rate-setter, warned ahead of yesterday\u2019s meeting, writing in the Times (\u00a3), that cutting interest rates would do more harm than good, and would fail to boost household or business spending. Tory politician John Redwood, a leading eurosceptic and Brexit campaigner, asked \u201cwhere is the evidence to justify the Bank\u2019s action?\u201d. He wrote on his blog: I read their forecast carefully. It is rightly riddled with uncertainty. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, was also critical, saying the measures gave the impression of \u201coverkill,\u201d and called on the government to do its bit. The contrast between what the MPC did yesterday and what they did in July was quite stark and the fact that the additional QE measures found dissent from three policymakers does appear to suggest some division on the MPC. If a company doesn\u2019t feel compelled to borrow money to invest when base rates are at 0.5%, why would it feel compelled to do so when base rates are at 0.25%? The problem in the UK isn\u2019t availability or cheapness of credit but demand for it, and that demand is only likely to come when the UK government reacts to the slowdown in the economy when it delivers its Autumn Statement later this year. We will be monitoring further reaction to the Bank of England measures as the day goes on. Today, the US non-farm payrolls figures for July are the main event. The latest jobs data are expected to show a gain of around 175,000, down from June\u2019s bumper 287,000, but above the three-month average of 148,000. The jobless rate is forecast to fall to 4.8%. In Germany, factory orders unexpectedly declined in June, by 0.4%. Data from the Economy Ministry in Berlin showed demand for investment goods slumped. But the Bundesbank has sought to reassure investors that Germany\u2019s economy merely paused for breath in the second quarter and that the Brexit vote hadn\u2019t changed the outlook for a pick-up in the current quarter. However, Siemens boss Joe Kaeser warned yesterday that political uncertainty in countries like the UK threatened to hold back orders and investment.",

Indeed that the UK commands such an important share of European export, it is considered to be an excellent platform from which to negotiate a favourable separation from the European Union.

                "bodyText":"With the prospect of low interest rates for longer and further central bank stimulus measures, along with a little more stability in the oil market ahead of a forthcoming Opec meeting, stock markets moved higher once more. Banks were also in demand as the post-Brexit blues wore off and a UK competition inquiry was less arduous for the sector than it had feared. Even signs of a slowdown in the UK economy from the latest NIESR report did not dampen the enthusiasm. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: The FTSE-100 continues to forge its way higher as an upbeat start to the session on Wall Street gives those traders who are still at their desks something else to cheer. The fact that oil prices have staged something of a turn around is certainly helping bolster sentiment, although it\u2019s probably worth adding that if we see this rally for crude being sustained then it starts to up the chances of a September rate hike by the Fed \u2013 and that has the potential to take the shine off gains on a global basis. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 42.17 points or 0.62% at 6851.30 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 2.5% to 10,692.90, its highest level this year France\u2019s Cac closed 1.19% higher at 4468.07 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB edged up 0.31% to 16,796.14 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.2% better at 8665.4 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.36% to 562.4 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 16 points or 0.09%, well off its earlier highs. Meanwhile the pound continued to slip amid talk of further easing by the Bank of England, down 0.3% at $1.2999 and 0.4% lower at \u20ac1.1707. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Stock markets are continuing to move higher, with the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq in the US at new intra-day highs. In Europe, Germany\u2019s Dax is up 2.3% while the FTSE 100 is 46 points or 0.69% better. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: The FTSE bulls have come back out to play today, with the main benchmark pushing into yet another 13-month high. At a time when many would expect the UK to be in the midst of sombre post-referendum introspection, UK markets are instead focusing on the here and now of lower for longer rates and the expectation of years of QE. Amid a wave of tourists taking advantage of a weak sterling, a similarly seismic shift is also likely from an investment point of view, with foreign investors likely to sweep up discounted UK assets. More interest rate cuts and further stimulus measures are likely as the UK economy slows, according to former member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee David Blanchflower. Writing in the Guardian he says the Bank did the right thing by reducing rates last week, but adding that the uncertainty following the Brexit vote is likely to continue for years: The good news is you should be able to make money by buying shares and gold. The bad news is that this will widen inequality further, as it does nothing to help the poor, the young and ordinary strugglers who don\u2019t have assets. The full article is here: The Bank of England has suffered a setback in the bond markets in its first attempt to buy long-dated debt under its new QE programme. Reuters reports: The Bank of England failed to get enough offers for its planned purchase of \u00a31.17bn of government bonds with maturities longer than 15 years, sending gilt yields to new record lows across a range of maturities. The BoE said it received offers worth \u00a31.118bn, resulting in an uncovered reverse auction in its first attempt to buy long-dated debt since it restarted its quantitative easing asset purchase programme after nearly four years. The central bank said it would announce its response to the shortfall on Wednesday at 0800 GMT. Twenty-year gilt yields hit a record low of 1.212 percent and were last down 5 basis points at 1.22 percent. Thirty-year yields hit a record low of 1.374 percent, and were last down 4.9 basis points at 1.385 percent. Yields on five- and 10-year gilts also hit all-time lows. The Bank of England was not immediately available for further comment. The UK economy slowed down by more than expected in July in the wake of the Brexit vote, according to the latest monthly GDP estimates from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, and could foreshadow a recession by the end of 2017. NIESR said output grew by 0.3% in the three months ending in July, following growth of 0.6% in the three months to June and expectations of a figure of 0.4%. The thinktank said the estimates suggested that monthly output declined by 0.2% in July, although it warned that monthly data were volatile. But it added that the estimate was in line with its latest quarterly forecast, which predicted a contraction of 0.2% in the third quarter. James Warren, research fellow at NIESR said: We estimate that in the three months to July the UK economy grew by 0.3 per cent, a marked economic slowdown. The month on month profile suggests that the third quarter has got off to a weak start, with output declining in July. Our estimates suggest that there is around an evens chance of a technical recession by the end of 2017. US markets are following the trend elsewhere in early trading, heading higher as oil prices remain steady at around $45 a barrel. The Dow Jones Industrial Index is currently up 39 points or 0.2% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq both opened marginally ahead. Further signs of the state of the UK economy will come shortly (3pm BST) as independent thinktank NIESR issues its latest GDP estimates. After growth of 0.6% in the three months to June, analysts expect NIESR\u2019s latest estimate for the three months to June to show a decline to around 0.4%. Ana Thaker, market economist at financial group PhillipCapital UK, said: Today\u2019s UK NIESR GDP figures promise to be crucial and will provide a reliable gauge of growth in the UK for July. The first snapshot of post-Brexit Britain from NIESR will no doubt move markets following the momentous decision to cut rates last week. If figures are weak the Bank of England will likely feel vindicated and will add assurance to the markets that their decision was well timed rather than hasty. However, weaker figures could see sterling fall further below the crucial $1.30 level as economic growth fears are confirmed; weak figures combined with the beginning of looser monetary policy could see sterling extend its losing streak and settle at new lows as markets await the effectiveness of new policy measures. Sterling has fallen 1.9% this month alone and underperforms compared to major peers, whilst this was previously viewed as a temporal dip we could see this become the long term trend of the currency. Another chart showing how the pound has weakened to one-month lows today, amid talk of more stimulus measures from the Bank of England: The big problems with America\u2019s weak productivity is that it could drive up the cost of employing people (as wages are currently going up). So, if a firm has skimped on new machinery and used more workers instead, it could easily start laying them off. Bloomberg has a good explanation: Productivity compared with a year earlier fell for the first time since 2013 as lackluster global markets prompted companies to scale back capital investment plans. In the face of deteriorating corporate profits and an absence of faster economic growth, the risk is that businesses may begin to ratchet back the hiring they\u2019ve relied on to meet demand. \u201cFirms have been substituting labor for capital,\u201d Richard Moody, chief economist at Regions Financial Corp. in Birmingham, Alabama, said before the report. \u201cThe advantage for firms is that if growth does fall off, it\u2019s a lot easier to rid yourself of excess labor than it is excess capital.\u201d Worrying news from America.... US productivity shrank by 0.5% in the second quarter of the year, following a 0.6% decline in the first three months. Economists has expected productivity to snap back in Q2, and forecasts a rise of 0.5%. That will fuel concerns about the underlying health of the US economy, as productivity is measured by the output per hour of work. So, while more Americans are getting jobs - and pay rises - it doesn\u2019t seem to be translating into higher productivity. Ian McCafferty\u2019s hint that more Bank of England stimulus could be needed has hit the pound today, says FXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed. Sterling slipped below $1.30 for the first time since July 12 following comments from BoE\u2019s Ian McCafferty that more easing is likely to be required if economic conditions deteriorated. Today marks the fifth consecutive day of declines on pound and the longest losing streak since the Brexit vote... The news that Britain\u2019s manufacturing output shrank by 0.3% in June hasn\u2019t helped the mood towards the pound either. But we should remember that there are two sides to a currency pair, and the dollar is also benefitting from last Friday\u2019s strong US jobs report. Despite the latest grim trade data, Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index has hit a new 14-month high today. The blue-chip index has gained 20 points this morning to 6831, which is its highest level since June 2015 [before fears over China\u2019s economy sparked a rout] That\u2019s partly due to the weakening pound, which boosts the value of international firms who earn money overseas, and gives foreign predators more firepower. David Miller, investment director at Quilter Cheviot, explains: Despite the lurid headlines, the curious thing, as Sherlock Holmes might have observed, is that the dog isn\u2019t barking. UK financial markets are delivering positive returns.... Since the unexpected referendum result sterling has fallen, making corporate UK more competitive on a global basis, short term interest rates have been reduced, but more importantly long term borrowing costs are also significantly lower and takeover activity is picking up because UK assets are now 10% cheaper than they were a month or so ago. The DAX police are out in force, pointing out that Germany\u2019s benchmark stock index is an odd beast - and actually includes dividends paid to shareholders: Good news for German investors. Over in Frankfurt, the DAX index has surged into Bull Market territory - up 20% since February\u2019s low. The pound is heading towards its weakest levels since the June referendum, as traders digest this morning\u2019s news. Sterling is still below $1.30 against the US dollar (down 0.5% at $1.298 right now). And against the euro, the pound has lost 0.4% to around \u20ac1.17. That means one euro is worth 85.4p, close to the 85.7p hit at the end of June. That\u2019s bad news for Brits heading to the continent this summer (unless you bought your euros before June 23rd). A weak pound should help tackle Britain\u2019s trade deficit, though -- but only if there is actual demand for UK goods in Europe. If Brexit causes Europe\u2019s economy to stumble, then exporters might not get a currency bounce. Here\u2019s Larry Elliott\u2019s take on today\u2019s widening UK trade gap: City economists agree that June\u2019s trade figures are pretty dire, although it can\u2019t all be blamed on the EU referendum. Ben Gutteridge, Head of Fund Research at Brewin Dolphin, hopes that the weak pound will help in future: \u201cThe deficit in the UK Trade Balance deepened in June and by an amount more than had been expected. The period over which the data has been collected is broadly pre-Brexit but still helps to confirm the widely acknowledged view that the UK is a bigger importer of goods than it is an exporter. Indeed that the UK commands such an important share of European export, it is considered to be an excellent platform from which to negotiate a favourable separation from the European Union. Of course, the politics of extending a favourable deal to non-members does, in some way, defeat the purposes of having a club, so the outcome of such negotiations remain highly uncertain. \u201cAs for trade figures going forward the drop in sterling will have significantly improved the competiveness of our goods and services globally. Over the medium term, therefore, the UK economy can expect to enjoy a genuine boost to activity, allowing the trade balance to narrow; all else equal. But a weak pound will hit people in the pocket, points out the Resolution\u2019s Group\u2019s Duncan Weldon: Sky News\u2019s Ed Conway fears any improvement will take a while.... Economist Rupert Seggins shows that Britain\u2019s been running a trade deficit for over a decade: Former Bank of England policymaker Andrew Sentance says today\u2019s data has limited use when assessing life after Brexit: Today\u2019s figure also show that Britain ran its largest trade gap with Germany - importing \u00a35.5bn but only exporting \u00a32.67bn. Mind you, the UK ran deficits with most countries -- but did post a surplus with Ireland and the US. Alarmingly, Britain\u2019s \u00a312.5bn trade in goods deficit is the worst for any June, ever, and the highest for any month since March 2015. In June alone, Britain exported \u00a312bn of goods and services to the European Union, up by \u00a3500m compared to May. But Britain also imported \u00a320.3bn from the EU, up by \u00a3800m, so the overall trade gap with the EU worsened. Britain\u2019s trade deficit has worsened after imports hit a new alltime high. The UK\u2019s deficit on trade in goods and services jumped to \u00a35.1bn on in June 2016, up from \u00a34.2bn in May, according to the Office for National Statistics. Exports increased by \u00a31.0bn and imports increased by \u00a31.9bn. Imports reached a record high of \u00a348.9bn. The deficit on trade in goods (which strips out the service sector) rose by \u00a3900m to \u00a312.4bn in June 2016, the ONS adds. The report also shows that Britain\u2019s trade deficit with the rest of the European Union has widened by \u00a3400m over the last three months. That\u2019s because the UK continued to import more than it exported back to its EU neighbours. The ONS says: Between Quarter 1 2016 and Quarter 2 2016, exports of goods to EU countries increased by \u00a31.8 billion due to exports of cars, increasing by \u00a30.4 billion to a record quarterly high of \u00a33.2 billion; oil increased by \u00a30.3 billion and both machinery and chemicals increased by \u00a30.2 billion each. For the same period, imports from the EU increased by \u00a32.2 billion to a record quarterly high of \u00a359.4 billion. This increase reflected a \u00a30.8 billion increase in food, beverages and tobacco; a \u00a30.4 billion increase in machinery; a \u00a30.3 billion increase in oil; and a \u00a30.1 billion increase in aircraft to a record high of \u00a30.9 billion. These increases were offset by a decrease in works of art of \u00a30.2 billion. So, not a great picture for a country facing the uncertainty of Brexit. Reaction to follow! Here we go! First... UK industrial output rose by 0.1% during June, meaning output was 1.6% higher than in June 2015. But the narrower manufacturing output measure shrank by 0.3% during the month, worst than the 0.2% decline expected. There\u2019s not much immediate sign of a Brexit hit. Indeed, industrial output over the last three months grew at the fastest quarterly rate sine 1999 - after a knockout April. Transport manufacturing drove the sector forwards. Britain\u2019s EU referendum is already causing angst in the property market. CBRE, the real estate advisor, says that office values fell by 3.3% across the UK in July, with steeper falls in the capital: The fall in capital values was widely expected and pulled year-on-year growth down to 0.4%. Heightened economic uncertainty, especially for financial services firms, hit offices in the City of London, shrinking capital values by -6.1%. And Savills, the estate agent, has reported that profit at its UK commercial property division more than halved in the first six months of this year. It now hopes, though, that things are back to normal now the vote is out of the wa Here\u2019s something to ponder.... according to the markets, the Bank of England won\u2019t raise interest rates for another 66 months! That takes us all the way through to the end of 2021, or 14 years since the crisis began. One of the Bank of England\u2019s policymakers has also undermined the pound, by predicting further interest rate cuts soon. Writing in The Times, Ian McCafferty says: \u201cIf the economy proves to have turned down in line with the initial survey signals, I believe that more easing is likely to be required, but that can easily be delivered in coming months.\u201d McCafferty voted in favour of last week\u2019s rate cut to 0.25%, but opposed the Bank\u2019s new \u00a360bn quantitative easing scheme. That makes him a relatively hawkish member of the committee. Here\u2019s Jill Treanor\u2019s story on the latest push to improve Britain\u2019s banks: Oh wow, Britain\u2019s borrowing costs have just hit a new record low. 10-year UK gilts are changing hands at a yield of just 0.592%, down from 0.609% last night. This makes it an excellent time to boost government borrowing to fund infrastructure projects.... No-one will be surprised to hear that Germany has posted another whopping trade surplus. German firms exported \u20ac106.8bn of goods in June, while the country imported \u00a382bn. That leaves Berlin with a surplus of \u20ac24.9bn, up from \u20ac23.9bn in May. The FT has more details: Exports to the EU accounted for the biggest growth in June \u2013 rising 2.3 per cent to his \u20ac62.7bn in the same month Britain went to vote on membership of the bloc. Imports from the EU to Germany rose 3.3 per cent, while the country\u2019s trade balance with the eurozone narrowed as imports (3 per cent up) outstripped a 0.1 per cent rise in exports. The pound is falling because traders fear bad news at 9.30am, reckons Connor Campbell of SpreadEx: Following a deathly dull and data-less Monday thing should be a bit more interesting this morning, with another wave of UK figures on their way. The reason behind sterling\u2019s Tuesday slide appears to be the prospect of more goods trade deficit bad news, with the gap between Britain\u2019s imports and exports expected to widen to \u00a32.5 billion from \u00a32.2 billion last month. UK consumers are refusing to be alarmed by the Brexit vote, according to a new report released overnight. Retail sales jumped by 1.1% in July, the fastest rate in six months. It was driven by warmer weather, which sent shoppers scrambling for new outfits, plus discounting from stores keen to shift stock. The pound is falling like one of Britain\u2019s fantastic synchronised divers this morning. Traders are selling sterling, as traders wait for this morning\u2019s trade balance and manufacturing report. The pound dropped by half a cent against the US dollar, to $1.298. This is a near one-month low; the pound hasn\u2019t been below $1.30 since mid July. This fall is being driven by expectations that the Bank of England will keep easing monetary policy in the months ahead, as part of its Brexit plans. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, says: Sentiment remains bearish towards the UK economy and speculations may heighten over the Bank of England taking further action if economic data continues to follow this negative path. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Coming up today.... we\u2019re about to discover how Britain\u2019s economy fared in the month of the EU referendum. The latest trade figures for June are due at 9.30am, and are expected to show that the UK ran a chunky current account deficit with the rest of the world (as usual). The gap between what Britain imported and exported is tipped to widen to around \u00a32.5bn in June, compared to \u00a32.2bn in May. And an industrial production report expected to show that manufacturing output fell by 0.2% in June, following a 0.5% decline in May. Other recent data has suggested that business confidence has taken a severe knock, but that consumers are relatively relaxed about the Brexit vote, so today\u2019s data could give new insights into the state of play. Germany is also posting trade data this morning, so we\u2019ll be able to compare its (traditional) trade surplus with the UK deficit. Then at 3pm, the NIESR thinktank publishes its estimate of UK growth in the May-to-July quarter. Will that show a Brexit hit too? Also coming up today.... The Competitions and Markets Authority is publishing its report into UK banking reforms, outlining ways to improve customer service and help the public switch banks. And we\u2019re also getting corporate news from estate agent Savills, and insurer Standard Life.",

However, loopholes and safe harbour clauses are easy to identify as most central banks are allowed to do \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 to fulfil their mandate. </p> <p>In practice, the central bank would deliver money to the treasury by receiving a meaningless asset (i.e. a zero coupon perpetual bond) in exchange, or \u2013 preferably - without any quid pro quo agreement. In either case, there would be no planned reimbursement for the sums extended. It is important that \u2013 at least for some time \u2013 this money creation is seen as permanent and irreversible, to avoid creating fears of challenging times ahead, and the associated desire to save, not spend or invest. </p> <p>The more orthodox central bankers have nothing to fear as they would be in the driving seat. They would have the power to impose conditions and participate in the decision-making process of how this money should be spent.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0c9abf64ca6316d30199967bb1e3a5f267268068\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c9abf64ca6316d30199967bb1e3a5f267268068/785_0_2615_2848/918.jpg\" alt=\"Could helicopter money be on the way?\" width=\"918\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Could helicopter money be on the way?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>In addition to ageing demographics in a number of key economic areas, there are three issues today that should be tackled. These are anaemic aggregate demand, persistence of excess supply and a growing social inequality. Any HM initiative must be dedicated to projects that aim to cure these.</p> <p>It should help the majority of households by increasing their welfare and enhancing their disposable income, fostering confidence and promoting consumer spending, in order to benefit the majority of the population rather than enrich asset-holders by inflating financial asset prices. There could also be spending on long-term themes like education, and on structural issues strangling the economy, such as the banking\u2019s sector non-performing assets. </p> <p>We need a fiscal plan that aims to generate real prosperity without incurring public indebtedness, or offsetting its benefits with fears of a gloomier future in which debts must be repaid. It should also attempt to create inflation expectations, and trigger higher interest rates. While higher borrowing costs would mean weaker businesses would not survive, the profitability of the banking sector would be enhanced and insurance companies would receive crucial support. Perhaps, this policy could also lower the liabilities of defined benefit pension funds. Ultimately, inflation is the only solution to today\u2019s global debt problem. Some inflation would reduce the real value of the accumulated debt.</p> <p>All this considered, the question is how much money should be created and spent? The calibration of an HM policy would be much easier than that of QE. While QE relies on an uncertain transmission mechanism, whether banks will lend more or hoard the additional cash, the multiplier effect of HM is easier to forecast. </p> <p>Only once the growth and inflation objectives are reached, would an exit policy be publicly discussed. Any overheating would be controlled by fiscal and monetary measures.</p> </blockquote> <p>He concludes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I believe that HM is superior to QE, and much better suited to our current challenges.

July is usually the second highest month for receipts during the financial year, reflecting the timing of corporation tax and self-assessment (SA) payments.<br></p> <p>2) The underlying reason for the slightly smaller surplus than last year was that the 2.2 per cent growth in central government accrued receipts (excluding APF transfers) was slower than the 4.2 per cent growth in central government spending (excluding grants to local authorities). <strong>The rise in central government spending mostly reflected growth in departmental spending</strong>. Growth in central government receipts was depressed by weak income tax receipts, although this partly reflects timing effects as the first self-assessment (SA) payment deadline fell on a weekend this year.<br></p> <p>3) <strong>Meeting our March <em>EFO</em> forecast for PSNB in 2016-17 would require it to fall by \u00a319.8 billion over the full financial year. A third of the way through the financial year, PSNB was only \u00a33.0 billion lower than last year.</strong> While prospects for the rest of the year are subject to greater uncertainty than usual due to the result of the EU referendum, it is still worth noting that receipts and spending data are volatile from month to month and prone to revision, especially at this relatively early stage of the year.<br></p> <p>4) <strong>However, despite these timing effects, there is still evidence that growth in PAYE, NICs and stamp duty land tax (SDLT) was slower in the first four months of the year than would be required to meet our March forecast for the year as a whole.</strong> July\u2019s data cover the first full month since the UK\u2019s referendum on membership of the EU, but a very substantial proportion of the data in this month\u2019s release is either a forecast or still reflects economic activity prior to the referendum.

                "bodyText":"The number of oil rigs in the US increased again last week in a further sign of raised production. The Baker Hughes weekly report showed 10 rigs were added in all, taking the total to 491 and marking the eighth weekly increase in a row. All of them were oil rigs with no gas rigs added. The crude price, which was at eight week highs earlier in the week on hopes of a deal next month to freeze output, is hovering in negative territory following the figures. Brent crude is down 0.49% at $50.64 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - has slipped lower and is off 0.06% at $48.19. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the week. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back on Monday. Heading into the weekend, the uncertainty over when the US Federal Reserve could raise interest rates has made for a cautious end to the trading week. Dovish minutes on Wednesday suggested a rate hike was off the table in the near future but subsequent comments from Fed members seemed to indicate otherwise. With oil slipping back from its recent highs, markets came under pressure again, although the August lull has meant trading volumes are thin. The final scores showed: The FTSe 100 finished down 10.01 points or 0.15% at 6858.95, with the index recording its worst weekly performance since mid-June Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.55% to 10,544.36 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.82% lower at 4400.52 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 2.18% to 16,310.06 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 1.16% at 8450.6 In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.91% to 561.32 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 24 points or 0.13% lower. And here comes the denial: A Bloomberg report suggesting that the UK government wants to trigger Article 50 - the start of the two year Brexit process - by next April has sent the pound lower. Up until now, the UK was expected to delay Article 50 until at least the end of next year. ETX Capital said: Big sell-off in sterling this afternoon amid rumours the UK wants to invoke Article 50 in the first half of 2017. Cable is down more than 1% and flirting with the $1.30 level again after a report said Theresa May would like to start the exit process before French and German elections next year. That means invoking Article 50 by April, putting paid to speculation that the UK would have several years to prepare to leave the EU. The less time the UK has to get things in order, the greater the market fears the fallout. But sterling is still on course to end the week higher, having enjoyed solid gains on much stronger-than-expected retail sales yesterday, which suggests consumers at least are not downcast. The pound is currently down 0.9% at $1.3052 and 0.6% lower against the euro at $1.1521. As expected, US markets have followed the trend elsewhere, slipping back in early trading on talk of the Federal Reserve perhaps hiking rates sooner than had been expected. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 94 points or 0.5% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both opened around 0.2% lower. Earlier this week there were protests outside the Bank of England against its quantitative easing programme, with calls for different measures to be used. One such is so-called helicopter money, and one supporter of the idea is Marino Valensise, head of the multi asset and income at Barings. He says: In simple terms, HM is \u201cmonetary financing of fiscal spending\u201d, a central bank who prints money for its government to spend; a practice definitely not included in the Bundesbank\u2019s instruction manual. However, we should keep an open mind after all - Mario Draghi sees it as a \u201cvery interesting concept\u201d and Loretta Mester from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland considers it a possible \u201cnext step if \u2026 we wanted to be more accommodative\u201d. It is therefore important that we analyse, in simple terms, how HM could work. The first step would be to assess whether this type of monetary financing is allowed under current laws and regulations. In most jurisdictions, rules exist and limit the actions of a central bank. Examples include Article 123 of the Treaty of Lisbon (EU), Article 5 of the Fiscal Act (Japan) and the Treasury Fed Accord of 1951 (US). However, loopholes and safe harbour clauses are easy to identify as most central banks are allowed to do \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 to fulfil their mandate. In practice, the central bank would deliver money to the treasury by receiving a meaningless asset (i.e. a zero coupon perpetual bond) in exchange, or \u2013 preferably - without any quid pro quo agreement. In either case, there would be no planned reimbursement for the sums extended. It is important that \u2013 at least for some time \u2013 this money creation is seen as permanent and irreversible, to avoid creating fears of challenging times ahead, and the associated desire to save, not spend or invest. The more orthodox central bankers have nothing to fear as they would be in the driving seat. They would have the power to impose conditions and participate in the decision-making process of how this money should be spent. In addition to ageing demographics in a number of key economic areas, there are three issues today that should be tackled. These are anaemic aggregate demand, persistence of excess supply and a growing social inequality. Any HM initiative must be dedicated to projects that aim to cure these. It should help the majority of households by increasing their welfare and enhancing their disposable income, fostering confidence and promoting consumer spending, in order to benefit the majority of the population rather than enrich asset-holders by inflating financial asset prices. There could also be spending on long-term themes like education, and on structural issues strangling the economy, such as the banking\u2019s sector non-performing assets. We need a fiscal plan that aims to generate real prosperity without incurring public indebtedness, or offsetting its benefits with fears of a gloomier future in which debts must be repaid. It should also attempt to create inflation expectations, and trigger higher interest rates. While higher borrowing costs would mean weaker businesses would not survive, the profitability of the banking sector would be enhanced and insurance companies would receive crucial support. Perhaps, this policy could also lower the liabilities of defined benefit pension funds. Ultimately, inflation is the only solution to today\u2019s global debt problem. Some inflation would reduce the real value of the accumulated debt. All this considered, the question is how much money should be created and spent? The calibration of an HM policy would be much easier than that of QE. While QE relies on an uncertain transmission mechanism, whether banks will lend more or hoard the additional cash, the multiplier effect of HM is easier to forecast. Only once the growth and inflation objectives are reached, would an exit policy be publicly discussed. Any overheating would be controlled by fiscal and monetary measures. He concludes: I believe that HM is superior to QE, and much better suited to our current challenges. It represents a pragmatic and superior alternative to any other policy, although it cannot be a panacea for structural issues such as poor demographics. In a heavily indebted world, suffering from low economic growth and facing serious political issues originating from inequality, HM has the potential to outperform any other policy. We must consider it now, or be forced to implement it in a hurry when the next economic recession hits. Ahead of the US open, European markets are in negative territory as investors shy away from shares on renewed talk of a possible US interest rate rise after some hawkish comments from Federal Reserve board members. The Stoxx 600 is down around 0.7%, heading for its biggest weekly loss since the middle of June. Earlier in the week the index hit a seven week high, but such volatility is typical of summer markets with light volumes. Meanwhile Germany\u2019s Dax has dropped 0.39% and France\u2019s Cac is down 0.86%. The FTSE 100 is virtually flat, however, down just 0.09% although it too is on track for its biggest weekly fall since mid-June. Oil remains above $50 a barrel although it has slipped back from recent highs, with Brent crude down 0.5% at $50.63. Sterling is fairly flat against the dollar at $1.3078 but is down 0.34% against the euro at \u20ac1.1557. Several hours ago, I promised fresh news about the economic crisis in Mongolia (we\u2019re a broad church in the liveblog). And S&amp;P have stepped up (ahem) by downgrading Mongolia\u2019s credit-rating from B to B-. That\u2019s deep into \u2018junk\u2019 territory, and just five notches above default. The credit rating agency also slashed its growth forecast in 2016 to 1.3%, down from 2.6%. It says: Our lower growth estimate stems partly from the ancillary effects of Mongolia\u2019s weaker terms of trade and partly from the country\u2019s mixed mining policies, which discouraged foreign direct investment. Another key deteriorating risk factor for Mongolia relates to its public finances. Mongolia has been hit hard by China\u2019s slowing economy, which eroded demand for its natural resources. That has left Mongolia short of foreign currency reserves, and pushed its deficit up. The country\u2019s new finance minister warned of a \u201cdeep economic crisis\u201d last week, which could leave it unable to pay civil servants\u2019 salaries. The Mongolian currency, the togrog, has been sliding in value ever since, forcing Mongolia\u2019s central bank to hike interest rates by 4.5% (!) yesterday, to 15%. Mongolia hasn\u2019t been a world power for centuries, so it\u2019s not too surprising that this crisis has slipped under the radar. But it\u2019s still worth taking seriously. Bloomberg have done a great piece on Mongolia\u2019s problems - here\u2019s a flavour: Mongolia, a mineral-rich and landlocked $12 billion economy bordering Russia and China, is staring at a full-blown balance of payments crisis. It\u2019s caused barely a ripple in global financial markets, but the nation\u2019s economic meltdown offers instructive lessons to far bigger resource-reliant economies like Brazil, Venezuela, Russia and Saudi Arabia. This is an economy that gives new meaning to what economists call the resource curse. An overabundance of natural resources can result in lopsided economic growth, government waste and boom-bust cycles that can leave a country\u2019s finances in tatters. \u201cMongolia should be much richer than it is,\u201d said Lutz Roehmeyer, a money manager at Landesbank Berlin Investment who helps oversee about $12 billion of investments including local-currency Mongolian debt. \u201cThere is nowhere else in the world where it is so easy to dig up resources without any problems and sell the commodities to China with such low transportation costs.\u201d Britain\u2019s independent fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, has warned that the government is on track to overshoot its borrowing targets in 2016-17. The OBR is concerned that tax receipt growths have slowed this year, pulling July\u2019s surplus down to only \u00a31bn. Unless that changes, Britain would fail to cut the deficit to \u00a355.5bn this financial year (from \u00a375.3bn), it fears. Here\u2019s the OBR\u2019s official response to today\u2019s figures (i\u2019ve bolded the key points): 1) Public sector net borrowing (PSNB) recorded a surplus of \u00a31.0 billion in July, a \u00a30.2 billion deterioration on last year\u2019s surplus. The surplus was \u00a30.9 billion below market expectations. July is usually the second highest month for receipts during the financial year, reflecting the timing of corporation tax and self-assessment (SA) payments. 2) The underlying reason for the slightly smaller surplus than last year was that the 2.2 per cent growth in central government accrued receipts (excluding APF transfers) was slower than the 4.2 per cent growth in central government spending (excluding grants to local authorities). The rise in central government spending mostly reflected growth in departmental spending. Growth in central government receipts was depressed by weak income tax receipts, although this partly reflects timing effects as the first self-assessment (SA) payment deadline fell on a weekend this year. 3) Meeting our March EFO forecast for PSNB in 2016-17 would require it to fall by \u00a319.8 billion over the full financial year. A third of the way through the financial year, PSNB was only \u00a33.0 billion lower than last year. While prospects for the rest of the year are subject to greater uncertainty than usual due to the result of the EU referendum, it is still worth noting that receipts and spending data are volatile from month to month and prone to revision, especially at this relatively early stage of the year. 4) However, despite these timing effects, there is still evidence that growth in PAYE, NICs and stamp duty land tax (SDLT) was slower in the first four months of the year than would be required to meet our March forecast for the year as a whole. July\u2019s data cover the first full month since the UK\u2019s referendum on membership of the EU, but a very substantial proportion of the data in this month\u2019s release is either a forecast or still reflects economic activity prior to the referendum. That means there is still little firm evidence on how the referendum result might affect the public finances this year. More here. The pound has dropped by half a cent against the US dollar so far today, to $1.312. But even so, sterling has still gained 1.6%, or two cents, this week. The pound has rallied as new inflation, unemployment and retail sales figures all came in stronger than expected, easing fears of an immediate slump following the Brexit vote. Here\u2019s our new Boom or Doom round-up of the week\u2019s economic data: In other news, Britain\u2019 s housing market seemed to cool last month, with estate agents seeing fewer potential buyers.... John McDonnell MP, Shadow Chancellor, is concerned that Britain\u2019s \u00a31bn surplus in July is smaller than a year ago. He says: Today\u2019s public finances show a budget surplus that has fallen compared to this time last year. And the Treasury\u2019s own comparisons of independent economic forecasts show a dramatic revision downwards in growth and upwards in inflation, unemployment and public sector net borrowing. McDonnell argues that the government should be urgently revising its fiscal plans, rather than leaving us all in suspense until the autumn statement: The UK economy needs immediate investment from the Government, rather than sticking to the failed policies of George Osborne which have helped create the problem. Britain is on hold waiting for Philip Hammond to tell us whether he will stick to his predecessor\u2019s planned cuts to investment, and firms and households can\u2019t wait until the autumn to find out. \u201cThe country needs a different plan that will end austerity, and start to invest in the infrastructure and housing a 21st century economy demands. That\u2019s why Labour would invest \u00a3500 billion to rebuild and transform our economy.\u201d Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics has crunched today\u2019s public finance numbers, and concluded that the government is on track to miss its borrowing target for 2016-17. Here\u2019s his workings out: He reckons this will give Philip Hammond little wriggle room (unless he abandons deficit reduction altogether, I guess) \u201cJuly\u2019s relatively small surplus means that the Chancellor will be able to put together only a modest package of measures to support the economy in the Autumn Statement later this year.\u201d Chancellor Philip Hammond will be \u201cslightly disappointed\u201d that July\u2019s surplus dipped to just below \u00a31bn, from \u00a31.2bn in July 2015, reckons Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight. July usually sees a surplus in the public finances as it is a key month for tax receipts). While the public finances are expected to be increasingly pressurized by the Brexit vote going forward, it was premature for there to have been much impact in July. However, the ONS did indicate that the July figures included forecasts and the data can also be influenced by different timings of tax payments. George Osborne has put down his gun and turned to Twitter: And here it is... Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, isn\u2019t terribly impressed by today\u2019s numbers: \u201cJuly\u2019s surplus was smaller than the \u00a31.2bn surplus recorded in July 2015 and left public borrowing in the fiscal year to date at \u00a323.7bn, only 11.3% lower than the \u00a326.7bn seen in the same period in 2015-16. This compares with the OBR\u2019s Budget forecast of a 26.3% drop in borrowing for 2016-17 as a whole. That forecast will be history, though, though, if Philip Hammond tears up gun-totin\u2019 George Osborne\u2019s fiscal strategy..... Here\u2019s Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, on today\u2019s public finance data: \u2018July is normally one of the bumper months for tax receipts, because HMRC gets a lot of payments of income tax from self-employed people, and also quarterly corporation tax payments from companies, which is why the government found itself quids in last month. Of course the elephant in the room is Brexit, and what effect this will have on tax receipts going forward, but so far the hard economic data has actually been pretty robust, though it\u2019s obviously very early days. Laith adds that chancellor Philip Hammond may tear up the government\u2019s austerity programme in the autumn statement: That could well see previous borrowing targets thrown out of the window, if the new government decides supporting the economy is more important than keeping a lid on debt.\u2019 PwC chief economist John Hawksworth has cast his expert eye over Britain\u2019s public finances, and concluded that they\u2019re not too shabby. \u201cThe public finances were in surplus by \u00a31 billion in July, which is a reasonable performance albeit slightly down on the \u00a31.2 billion budget surplus recorded in July 2015. \u201cFor the four months to July, the cumulative budget deficit in this financial year is running around \u00a33 billion lower than in the same period last year, though the rate of deficit reduction has been slower than the OBR forecast back in March. But while there\u2019s no immediate sign of a Brexit shock, the full impact of June\u2019s referendum won\u2019t be seen for some time (as ONS chief economist Joe Grice also warned this morning). Hawksworth explains: \u201cOverall, as with other official data released this week for retail sales and the unemployment claimant count, there is no real sign yet of a downturn in economic fortunes following the Brexit vote. But it will be some months before we get a clearer picture of this as it will take time for companies to adjust their investment and hiring plans to the new post-referendum environment.\u201d The Chief Secretary to the Treasury, David Gauke, says today\u2019s public finances show Britain is in good shape to handle the aftermath of the EU referendum vote. Here\u2019s his official statement: \u201cWith the public finances in surplus in July, our economy starts from a position of strength to face any economic turbulence following the vote to leave the EU. \u201cAs we keep working to cut the deficit, we are well-placed to handle any challenges and seize the opportunities as our economy adjusts. We are determined to build on our economic strengths to ensure Britain is a country that works for everyone.\u201d Correction: The UK national debt is \u00a31.6 TRILLION, of course, not \u00a31.6bn. Apologies, and thanks to those of you who kindly pointed it out. #grauniad. July\u2019s \u00a31bn surplus won\u2019t make much of a dent in Britain\u2019s national debt. The UK now owes \u00a31.6 trillion  to investors, which equates to 82.9% of GDP (the value of all the goods and services currently produced by the UK economy in a year). But the national debt does seem to be levelling out, as a percentage of GDP. Fraser Munro, public sector finance statistician at the ONS, is tweeting the key points from today\u2019s data. This chart shows how the UK has borrowed less this year, than in 2015-2016. More details: Anyone looking for evidence of Brexit vote impact in today\u2019s report should tread cautiously, says the ONS, as the figures could easily be revised in future. The data presented in this bulletin presents the latest fiscal position of the public sector as at 31 July 2016 and so includes the first post-EU referendum data. However, estimates for the latest period always contain a substantial forecast element and so any post-referendum impact may not become clear for some time. The BBC\u2019s Joe Lynam reminds us that July\u2019s public finances are usually decent, as firms often pay their quarterly corporation tax bills. Breaking: Britain ran a surplus of \u00a31bn in July, thanks to a pick-up in corporation tax receipts. That\u2019s less than some analysts had expected. But this means that so far this financial year, UK has borrowed \u00a33bn less than a year ago, suggesting that the government\u2019s deficit-reduction plan may still be on course. The Public sector net borrowing requirement in July came in at minus \u00a31.472bn last month, the Office for National Statistics reports. Excluding the impact of state-owned banks, and the surplus shrinks to \u00a3977m. Corporation tax receipts were the strongest for any July since 2011, the ONS adds. And this means that Britain has borrowed \u00a323.7bn since the start of the financial year in April, which is the smallest deficit since the financial crisis. More here: Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit agrees with Joe Grice.... Today\u2019s public finances will show whether the UK government is still on track to hit its deficit targets for this financial year. Former chancellor George Osborne has his mind on other issues, though \u2013 he\u2019s been spied blasting a machine gun at a former Viet Cong base near Ho Chi Minh city. Probably less dangerous than inflicting his threatened punishment budget on the UK.... A lacklustre start to trading has seen London\u2019s FTSE 100 index drop by 17 points, or 0.24%, to 6852 points. But budget airline easyJet is defying the selloff. Its shares have jumped by 2.6% to the top of the Footsie leaderboard. The Times\u2019s Dominic Walsh has heard some chatter about a possible takeover, but it sounds pretty speculative. And in a quiet summer, it doesn\u2019t take much to move shares. So we shall see.... Oil has hit its highest level since the EU referendum, driven by ongoing speculation that producers could reach some kind of deal soon. Brent hit $51.22 per barrel, an eight-week high, putting it on track for its eighth day in a row. Traders are calculating that the OPEC cartel might agree some measures to shore up the oil price, when they meet in Algeria in September The Telegraph\u2019s Tara Cunningham flags up that oil has now gained 22% since August 2, putting it in a Bull Market again. Quite a turnaround in two weeks.... This was billed as the week when Britain would discover the economic pain caused by the Brexit vote. And the patient looks to be in better health than some experts had feared. So far, we\u2019ve learned that: Inflation: rose to 0.6% in July from 0.5%, but with no evidence of a Brexit effect Unemployment: A welcome fall in the claimant count in July, while the jobless rate remained at 4.9% in April-June Retail Sales: Smashed expectations in July, with a 1.4% jump So can we put fears of a Brexit recession to bed? Not according to Joe Grice, the chief economist of the Office for National Statistics. Speaking on Bloomberg TV this morning, Grice explained that it\u2019s too early to really know the impact of the EU referendum vote. For example, the labour market report shows that Brexit uncertainty in the run-up to the referendum didn\u2019t hurt the economy much, but doesn\u2019t really show the impact of the vote. The 1.4% jump in July retail sales, though, is \u201chard\u201d evidence of what\u2019s happening in the real economy. All retail sectors did well, especially department stores and clothing shops. But.... They don\u2019t tell us anything about what businesses were doing, they don\u2019t say anything about trade.....but they do say that consumers were spending strongly. That suggests that fears of a \u201ccatastrophic fall in consumer confidence\u201d immediately after the referendum can be crossed off, as it hasn\u2019t happened, Grice adds. But still.... Does that mean there won\u2019t be a recession? No. The story is still to unfold. More details here. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After a week of largely encouraging economic data from Britain, there\u2019s still one important measure before we can clock off for the weekend - July\u2019s UK public finances. Due at 9.30am, this will show whether the British government had to borrow from international investors to balance the books in the weeks after the EU referendum. July is usually a good month for tax receipts, so the City is hoping that Westminster may actually have run a surplus - of perhaps \u00a32.2bn. That would indicate that the economy was motoring along pretty well. A poor reading, though, might reignite concerns that growth is slowing - despite the moderate price pressures, low unemployment and strong consumer spending reported this week. And a quick truffle through this morning\u2019s research notes show that analysts are a little concerned. Paul Hollingsworth of Capital Economics expects to be underwhelmed: The first post-referendum set of public borrowing figures look set to be disappointing. We have pencilled in a surplus of \u00a31bn in July, marginally lower than a year ago. And the team at RBS Capital Markets fears Britain may actually have run up a deficit in July: July is seasonally a good month for tax receipts with a second wave of self-assessment tax payments, quarterly corporation tax instalments and the first of three payments through the year by oil and gas firms. The OBR has said it planned for modest tax receipts from those oil and gas companies on the back of weak commodity prices. Our simple arithmetic process points to a surplus on the government budget of \u00a31bn for July, but in light of modest expectations for those tax receipts and poor outturns in earlier months of this financial year the risk is for a smaller surplus or possibly even a deficit. There\u2019s not much else on the agenda today, but we\u2019ll keep an eye on the oil price, and a nasty economic crisis unfolding in Mongolia (more on that shortly....)

Her comments at Jackson Hole in the US on Friday afternoon will be scrutinised for hints about when the central bank could raise interest rates, with various analysts expecting her to be hawkish, dovish or neutral. With that uncertainty it is no surprise that investors have been erring on the side of caution. And after recent falls in the oil price, along with a drop in pharmaceutical shares following comments on excessive pricing by US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, stock markets ended the day in negative territory. The final scores showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 finished 18.88 points or 0.28% lower at 6816.90</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.88% to 10529.59</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.65% at 4406.61</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.07% to 16710.78</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.65% at 8599.5</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.37% to 565.83</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently fairly stable, down just 6 points or 0.04%.</p> <p><em>On that note, we\u2019ll close for the evening.

After appearances from Dudley and Fischer last week, today\u2019s input from voting member George adds yet another voice to the increasingly deafening push for a rate hike in the coming months. With the election looking unpredictable, the likeliness is that members will see December as the month to press the button once more, one year on from the contentious 2015 rise. It is hard to see Janet Yellen delivering anything other than a relatively hawkish outlook tomorrow [at Jackson Hole] and with the dollar having suffered heavily in recent weeks, tomorrow could be a turning point for foreign exchange markets.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57bf0813e4b0568600c043aa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-25T15:08:16.331Z\">4.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Another comment suggesting that the Jackson Hole gathering of central bankers in the US could be a damp squib, despite expectations that Fed chair Janet Yellen could hint at future rate rises. David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Investors continue to hold back from taking on additional market exposure ahead of tomorrow\u2019s speech from Janet Yellen at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium. Few expect the Fed Chairman to say anything explicit about the likelihood or timing of what would be the US central bank\u2019s first rate hike since December last year. Nevertheless, there are hopes that she may give some clues as to the Fed\u2019s thinking over the state of the US economy, and indeed any risks facing the global economy as well.</p> <p>Last week we heard hawkish rhetoric from three Fed members. Then on Sunday Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer provided an upbeat outlook for the US economy saying that he expected growth to pick up following a particularly weak second quarter. Not only that, but he said that the Fed\u2019s targets for inflation and unemployment (the dual mandate) were close to being hit. If Yellen is similarly upbeat in her speech tomorrow, then investors will price in an increased possibility of a September hike.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a50a3b0195a5e2b38fe60a4075ed6a990ed708ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a50a3b0195a5e2b38fe60a4075ed6a990ed708ae/0_329_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Uncertainty over Federal Reserve rate outlook\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Uncertainty over Federal Reserve rate outlook</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>But despite all this chatter and speculation, it seems unlikely that Yellen will want to paint herself into a corner over the future direction of US monetary policy.</p> <p>Consequently, it could be that there\u2019s little of substance in the speech. While we\u2019ve had a clutch of Fed-heads out there trying to persuade investors that September is still \u201clive\u201d when it comes to a rate hike, the minutes from the last meeting in July showed that only one out of ten FOMC-voting members was in favour of tightening monetary policy. In addition, we\u2019ll get a stack of fresh economic data ahead of the Fed\u2019s next meeting, including Non-Farm Payrolls, Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing PMIs and inflation numbers. There\u2019s really no point in committing to any course of action until the Fed sees these reports.</p> <p>Finally, I don\u2019t believe that the FOMC has the faintest idea what they should do at the next meeting. And unfortunately we now have a central bank which pays too much attention to stock market movements and appears to relish its ability to influence short-term investor behaviour.</p> <p>Overall, I think there\u2019s just too much importance being attached to this speech. Jackson Hole was a fairly obscure event in years gone by.

                "bodyText":"it has been the main obsession with stock markets for most of the week, but the long awaited speech by Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is almost upon us. Her comments at Jackson Hole in the US on Friday afternoon will be scrutinised for hints about when the central bank could raise interest rates, with various analysts expecting her to be hawkish, dovish or neutral. With that uncertainty it is no surprise that investors have been erring on the side of caution. And after recent falls in the oil price, along with a drop in pharmaceutical shares following comments on excessive pricing by US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, stock markets ended the day in negative territory. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 18.88 points or 0.28% lower at 6816.90 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.88% to 10529.59 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.65% at 4406.61 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.07% to 16710.78 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.65% at 8599.5 In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.37% to 565.83 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently fairly stable, down just 6 points or 0.04%. On that note, we\u2019ll close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, adds his voice to those expecting a US rate rise in December: Esther George of the Kansas Fed gave markets something to chew over, with yet another hawkish comment coming in a long line of Fed members keen to talk about higher rates. After appearances from Dudley and Fischer last week, today\u2019s input from voting member George adds yet another voice to the increasingly deafening push for a rate hike in the coming months. With the election looking unpredictable, the likeliness is that members will see December as the month to press the button once more, one year on from the contentious 2015 rise. It is hard to see Janet Yellen delivering anything other than a relatively hawkish outlook tomorrow [at Jackson Hole] and with the dollar having suffered heavily in recent weeks, tomorrow could be a turning point for foreign exchange markets. Another comment suggesting that the Jackson Hole gathering of central bankers in the US could be a damp squib, despite expectations that Fed chair Janet Yellen could hint at future rate rises. David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco, said: Investors continue to hold back from taking on additional market exposure ahead of tomorrow\u2019s speech from Janet Yellen at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium. Few expect the Fed Chairman to say anything explicit about the likelihood or timing of what would be the US central bank\u2019s first rate hike since December last year. Nevertheless, there are hopes that she may give some clues as to the Fed\u2019s thinking over the state of the US economy, and indeed any risks facing the global economy as well. Last week we heard hawkish rhetoric from three Fed members. Then on Sunday Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer provided an upbeat outlook for the US economy saying that he expected growth to pick up following a particularly weak second quarter. Not only that, but he said that the Fed\u2019s targets for inflation and unemployment (the dual mandate) were close to being hit. If Yellen is similarly upbeat in her speech tomorrow, then investors will price in an increased possibility of a September hike. But despite all this chatter and speculation, it seems unlikely that Yellen will want to paint herself into a corner over the future direction of US monetary policy. Consequently, it could be that there\u2019s little of substance in the speech. While we\u2019ve had a clutch of Fed-heads out there trying to persuade investors that September is still \u201clive\u201d when it comes to a rate hike, the minutes from the last meeting in July showed that only one out of ten FOMC-voting members was in favour of tightening monetary policy. In addition, we\u2019ll get a stack of fresh economic data ahead of the Fed\u2019s next meeting, including Non-Farm Payrolls, Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing PMIs and inflation numbers. There\u2019s really no point in committing to any course of action until the Fed sees these reports. Finally, I don\u2019t believe that the FOMC has the faintest idea what they should do at the next meeting. And unfortunately we now have a central bank which pays too much attention to stock market movements and appears to relish its ability to influence short-term investor behaviour. Overall, I think there\u2019s just too much importance being attached to this speech. Jackson Hole was a fairly obscure event in years gone by. It only attained its current significance when Ben Bernanke used it as a forum for market manipulation in the wake of the 2008/9 financial crisis. It would be better for all if it went back to being a boring conference for boring people. Back with the UK, and the strong retail sales figures from the CBI back up the idea that any negative effects of Brexit on the economy will only appear slowly, writes economic editor Larry Elliott: While we wait for Fed chair Janet Yellen on Friday, and any hints she gives on US interest rates, there is at least one board member of the US central bank suggesting a rise could be imminent. Speaking on CNBC, Dallas Federal Reserve president Robert Kaplan said the bank should be able to hike rates in the not too distant future, and the case for a rise was strengthening. He said progress was being made on employment and - more slowly - inflation. The latest PMI data means a US rate rise in September is unlikely but could signal a move in December, said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at Markit: The ongoing lacklustre economic growth signalled by the flash PMI suggests GDP growth is failing to accelerate in the third quarter from the weak 1.2% pace seen in the second quarter. Historical comparisons indicate that the PMI is signalling an annualised GDP growth rate of just under 1% in the third quarter, based on the data for July and August. With job creation also waning alongside subdued price pressures (the August PMI is consistent with non-farm payrolls rising by just under 130,000), the survey data will fuel expectations that the Fed will be in no rush to tighten policy again. However, as anecdotal evidence from the survey suggests that business activity is being dampened by uncertainty due to the upcoming presidential election, there\u2019s a good chance that the economy will pick up speed again after the vote, leaving a December rate hike on the table. After the better than expected US durable goods and jobless claims figures, a service sector survey for August has missed forecasts. The IHS Markit service sector initial PMI came in at 50.9, down from 51.4 in July and below forecasts of 52. This was the weakest rise in services activity since February. Markit said: U.S. service providers indicated another month of lacklustre growth in August, with business activity, new orders and employment all rising at a slower pace than in July. Survey respondents generally cited subdued underlying demand conditions and uncertainty ahead of the presidential election as factors that had dampened growth in August. Nonetheless, the balance of service sector firms expecting a rise in business activity over the year ahead remained well above the survey-record low seen in June. The composite PMI slipped from 51.8 in July to 51.5. As investors await Fed chair Janet Yellen\u2019s speech at the Jackson Hole symposium on Friday, US markets are heading lower in early trading. There is growing uncertainty over the timing of any US interest rate rise, and Yellen\u2019s comments will be scoured for any hints. Meanwhile the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 12 points while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.18% lower. Neil Wilson, market analyst at ETX Capital is decidedly underwhelmed at the prospect of Jackson Hole: Don\u2019t expect much from Jackson Hole. The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\u2019s annual economic policy symposium is a serious, sombre affair. It is not a policy meeting, nor is it meant to drive expectations for future policy decisions. It\u2019s a talking shop and we should take the goods on offer with a healthy dose of salt. Markets are incredibly quiet this August (in sharp contrast to last year) so investors are latching on to anything they can, which gives this meeting a lot more attention than it probably deserves. Investors will hang on every word uttered by Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve chair. ...But Yellen\u2019s habit of keeping markets guessing with alternately hawkish and dovish remarks should be kept in mind. Indeed what the meeting will highlight is just how hard it is for central banks to normalise policy after years of accommodation. Economists taking part in a Reuters poll believe the Brexit vote will weigh on UK house prices over the next couple of years. Average UK house prices are expected to rise by 2.8% in 2016, 1.3% in 2017, and 2.4% in 2018. London property prices are forecast to increase by 2% in 2016, by zero in 2017, and by 2% in 2018. Some more strong data out of the US. Durable goods orders increased by 4.4% in July, following a 4.2% fall in June according to the US Commerce Department. Economists had forecast a weaker rise of 3.3%. Rob Carnell, chief international economist at ING, says the better-than-expected data do not alter his view that the Federal Reserve will hold rates at its September meeting: Some marginally better than expected durable goods orders don\u2019t change our view that a September rate hike from the Fed is difficult to support. After two consecutive quarters of outright declines in US business investment, durable goods orders for July provide a first insight into how investment in the third quarter is shaping up. And our take on the figures is that the negativity is beginning to abate. But this is far from a big turnaround. The headline 4.4% month-on-month growth in July only just offsets last month\u2019s fall, and the trend for core goods orders and shipments are still both negative. Over in the US, the latest figures showed new claims for unemployment benefit fell unexpectedly by 1,000 in the week ending 20 August to 261,000. It was the third successive weekly fall, and a five-week low according to the US Labor Department data. Economists had forecast a rise to 265,000 new claims. Claims have been below 300,000 - a threshold associated with a strong labour market - for 77 weeks in a row. It is the longest stretch since 1970. The four-week rolling average fell by 1,250 to 264,000 last week. Sticking with Sports Direct, Legal &amp; General Investment Management says it will vote against the re-election of the retailer\u2019s chairman Keith Hellawell at the annual meeting on 7 September. It would be the third consecutive year LGIM has voted against Hellawell\u2019s re-election. It also proposes to vote against the re-election of all non-executive directors at the company. It follows a Guardian investigation last year that revealed Sports Direct warehouse workers were effectively being paid less than the minimum wage because of lengthy security checks at the end of shifts. Earlier this month Sports Direct said warehouse workers would receive back pay totalling about \u00a31m after the retailer admitted breaking the law by not paying the national minimum wage. Sports Direct is back in the headlines after a major investor group spoke out about the retailer\u2019s corporate governance failings. The Investor Forum has 40 members and represents 27% of Sports Direct\u2019s independent shareholders, including Legal &amp; General, Aviva, Standard Life and Fidelity. It was set up two years ago and this is apparently the first time it has made public concerns about a company. Governance failings are clearly resulting in declines in operating performance and long term shareholder value and, given the lack of progress and the broader impact on all stakeholders, the Forum now considers it important to make public its recommendations to the Sports Direct International board. The Investor Forum calls on the board and its founder Mike Ashley to launch an independent review of the company\u2019s \u201centire corporate governance framework\u201d at the annual meeting on 7 September. They must commit to implementing the recommendations of that review, it adds. Andy Griffiths, executive director of the Forum: It is highly unusual for the Investor Forum to consider it necessary to make public their concerns and recommendations in this way. In prior situations we have always managed to work privately with companies to create effective long term solutions. We do not take this step lightly and whilst we welcome SDI\u2019s move to hold an open day, we still have not received an appropriate level of commitment to respond to investor concerns and, as a result, the usual options have been exhausted. Phillip Inman, the Guardian\u2019s economics correspondent, has written a handy list of five problems facing central bankers as they head to Jackson Hole for the annual symposium. Here they are in short: Markets are addicted to low rates Negative interest rates A stagnant eurozone Fragile emerging markets Currency wars Read the piece in full here: Applications for British citizenship by EU nationals living in the UK jumped 14% in the run-up to the EU referendum in June. Figures from the Home Office suggest there was a rush for British passports as uncertainty built before the referendum. The 14% rise in passport applications to 15,501 included a 26% rise in applications from Italians and a 9% rise from Polish nationals in Britain. Separate figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that in 2015, one in eight people - or 8.6m - living in the UK were born abroad. It was a 3.5% increase, up from 8.3m in 2014. Annual net migration to Britain fell by 9,000 to 327,000 in the 12 months to March 2016. The price of Brent crude oil has fallen below $49 a barrel, and is currently down 0.2% at $48.94. Prices are under pressure as hopes fade that oil producing countries will reach a deal to limit production, and on the latest evidence that stocks are rising in the US. US government data published on Thursday showed weekly crude stocks rose by 2.5m barrels to 523.59m. Analysts had expected the figures from the Energy Information Administration to show a 0.5m fall. The pound is coming under some pressure. It is down 0.2% against the dollar at $1.32, and down 0.5% against the euro at \u20ac1.1688. Ruth Gregory at Capital Economics says the strong UK retail sales reported by the CBI won\u2019t last as the impact of the Brexit vote starts to creep into the data: With labour market conditions likely to deteriorate and rising inflation set to undermine real wage growth, it would be fairly surprising if retail sales growth didn\u2019t slow at all in the aftermath of the leave vote. It shouldn\u2019t be too dire for retail sales though, she adds: We think that other supportive factors \u2013 including low interest rates \u2013 should prevent household purchases from slowing too sharply. What\u2019s more, the upbeat tone of the forward-looking indicators provide us with some reassurance that we\u2019re not likely to see a marked collapse in consumer spending ahead. There is no sign of Brexit uncertainty weighing on consumer confidence in the CBI\u2019s latest retail survey. Shoppers were encouraged to hit the high streets by the sunny weather, shrugging off any Brexit fears. Specifically, 35% of retailers said sales volumes were up in August compared with a year earlier, while 26% said they were down. It gave a balance of +9%, rebounding from -14% in July. It was far better than the -12% predicted by retailers. Anna Leach, CBI head of economic analysis says it\u2019s not all good news: The summer weather has brought shoppers out onto the high street with retailers reporting that sales growth has risen, outdoing expectations, although firms do expect sales growth to ease next month. While the fall in sterling has boosted visitor numbers to the UK, it is likely to push up the price of imported goods over time which will mean households will be more likely to rein back spending on non-essentials. And we\u2019re back... Guardian Towers is being evacuated following a fire alarm... we\u2019ll be back as soon as possible Jasper Lawler, analyst at CMC markets, has this take on Thursday\u2019s share price falls across Europe: European healthcare stocks have been caught in the storm of another attack on price gauging in the industry from presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton. Shire and Hikma Pharmaceuticals are amongst the top fallers on the FTSE 100 whilst Qiagen in Germany was a top faller in the Stoxx 600 Healthcare euro price index. The FTSE 350 Mining Index is off by over 2% from the open. Poorly-received earnings from Glencore on Wednesday and lower oil prices continue to weigh on commodity-sensitive shares. European equity losses are building this morning, driven lower by pharmaceutical stocks following comments by US presidential hope Hilary Clinton. Her comments about excessive price rises in the industry - with specific reference to Mylan raising the cost of allergy treatment EpiPens - are weighing on the sector. Clinton said it was \u201cthe latest troubling example of a company taking advantage of its consumers\u201d. She continued: ...it\u2019s wrong when drug companies put profits ahead of patients, raising prices without justifying the value behind them. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve put forward a plan, hrc.io/2c7gjuI, to address exorbitant drug price hikes like these. As part of my plan, I\u2019ve made clear that pharmaceutical manufacturers should be required to explain significant price increases, and prove that any additional costs are linked to additional patient benefits and better value. Since there is no apparent justification in this case, I am calling on Mylan to immediately reduce the price of EpiPens. Europe\u2019s STOXX 600 index is down 1.14% at 341, with pharmaceutical companies among the biggest fallers: Carsten Brzeski, ING chief economist for Germany and Austria, says the weak August Ifo survey suggests German business confidence has been struck down by the Brexit vote. Oops. It seems that German businesses always take a bit longer to digest the news but today\u2019s Ifo suggests that German businesses have suddenly woken up to Brexit reality. Germany\u2019s most prominent indicator, the Ifo index, decreased sharply in August to 106.2, from 108.3 in July; the strongest monthly drop since May 2012. The drop was equally driven by decreases of both the current assessment and the expectations component. The expectations component is now at its lowest level since October 2014. What we had feared could happen did unfortunately happen: German businesses continued a longer tradition of delayed reactions to single and unexpected events. It is not the first time that the Ifo reacts with a delay of one or two months to global events. Today\u2019s Ifo reading is a good reminder that the relative benign reaction of Eurozone data to the Brexit vote should not be taken as given. The negative confidence impact is for real. Morale among German businesses weakened unexpectedly in August according to the latest Ifo survey. The headline business climate index, based on a survey of about 7,000 firms, fell to 106.2 this month from 108.3 in July. Economists had forecast a slight improvement to108.5. Clemens Fuest, Ifo head, said: Business confidence in Germany has clearly worsened. The German economy has fallen into a summer slump. Europe\u2019s major markets are all down this morning. It follows falls on Wall Street on Wednesday and in Asia on Thursday. Investors are feeling cautious ahead of Jackson Hole, and the recent drop in the oil price as hopes of an OPEC deal fade is also denting sentiment. FTSE 100: -0.7% at 6,790 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.8% at 10,538 France\u2019s CAC: -0.9% at 4,397 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.9% at 16,738 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.6% at 8,606 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.8% at 342 More than a million cars have rolled off production lines at UK factors since the beginning of 2016. The latest industry figures showed a total of 1.02 million cars were built in the first six months of the year. It was a 12.3% increase compared with the same period a year earlier. In July alone, the number of cars made in the UK rose by 7.6% to 126,566 vehicles. It was the 12th consecutive month of growth. Mike Hawes from the industry trade body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, says production is \u201cbooming\u201d with demand for British built cars from around the world. Manufacturers have invested billions to develop exciting new models and produce them competitively here in the UK. Future success will depend on continued new car demand and attracting the next wave of investment so Britain must demonstrate it remains competitive and open for business. There are concerns however that following the Brexit vote foreign car companies will be less willing to invest in UK car plants. The rise in production volumes in 2016 is the result of past investment so it will take a while for any Brexit effect to feed through to manufacturing numbers. Figures published this morning show French business confidence faltered in August. The French statistics office INSEE said the index for firms in the industrial sector dropped to 101 from 103 in July. The weaker confidence was most keenly felt among food and drinks manufacturers. The wider gauge of business morale also dipped to 101 this month from 102 in July. Confidence in the services sector was stable at 101. European markets are expected to open lower: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Central bankers and leading economists will arrive for the keenly anticipated Jackson Hole symposium which kicks off today with a reception and opening dinner. The full agenda for the meeting will be published at 6pm Mountain Time today (1am Friday in the UK). It should be available here. The main event of course will be the speech by Janet Yellen, chair of the Federal Reserve. She will be speaking on Friday at 3pm UK time. Investors will be listening closely for any hints on the timing of the next interest rate rise. There will be more clues on whether or not the Brexit vote has knocked confidence among UK consumers when we get the CBI\u2019s latest retail sales survey for August. Also today: The final estimate of Spanish GDP for the second quarter The German IFO business climate index for August In the US we will get jobless claims figures for last week, durable goods data, and the services PMI survey for August We will be bringing you all the key developments as the day unfolds.",

Oh, hang on, as you were, nothing\u2019s imminent.\u201d In other words, the dollar rose and then the dollar fell. Stocks trimmed gains and then recovered.</p> <p>Hunter at Capital Economics says Yellen\u2019s acknowledgement that \u201cthe case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened\u201d would appear to increase the likelihood of a near-term rate hike. </p> <p>He continues:</p> <p>\u201cOn balance, however, we think most officials will want to see more concrete evidence of a rebound in GDP growth and a rise in inflation towards the 2% target, with a December move still appearing the most likely outcome.</p> <p>\u201cIn a fairly upbeat assessment of current economic conditions, Yellen acknowledged the recent strength of consumption, despite the weakness of GDP growth. She also highlighted that even that subdued pace of growth \u201chas been sufficient to generate further improvement in the labour market\u201d. However, she repeated the warning that the future path of monetary policy will depend on the incoming data.\u201d</p> <p>And on the consultancy\u2019s view on when rates will rise, Hunter concludes: </p> <p>\u201cOverall, along with the more upbeat tone of the recent data, we think the odds of a September rate hike have probably increased. They will increase further if we are right in forecasting that non-farm payrolls increased by a solid 180,000 in August (data due next Friday). Nonetheless, with real GDP expanding by just 1.2% over the past 12 months and inflation continuing to run below target, we still think most Fed officials will want to wait until December before next raising rates.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c057c7e4b0396caaf99785\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-26T14:59:19.380Z\">3.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are some reassuring words for any readers struggling to make sense of today\u2019s Jackson Hole speech from Janet Yellen.</p> <p>Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, says the Fed Chair\u2019s address provided an opportunity for \u201cWall Street to play one of its favourite games: interpreting a speech by Janet Yellen.\u201d</p> <p>He writes:</p> <p>\u201cTruly, in terms of making her pronouncements cryptic, the most powerful central banker in the world is the daughter and heir to her predecessor but one, Alan Greenspan.</p> <p>Nothing Yellen has come up with comes close yet to Greenspan\u2019s \u201cI know you think you understand what you thought I said but I\u2019m not sure you realise that what you heard is not what I meant\u201d but <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20160826a.htm\">her presentation at the Jackson Hole symposium</a> was a pretty good effort.\u201d</p> <p><em>Full analysis following soon</em></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c05621e4b09fcabd06c924\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-26T14:49:35.448Z\">3.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Rob Carnell, chief international economist at the bank ING says it was a speech full of caveats from Janet Yellen and that \u201ca September rate hike remains awkward to sell to markets unless the inflation data start to move higher\u201d.</p> <p>He has pulled out two main messages, and one sub-message, from the lengthy Jackson Hole speech.</p> <p>\u201cThe first of the main messages was that <strong>the economy has continued to improve and that made the case for a rate hike more likely in the months ahead</strong>. </p> <p>\u201cBut \u201cmore likely\u201d does not mean \u201clikely\u201d, and markets are still reluctant to buy into a September rate hike story, at least without more information on the evolution of jobs growth, the pace of economic activity, or higher inflation.</p> <p>\u201cThe second message, which we suspect markets may also have problems accepting at face value, is that <strong>in the event of a return to crisis, more quantitative easing, coupled with \u201cforward guidance\u201d would likely provide sufficient stimulus to avert catastrophe</strong> (our words). This message might very well be filed under the heading of \u201cWell, they would say that wouldn\u2019t they.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cBut buried at the end of the speech, after a section that seemed to draw heavily on the recent paper by the San Francisco Fed President, John Williams\u2019, <strong>Yellen proposed an enhanced role for fiscal policy</strong>. She talked about the need for measures designed to improve productivity (fiscal, not monetary), as well as enhancing (fiscal) automatic stabilisers. A cynic might paraphrase the speech as \u201cThings are looking brighter, but if it all goes wrong don\u2019t panic, there\u2019s always fiscal policy\u201d.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c054b9e4b09fcabd06c91d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-26T14:42:57.165Z\">3.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco has been looking at that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/aug/26/all-eyes-on-yellen-as-jackson-hole-kicks-off-business-live?page=with:block-57c05109e4b09fcabd06c908#block-57c05109e4b09fcabd06c908\">rollercoaster market reaction</a> to the speech by Janet Yellen.<br></p> <p>He comments:</p> <p>\u201cHer speech was undeniably hawkish.

New policy tools, which helped the Federal Reserve respond to the financial crisis and Great Recession, are likely to remain useful in dealing with future downturns. Additional tools may be needed and will be the subject of research and debate. But even if average interest rates remain lower than in the past, I believe that monetary policy will, under most conditions, be able to respond effectively.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>There are echoes of Bank of England governor Mark Carney, who <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2016/speech915.pdf\">shortly after the EU referendum said</a>: \u201cThe charge that central banks are out of monetary ammunition is wrong, but the widespread absence of global price pressures demands that our firepower be well aimed.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c05244e4b09fcabd06c911\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-26T14:30:20.880Z\">3.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Also reacting to Janet Yellen\u2019s speech at Jackson Hole, Lee Ferridge, head of multi-asset strategy at State Street Global Markets North America has shared this view:</p> <p>\u201cDespite recent hints of an ongoing policy rethink at the FOMC [Federal Open Markets Committee], Janet Yellen\u2019s Jackson Hole speech did not break much new ground. Her comments could help arrest the dollar\u2019s recent decline and deal a blow to the rally in risky assets that we have seen in recent weeks.

Similarly, stock markets initially trimmed gains on the prospect of higher interest rates and then rose again when traders had digested Yellen\u2019s remarks and decided it was too soon to worry. </p> <p><strong>Aberdeen Asset Management fixed income investment manager James Athey comments:</strong><br></p> <p> \u201cWhile the bulk of Yellen\u2019s opening remarks at Jackson Hole focussed on monetary policy over the long term, she stated that in her opinion the case for a rate hike has strengthened in recent months. But the lack of any specific signal with regards to the September meeting means markets are unlikely to react adversely to this fairly throwaway comment. Yellen\u2019s comments were largely focussed on the debate around the effectiveness of the Fed\u2019s toolkit.</p> <p>\u201cOf course she defended the success of previous policy and indeed the ability of the Fed to respond effectively in the future, however she wasn\u2019t shy of highlighting the need for government to assist in the heavy lifting through the use of supportive fiscal policy \u2013 a plea we regularly hear from ECB President Mario Draghi.<br></p> <p>\u201cHowever the elephant in the room is that the Fed may well be worshipping at a false idol. There\u2019s more and more evidence to show that inflation just isn\u2019t behaving in the way that economists think it should. The Fed should stop targeting consumer inflation and start looking at a wider suite of measures to judge the health of the economy and the appropriateness of their policy. Sadly it looks like the wide open plains of Wyoming have not inspired any soul searching.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c04d6ce4b0486629890578\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-26T14:17:03.350Z\">3.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>So it\u2019s a hawkish message from Yellen, but is she telling us anything we didn\u2019t know already?</p> <p>Well, markets appear to be struggling to make sense of the message from Yellen.

                "bodyText":"Fed chair Janet Yellen has told the Jackson Hole meeting of central bankers that the case for rate rises has \u201cstrengthened\u201d but she gave markets little guidance on timing, saying they would be \u201cgradual\u201d and happen \u201cover time\u201d He fellow policymaker and vice chair Stanley Fischer followed up the speech with an interview where he highlighted a strengthening US economy and jobs market Stock markets initially trimmed gains on Yellen\u2019s speech, then recovered on relief that any rate rise could be some way off, only to drop again on Fischer\u2019s sanguine remarks US growth was revised slightly lower In the UK, the FTSE 100 has closed up 21 points, or 0.3%, at 6,838 Official UK data confirmed GDP grew 0.6% in the second quarter, with little evidence that the EU referendum at the end of the quarter had hurt investment. Consumer spending remained the main driver But economists warned that the second quarter figures would come to represent a high point for this year, with growth in the following months hit weaker business confidence on the back of the Brexit vote On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all the comments, we will be back on Tuesday. Here is CNBC\u2019s report on its interview with Fed vice chair Stanley Fischer, who gave markets more to mull over when he highlighted the US economy\u2019s recent strength. Hints that the Fed could raise rates as soon as next month, saw US stock markets erase earlier gains. Now Fed policymaker Stanley Fischer is talking about Janet Yellen\u2019s speech, adding fuel to the debate over whether the US central bank could raise rates as soon as September. He has been speaking to CNBC and appears to be hinting a near-term rate rise is still on the table. The dollar is strengthening and US stocks have trimmed gains. Here\u2019s a rather unsympathetic assessment of how financial markets reacted to Janet Yellen\u2019s speech from David Lamb, head of dealing a FEXCO Corporate Payments. He says traders are \u201cunable to see their terminals for the egg on their faces\u201d. Lamb comments: \u201cThe currency markets frequently live and die by the \u2018shoot first and ask questions later\u2019 motto. Today they were asking awkward questions just seconds after firing. \u201cNo sooner had the Fed\u2019s Chair uttered the magic words \u2018the case has strengthened\u2019 and trigger-happy traders were snapping up dollars in expectation of an near-immediate rate rise. \u201cBut as the seconds ticked by, it became increasingly clear that a hike is inevitable, but not imminent. \u201cCue a huge correction that saw the dollar slump well below its pre-announcement levels \u2013 leaving many traders unable to see their terminals for the egg on their faces. \u201cThe caveats came thick and fast. There\u2019s a range of possible rate rise scenarios, they could still be blown of course, and the killer line \u2013 gradual hikes are appropriate.\u201d US stock markets are rallying in the wake of Janet Yellen\u2019s speech, says Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading company IG. He believes Yellen opted to \u201cplease both hawks and doves\u201d. Beauchamp comments: \u201cThe \u2018Dip-buyers anonymous\u2019 team is working at full steam this afternoon, as Janet Yellen finds the right tone to encourage investors to step back into the market at the end of a tedious week. Clearly a modest rise in rates is taken as a sign of confidence in the economy, while the passing reference to other policy measures being potentially necessary in future crises was viewed as leaving the door open to the kind of broader monetary stimulus practised by the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan.\u201d Looking ahead, he adds: \u201cGiven the enthusiastic reception equity markets have given Janet Yellen, it looks like the steady grind higher will continue into the end of August.\u201d Andrew Hunter, US economist at the consultancy Capital Economics says Janet Yellen\u2019s comments are \u201cconsistent with a US rate hike by year-end\u201d. To re-cap, the Fed chair said the case for rate rises had strengthened, she rebuffed suggestions monetary policy had lost some of its power and made that now so familiar call from central bankers for fiscal policy to do its share of the heavy lifting. But there was little in the way of guidance on when US interest rates might rise and so markets were left doing a little dance that I would sum up - if readers will forgive the lack of sophistication - as \u201cOh no, rate hikes!!! Oh, hang on, as you were, nothing\u2019s imminent.\u201d In other words, the dollar rose and then the dollar fell. Stocks trimmed gains and then recovered. Hunter at Capital Economics says Yellen\u2019s acknowledgement that \u201cthe case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened\u201d would appear to increase the likelihood of a near-term rate hike. He continues: \u201cOn balance, however, we think most officials will want to see more concrete evidence of a rebound in GDP growth and a rise in inflation towards the 2% target, with a December move still appearing the most likely outcome. \u201cIn a fairly upbeat assessment of current economic conditions, Yellen acknowledged the recent strength of consumption, despite the weakness of GDP growth. She also highlighted that even that subdued pace of growth \u201chas been sufficient to generate further improvement in the labour market\u201d. However, she repeated the warning that the future path of monetary policy will depend on the incoming data.\u201d And on the consultancy\u2019s view on when rates will rise, Hunter concludes: \u201cOverall, along with the more upbeat tone of the recent data, we think the odds of a September rate hike have probably increased. They will increase further if we are right in forecasting that non-farm payrolls increased by a solid 180,000 in August (data due next Friday). Nonetheless, with real GDP expanding by just 1.2% over the past 12 months and inflation continuing to run below target, we still think most Fed officials will want to wait until December before next raising rates.\u201d Here are some reassuring words for any readers struggling to make sense of today\u2019s Jackson Hole speech from Janet Yellen. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, says the Fed Chair\u2019s address provided an opportunity for \u201cWall Street to play one of its favourite games: interpreting a speech by Janet Yellen.\u201d He writes: \u201cTruly, in terms of making her pronouncements cryptic, the most powerful central banker in the world is the daughter and heir to her predecessor but one, Alan Greenspan. Nothing Yellen has come up with comes close yet to Greenspan\u2019s \u201cI know you think you understand what you thought I said but I\u2019m not sure you realise that what you heard is not what I meant\u201d but her presentation at the Jackson Hole symposium was a pretty good effort.\u201d Full analysis following soon Rob Carnell, chief international economist at the bank ING says it was a speech full of caveats from Janet Yellen and that \u201ca September rate hike remains awkward to sell to markets unless the inflation data start to move higher\u201d. He has pulled out two main messages, and one sub-message, from the lengthy Jackson Hole speech. \u201cThe first of the main messages was that the economy has continued to improve and that made the case for a rate hike more likely in the months ahead. \u201cBut \u201cmore likely\u201d does not mean \u201clikely\u201d, and markets are still reluctant to buy into a September rate hike story, at least without more information on the evolution of jobs growth, the pace of economic activity, or higher inflation. \u201cThe second message, which we suspect markets may also have problems accepting at face value, is that in the event of a return to crisis, more quantitative easing, coupled with \u201cforward guidance\u201d would likely provide sufficient stimulus to avert catastrophe (our words). This message might very well be filed under the heading of \u201cWell, they would say that wouldn\u2019t they.\u201d \u201cBut buried at the end of the speech, after a section that seemed to draw heavily on the recent paper by the San Francisco Fed President, John Williams\u2019, Yellen proposed an enhanced role for fiscal policy. She talked about the need for measures designed to improve productivity (fiscal, not monetary), as well as enhancing (fiscal) automatic stabilisers. A cynic might paraphrase the speech as \u201cThings are looking brighter, but if it all goes wrong don\u2019t panic, there\u2019s always fiscal policy\u201d.\u201d David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco has been looking at that rollercoaster market reaction to the speech by Janet Yellen. He comments: \u201cHer speech was undeniably hawkish. She said the case for a rate hike has strengthened in recent months. Also, the US economy continues to expand and has reached maximum employment with price stability. This saw the dollar pop higher initially and precious metals fall. Nevertheless, she anticipates that gradual rate hikes are appropriate... \u201cBut as is so often the case, the initial market reaction can be misleading. As traders scanned below the headlines for the meat in the speech, perceptions over Dr Yellen\u2019s thinking changed. Gold and silver have surged as the dollar slumped. Possibly this is connected to her comments that the overall economic situation remains uncertain.\u201d Janet Yellen has also used her speech to join the chorus of central bankers insisting they are not all out of ammunition. Her speech to the Jackson Hole meeting, entitled \u201cThe Federal Reserve\u2019s Monetary Policy Toolkit: Past, Present, and Future\u201d, unsurprisingly concludes that it\u2019s a well-stocked and effective toolkit. Yellen says: \u201cAlthough fiscal policies and structural reforms can play an important role in strengthening the U.S. economy, my primary message today is that I expect monetary policy will continue to play a vital part in promoting a stable and healthy economy. New policy tools, which helped the Federal Reserve respond to the financial crisis and Great Recession, are likely to remain useful in dealing with future downturns. Additional tools may be needed and will be the subject of research and debate. But even if average interest rates remain lower than in the past, I believe that monetary policy will, under most conditions, be able to respond effectively.\u201d There are echoes of Bank of England governor Mark Carney, who shortly after the EU referendum said: \u201cThe charge that central banks are out of monetary ammunition is wrong, but the widespread absence of global price pressures demands that our firepower be well aimed.\u201d Also reacting to Janet Yellen\u2019s speech at Jackson Hole, Lee Ferridge, head of multi-asset strategy at State Street Global Markets North America has shared this view: \u201cDespite recent hints of an ongoing policy rethink at the FOMC [Federal Open Markets Committee], Janet Yellen\u2019s Jackson Hole speech did not break much new ground. Her comments could help arrest the dollar\u2019s recent decline and deal a blow to the rally in risky assets that we have seen in recent weeks. A move at the September meeting remains less likely but a move before year end now looks a distinct possibility should US data continue to improve.\u201d Some more reactions coming in to Janet Yellen\u2019s speech now, which as we noted earlier left the markets in a bit of a muddle. The dollar initially strengthened as the Fed chair hinted at further rate rises but then lost those gains, possibly as the timing of any such tightening seems to be some way off. Similarly, stock markets initially trimmed gains on the prospect of higher interest rates and then rose again when traders had digested Yellen\u2019s remarks and decided it was too soon to worry. Aberdeen Asset Management fixed income investment manager James Athey comments: \u201cWhile the bulk of Yellen\u2019s opening remarks at Jackson Hole focussed on monetary policy over the long term, she stated that in her opinion the case for a rate hike has strengthened in recent months. But the lack of any specific signal with regards to the September meeting means markets are unlikely to react adversely to this fairly throwaway comment. Yellen\u2019s comments were largely focussed on the debate around the effectiveness of the Fed\u2019s toolkit. \u201cOf course she defended the success of previous policy and indeed the ability of the Fed to respond effectively in the future, however she wasn\u2019t shy of highlighting the need for government to assist in the heavy lifting through the use of supportive fiscal policy \u2013 a plea we regularly hear from ECB President Mario Draghi. \u201cHowever the elephant in the room is that the Fed may well be worshipping at a false idol. There\u2019s more and more evidence to show that inflation just isn\u2019t behaving in the way that economists think it should. The Fed should stop targeting consumer inflation and start looking at a wider suite of measures to judge the health of the economy and the appropriateness of their policy. Sadly it looks like the wide open plains of Wyoming have not inspired any soul searching.\u201d So it\u2019s a hawkish message from Yellen, but is she telling us anything we didn\u2019t know already? Well, markets appear to be struggling to make sense of the message from Yellen. US stocks initially trimmed gains only to rise again. The dollar has now reversed its initial gains against the pound and euro. Here are some of the early reactions (including from UK commentators, who are counting down to a long weekend with a public holiday on Monday): Those remarks on a stronger case for rate hikes in the US have seen US stock markets trim some of their gains and pushed the dollar up against the euro and pound. This key extract from the speech shows Janet Yellen and her fellow policymakers are still keen to come across as avid data watchers, but she clearly sees a better case for rate rises: \u201cIn light of the continued solid performance of the labor market and our outlook for economic activity and inflation, I believe the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened in recent months. Of course, our decisions always depend on the degree to which incoming data continues to confirm the Committee\u2019s outlook,\u201d she said. Yellen has told her audience at Jackson Hole that the case for raising US interest rates has strengthened in recent months. She cited improvements in the jobs market and hopes for modest GDP growth. Here is the full speech. US markets are up in early trading as investors await Yellen\u2019s speech at Jackson Hole. Twenty minutes to go. Dow Jones: +0.3% at 18,495 S&amp;P 500: +0.3% at 2,178 Nasdaq: +0.2% at 5,222 Before Janet Yellen speaks in less than an hour, there have been some important developments in the cruise liner industry. David Hasselhoff of Knight Rider and Baywatch fame will set sail on his first official fan cruise on 4 November next year. The six-day tour on Costa Favolosa will begin in Italy and call at various European ports. The ticket price starts at \u20ac599 (\u00a3513) and \u201cDavid is on board with you for the duration of the cruiser\u201d, apparently. Events will include a concert, a get-together with the Hoff, an autograph session and \u2013 an evening with David \u201cin the large theatre\u201d.... Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s have recalled some 500ml cartons of their Cookie Dough flavour ice cream over fears they might contain small pieces of metal. Four batches are thought to have been affected and UK customers have been asked to check batch numbers printed at the bottom of their pots. The ice-cream maker advised customers to throw the product away if it was from one of the batches. It said in a safety notice: The company has identified a specific production period during which Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s Cookie Dough 500ml may have been affected and, as safety remains a top priority, Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s is voluntarily recalling four batch codes of Cookie Dough 500ml from sale. As a precaution, everyone with a 500ml tub of Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s Cookie Dough in their freezers at home should check the batch number on the bottom of their tub to make sure it\u2019s not affected. And, if it matches the batch numbers listed above, they should not eat the product and, instead, we ask them to discard the product in the usual household bin. (The batch codes affected are L62110L011, L62111L011, L62112L011 and L62113L011.) Fancy an ice cream anyone? Simon Smith, chief economist at FxPro, thinks Janet Yellen should take a cautious approach to her Jackson Hole speech, which is coming up in a hour an a quarter. Smith says: Yellen will do her best to sound upbeat on the US economy, but not to tie her hands into tightening policy this year. The Fed has led the market down the garden path once too often on this front, not least at last year\u2019s Jackson Hole summit, so she\u2019d do well to keep her options open this time and not cause a similar furore this year.\u201d He adds makes the point that central bankers are running out of rope when it comes to monetary policy stimulus: The issue is that monetary policy is reaching its limits, even the various forms of quantitative easing and negative interest rates being imposed. This is most true for Japan and the eurozone. That may encourage central bankers to be even more aggressive in their approach, but there are always unintended consequences. This is certainly true in the eurozone, given the costs that negative rates impose on banks and (increasingly) their customers. US GDP growth for the second quarter has been revised down a touch to an annual rate of 1.1%, from an earlier estimate of 1.2%. The second estimate from the US Commerce Department was in line with the expectations of economists polled by Reuters. It followed 0.8% growth in the first quarter. European markets remain subdued as we await Yellen\u2019s speech. The FTSE 100 is down just three points at 6,820. It\u2019s a similar story across Europe, with the STOXX 600 index down 0.1 points to 341.9. Earlier in Japan, figures showed consumer prices fell for the fifth month in a row in July, dealing a blow to prime minister Shinzo Abe and his bid to combat deflation. Annual deflation deepened last month, with consumer prices falling by 0.5% in the year to July. It followed a 0.4% drop in June and was the biggest fall in more than three years as businesses delayed price hikes because of weak demand. The data will intensify the pressure on Japan\u2019s central bank to announce more stimulus, on top of the huge amount of money it has already pumped into the world\u2019s third largest economy. Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics: While economic activity is on the mend, the slump in import prices suggests that underlying inflation will continue to fall in coming months. The Bank of Japan will find it increasingly difficult to blame falling energy prices for the decline in overall consumer prices. Ana Thaker, Market Economist at PhillipCapital UK, says investors will be looking to this afternoon\u2019s US GDP number, as well as Yellen\u2019s speech, for clues about the timing of the next rate rise. Strong data combined with a hawkish Yellen could see the dollar rally as August comes to a close and markets look towards the [rate-setting] FOMC meeting in September. The Fed are relying on strong economic data to advocate a long anticipated rate hike so data over the last half of 2016 is crucial to both markets and the Fed in determining the direction of policy and markets. We are at a crucial point in the course of monetary policy for the Fed and data points are more pertinent than ever. Markus Allenspach, head of fixed income research at Julius Baer, says Yellen is unlikely to give any clear signals about September\u2019s Fed meeting: For weeks already, the market is waiting anxiously for Yellen\u2019s speech, as members of the Federal Reserve often presented conflicting views in the public about the necessity and timing of rate hikes. We doubt, however, that Yellen will give clear directions today; in her view, monetary policy decisions are taken by the FOMC as a committee. Esther George, president of the Kansas City Federal Reserve and host of the Jackson Hole meeting, has been speaking to Bloomberg from the event. Having already voted against the majority for a rate rise, she suggests she\u2019ll vote again for higher rates at the Fed\u2019s September meeting. When I look at where we are with the job market, when I look at inflation and our forecasts for that, I think it\u2019s time to move. Where it will look by the September meeting we\u2019ll have to wait and see if anything changes fundamentally. Ahead of Yellen\u2019s speech, traders are forecasting a one in three chance of a US rate rise in September. Back to the main event of the day in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Once Friday\u2019s proceedings get underway at Jackson Lake Lodge, we won\u2019t have long to wait for Janet Yellen\u2019s speech as the chair of the US Federal Reserve is first up at 8am Mountain Time (3pm in the UK). The meeting runs from 8am to 2pm on both Friday and Saturday, with a series of papers presented, speeches given, and discussions held. As Larry Elliott, the Guardian\u2019s economics editor put it, \u201cJackson Hole is Davos for central bankers\u201d. The Bank of England\u2019s Minouche Shafik will give a speech titled adapting to changes in the financial market landscape at 3.50pm UK time. Other topics up for discussion on Friday include negative interest rates, and \u201calternative monetary frameworks\u201d. The main topic on Saturday is central bank balance sheets. The full agenda is published here. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY Item Club, says predictions of a self-inflicted Brexit recession are overdone. An uncertainty-driven slowdown still seems likely. But with a number of recent surveys from the CBI and others showing bouncebacks from post-vote lows, strong official retail sales numbers for July, and the support offered by the package of measures announced by the Bank of England, predictions that the economy will fall into recession look unduly pessimistic. The pound is up slightly against the dollar at $1.3203 (+0.1%). It is flat against the euro at \u20ac1.688. UK data this week has generally been better-than-expected and a survey published overnight by YouGov/Cebr showed a surge in consumer confidence in August. The headline index increased 3.2 points to 109.8 in August. It was the biggest monthly jump since February 2013 after the economy performed better than expected. The August rise followed a sharp drop in July, suggesting initial shock and fears over the June Brexit vote subsided this month. YouGov interviews about 6,000 consumers a month, asking them about their household finances, property prices, job security and business activity in the workplace. The only indicator to show a drop in August was job security over the next 12 months. Here is the Guardian\u2019s full story on the second estimate of Q2 growth, which was confirmed at 0.6%: Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics is decidedly gloomy about the outlook for the UK economy. He says consumers will start to feel the pinch from rising inflation next year: Looking ahead, consumers might be able to maintain strong growth in their spending for another quarter, but when inflation picks up in earnest early next year and firms follow through on plans to freeze hiring, they will have to slow down. Meanwhile, the slight rise in business investment in Q2 provides little reassurance about the post-referendum outlook, since few businesses anticipated the Leave vote and surveys suggest firms are recoiling from major financial commitments in Q3. As a result, we continue to see a high risk that the economy enters a mild recession over the coming quarters. Deloitte\u2019s chief economist Ian Stewart, says the consumer recovery is going strong: The UK entered the post-referendum period with good momentum. Household spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of the economy and is growing at the fastest rate in eight years. We see few signs that Brexit has derailed the consumer recovery. Scott Bowman at Capital Economics, says the Brexit vote will weigh on growth in the second half of the year: UK households shrugged off pre-referendum uncertainty, driving an acceleration in GDP growth in the second quarter. Looking ahead, growth looks set to slow significantly in the second half of the year as uncertainty related to the Brexit vote takes its toll. We think that growth will fall to around zero in Q3 and Q4, mainly due to falls in business investment. Here are three key charts from the second estimate of Q2 growth, which came in at 0.6%... 1. The UK economy has grown every quarter since the first quarter of 2013: 2. On the output side of the economy, only the services sector is back above pre-crisis levels: 3. Households shrugged off uncertainty in the run-up to the 23 June referendum, as consumer spending continued to be a key driver of growth: Joe Grice, chief economist at the ONS has commented on this mornings figures which confirmed the UK economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter, following 0.4% growth in the first quarter. Today\u2019s figures reinforce the picture that the economy grew strongly in April, and then remained relatively flat in May and June. Business investment grew in the second quarter, partly thanks to companies spending on transport equipment such as cars and planes. However, levels of investment remained lower than at the same period last year. Our survey returns, which include the period leading up to and immediately following the referendum, show no sign so far of uncertainty having significantly affected investment or GDP. The ONS says there is no sign in the GDP data that uncertainty in the run-up to the EU referendum affected investment. The second estimate of growth (confirmed at 0.6%) gives a more detailed picture of how different parts of the economy performed between April and June. Specifically it shed some light on the spending side. Business investment increased by 0.5% over the quarter, beating expectations of a 0.8% fall and a 0.6% fall in the first quarter. Household spending was the strongest in almost two years in the second quarter, up 0.9% from 0.7% in the first quarter. In terms of output, services growth was confirmed at 0.5% and industrial output growth was confirmed at 2.1%. Construction output was revised down however, falling by 0.7% and not 0.4% as initially thought. Growth of 0.6% in the second quarter has been confirmed by the Office for National Statistics. More soon. French consumer confidence ticked up in August, to 97 from 96 in July. It followed a drop in confidence in the previous two months according to the INSEE figures. Confidence among households about their personal finance situation improved sharply, jumping seven points to highest level since October 2007. The French economy was flat in the second quarter, a second estimate of GDP from the statistics office INSEE showed. Zero growth between April and June followed 0.7% growth in the first quarter. INSEE said there was a sharp slowdown in household spending, while trade made a positive contribution after imports fell more than exports. There is little movement in European markets this morning as investors await Janet Yellen\u2019s speech at Jackson Hole. They will be looking for clues from the Fed chair about whether to expect the next rise in US interest rates in September, December, or 2017. FTSE 100: -0.2% at 6,802 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.1% at 10,537 France\u2019s CAC: +0.1% at 4,409 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.7% at 16,587 Spain\u2019s IBEX: 0.3% at 8,623 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.03% at 342 The Jackson Hole economic symposium has been hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City since 1978. Representing the Bank of England are Minouche Shafik, deputy governor for markets and banking, and Kristin Forbes, an external member of the Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee. Bank of England governor Mark Carney, and European Central Bank president Mario Draghi, will not attend. Also coming up today... We will get the second estimate of UK growth in the second-quarter from the Office for National Statistics. Economists polled expect growth to be confirmed at 0.6%. But Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, says there is a risk that the number could be revised lower, \u201cparticularly since we did see some evidence of a slowdown in late May and June as the referendum date approached\u201d. The latest estimate will provide more details on how the different parts of the economy performed between April and June. So far the consumer side of the economy appears to have held up well since the Brexit vote on 23 June, but those numbers as well as business investment figures will be closely scrutinised in the coming months for signs of waning confidence. In the US (before Yellen speaks at 3pm UK time) we will get the second estimate of Q2 growth from the world\u2019s largest economy. European markets are expected to open slightly lower this morning as traders pause for breath before Yellen\u2019s speech. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The day has finally arrived. At 8am Mountain Time, or 3pm UK time, the chair of the US Federal Reserve Janet Yellen will deliver her keenly anticipated speech at the 2016 Jackson Hole symposium. The event is hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, and got underway last night with a reception and dinner at the Jackson Lake Lodge in Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming. The full agenda for the meeting of the world\u2019s central bankers can be found here. This year\u2019s theme is Designing Resilient Monetary Policy Frameworks for the Future. But the main event awaited by investors all week is Yellen\u2019s speech. The title of the speech is The Fed\u2019s Monetary Policy Toolkit, but traders and commentators will be looking specifically for any hints on the timing of the next Fed rate rise. This is what markets have been waiting for all week. We will bring you commentary in the run-up to the speech, the speech itself, and reaction thereafter. Thank you for joining us.",

McIlwee left his job at Tesco in April 2014 with a \u00a31m payoff following tensions with the then chief executive, Philip Clarke. Five months later, Clarke\u2019s successor, Dave Lewis, flagged up the discovery of a black hole in the company\u2019s accounts that was eventually valued at \u00a3263m. In December 2014, the Financial Reporting Council, the accountancy watchdog, launched an investigation into the actions of Tesco\u2019s financial team, including McIlwee, and the role of its auditor, PwC, in the profits overstatement. On Wednesday, the FRC said it had closed the investigation into McIlwee after concluding that there was \u201cno realistic prospect that a tribunal would make an adverse finding in relation to [his] conduct\u201d. PwC remains under investigation. The scandal is also being looked at by the Serious Fraud Office, which interviewed Clarke under caution last year. It is understood that McIlwee has been interviewed by the SFO, but only as a witness, and he is not being considered for prosecution. The FRC clearance means that McIlwee, who has not been in full-time work since leaving Tesco, is unlikely to face any action over the scandal and can look for a new role. The move also suggests that the SFO may be preparing to release the findings of its investigation. A third investigation by the grocery market watchdog in January led to Tesco being ordered to make \u201csignificant changes\u201d in the way it deals with suppliers, after finding that the supermarket, Britain\u2019s biggest, had deliberately delayed payments to maximise profits. The accounting scandal was revealed weeks after the arrival of Lewis, who was brought in to turn around falling sales and profits. McIlwee was paid \u00a3400,000 in the six months after he quit Tesco, during which time he was requested to be available to assist the supermarket. It later emerged that McIlwee did not provide any services to Tesco during that time and was asked not to come into the office.
