Retail sales rose by 1.9% year on year in July, the best performance since January according to the British Retail Consortium and KPMG, as shoppers splashed out on summer clothing and barbecue food. </p> <p>The impact of Brexit on the economy will not be known for some time. It will be judged by the size of company cutbacks, but also by planned investments and expansion plans that are scrapped. This is why the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">Bank of England has cut forecasts for 2017 and 2018 rather than this year.</a><br></p> <p>So while the unemployment figures show the economy did not go into shock straight after the vote, Brexiters have little reason to celebrate yet.</p> <h2>Is Deliveroo\u2019s model under threat in courier row?</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/16/deliveroo-announces-it-will-not-force-new-contracts-on-workers\">The protests by Deliveroo workers</a> about their pay highlights that the online revolution is still to solve the biggest conundrum facing shops, restaurants and other consumer-facing businesses \u2013 the last mile.</p> <p>The \u201clast mile\u201d is the phrase used in retail and logistics to describe the process of getting a customer\u2019s order to their front door. </p> <p>For online businesses, the last mile is remarkably inefficient compared with the rest of their operation. Even the zaniest technological advances imaginable do not change the fact that a business must find a way to get its product to the customer.</p> <p>The beauty of a shop or restaurant is that this cost is put on the shopper. In a supermarket, for example, the shopper travels to the store, picks the products off the shelf, then goes home. But online food retailers, such as Ocado, have to bear these costs themselves. </p> <p>This is why a string of online businesses, including the mighty Amazon, have struggled to make a profit despite growing sales rapidly. It is also a good reason why the restaurants for which Deliveroo delivers food were not doing it themselves.</p> <p>Deliveroo has to keep costs under control to make its model work, meaning the amount it pays its couriers is key. The company does not publish its financial results so the health of its balance sheet is not clear. </p> <p>William Shu believed he had identified a gap in the market when he founded Deliveroo in 2013. But a mile is a big gap to fill.</p> <h2>TfL\u2019s English language exam proposal for cabbies tests everyone\u2019s patience</h2> <p><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/17/uber-takes-tfl-to-high-court-over-english-written-test\">Transport for London\u2019s attempts to rein in Uber</a> are becoming ugly. TfL is proposing that drivers applying for a private-hire licence who are from countries where English is not the main language will have to present a certificate showing they have a B1 level of English on the Common European Framework. This certificate requires a two-hour exam that costs \u00a3200 to sit.</p> <p>The new requirements are more stringent than those facing bus drivers, train drivers and other public servants. Uber accepts that drivers should be proficient at spoken English, but believes the proposals go too far and that the company and its drivers are being unfairly targeted \u2013 hence the legal action. </p> <p>TfL says it wants to enhance public safety, but it would be wise to reconsider its position. While public safety and reducing the number of cars on London\u2019s roads are laudable targets, fighting against technological developments and protecting the status quo \u2013 which is what this looks like \u2013 are not.</p> <p>Uber has grown rapidly in London and other cities because its users believe it offers value and convenience compared with the alternatives. The company is not going away. It should be considered as part of a solution for London\u2019s traffic problems, rather than a problem. </p> <p>Rivals who have lost market share because of Uber should focus on improving their service, while TfL should focus on more important things than making taxi drivers write essays.</p>",

The early evidence suggests consumers are more bothered about the warm weather than Brexit, so shops, pubs and other high street businesses do not need to make cutbacks. Retail sales rose by 1.9% year on year in July, the best performance since January according to the British Retail Consortium and KPMG, as shoppers splashed out on summer clothing and barbecue food. The impact of Brexit on the economy will not be known for some time. It will be judged by the size of company cutbacks, but also by planned investments and expansion plans that are scrapped. This is why the Bank of England has cut forecasts for 2017 and 2018 rather than this year. So while the unemployment figures show the economy did not go into shock straight after the vote, Brexiters have little reason to celebrate yet. Is Deliveroo\u2019s model under threat in courier row? The protests by Deliveroo workers about their pay highlights that the online revolution is still to solve the biggest conundrum facing shops, restaurants and other consumer-facing businesses \u2013 the last mile. The \u201clast mile\u201d is the phrase used in retail and logistics to describe the process of getting a customer\u2019s order to their front door. For online businesses, the last mile is remarkably inefficient compared with the rest of their operation. Even the zaniest technological advances imaginable do not change the fact that a business must find a way to get its product to the customer. The beauty of a shop or restaurant is that this cost is put on the shopper. In a supermarket, for example, the shopper travels to the store, picks the products off the shelf, then goes home. But online food retailers, such as Ocado, have to bear these costs themselves. This is why a string of online businesses, including the mighty Amazon, have struggled to make a profit despite growing sales rapidly. It is also a good reason why the restaurants for which Deliveroo delivers food were not doing it themselves. Deliveroo has to keep costs under control to make its model work, meaning the amount it pays its couriers is key. The company does not publish its financial results so the health of its balance sheet is not clear. William Shu believed he had identified a gap in the market when he founded Deliveroo in 2013. But a mile is a big gap to fill. TfL\u2019s English language exam proposal for cabbies tests everyone\u2019s patience Transport for London\u2019s attempts to rein in Uber are becoming ugly. TfL is proposing that drivers applying for a private-hire licence who are from countries where English is not the main language will have to present a certificate showing they have a B1 level of English on the Common European Framework. This certificate requires a two-hour exam that costs \u00a3200 to sit. The new requirements are more stringent than those facing bus drivers, train drivers and other public servants. Uber accepts that drivers should be proficient at spoken English, but believes the proposals go too far and that the company and its drivers are being unfairly targeted \u2013 hence the legal action. TfL says it wants to enhance public safety, but it would be wise to reconsider its position. While public safety and reducing the number of cars on London\u2019s roads are laudable targets, fighting against technological developments and protecting the status quo \u2013 which is what this looks like \u2013 are not. Uber has grown rapidly in London and other cities because its users believe it offers value and convenience compared with the alternatives. The company is not going away. It should be considered as part of a solution for London\u2019s traffic problems, rather than a problem. Rivals who have lost market share because of Uber should focus on improving their service, while TfL should focus on more important things than making taxi drivers write essays.",

                "bodyText":"As it\u2019s quietened down, sit back and enjoy this video of retail magnate Sir Philip Green swapping bon mots with Sky News.... Here\u2019s the full story: The latest US unemployment report is as impressive as ever. Just 262,000 people filed new claims for unemployment benefit last week, 4,000 fewer than the previous week. That means the initial jobless claims total has been below 300,000 for 76 weeks in a row, which hasn\u2019t happened since 1973. The UK public have shaken off some of their post-referendum worries, according to IPSOS Mori, the polling company. Its latest survey has found that 43% of the public expect the economy to deteriorate over the next 12 months, down from 57% a month ago. And the proportion expecting conditions to improve has risen to 28%, from 23%. Conservative voters have become particularly optimistic this month, apparently, perhaps showing they\u2019re happy with Theresa May\u2019s premiership. But remain supporters, young people and Labour voters are all still gloomy, according to IPSOS Mori\u2019s Gideon Skinner: The European Central Bank has urged EU leaders to pick up their game following Britain\u2019s EU referendum. The minutes of its last meeting, released today, state that: \u201cA strong call was made for European policymakers to contain political uncertainty surrounding the UK exit negotiations and to provide a clear vision for the future path of the European Union and its integration process.\u201d The ECB also hinted that it might deploy fresh stimulus measures at its September meeting, once policymakers had assessed the situation in the eurozone. The minutes of July\u2019s meeting say: \u201cIt was widely felt among members that it was premature tod iscuss any possible monetary policy reaction at this stage. More time was needed to assess the incoming information over the coming months, although downside risks had clearly increased.\u201d Asda\u2019s record fall in sales shows that the company needs to compete better on price, and quality, to stay afloat, says Paul Thomas, senior consultant at Retail Remedy. The limping Asda ship has a new captain and for Sean Clarke\u2019s first trading update, it could be no worse. It is too soon for the new CEO to have had any significant impact but a 7.5% decline in like for like sales is apocalyptic for Asda. There is absolutely no honeymoon period for Sean Clarke: it\u2019s a case of get in there and power up the defibrillator. Back to this morning\u2019s UK retail sales figures, and this chart shows how shoppers have benefitted from falling prices since mid 2014. The weaker pound could end this trend, though, by pushing up import costs.... Some aghast reaction to ASDA\u2019s sales slump: Ouch. In fact. double-ouch. Sales at ASDA, the supermarket chain owned by US mega-group Walmart, have fallen by 7.5% in the last quarter - its worst performance ever! Walmart says it is urgently addressing the situation, but admits turning Asda around will take time given the \u201ccompetitive environment in the UK\u201d, and food deflation. Back in June, Walmart surprise retail experts by parachuting the head of its Chinese operation, Sean Clarke, to run Asda. Like all UK supermarkets, Asda has been squeezed by the rise of discount chains such as Aldi and Lidl. It is also struggling to cope with the shift towards online shopping, and the move away from large supermarkets towards smaller convenience stores. Newsflash: Sports Direct has announced plans to review its own board. The retail chain, whose working practices were exposed by the Guardian last December, has also told the City that its own internal review will be published early next month. Here\u2019s the statement: Sports Direct announces that the independent report on working practices being undertaken by the law firm RPC, which will review and report on the internal investigation announced in December 2015, will be published in the week commencing 5 September 2016, (ahead of the AGM on 7 September 2016). An external evaluation of the board is planned for later this financial year. In other retail news, Amazon has just announced is is opening a new fulfilment centre in Tilbury, Essex next year. This will create 1,500 new permanent jobs, but Amazon will also be deploying its latest Robotics technology, which means.... The robots slide under a tower of shelves where products are stowed, lift it and move it through the fulfilment centre. Robots help speed order processing time and reduce walking time by moving the shelves to employees, reducing the time taken to stow items for sale or pick them for new customer orders. They also save space, allowing for 50 per cent more items to be stowed per square foot. Here\u2019s a recent feature about Amazon\u2019s smart robot work: The jump in the pound suggests investors have been too gloomy about the UK since the Brexit vote, says Arnaud Masset, market analyst at Swissquote Bank. Perhaps July\u2019s solid retail sales are a once-off and the positive effects of the weaker pound will be short-lived. However, one thing is certain: the market has been overly pessimistic in the wake of the Brexit vote and clearly needs to better assess the lay of the land. It appears that Britain\u2019s shopkeepers are benefitting from a flurry of tourists, thanks to the slump in the pound since the Brexit vote Joe Grice, Chief Economic Adviser at the Office for National Statistics, explains: \u201cThese are strong numbers showing a pronounced increase in sales compared with last July. Better weather this year could be a major factor with sales of clothing and footwear doing particularly well. There is also anecdotal evidence from respondents suggesting the weaker pound has encouraged overseas visitors to spend. Department stores and specialist retailers like jewellers are among those reporting a good month.\u201d Sterling is rocketing higher, as fears of a Brexit-induced recession ease. The pound has jumped by over one cent against the US dollar to $1.3154, a two week-high, as traders hail the 1.4% jump in retail sales last month. It\u2019s also up 0.8 eurocents at \u20ac1.1631, bouncing back from Tuesday\u2019s three-year low. Andy Scott, economist at HiFX, says British consumers appear to be \u201cunfazed\u201d by the Brexit vote. That could mean the UK avoids falling into recession, as some economists had feared. Scott says: Sentiment is key to avoiding a prolonged downturn or recession and the consumers willingness to spend would point to it holding up well. This chart shows exactly how British retail sales surged by 5.9% year-on-year in July (note how prices fell across the sector) City experts are hailing the surprise rise in UK retail sales in July. Joshua Mahony of IG points out that it follows yesterday\u2019s decent unemployment figures. It may mean the economy actually keeps growing this quarter, despite Brexit uncertainty, says Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight: Jeremy Cook of currency exchange firm World First reckons consumers could play a big role in keeping the economy moving: But economist Rupert Seggins remans cautious: No immediate sign of a Brexit shock here.... Every part of the UK retail sector enjoyed growth last month, with non-food stores doing particularly well. And consumers benefitted from cheaper prices in July. The ONS explains: Compared with June 2016, the quantity bought increased by 1.4%; all sectors showed growth with the main contribution again coming from non-food stores. Average store prices (including petrol stations) fell by 2.0% in July 2016 compared with July 2015. Compared with June 2016, there was a fall of 0.8%. BOOM! UK retail sales have soared in July, despite the uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote. Retail sales jumped by 1.4% month-on-month, smashing expectations of a rise of just 0.1% to 0.2%. If you strip out fuel sales, retail sales were 1.5% higher. And on an annual basis, retail sales were almost 6% higher than in July 2015. It\u2019s still early days, but it does suggests that consumers aren\u2019t gripped by post-referendum angst. The Office for National Statistics says that retailers benefitted from warm weather in July, as Brits finally their wardrobes with summery clothing. And the slump in the pound may also have helped, by encouraging overseas visitors to come to the UK. More to follow.... As retail analyst Mark Brumby points out, retail spending isn\u2019t the best route to economic prosperity (especially given Britain\u2019s current account deficit!): Kingfisher, which owns the B&amp;Q do-it-yourself chain, is a decent barometer of the UK retail world. So investors are encouraged to see that it posted a 3% jump in sales over the last quarter. CEO V\u00e9ronique Laury told shareholders that the EU referendum vote has created uncertainty, but: \u201cThere has been no clear evidence of an impact on demand so far on our businesses.\u201d Neil Wilson, markets analyst at ETX Capital, reckons Kingfisher might actually profit from a slowdown in the housing market: Brexit uncertainty, which looks to have cooled the UK property market, may actually be helping as homeowners improve rather than move. Moving home costs money and people may be more inclined to sit tight, perhaps re-mortgage to a lower rate, and carry out home improvements. European stock markets are starting the day with a gentle rally, as fears of an imminent US interest rate hike recede. The FTSE 100 index has risen by 24 points, or 0.35%, to 6883, which recovers most of yesterday\u2019s losses. Mining shares are leading the risers, with Antofagasta and BHP Billiton jumping by 2.5%. The markets in Spain, Italy, Germany and France have all risen by around 0.7%. Last nights dovish minutes from the Federal Reserve are the main factor, with traders anticipating that US interest rates won\u2019t rise in September. Reading the tealeaves in today\u2019s retail sales figures may be tricky, warn economists at RBC Capital Markets. They write: In the UK this morning brings news of retail sales in July. Given it is the first month of data following the referendum result, there will be interest from those trying to discern how the consumer has behaved in the aftermath of the surprise result. However, this isn\u2019t the easiest series to interpret in terms of the read across to broader macro aggregates. Quelle surprise! France\u2019s unemployment rate has hit its lowest level since 2012. In a boost to embattled president Francois Hollande, the French jobless rate has dipped to 9.9% in the second quarter of 2016. That\u2019s the lowest level since the third quarter of 2012, shortly after the socialist leader was sworn in as president (and promptly saw his plane struck by lightning as he flew to meet Angela Merkel). France\u2019s persistently high unemployment rate has dogged Hollande\u2019s presidency; he had pledged to bring it down, but instead the jobless total has hit a series of record highs. And even at 9.9%, France\u2019s unemployment rate is basically double that of the UK or America. So there\u2019s still lots of work for Hollande, or his successor, to do, as Reuters explains: Unemployment was down in all age categories, but the fall in youth unemployment was sharper: it fell 0.4 points to 24.3%, the lowest since 2014. The percentage of long-term unemployed -- those registered as out of work for over a year -- remained stable at 4.3%, however. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Once dubbed a nation of shopkeepers, Modern Britain now looks more like a nation of shoppers. And today we get our first official signal of how June\u2019s Brexit vote has hit consumers. July\u2019s retail sales figures, due at 9.30am, will show whether shopping habits took a knock in the weeks after Britain voted to leave the EU. Economists predict that retail sales crept up by just 0.1% during the month, which would mean sales were 3.9% higher than a year ago. In June, retail sales fell by 0.9% \u2013 the biggest decline in six months \u2013 so the City is hoping for a recovery in July. A poor reading could show that the Brexit vote is eroding confidence, while a decent report might reassure policymakers that Brits are taking the situation in their stride. Yesterday\u2019s unemployment figures didn\u2019t show much impact from the vote, with Britain\u2019s jobless rate remaining at just 4.9%. But it\u2019s not all rosy out there. Pollsters at TMS reported that the British public\u2019s confidence in the economy has fallen sharply since the vote to leave the European Union. TMS found that 33% of Britons think the economy has worsened compared with a year ago, up 11 points from April. Also coming up today.... Investors are still digesting the minutes of the last US Federal Reserve meeting, which were released last night. They show that the Fed was split over the prospects of an early interest rate hike. That\u2019s likely to push shares higher in Europe today. They\u2019re also watching the Japanese yen nervously, as it bobs a In the corporate world, the Co-operative Bank and retail group Kingfisher are publishing results this morning, with US retail giant Wal-Mart around lunchtime. And in the eurozone, we\u2019re getting French unemployment figures, and eurozone inflation.",

That\u2019s hysterical!\u201d</p> <p>Unhappiness over Apple\u2019s exclusive control of the Frank Ocean release comes a year after Taylor Swift wrote an open letter to Apple and its CEO, Tim Cook, finding it to be \u201cshocking, disappointing, and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous company\u201d that the firm was refusing to pay artists streaming revenue during its free, three-month trial period. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/22/apple-royalties-u-turn-is-taylor-swift-the-most-powerful-woman-in-music\">Apple ultimately backed down</a>.</p> <p>Previously, Apple had been forced into an embarrassing apology after loading half a billion Apple iTunes users with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/09/u2-songs-of-innocence-itunes-customers-free-album\">latest U2 album</a> during an iPhone launch. The download, for which Apple paid the band a reputed $60m, proved to be a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2014/sep/10/ten-things-to-do-with-unwanted-u2-free-album-apple\">PR disaster</a> for the company and the band. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/26/beyonce-lemonade-jay-z-becky-pop-culture\">How Beyonc\u00e9's Lemonade became a pop culture phenomenon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The company\u2019s dispute with Swift predates the current trend for \u201cexclusives\u201d among streaming services \u2013 often accused of paying pitiful rates to copyright holders \u2013 as part of an effort to drive up subscriptions. For some artists, the war for subscribers has proved highly profitable even if, as many argue, the services ultimately serve to restrict rather than enhance broader consumer appeal. </p> <p>Last year, Apple paid the Canadian rapper Drake a reported $19m for an exclusive deal \u2013 a figure Apple has since disputed \u2013 to steal him away from signing with Jay Z\u2019s Tidal. \u201cI think that\u2019s just his competitive nature, and I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s looking at the bigger picture: that it\u2019s not about me and it\u2019s not about him. It\u2019s about the future of the music business,\u201d Jay Z later said of Iovine. </p> <p>But as the battle for artists, especially those from the hip-hop/R&amp;B world, heats up, can Grainge \u2013 recently named the music business\u2019s most powerful executive \u2013 or any other label rival hope to compete? </p> <p>\u201cUpfront money talks,\u201d points out one former record company head, cautioning that the deals work for the streaming services but not necessarily for artists and labels. </p> <p>But with industry leader Spotify competing against the deep-pocketed tech giants Apple, Google and Amazon, hungry for market share, the stage is set for a new showdown over control as streaming becomes the dominant means of distribution.</p> <p>To Lefsetz, exclusives represent a misreading of the market that will ultimately alienate consumers. \u201cApple Music is a me-too product that works badly that\u2019s locked behind a paywall and the music industry wants it to be the dominant platform so the fan is squeezed and indie acts are pushed down to the bottom where they belong.\u201d</p> <p>But as the music industry awaits confirmation that UMG is pulling out of streaming exclusives, Lefsetz is also taking artists who sign exclusive distribution deals to task. </p> <p>\u201cShame on you Frank, and shame on everybody else who takes money from Apple and screws fans. There\u2019s enough money in music without taking every last buck, and the joke is on you, for thinking so short term, you want your music available to everybody, because in these days of information overload we need nobody, everybody is superfluous, you don\u2019t want to enter the marketplace with one hand tied behind your back,\u201d he wrote.</p>",

That\u2019s hysterical!\u201d Unhappiness over Apple\u2019s exclusive control of the Frank Ocean release comes a year after Taylor Swift wrote an open letter to Apple and its CEO, Tim Cook, finding it to be \u201cshocking, disappointing, and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous company\u201d that the firm was refusing to pay artists streaming revenue during its free, three-month trial period. Apple ultimately backed down. Previously, Apple had been forced into an embarrassing apology after loading half a billion Apple iTunes users with the latest U2 album during an iPhone launch. The download, for which Apple paid the band a reputed $60m, proved to be a PR disaster for the company and the band. The company\u2019s dispute with Swift predates the current trend for \u201cexclusives\u201d among streaming services \u2013 often accused of paying pitiful rates to copyright holders \u2013 as part of an effort to drive up subscriptions. For some artists, the war for subscribers has proved highly profitable even if, as many argue, the services ultimately serve to restrict rather than enhance broader consumer appeal. Last year, Apple paid the Canadian rapper Drake a reported $19m for an exclusive deal \u2013 a figure Apple has since disputed \u2013 to steal him away from signing with Jay Z\u2019s Tidal. \u201cI think that\u2019s just his competitive nature, and I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s looking at the bigger picture: that it\u2019s not about me and it\u2019s not about him. It\u2019s about the future of the music business,\u201d Jay Z later said of Iovine. But as the battle for artists, especially those from the hip-hop/R&amp;B world, heats up, can Grainge \u2013 recently named the music business\u2019s most powerful executive \u2013 or any other label rival hope to compete? \u201cUpfront money talks,\u201d points out one former record company head, cautioning that the deals work for the streaming services but not necessarily for artists and labels. But with industry leader Spotify competing against the deep-pocketed tech giants Apple, Google and Amazon, hungry for market share, the stage is set for a new showdown over control as streaming becomes the dominant means of distribution. To Lefsetz, exclusives represent a misreading of the market that will ultimately alienate consumers. \u201cApple Music is a me-too product that works badly that\u2019s locked behind a paywall and the music industry wants it to be the dominant platform so the fan is squeezed and indie acts are pushed down to the bottom where they belong.\u201d But as the music industry awaits confirmation that UMG is pulling out of streaming exclusives, Lefsetz is also taking artists who sign exclusive distribution deals to task. \u201cShame on you Frank, and shame on everybody else who takes money from Apple and screws fans. There\u2019s enough money in music without taking every last buck, and the joke is on you, for thinking so short term, you want your music available to everybody, because in these days of information overload we need nobody, everybody is superfluous, you don\u2019t want to enter the marketplace with one hand tied behind your back,\u201d he wrote.",

Apple paid a tax rate on European profits of between 0.005% and 1%, according to the EU\u2019s executive arm. The US technology group, and Ireland, have said they will appeal against the decision but it will have ramifications for countries and companies across Europe. </p> <h2>Why has the European commission ordered Ireland to claw back up to \u20ac13bn in tax from Apple?</h2> <p>The commission has found that Apple benefited from a sweetheart tax ruling granted by Ireland decades ago, saving the iPhone-maker huge sums in taxes over many years. The ruling was not only generous but gave Apple special tax treatment unavailable to competitors. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/30/apple-pay-back-taxes-eu-ruling-ireland-state-aid\">As such, competition officials in Brussels have found it amounted to unlawful state aid under EU rules.</a> The sweetheart deal allowed Apple to shift up to two-thirds of its global profits through a handful of Irish-registered companies that routinely paid less than 1% tax.</p> <h2>Are other companies in the line of fire?</h2> <p>Over the past four years the commission has been looking at similar generous tax deals handed out to multinationals, questioning whether they too amount to unlawful state aid. Tax rulings from Luxembourg and the Netherlands \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/21/starbucks-and-fiat-tax-deals-with-eu-nations-ruled-unlawful\">granted to Fiat and Starbucks respectively</a> \u2013 have already been found unlawful.

That will boost Ireland\u2019s public purse, but in the longer term it may damage its reputation as one of the most attractive places for multinational companies such as Facebook and Google to locate their operations.<br></p> <h2>Will Ireland cease to be a tax haven for multinationals?</h2> <p>Ireland has been under pressure to ditch its most aggressive tax deals for multinationals for many years. Pressure comes not just from other European countries, but also from the US, where Ireland has been heavily criticised for helping big businesses hoard profits offshore, beyond the reach of the US tax authorities. The so-called \u201cdouble Irish\u201d tax structure, which has been used by Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Apple, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/14/ireland-abolish-double-irish-tax-scheme-apple\">is being phased out</a>.

                "bodyText":"The European commission has ordered Apple to pay back the Irish state up to \u20ac13bn in taxes in a landmark ruling. Apple paid a tax rate on European profits of between 0.005% and 1%, according to the EU\u2019s executive arm. The US technology group, and Ireland, have said they will appeal against the decision but it will have ramifications for countries and companies across Europe. Why has the European commission ordered Ireland to claw back up to \u20ac13bn in tax from Apple? The commission has found that Apple benefited from a sweetheart tax ruling granted by Ireland decades ago, saving the iPhone-maker huge sums in taxes over many years. The ruling was not only generous but gave Apple special tax treatment unavailable to competitors. As such, competition officials in Brussels have found it amounted to unlawful state aid under EU rules. The sweetheart deal allowed Apple to shift up to two-thirds of its global profits through a handful of Irish-registered companies that routinely paid less than 1% tax. Are other companies in the line of fire? Over the past four years the commission has been looking at similar generous tax deals handed out to multinationals, questioning whether they too amount to unlawful state aid. Tax rulings from Luxembourg and the Netherlands \u2013 granted to Fiat and Starbucks respectively \u2013 have already been found unlawful. In both cases the companies are appealing against the commission\u2019s findings. Meanwhile, competition regulators are also investigating a tax deal from Luxembourg awarded to both McDonald\u2019s and Amazon. Will EU taxpayers benefit and will multinationals become more transparent with tax? If the commission\u2019s decision is not overturned on appeal, then Ireland will have to recalculate years of back taxes and send Apple a large bill. That will boost Ireland\u2019s public purse, but in the longer term it may damage its reputation as one of the most attractive places for multinational companies such as Facebook and Google to locate their operations. Will Ireland cease to be a tax haven for multinationals? Ireland has been under pressure to ditch its most aggressive tax deals for multinationals for many years. Pressure comes not just from other European countries, but also from the US, where Ireland has been heavily criticised for helping big businesses hoard profits offshore, beyond the reach of the US tax authorities. The so-called \u201cdouble Irish\u201d tax structure, which has been used by Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Apple, is being phased out. However, Ireland has made sure it has other replacement tax breaks to keep multinationals from moving elsewhere. Will this make US multinationals bring their cash piles home? The last place American multinationals want to move profits is back home to the US, where the 35% headline tax rate is one of the highest in the world. While many big firms worry that Brussels may try to chase these huge cash reserves, they would prefer to be taxed in Europe than America so are unlikely to repatriate funds. Can Apple afford to pay back \u20ac13bn? Yes it can. The technology group \u2013 valued at $570bn on the stock market \u2013 has a cash stockpile of more than $230bn, of which more than 90% is kept outside the US so that it does not attract US tax. Therefore the ruling should not have a material impact on the group\u2019s finances or its considerable research and development spending. The \u20ac13bn represents more than a quarter of its last full year profits, which were $53.4bn and is equal to sales of 20m iPhone6 Plus handsets, at a current UK cost price of \u00a3539. What does \u20ac13bn mean to Ireland? It is a huge sum \u2013 more than the \u20ac12.9bn annual government spending on the Irish health service and nearly one-third of Ireland\u2019s total government tax revenue in 2015, which was \u20ac45.6bn. It is also the equivalent of \u20ac2,830 for every one of Ireland\u2019s 4.6 million population. Could a post-Brexit UK now offer such generous tax deals? Brussels has no power over corporation tax rates, which member states have always been able to set themselves. The former chancellor, George Osborne, had pledged to make Britain the most competitive G20 country in terms of corporation tax. That has seen him set a roadmap that, unless it is adjusted by his successor, Philip Hammond, will soon take the UK corporate tax rate down to 17%. Once it is outside the EU, Britain would have even more leeway to offer special deals to multinationals in the hope they would invest in the UK.
