It may end up that interest rates of 1-2 per cent become the norm rather than the exception. </p> <p>With inflation low and likely to remain low, the Reserve Bank can attempt to run the economy at a faster rate by cutting interest rates. The aim is to boost spending, employment and investment with the stronger demand lifting the inflation rate back into the 2-3% target band.</p> <p><strong>But there are no guarantees that lower rates will indeed boost economic growth</strong> and inflation. That doesn\u2019t mean that you give up trying. Central banks need to do everything in their power to stimulate growth and prevent super-low inflation rates being sustained. And certainly do everything to prevent deflation (falling prices) from taking hold.</p> </blockquote> <p>That seems a suitably apt point at which to call it a day. </p> <p>You can read a full story on the day\u2019s dramatic developments here.

                "bodyText":"I\u2019m closing the blog now but there is plenty of food for thought from the RBA decision, not least Australia\u2019s ability or otherwise to resist global economic trends. Craig James, chief economist at CommSec, has made a very good point about this in a note this afternoon, suggesting that super-low rates may become the norm: While central banks in other parts of the world have been forced to reduce rates to near zero, Australia has never been in that position. But these are extraordinary times with technology, \u201cdisruption\u201d and an environment of conservatism driving global inflation rates lower. The Reserve Bank may be uncomfortable with interest rates at current super-low levels, but these are unusual times. It may end up that interest rates of 1-2 per cent become the norm rather than the exception. With inflation low and likely to remain low, the Reserve Bank can attempt to run the economy at a faster rate by cutting interest rates. The aim is to boost spending, employment and investment with the stronger demand lifting the inflation rate back into the 2-3% target band. But there are no guarantees that lower rates will indeed boost economic growth and inflation. That doesn\u2019t mean that you give up trying. Central banks need to do everything in their power to stimulate growth and prevent super-low inflation rates being sustained. And certainly do everything to prevent deflation (falling prices) from taking hold. That seems a suitably apt point at which to call it a day. You can read a full story on the day\u2019s dramatic developments here. Thanks for reading: A dramatic day for the markets in Australia. Here\u2019s a a summary of the main points: The RBA has cut the cash rate to 1.5% from 1.75%, a new record low Governor Glenn Stevens said low inflation meant the board had to act The risk of a housing market bubble had \u201cdiminished\u201d, giving further justification for a cut The Aussie dollar fell sharply to US75.06c but quickly recovered the losses ASX/S&amp;P200 fared worse, rising slightly before dropping 0.7% in volatile trade Commonwealth Bank has passed 0.13% of the cut on to borrowers 10-year bond yields have fallen to a record low of 1.83% Chris Weston at IG reckons the RBA has \u201cthrown caution to the wind\u201d with its analysis of the housing market. Basically, Chris argues, the policy makers don\u2019t think lower rates are going to make any difference to the house prices any more: The Reserve Bank have effectively thrown caution to the wind, respecting their mandate for price stability, amid diminishing negative effects from lower interest rates. One noticeable issue here is the lack of concern lower rates are likely to have on the housing market, with even a hint of concern around the apartment market. It seems we may have reached an inflection point where the consumer is just not enthused about where borrowing rates are and this is something incoming RBA governor Philip Lowe has been arguing in recent times. More reaction flooding in. David Bassanese of BetaShares reckons it\u2019s basically good news. This is his view: The Reserve Bank\u2019s decision to cut interest today was in line with my long-hold expectation that the cash rate would fall to 1.5%. The good news for the economy, however, is that it has been much lower-than-expected inflation \u2013 rather than weaker-than-expected economic growth \u2013 that drove the RBA\u2019s latest decision. And more tweets: My colleague in the Canberra bureau, Gareth Hutchens, has this observation about the RBA statement and what it says about the housing market: The Reserve Bank believes the risk of exacerbating problems in the housing market with further interest rate cuts has diminished. It lists a number of reasons why: Supervisory measures have strengthened lending standards, and a number of lenders are taking \u201ca more cautious attitude\u201d to lending in certain segments. Growth in lending for housing purposes has slowed a little this year. The most recent information suggests that dwelling prices have been rising \u201conly moderately\u201d this year, with \u201cconsiderable\u201d supply of apartments scheduled to come on stream over the next couple of years, particularly in the eastern capital cities. All this suggests that \u201cthe likelihood of lower interest rates exacerbating risks in the housing market has diminished\u201d, it says. The biggest bank has already moved to pass on some of the rate cut to borrowers. Standard variable mortgage holders will pay 0.13% less to take their borrowing costs to 5.22%. That\u2019s still a fairly hefty margin for the banks though - consumer groups might hve something to say about that decision. ASX/S&amp;P200 has bounced back after the RBA announcement. It climbed 30 points to nearly 5575 points but has dipped slightly again in the last few minutes as traders digest the implications of what looks like sustained low interest rates for Australia. Australian bond yields \u2013 the cost of borrowing for the government \u2013 have extended their falls after the announcement. Over to you Scott Morrison to get the cheque book out and get that new infrastructure built? Lots of reaction: The statement by the RBA governor, Glenn Stevens, is interesting in how little it varies from the statement made last month, when there was no change to rates. For example last month he said of the Australian economy: In Australia, recent data suggest overall growth is continuing, despite a very large decline in business investment. Other areas of domestic demand, as well as exports, have been expanding at a pace at or above trend. Labour market indicators have been more mixed of late, but are consistent with a modest pace of expansion in employment in the near term. This month he says: In Australia, recent data suggest that overall growth is continuing at a moderate pace, despite a very large decline in business investment. Other areas of domestic demand, as well as exports, have been expanding at a pace at or above trend. Labour market indicators continue to be somewhat mixed, but are consistent with a modest pace of expansion in employment in the near term\u201d. Almost no change in wording at all. So why cut rates this month and not last month? It would appear they were waiting for the inflation numbers, and when they came out low, the decision was made for them. Recent data confirm that inflation remains quite low. Given very subdued growth in labour costs and very low cost pressures elsewhere in the world, this is expected to remain the case for some time. The dollar is pushing below US75c. But as Greg pointed earlier in the blog, it might not last. The cash rate is now an all-time low of 1.5%. Nearly there ... just a few minutes to go before the announcement in what is also a big day for the markets in Japan. Prime minister Shinzo Abe is expected to give details on his 28 trillion yen fiscal stimulus package today (that\u2019s around US$266bn). The Nikkei is down around 0.7% as investors await the details but there\u2019s also pressure on stocks from the falling price of crude oil. Overnight it entered a bear market down below $40 \u2013 a fall of a fifth since June. But if we had a live reporter we\u2019d now be saying \u201cover to Martin Place now ...\u201d But another rate cut would encourage investment in the housing market at a time when many would suggest it doesn\u2019t need any more encouraging \u2013 because a housing glut is on the way. While the latest building approvals figures did show a fall, the reality is we are still building a lot of houses and apartments \u2013 yes down from the record levels a year ago, but still historically very high: And one of the problems with this is that the major increase in apartments and other non-house dwelling in Melbourne and Sydney is that there is a very great deal of apartments that have been approved to be built but which have yet to start construction: There certainly is no great need to encourage investors to build dwellings, the worry is that too many are already being built and are planned to be built. One area this has an impact is rental prices. Rental prices around the nation are growing more slowly than they have for many years: Again this is unlikely because people are reducing their demand for renting, but more an indicator of the overall weak inflation growth and the increase in supply. The RBA may be worried that another cut might just exacerbate this, and eventually see an oversupply of apartments leading to a collapse in the prices, which would cascade on housing prices overall. The question perhaps, given how likely it is that a rate cut will happen, isn\u2019t if the RBA will cut rates, but whether they should. If inflation is a symptom of strong competition and weak work prices, then a rate cut is not going to do much to improve it. That\u2019s not to say a rate cut won\u2019t have an impact. Having less to pay each month in your mortgage does give people an incentive to spend more money. More spending = more turnover = more jobs = more growth in the economy. At least that\u2019s the theory. Given the low rates it could also see people needing to invest more to get the same return. It also might not really have an impact in the area of housing. Are there that many people holding out on buying a house because 5.4% isn\u2019t low enough? The latest building approvals figures out today showed a continued slowing of private sector approvals: The slowing is occurring in most states \u2013 except South Australia where things are going pretty strong: It is unlikely another rate cut would set off another housing boom, especially since housing prices have increased by 31% since December 2011, whereas wages have grown just 11% in that time: The impact of inflation on mortgage rates is also of course a factor as well. While mortgage rates are at record lows, because inflation growth is also scraping along the bottom, that means the real rate of your mortgage is not at a record low: It is lower than it was during the housing boom year before the GFC, but paying 3.7% above inflation on your mortgage is not stunningly low. And because term deposits are at record lows in real terms this means that the gap between what the banks charge to lend you money and what they pay to obtain your money (term deposits are in effect you lending money to the bank) is wider than it has been for over a decade: Basically, since August 2013, the banks have cuts term deposit rates by more than they have mortgages. What about for savers? The cash rate also affects the interest rates banks give you for holding your money. And not surprisingly, because the cash rate is at record lows, so too are the rates for term deposits \u2013 just 2.5% return for the \u201cspecial average rate\u201d: What this mean in real terms is that investors are getting less than a 1% return above inflation: Long gone are the glory days where self-funded retirees could invest in essentially risk-free term deposits and get a real return of above 2%. So what would a rate cut mean in the real world? Well currently the average variable mortgage rate is 5.40% \u2013 the lowest since July 1968 (top of the charts at the time in Australia was the Seekers\u2019 Greatest Hits). The discount rate of 4.60% is lower than any rates we have on record: But rather interestingly banks might not pass on the full cut should the RBA cut the cash rate. The gap between the average mortgage rate and the cash rate is now larger than ever: So while a full 25 basis points cut would reduce the fortnightly payments of a $300,000 loan at 30 years from $777.13 to $755.65, don\u2019t spend that extra $21.50 a fortnight just yet. A little bit more reaction on today\u2019s poor data on the Australian economy. Building approvals and trade figures were both disappointing on the downside for the market. Here\u2019s CommSec economist Savanth Sebastian A weaker set of economic results. A modest slide in the number of dwelling approvals, and a substantial rise in the trade deficit. The only positives to be taken out of the data related to the rise in the value of building approvals. Overall there is nothing in the data to stop the Reserve Bank from cutting interest rates if they deem it necessary. As ever the situation of Australia\u2019s exchange rate will be a factor. Cutting the cash rate should \u2013 all other things being equal \u2013 lead to the value of our dollar falling. This makes our exports cheaper and our imports more expensive. But all other things, alas, are never equal. When the RBA cut the cash rate in May, the value of our dollar was US$0.75. It fell for a bit and then rose again and now sits at ... US$0.75: And while the price of our imports is a factor in our low inflation figures, the reality is inflation is just low everywhere. While the prices of tradables were flat in the past year, the prices of non-tradable items grew at near record lows of just 1.6%: One further argument in favour of the position that the supply side/strong competition is driving low inflation rather than weak demand is that the growth of prices is weak both internationally and domestically. In the past 12 months the price of those \u201ctradable\u201d goods and services which have prices driven mostly on the international market \u2013 eg petrol, most foods, furniture and personal products, audio/visual equipment, motor cars and international holidays \u2013 grew not at all. There\u2019s not much the RBA can do about the price of wheat, oil or Ikea furniture. And weak prices overseas may be due to weak demand throughout the world for products, but that low price really doesn\u2019t reflect the strength of demand in Australia. Petrol prices in the past year dropped 11% and they are now back to 2009 levels: The RBA cutting rates won\u2019t do anything to increase petrol prices \u2013 and petrol alone accounts for 3.55% of the CPI index. There is some conjecture that the low inflation rate is not so much an indicator of weak demand in the economy, but strong competition on the supply side. Certainly when you look at the growth of food prices this aspect comes into play: In the past 12 months the average prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages fell by 0.1%. Now clearly that\u2019s not because people have reduced their demand for food and drink. An excellent example of this is milk. It was just a given that the price of milk would go up at along the same pace as overall inflation until Coles and Woolworths embarked on their milk price war, which now sees milk costing the same as it did a decade ago, despite overall inflation being nearly 30% higher than then: But even when we exclude food and beverages (which accounts for 16% of CPI), inflation remains very low: One thing the expectation for a rate cut shows us is how changed the outlook for the economy has become over the past two years. In August 2014, the cash rate was at 2.5% and the market was expecting it to mostly stay there. Instead within a year it was cut twice to 2%. In August last year the market though there would be a cut by now to 1.75% - so they got that right. But they expected by the end of this year things to be improving: The story of the past two years is the market thinking inflation and economic growth will return to some sort of normality, and then later revising those expectations down. Here\u2019s hoping in a year\u2019s time we are not still seeing this trend. The big reason most expect a rate cut is that the latest inflation figures out last week showed the CPI growing annual at just 1%. The two RBA \u201cunderlying\u201d or \u201ccore\u201d inflation measures were also calculated to be growing at just 1.7% for the trimmed mean and 1.3% for the weighted median \u2013 both record lows and all three measures, are well below the RBA\u2019s target band of 2% to 3%: Now just because inflation is outside the target band does not mean the RBA will necessarily act. That band is the aim over the cycle \u2013 so they don\u2019t mind if it occasionally drops below or goes above. But underlying inflation has now been below 2% since September last year, and actual CPI hasn\u2019t been above 2% since September 2014. It is unlikely the RBA would not look to raise rate were the situation reversed and inflation was running over 3% for nearly two years. So if they don\u2019t cut, it might be a sign that the RBA either doesn\u2019t care too much about low inflation, that it\u2019s real inflation band is more 1.5% to 3%, or that it doesn\u2019t think a rate cut will do anything. Over to Greg then... With a week to go before the Rio Olympics, forget wondering whether records will be broken. For that we need only look to Martin Place in Sydney at 2:30pm. Just three months since the RBA cut the cash rate to a record low of 1.75% we have the strong expectation that another record is to be set. The market yesterday was rating it a 68% chance that a cut would occur: This roughly agrees with the odd you can get on the betting sites \u2013 Sportsbet is paying $1.60 for a cut to 1.5% \u2013 which translates to a 62.5% chance. Though the future market today has pushed the likelihood up even further to around 72%. It\u2019s rare the bank goes against the market expectations, but even if it doesn\u2019t happen today, the market has now fully priced in a rate cut by November. Good afternoon and welcome to the live blog on the Reserve Bank\u2019s latest monetary policy decision \u2013 aka interest rates decision. Greg Jericho will be here shortly with his inimitable mix of analysis and comment but before then just a quick bit of scene-setting. The market now believes there is a 76.6% chance that the RBA will cut rates again today \u2013 to a new all-time low of 1.5% (assuming just a 0.25% cut), according to CommSec. The cash rate was last cut in May to 1.75%. That follows worse than expected official figures on building approvals earlier today. Approvals for the construction of new homes fell 2.9% in June, which was worse than market expectations of a 0.5% rise. In other gloomy news, Australia\u2019s trade deficit grew in June from $2.2bn to $3.1bn Shares across Asia Pacific are subdued in the run-up to the RBA decision at 2.30pm AEST. The Aussie is flat at around US75.35c ahead of the meeting but 10-year bond yields are at an all-time low, indicating a bearish outlook for the dollar.",

                "bodyText":"Leading shares are slipping back following recent disappointing economic data - the latest being poor construction figures - and continuing weakness in the oil price. But Direct Line and InterContinental Hotels have bucked the downward trend after their latest updates. Insurer Direct Line has jumped 8% to 383.8p as first half profits fell 5% to \u00a3316.9m after lower investment gains and a new levy to cut insurance costs for homes in flood-risk areas. But the figure was more than 20% than consensus forecasts, and the company also said it would pay a special dividend of 10p a share on top of its interim payout of 4.9p a share. Peel Hunt analyst Andreas van Embden said: Direct Line surprised with an increase in reserve releases, a large part of which is one-off but provides strong support to solvency and the dividend. The solvency ratio was a healthy 184%, well above the usual 150% level following the approval of its partial internal model. This has allowed the company to offer an interim special dividend of 10p on top of the basic dividend per share. After a weak share price performance, these results will go down well and whilst guidance is unchanged, 2016 underwriting results should come in at the top end of the range. At a PE of 14 times, the shares are fairly valued but offer a \u2018best in class\u2019 dividend yield (around 7%). UBS analysts said: A 20% pretax profit beat, an interim special well ahead of expectations, strong capital position, improved outlook, should be taken well, albeit the shares are not cheap on 1.9 times 2016 estimated total net asset value (top end of its historical range). Direct Line is the biggest riser in the FTSE 100, and not far behind is rival Admiral which has added 50p to \u00a321.99. Meanwhile InterContinental Hotels is up 95p at \u00a331.09 after faster growth in its global room revenue in the second quarter. Revenue per available room rose 2.5% in the three months to June compared with a 1.5% increase in the first quarter. Operating profit rose 2% to $344m. Chief executive Richard Solomons said: The fundamentals for our industry, and particularly for IHG as one of the largest branded players, remain compelling...Despite the uncertain environment in some markets, we remain confident in the outlook for the remainder of the year. Numis analysts said: Underlying earnings before interest and tax of $344m represented growth of 10% and was marginally ahead of consensus expectations of around $331m (Bloomberg). The key drivers were RevPAR growth of 2.0% and net system growth of 3.6%, consistent with medium term guidance. Following the return of $1.5bn to shareholders, net debt of $1.8bn was as expected and represents leverage of 2.3 times EBITDA. Group RevPAR grew by 2.5% in the second quarter of 2016, faster than +1.5% in the first quarter, and more comparable to 2.4% from the fourth quarter of 2015. Part of the improvement reflected an earlier Easter. Also weakness in oil producing states in the US is starting to annualise: RevPAR in oil producing states fell by 6.3% and the remainder grew +3.7%. Overall the FTSE 100 has fallen 31.98 points to 6661.97 ahead of this week\u2019s Bank of England rate decision, with growing anticipation of a cut, and despite a new Japanese stimulus package to try and boost its economy. With gold and silver prices edging up as investors look for less risky asset, Mexican precious metal miner Fresnillo is up 60p at \u00a319.83 - helped by a positive update - and Randgold Resources has risen 175p to \u00a390.85. Consumer goods groups were also in demand, with Unilever up 45.5p at 3579.5p and Reckitt Benckiser 80p better at \u00a374.31. But valve control specialist Rotork has slumped nearly 10% to 193.4p.

                "bodyText":"Japan\u2019s prime minister Shinzo Abe has unveiled a new multi-trillion yen programme of higher spending on welfare and infrastructure in the latest attempt to steer the country\u2019s struggling economy away from deflation. Tokyo announced a package of largely unspecified tax and spending measures designed to boost activity at a time when exports have been hit by the rising yen and Brexit has dented business confidence. Abe said: \u201cWe compiled today a strong economic package draft aimed at carrying out investment for the future. \u201cWith this package, we\u2019ll proceed to not just stimulate demand but also achieve sustainable economic growth led by private demand.\u201d But the package has failed to impress financial markets, which said the additional boost to demand would be much smaller than the 28tn yen (\u00a3207bn) announced by Abe. Analysts said the additional government spending would be 6tn yen (\u00a344bn), only three-quarters of which would be spent in the current fiscal year. Yields on Japanese bonds rose after Abe announced details of his fiscal plan because investors were fearful that it marked a change of policy in Tokyo. The Bank of Japan has been using aggressive monetary policy \u2013 including negative interest rates and large tranches of quantitative easing \u2013 as the main weapon in its fight against deflation, but Abe\u2019s fiscal package was seen as a sign that monetary policy has lost its potency. The measures include 2.5tn yen for welfare, including help for poor pensioners and childcare subsidies, 1.7tn yen on infrastructure and 0.6tn yen for small and medium sized companies adversely affected by the UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU. The Bank of Japan surprised financial markets last week when it failed to buy more bonds under its QE programme and added to nervousness by saying it would re-evaluate policy in September. Governor Haruhiko Kuroda declined to comment on the upward move in yields (the interest rate) on Japanese government bonds, JGBs, but said the planned review would not lead the Bank of Japan to weaken its stimulus. \u201cI don\u2019t think that would happen,\u201d Kuroda told reporters, when asked whether the promised \u201ccomprehensive review\u201d might lead to reduced stimulus.

Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, has sent us his thoughts.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Struggling for any direction that isn\u2019t its current glacial decline the Dow Jones was left wanting, the latest data-dump a decidedly mixed bag. The ADP non-farm employment change reading was better than expected at 179k against the 171k forecast; this number tends to have a rather tenuous link to the government-released non-farm figure, however, leaving it with a limited amount of market relevance. More important was the Markit and ISM services PMIs, yet even these left investors scratching their heads; the former jumped to a better than forecast 51.4, while the latter was far lower than expected, sliding to 55.5 from 56.5 last month. Unsurprisingly the Dow Jones couldn\u2019t find much clarity in these figures, rising a meagre 0.1% after the bell. </p> <p>Tomorrow, then, is the week\u2019s biggie: the first Bank of England \u2018Super Thursday\u2019 with a chance of actually living up to its normally sarcastic moniker. Following the string of ominous UK PMIs between Monday and Wednesday Mark Carney and co. are almost guaranteed to do something on Thursday \u2013 the big question is what?</p> <p>Consensus seems to suggest at the very least a rate cut to 0.25%, with some analysts suggesting it could go as low as 0.1%. <strong>The main uncertainty is over quantitative easing.</strong> A \u00a375bn extension to the pre-existing programme has been floated in certain quarters, though this is expected to be a more hotly debated issue in the MPC than the headline interest rate. Traditional logic would dictate that a rate cut alone should cause the FTSE to rise and the pound to fall; however, there is such an air of expectation around Thursday\u2019s meeting that a lack of QE (or something similar) may lead to disappointment for the former and relief for the latter.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57a20546e4b09f60c88cc7a7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-03T14:57:14.229Z\">3.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Sterling is steadying ahead of tomorrow\u2019s Bank of England decision, trading just off a three-week high against the dollar. Money markets are pricing in a quarter-point interest rate cut. Many economists are also expecting the central bank to announce other measures to stimulate the economy, for example through its quantitative easing (bond-buying) programme.</p> <p>The pound is holding above $1.33, down 0.25% against the dollar.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57a20491e4b053ab6456b3b0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-03T14:51:04.777Z\">3.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Knight Frank\u2019s report also showed that rental transactions for upmarket homes in central London are up since the Brexit vote on 23 June, while rental prices have declined. The lettings market is actually stronger than last summer, thanks to the more \u201crealistic pricing\u201d. More sellers have become landlords due to uncertainty around price growth, the estate agent added.</p> <p>Tim Hyatt, head of lettings at Knight Frank, said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The current lettings market in prime central London is encouragingly stable. We saw a spike in new instructions in the aftermath of the referendum vote, although the number of new applicants registering is slightly down creating an imbalance of supply and demand.</p> <p>From a transaction perspective, the level of new deals has remained strong. In particular, the number of corporate enquiries was encouragingly positive as it was dramatically up on last year, highlighting that confidence in London as a capital city of choice remains strong.</p> <p>Due to the imbalance of supply and demand, landlords need to be realistic when it comes to pricing in an increasingly competitive market. This includes considering price reductions, however significant, in order to reflect value in the current climate.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57a201cae4b09f60c88cc793\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-03T14:41:15.276Z\">3.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>In central London, prices for luxury homes have fallen 1.5% in the year to July, according to upmarket estate agent Knight Frank. It says buyers are typically asking for 10% or more off the asking price.</strong></p> <p>The firm said stamp duty was more of a concern than the recent Brexit vote in prime central London. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Changes to the market over the last two years have meant that the Brexit vote has merely been a trigger for some to make overdue reductions to their asking price. It is too soon to say what impact Brexit will have on pricing but, in many cases, reductions reflect what would have been an appropriate price before the referendum.</p> </blockquote> <p>The number of viewings in June was 17% higher than a year earlier, and demand in areas such as Belgravia and Knightsbridge held up better than elsewhere.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e4d3a87ed42888e9bfedccbdc496e7a2b556fe3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e4d3a87ed42888e9bfedccbdc496e7a2b556fe3/0_290_8688_5213/1000.jpg\" alt=\"8 Whittaker Street, Belgravia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">8 Whittaker Street, Belgravia</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-03T14:57:53.201Z\">at 3.57pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57a20062e4b031196bf5bc77\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-03T14:35:20.899Z\">3.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>OIl prices have moved higher after their recent slide, with Brent crude \u2013 the global benchmark \u2013 up 1.4% at $42.38 a barrel and US West Texas Intermediate up 1.5% at $40.10.

Given current market expectations, in such an event we would only expect a modest impact to sterling, FTSE and 10-year Gilts.</p> <p>A 25bp cut in the base rate will provide no more than a short-term sugar rush to the UK economy and the private sector will continue to be uncooperative. Unwilling or unable to take on the quantities of new debt necessary to overcome the structural headwinds facing the global economy, the response will continue to be the monetary policy equivalent of \u2018Can\u2019t Cook, Won\u2019t Cook\u2019.</p> <p>Price of credit for firms is already low and it is difficult to imagine if businesses are scared or unwilling to invest in the wake of Brexit at 50bp interest rates, whether a further to 25bp will induce them to invest. Our view continues to be that the deflationary pressures exerted by the burden of surplus debt, overcapacity across many industries, and technological disruption are too big in magnitude for monetary policy to counter. Given the private sector lacks the confidence and/or ability to increase credit by the required amount, the onus falls on the public sector.</p> <p>Lower interest rates mean lower margins for the banking sector. It is increasingly difficult for banks to make an attractive spread on deposits without taking large credit and/or deposit risk. This is the clear message from Europe\u2019s experiment with low interest thus far and continues to support our decision to hold zero banks within our Newton UK portfolios.</p> <p>Record-low interest rates and bond yields may validate continuing to pay higher prices for equities and other risk assets, continuing the hunt for yield and supporting safe haven assets. The housing market, particularly in the southeast of England has benefited from the availability of cheap finance. The search for yield and the decision to lower rates may support asset prices in the near-term.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57a1e686e4b053ab6456b2fb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-03T12:43:32.041Z\">1.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The good ADP jobs figures are not necessarily a good guide to Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll numbers.

This was in line with the consensus estimate. Portugal and Spain saw the highest increases (+3.1% and +1.0% MoM respectively), while Germany recorded a 0.1% fall and in France retail sales contracted 0.4% on the month. Year-on-year retail sales expanded by 1.6%.</p> <p>On average, retail sales grew 0.1% over the quarter after a 0.6% increase in the first quarter. The main culprit for the somewhat weaker consumption growth was most likely the 30% increase in oil prices over the quarter, sapping households\u2019 purchasing power.</p> <p>However, since July, energy prices have been weakening again, while July\u2019s PMIs are also showing that job creation remains strong in the Eurozone. Even though Brexit might have a minor adverse impact on consumer confidence, we believe that the underlying fundamentals remain strong enough to support consumption in the second half of the year. That said, we don\u2019t see any strengthening of the expansion in the near future with GDP growth likely to hover around 0.2% over the next few quarters, resulting in a 1.5% expansion for the whole of the year.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57a1b865e4b07e27cb7e05d5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-03T09:25:21.296Z\">10.25am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More from Markit on the UK economy as evidenced from its latest surveys:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/WilliamsonChris/status/760767049752862720\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">PMI shows UK business costs rising due to weaker \u00a3 but selling price inflation unchanged.

As with manufacturing, a snapshot two weeks ago showed a sharp downturn in the wake of Brexit, with <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/22/britains-economy-shrinking-at-fastest-rate-since-2009-says-survey\">the index down from 52.3 in June to 47.4 in July, an 88 month low. </a></strong><br></p> <p>There is an outside chance this will be revised upwards but analysts are not holding their breath. Even if the figure is better than the initial estimate, most economists are betting the economy is weak enough to justify the Bank cutting rates on Thursday, with perhaps an extra package of stimulus to give another boost to business. But some believe central bankers are running out of ammunition. A rate cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia and a Japanese stimulus package, both on Tuesday, did little to boost market sentiment. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The larger concern here given recent market reaction to policy moves by central bankers is that<strong> </strong>policymakers are losing the confidence of investors.</p> <p>Investors are slowly realising that with every spin of the central bank policy chamber the magazine is getting emptier, and in the absence of any will or ability of politicians to step up, central bank policy will continue to move into the realms of the more experimental with every passing day. </p> </blockquote> <p>Of course, the UK is not alone in reporting service sector data.

                "bodyText":"The FTSE 100 index has closed 11 points lower at 6634.40, a 0.17% fall. Banking shares had a better day, recouping some of the losses suffered over the past two days. HSBC closed nearly 5% higher at 504.4p, the biggest gainer, followed by Standard Chartered, up 4.2% at 614.3p. Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays were also among the top risers, gaining 2.6% and 1.6% respectively. The Dax in Frankfurt rose 0.26% to 10,170.21 while the CAC in Paris slipped 0.16% to 4321.08.

In the US, the Dow Jones is trading 0.13% higher at 18,338.15 while the wider S&amp;P 500 is up just 0.09% at 2159 and the Nasdaw is also flat at 4718.85. Thank you for all your great comments. We will be back tomorrow. Good-bye! It\u2019s been another day in the red for European markets, despite all the hype surrounding \u2018Super Thursday\u2019 when the Bank of England is widely expected to cut interest rates for the first time since early 2009, taking borrowing costs to a new record low. Josh Mahony, market analyst at online trading firm IG, said: Much of the market reaction following June\u2019s referendum result have been somewhat surprising, with record highs in the US, the FTSE 250 reaching pre-referendum levels and now a sharp downturn in European stocks in the same week that both the RBA and BoE are likely to have ease monetary policy. The threat is that any rate cut is already priced in to markets and as such Carney &amp; co will have to do more than simply a 25 basis points cut to get any positive response from markets tomorrow. Today\u2019s survey data has confirmed the likelihood of a recession in the UK, with a sharp deterioration in the dominant services sector pointing towards a significant slowdown in hiring, business investment and ultimately economic growth. The manufacturing and construction industries have also weakened, according to equivalent surveys out earlier this week. The data from the US was more mixed today, with improvements in the jobs market on the one hand and weakening growth in the services sector on the other. Friday\u2019s non-farm payrolls numbers should shed more light on the state of the US economy. Credit ratings agency Moody\u2019s has warned that Brexit will have a negative effect on the UK\u2019s commercial property market, forecasting price falls of up to 10%. However, any price falls would be smaller than those seen during the global financial crisis. Moody\u2019s said: If London were to lose its \u201csafe haven\u201d status with foreign investors, it is likely that transaction volumes as well as property values would fall. Over the last two years, foreign direct investment has accounted for over two-thirds of all commercial real estate transactions in central London, with the remainder outside the city [according to CBRE data]. The office market in central London would be worst hit because that\u2019s where most financial and professional service firms are located. Demand for property would fall as firms would move some operations elsewhere in the EU, Moody\u2019s predicted. Developers Hammerson and Land Securities, which are major players in UK commercial property, are particularly at risk. Some of Britain\u2019s biggest food producers have issued a serious warning about home-grown fruit and veg following the Brexit vote. Damian Carrington reports: British fruit and vegetables would all but vanish from shops if Brexit means the foreign workers who pick virtually all the home-grown produce are no longer able to come to the UK, according to some of the country\u2019s biggest producers. They warn that the nation\u2019s food security would be damaged and that produce in UK shops would become more expensive if the freedom of movement for EU workers came to an end. They are urging ministers to set up a new permit scheme for seasonal workers. Without a scheme, they say production would move abroad, where many already have large operations, or would switch to cereals which are harvested by machines. The Brexit vote is already deterring foreign workers from coming to the UK, the producers report. About 90% of British fruit, vegetables and salads are picked, graded and packed by 60,000 to 70,000 workers from overseas, mostly from eastern Europe. Many of these work in areas which voted very strongly to leave the EU: the largely agricultural borough of Boston in Lincolnshire had the highest vote for leaving the EU in the whole country, at 75%. It\u2019s a pretty dull afternoon on the markets, ahead of the Bank of England\u2019s \u2018Super Thursday\u2019. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, has sent us his thoughts. Struggling for any direction that isn\u2019t its current glacial decline the Dow Jones was left wanting, the latest data-dump a decidedly mixed bag. The ADP non-farm employment change reading was better than expected at 179k against the 171k forecast; this number tends to have a rather tenuous link to the government-released non-farm figure, however, leaving it with a limited amount of market relevance. More important was the Markit and ISM services PMIs, yet even these left investors scratching their heads; the former jumped to a better than forecast 51.4, while the latter was far lower than expected, sliding to 55.5 from 56.5 last month. Unsurprisingly the Dow Jones couldn\u2019t find much clarity in these figures, rising a meagre 0.1% after the bell. Tomorrow, then, is the week\u2019s biggie: the first Bank of England \u2018Super Thursday\u2019 with a chance of actually living up to its normally sarcastic moniker. Following the string of ominous UK PMIs between Monday and Wednesday Mark Carney and co. are almost guaranteed to do something on Thursday \u2013 the big question is what? Consensus seems to suggest at the very least a rate cut to 0.25%, with some analysts suggesting it could go as low as 0.1%. The main uncertainty is over quantitative easing. A \u00a375bn extension to the pre-existing programme has been floated in certain quarters, though this is expected to be a more hotly debated issue in the MPC than the headline interest rate. Traditional logic would dictate that a rate cut alone should cause the FTSE to rise and the pound to fall; however, there is such an air of expectation around Thursday\u2019s meeting that a lack of QE (or something similar) may lead to disappointment for the former and relief for the latter. Sterling is steadying ahead of tomorrow\u2019s Bank of England decision, trading just off a three-week high against the dollar. Money markets are pricing in a quarter-point interest rate cut. Many economists are also expecting the central bank to announce other measures to stimulate the economy, for example through its quantitative easing (bond-buying) programme. The pound is holding above $1.33, down 0.25% against the dollar. Knight Frank\u2019s report also showed that rental transactions for upmarket homes in central London are up since the Brexit vote on 23 June, while rental prices have declined. The lettings market is actually stronger than last summer, thanks to the more \u201crealistic pricing\u201d. More sellers have become landlords due to uncertainty around price growth, the estate agent added. Tim Hyatt, head of lettings at Knight Frank, said: The current lettings market in prime central London is encouragingly stable. We saw a spike in new instructions in the aftermath of the referendum vote, although the number of new applicants registering is slightly down creating an imbalance of supply and demand. From a transaction perspective, the level of new deals has remained strong. In particular, the number of corporate enquiries was encouragingly positive as it was dramatically up on last year, highlighting that confidence in London as a capital city of choice remains strong. Due to the imbalance of supply and demand, landlords need to be realistic when it comes to pricing in an increasingly competitive market. This includes considering price reductions, however significant, in order to reflect value in the current climate. In central London, prices for luxury homes have fallen 1.5% in the year to July, according to upmarket estate agent Knight Frank. It says buyers are typically asking for 10% or more off the asking price. The firm said stamp duty was more of a concern than the recent Brexit vote in prime central London. Changes to the market over the last two years have meant that the Brexit vote has merely been a trigger for some to make overdue reductions to their asking price. It is too soon to say what impact Brexit will have on pricing but, in many cases, reductions reflect what would have been an appropriate price before the referendum. The number of viewings in June was 17% higher than a year earlier, and demand in areas such as Belgravia and Knightsbridge held up better than elsewhere. OIl prices have moved higher after their recent slide, with Brent crude \u2013 the global benchmark \u2013 up 1.4% at $42.38 a barrel and US West Texas Intermediate up 1.5% at $40.10. Prices were boosted after US government data showed a bigger-than-expected gasoline drawdown that offset a surprise build-up in crude stockpiles. US crude inventories rose by 1.4m barrels last week, while analysts had expected a fall of the same magnitude, the Energy Information Administration reported. At the same time, gasoline stocks slumped by 3.3m barrels, compared with forecasts of drop of 200,000 barrels. Concerns over a global oil glut persist, however. Output from the Opec cartel is near record levels. But markets prefer to look at the ISM services survey. Both surveys signal an easing in activity. A separate survey, from economic pollsters Markit, also showed that growth in the US service sector remained muted in July, with new business recording a slower increase. However, the rate of job creation picked up slightly and business confidence improved markedly after hitting a record low in June. The Markit US services index came in at 51.4 in July, unchanged from June, and above the 50 mark the divides expansion from contraction. The dollar is slipping against the yen and the euro on the data. US data just out: the closely watched ISM services/non-manufacturing index for July has come in at 55.5, slightly less than expected and down from 56.5 in June, signalling a slowdown. Employment in the services sector has weakened. US stock markets have opened and are broadly flat. The Dow Jones edged up nearly six points at the bell to 18,319.73 while the tech-heavy Nasdaq and the wider S&amp;P 500 were down slightly. Here\u2019s a quick round-up of today\u2019s corporate news: HSBC, Britain\u2019s biggest bank, has admitted a regulatory breach in the US as it unveiled a slump in first-half profits in what it termed \u201cturbulent\u201d markets, our City editor Jill Treanor reports.

He was suspended at the weekend by Publicis, Saatchi\u2019s parent company, after denying that sexism was an issue in the advertising world. The boss of London housebuilder Berkeley Group, Tony Pidgley, made \u00a321.5m last year \u2013 despite a slight pay cut from \u00a323.3m the previous year.

The energy regulator, Ofgem, has promised to introduce next spring the first price controls for some customers since the domestic power sector was privatised more than 15 years ago. Full story by our energy editor, Terry Macalister, here. The Scotch whisky industry has warned of higher tariffs following the Brexit vote in June, and urged the UK government to push for favourable trade conditions after leaving the EU. David Frost, chief executive of the Scotch Whisky Association, said: We are calling on the UK government to bring clarity to the transition to Brexit as soon as possible and to negotiate to ensure that the current open trading environment is not affected. A cut in UK interest rates on Thursday will only have a short term impact, says Christopher Metcalfe at Newton Investment Management: Tomorrow the Bank of England is expected to announce the first interest rate reduction in more than seven years from its current record low of 0.5% to 0.25%. Given current market expectations, in such an event we would only expect a modest impact to sterling, FTSE and 10-year Gilts. A 25bp cut in the base rate will provide no more than a short-term sugar rush to the UK economy and the private sector will continue to be uncooperative. Unwilling or unable to take on the quantities of new debt necessary to overcome the structural headwinds facing the global economy, the response will continue to be the monetary policy equivalent of \u2018Can\u2019t Cook, Won\u2019t Cook\u2019. Price of credit for firms is already low and it is difficult to imagine if businesses are scared or unwilling to invest in the wake of Brexit at 50bp interest rates, whether a further to 25bp will induce them to invest. Our view continues to be that the deflationary pressures exerted by the burden of surplus debt, overcapacity across many industries, and technological disruption are too big in magnitude for monetary policy to counter. Given the private sector lacks the confidence and/or ability to increase credit by the required amount, the onus falls on the public sector. Lower interest rates mean lower margins for the banking sector. It is increasingly difficult for banks to make an attractive spread on deposits without taking large credit and/or deposit risk. This is the clear message from Europe\u2019s experiment with low interest thus far and continues to support our decision to hold zero banks within our Newton UK portfolios. Record-low interest rates and bond yields may validate continuing to pay higher prices for equities and other risk assets, continuing the hunt for yield and supporting safe haven assets. The housing market, particularly in the southeast of England has benefited from the availability of cheap finance. The search for yield and the decision to lower rates may support asset prices in the near-term. The good ADP jobs figures are not necessarily a good guide to Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll numbers. David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco, said: [The ADP report] was good news as far as investors were concerned, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that we\u2019re set for a strong Non-Farm Payroll number on Friday. Analysts are generally wary of taking the ADP data as a heads-up for Non-Farm Payrolls as the latter tends to be much more volatile than the ADP release. This has certainly been the case over the last few months. But the other issue is that the next Fed meeting isn\u2019t until 20/21st September. Not only will July\u2019s employment data be old news by then, but the market already doubts that the Fed will tighten monetary policy this year, let alone ahead of November\u2019s presidential Election. Ahead of the US non-farm payroll numbers comes a report showing private sector employers created more jobs than expected in July. The ADP report showed employment increased by 179,000 jobs last month compared to forecasts of a 170,000 rise. That compares to 176,000 in June, itself revised upwards from 172,000. Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell has called for action from the government following the latest gloomy economic data: The economic outlook for the UK is uncertain, and it\u2019s time the Chancellor stepped up and told us what he is planning to do....We must rebalance our economy and support our key industries with an industrial strategy that can provide the good secure jobs that we so desperately need. Markets are currently mixed in the wake of the various PMI surveys. The FTSE 100 is now down 15 points or 0.2% while France\u2019s Cac has slipped 0.28%. But Germany\u2019s Dax has edged higher following its strong service sector performance, adding 0.1%. Meanwhile sterling is virtually flat against the dollar at $1.3355 and down 0.24% against the euro at \u20ac1.1926. Here is our report on the Markit surveys from economic editor Larry Elliott: The Bank of England has been provided with fresh evidence of the softness of the economy in the immediate post-Brexit period by a survey showing activity on course to decline by 0.4% in the third quarter of 2016. Ahead of Threadneedle Street\u2019s decision on whether to provide additional stimulus to boost growth, the Markit/CIPS snapshot of the services sector underlined the blow to output, orders and confidence delivered by the shock referendum result. The final purchasing managers index for services for July fell from 52.3 to 47.4 in June \u2013 the sharpest drop on record and in line with a flash estimate provided by Markit/CIPS just under two weeks ago. Live UK faces \u2018mild recession\u2019 as economy shrinks at fastest rate since 2009 - business live UK services sector contracts as Brexit concerns bite Read more A composite PMI \u2013 including manufacturing as well as services \u2013 showed a slightly bigger fall than first feared, declining from 52.5 to 47.5. Construction was not included in the original flash estimate of economic conditions in the aftermath of Brexit, but the all-sector PMI fell from 51.9 in June to 47.3 in July, its lowest level since the economy was in recession in April 2009. Any reading below 50 indicates that activity is contracting. The full report is here: Back with the European retail sales, and following recent weakness, they could pick up again as energy costs fall, says Peter Vanden Houte at ING Bank: Eurozone retail sales stabilized in June, though cheaper oil and stronger job creation should support consumption in the second half of the year. According to Eurostat figures released today, Eurozone retail sales stabilized in June, after a 0.4% expansion in May. This was in line with the consensus estimate. Portugal and Spain saw the highest increases (+3.1% and +1.0% MoM respectively), while Germany recorded a 0.1% fall and in France retail sales contracted 0.4% on the month. Year-on-year retail sales expanded by 1.6%. On average, retail sales grew 0.1% over the quarter after a 0.6% increase in the first quarter. The main culprit for the somewhat weaker consumption growth was most likely the 30% increase in oil prices over the quarter, sapping households\u2019 purchasing power. However, since July, energy prices have been weakening again, while July\u2019s PMIs are also showing that job creation remains strong in the Eurozone. Even though Brexit might have a minor adverse impact on consumer confidence, we believe that the underlying fundamentals remain strong enough to support consumption in the second half of the year. That said, we don\u2019t see any strengthening of the expansion in the near future with GDP growth likely to hover around 0.2% over the next few quarters, resulting in a 1.5% expansion for the whole of the year. More from Markit on the UK economy as evidenced from its latest surveys: Retail sales in the eurozone were stable in June, ahead of the UK\u2019s referendum, compared with the previous month. In the wider European Union they declined by 0.2%. In May there was an increase in both areas of 0.4%. Meanwhile the year on year figure rose by 1.6% in the euro area and by 2.4% in the wider EU. Even without a recession, the UK faces a period of lacklustre growth, says Dean Turner, economist at UBS Wealth Management: Off the back of equally disappointing manufacturing figures, today\u2019s numbers confirm that the UK economy is slowing. Although not currently our base case, if current levels for the PMIs are sustained, we may need to brace ourselves for a mild recession by the end of the year. Today\u2019s confirmation of the downturn in the Services PMI should not be underestimated, with significant near-term implications for UK businesses. But until the fog of Brexit begins to clear, it is frankly too early to tell whether the latest string of disappointing data is a real cause for concern. Time will tell if a recession is on the cards but it is clear we now face a period of lacklustre growth, a sharp contrast to the above trend growth we\u2019ve enjoyed for the last three years. These figures support speculation that we will see an interest rate cut tomorrow. We expect the Bank of England to cut rates by at least 25 basis points, reopen QE, and potentially discuss other easing measures. But: The Bank of England is now likely to cut interest rates following this latest survey evidence, agrees David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco: This was the last piece of major UK data ahead on tomorrow\u2019s Bank of England rate decision. It provides more evidence (if any were needed) that the Bank will want to ease monetary policy further with the consensus view that it will cut its headline Bank Rate by 25 basis points. There\u2019s also an expectation that the Bank will restart its asset purchases. However, there are a range of views here with estimates for additional stimulus ranging from \u00a350 \u2013 175 billion. The chances of the UK sliding into recession have increased, says Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, and an interest rate cut on Thursday now seems \u201ca foregone conclusion.\u201d He says: The marked service sector downturn follows news from sister PMI surveys showing construction activity suffering its steepest decline since mid- 2009 and manufacturing output contracting at the fastest rate since late-2012. At these levels, the PMI data are collectively signalling a 0.4% quarterly rate of decline of GDP. It\u2019s too early to say if the surveys will remain in such weak territory in coming months, leaving substantial uncertainty over the extent of any potential downturn. However, the unprecedented month-on-month drop in the all-sector index has undoubtedly increased the chances of the UK sliding into at least a mild recession. Services providers are certainly bracing themselves for worse to come, with a record drop in business confidence about the year ahead leaving optimism at its lowest ebb since February 2009. However, the extent of any downturn clearly depends to some degree on the policy response. The PMI is already deep into territory which would normally spur the Bank of England into taking action to stimulate the economy. A quarter-point cut in interest rates therefore seems to be a foregone conclusion at tomorrow\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee meeting, though the extent and nature of other non-standard stimulus measures remains a far greater source of uncertainty and the subject of intense speculation. The fall in the UK all sector index from 51.9 to 47.3 in July was the biggest one month drop in the 20 year history of the survey. Ahead of Thursday\u2019s Bank of England meeting, the UK economy has been confirmed as slowing at its fastest rate since the financial crisis following the Brexit vote. The final reading of the UK services PMI for July came in at 47.4, down from 52.3 in June and in line with the flash reading two weeks ago. The all-sector index of services and manufacturing (as well as construction) was lower than the initial estimate, down from 51.9 in June to 47.3 and marking the lowest level since April 2009. The flash estimate was 47.7. Away from the service sector surveys for a moment, and here\u2019s our report on the update from retailer Next: Next has warned that trading will be difficult for the rest of this year because of weak consumer demand for clothing but the retailer predicted its annual profit would be higher than expected. In a trading update, Next said full-price sales rose 0.3% in the second quarter of its financial year, an improvement on the 0.9% fall in the first quarter. Sales will fall again in the third quarter compared with what was Next\u2019s best trading period last year. If the winter is cold, fourth quarter sales could grow compared with a year earlier, when warm weather and lack of stock depressed sales, the group said. \u201cTrading remains extremely volatile and on a week-by-week basis is highly dependent on the weather. This volatility is indicative of the underlying weakness of consumer demand for clothing \u2026 We expect the consumer environment to remain tough for the rest of the year.\u201d The full story is here: Lifted by a strong performance from Germany, offsetting continuing stagnation in France and a slowdown in Italy and Spain, eurozone business activity edged higher in July. Markit\u2019s eurozone composite PMI rose from 53.1 in June to 53.2, higher than the initial reading of 52.9. The services PMI came in at 52.9 in July, up from 52.8 and better than the flash estimate of 52.7. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit said: A welcome uptick in the final PMI numbers presents a slightly better picture than the slowing signalled by the earlier flash reading, and is especially encouraging as it suggests the region saw little overall contagion from the UK\u2019s \u2018Brexit\u2019 vote. However, the survey is still indicating only a modest 0.3% quarterly rate of economic growth at the start of the third quarter. Such a meagre pace of expansion will inevitably fuel speculation about what the ECB could and should do to boost growth, and when. The upturn is being led by surging growth in Germany, where a 0.5% pace of expansion is being signalled. However, France continued to stagnate, acting as a significant drag on the region. Growth has also slowed in Spain and Italy, in both cases indicating that political uncertainty is hurting businesses. While the pace of expansion in Spain has merely slowed to around 0.6% in July, Italy is growing at a sluggish 0.2% pace. Greater comfort can be gained from the upturn in employment growth to a pace which has not been exceeded since February 2008. The improved hiring trend suggests firms have gained sufficient confidence in the durability and sustainability of the upturn to expand capacity in increasing numbers. However, if growth in Spain and Italy continues to weaken, this impressive hiring trend will inevitably come under pressure. Germany\u2019s business activity grew at its highest pace this year, boosted by strong growth in the services sector, but there were some concerns about the impact of the UK\u2019s vote to leave the European Union. Markit\u2019s composote purchasing managers\u2019 index - which includes both services and manufacturing - rose to 55.3 in July from 54.4 the previous month, unchanged from the initial estimate. The service sector PMI increased from 53.7 in June to a two month high of 54.4. Markit economist Oliver Kolodseike said: Germany\u2019s service sector continued to grow at the start of the third quarter, with the underlying trend pace broadly in line with that seen over the past three years. But he said positive sentiment fell to an eight month low as companies expressed concern about the Brexit vote. France\u2019s service sector returned to growth in July, with a better than expected performance. The Markit services PMI came in at 50.5 from 49.9 in June and better than the intial reading of 50.3 for the month. Anything above 50 signals expansion.historically muted level. Manufacturing continued to be weak, but with the strength in services, the composite index of both sectors rose from 49.6 in June to 50.1, marginally better than the initial reading of 50.0. Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Markit, said: The service sector returned to growth at the start of the third quarter, compensating for ongoing manufacturing weakness and leaving overall private sector activity broadly flat on the month. There were slight increases in new business and employment evident in the latest survey data, but overall little sign of any change to the subdued pattern seen throughout the year to date. Indeed companies\u2019 business expectations remain at a But the composite figure for Italy, comprising both services and manufacturing, has slipped back in July and suggests weak third quarter GDP growth: And they are coming thick and fast now. Italy\u2019s service sector has grown more strongly than expected in July: Spain\u2019s service sector growth has come in below expectations, falling to its lowest level since February. Which has helped pull down the composite index of both services and manufacturing: Not everyone believes the Bank of England should cut interest rates on Thursday, despite its hints last month that a move in August was on the cards unless the UK economy improved. If central banks are running out of ammunition, the argument goes, then perhaps Bank governor Mark Carney and the rest of the monetary policy committee should wait for more evidence of the fallout from Brexit before using up what they have left in the locker. And if the government decides to unveil fiscal measures to help boost the economy, that will not happen until September. So perhaps the Bank should wait until then to see what new chancellor Philip Hammond has up his sleeve. China\u2019s service sector slowed in July but a rebound in manufacturing has pushed the composite index - which covers both sectors - to its highest since September 2014. The Caixin services index fell from an 11-month high of 52.7 in June to 51.7, but the composite index for July was 51.9, up 1.6 points from June\u2019s reading. Caixin said: The renewed upswing in overall growth momentum was partly driven by the first increase in manufacturing output for four months, while services activity continued to expand in July. That said, the rate of services activity growth slowed since June and was moderate overall. [For services] all of the index categories showed signs of deterioration, with employment falling back into the territory of contraction after three consecutive months of growth. Implementation of supportive measures including proactive fiscal policies must continue to protect the recovery, and regulations in the services sector should be further relaxed. It\u2019s an uncertain start but a marginally positive one for Europe\u2019s stock markets. The FTSE 100 is up 24 points or 0.38%, helped by a 4% rise in Next following its latest trading statement and a more than 3% jump in HSBC shares after its results. Elsewhere Germany\u2019s Dax opened up 0.1%, France\u2019s Cac 0.4% higher and Spain\u2019s Ibex 0.5% ahead. Ahead of the UK service sector figures: HSBC could provide a little light in the gloom of the banking sector following its results. Yes, first half profits fell by 29% but news of a \u00a31.8bn buyback is expected to give some support to its shares. In Hong Kong its shares erased early losses to climb 0.2%, which traders hope will be followed through in London. The banking sector has been under pressure in recent days, following the results of the European stress tests on Friday and continuing concerns about the effect of low - and in some cases negative - interest rates on their balance sheets. Not to mention non-performing loans of course, with Italian banks a particular problem. Even the stress test results themselves have left analysts unconvinced of their merits. CMC\u2019s Michael Hewson again: If last week\u2019s European bank stress tests were designed to bolster confidence in the European banking sector it is becoming quite clear that they have failed abysmally. Far from boosting confidence they appear to have helped undermine it by focussing attention on what wasn\u2019t tested, as opposed to what was. The omission of Portuguese and Greek bank from the tests as well as the failure to test resilience against a prolonged period of negative rates has left investors to draw their own conclusions, and Commerzbank\u2019s decision yesterday to scrap its profit target for the year in the wake of 32% drop in quarterly profits, merely served to reinforce those fears sending its share price to new record lows, along with its sector peer Deutsche Bank, who suffered the ignominy of being relegated out of the EurStoxx50 in a clear sign of how far the shares have fallen. Italian banking shares also resumed their downward track despite Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi\u2019s attempts to calm nerves by claiming that Italian banks were fine by claiming that growth would be the best way to resolve the non-peforming loan problem. Unfortunately for Mr Renzi the Italian economy hasn\u2019t grown in any significant way since it joined the euro which suggests that for all his warm words the reality has been somewhat different, and isn\u2019t likely to change any time soon, and that is likely to be his biggest challenge. Monte dei Paschi led the declines crashing to new record lows and weighing down the rest of the sector as doubts grew about the prospect of the ability of the Italian banking sector to absorb further write downs across the rest of the sector. Asian markets have fallen back, with concerns about a global slowdown, the weak oil price and the banking sector, not to mention disappointment with recent action from central banks. The Nikkei 225 is down 1.88% while the Hang Seng is 2.64% lower. So we can look forward to a mixed opening in Europe: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After Monday\u2019s global manufacturing figures for July - a mixed picture on the whole - come the service sector numbers. In particular focus will be the UK number, as it comes just a day ahead of the Bank of England\u2019s latest interest rate decision. As with manufacturing, a snapshot two weeks ago showed a sharp downturn in the wake of Brexit, with the index down from 52.3 in June to 47.4 in July, an 88 month low. There is an outside chance this will be revised upwards but analysts are not holding their breath. Even if the figure is better than the initial estimate, most economists are betting the economy is weak enough to justify the Bank cutting rates on Thursday, with perhaps an extra package of stimulus to give another boost to business. But some believe central bankers are running out of ammunition. A rate cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia and a Japanese stimulus package, both on Tuesday, did little to boost market sentiment. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The larger concern here given recent market reaction to policy moves by central bankers is that policymakers are losing the confidence of investors. Investors are slowly realising that with every spin of the central bank policy chamber the magazine is getting emptier, and in the absence of any will or ability of politicians to step up, central bank policy will continue to move into the realms of the more experimental with every passing day. Of course, the UK is not alone in reporting service sector data. Here\u2019s the European agenda: And around 3pm BST come the US figures.",

But some analysts see plenty of reasons for the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to hold off until after November\u2019s presidential election.</p> <p>Ken Odeluga, analyst at City Index says all eyes will now be on a speech from Fed chair Janet Yellen later this month:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cHeadline U.S. payrolls which beat expectations by about 40%, and jobs market growth that\u2019s showing signs of bursting at the seams, obviously swing the onus back on to Janet Yellen\u2019s Federal Reserve... Federal funds futures had all but priced out another rate hike this year before Friday, but chances are rising that the latest data will encourage Yellen to signal a rate rise as early as September.</p> <p>\u201cWith no Fed meeting this month, the Fed chair\u2019s speech at this year\u2019s Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium, between 25<sup>th</sup>-27<sup>th</sup> August, will be scrutinised closely.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>But markets should interpret anything she says with care. Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, highlights the market\u2019s uneasy relationship with the Fed after previous unrealised hints of action:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cFOMC watchers could be forgiven for thinking the committee has taken a \u201chead in the sand\u201d approach to the US labour market. After saying for years that rates would rise if the labour market continued to improve, the FOMC appears to be holding fire on rate hikes, and as a result markets are very sceptical about the prospects of even today\u2019s strong figures leading to further tightening in the near future. However, complacency can lead to volatility and if the FOMC does finally act in September, the resulting correction in fixed income, commodities and currencies could make for an interesting autumn.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>David Page, senior economist at AXA Investment Managers expects a Fed move in December.

                "bodyText":"A busy week for economic and business news has been capped off with brighter figures from the US, where a forecast-busting 255,000 jobs were added in July. A pick-up in wage growth and jobs gains for June that were stronger previously thought helped raise hopes that the world\u2019s biggest economy is strengthening, putting the prospect of a September interest rate rise from the US Federal Reserve back on the table. Before we go, here\u2019s a summary of today\u2019s main news: The US economy added 255,000 jobs in July, beating economists\u2019 expectations for growth of 180,000 Wall Street has opened higher after those jobs numbers. The Nasdaq is up 1%, the Dow Jones industrial average is up 0.8% and the S&amp;P 500 is up 0.7% The optimism has spread to Europe, where the FTSE 100 is up 0.7%, having briefly broken through the 6,800 mark and set a new high for this year. The FTSE 250 index of midcaps is similarly at new highs for 2016, up 1.3% to 17,462 France\u2019s CAC40 share index is up 1.4%, Germany\u2019s Dax is up 1.1% The Bank of England\u2019s deputy governor Ben Broadbent has defended a rate cut to 0.25% and other measures unveiled on Thursday to ward off a post referendum recession Commercial banks, told by the Bank of England governor Mark Carney they have no excuse not to pass on the base rate cut, appear to be acceding to his call. However, Lloyds, the country\u2019s biggest mortgage lender, is still considering how to proceed Royal Bank of Scotland, the 73%-taxpayer-owned bank, has slumped to a \u00a32bn half-year loss The chief executive of Nissan has warned that future investment decisions about the company\u2019s car plant in the north-east of England will depend on the outcome of Brexit negotiations. With that, we are closing the live blog for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. We\u2019ll be back on Monday with more rolling coverage of business and economics news. The will-they-won\u2019t-they debate over a September interest rate hike from the US Federal Reserve has hotted up in the wake of these stronger than expected payrolls numbers. In stark contrast to the UK, where rates were cut to a new record low on Thursday and more cuts are expected, the US central bank could be raising as soon as next month. But some analysts see plenty of reasons for the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to hold off until after November\u2019s presidential election. Ken Odeluga, analyst at City Index says all eyes will now be on a speech from Fed chair Janet Yellen later this month: \u201cHeadline U.S. payrolls which beat expectations by about 40%, and jobs market growth that\u2019s showing signs of bursting at the seams, obviously swing the onus back on to Janet Yellen\u2019s Federal Reserve... Federal funds futures had all but priced out another rate hike this year before Friday, but chances are rising that the latest data will encourage Yellen to signal a rate rise as early as September. \u201cWith no Fed meeting this month, the Fed chair\u2019s speech at this year\u2019s Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium, between 25th-27th August, will be scrutinised closely.\u201d But markets should interpret anything she says with care. Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, highlights the market\u2019s uneasy relationship with the Fed after previous unrealised hints of action: \u201cFOMC watchers could be forgiven for thinking the committee has taken a \u201chead in the sand\u201d approach to the US labour market. After saying for years that rates would rise if the labour market continued to improve, the FOMC appears to be holding fire on rate hikes, and as a result markets are very sceptical about the prospects of even today\u2019s strong figures leading to further tightening in the near future. However, complacency can lead to volatility and if the FOMC does finally act in September, the resulting correction in fixed income, commodities and currencies could make for an interesting autumn.\u201d David Page, senior economist at AXA Investment Managers expects a Fed move in December. He comments: \u201cAnother solid payrolls continues to suggest a firmer underlying GDP expansion than recorded in Q2 GDP. This is consistent with the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s latest guidance that \u201cnear-term risks \u2026 diminished\u201d. We expect Q3 GDP to record a solid rebound to Q2\u2019s inventory-correction impacted growth. We think this will increase the Fed\u2019s confidence to tighten policy. We consider this unlikely before November\u2019s elections (although we expect the probability of a September hike to grow in market\u2019s minds). We forecast a 0.25% December hike.\u201d One part of the US jobs report that confounded expectations to the downside was the unemployment rate. That held steady in July at 4.9%, missing expectations among economists for it to drop to 4.8%. The unchanged unemployment rate, despite a pick up in new jobs, is explained by a rise in the number of people entering the labour market looking for work. Here are those US jobs numbers in context: Wall Street has opened higher, as expected, after those stronger-than-expected US jobs numbers. Following government data showing 255,000 jobs were added in July, the market feels the outlook for the US economy has brightened and stocks and the dollar are higher. The Dow Jones industrial average is up 0.8%, the S&amp;P 500 is up 0.3% and the Nasdaq is up around 0.5%. In the UK, the effects of a weak pound against the dollar continue to be felt on the FTSE 100. The index, where a significant number of component companies earn revenues in dollars, has hit its highest level since July 2015. Adding to gains made on the back of Thursday\u2019s UK interest rate cut, the bluechip index now stands at 6,799.9. That\u2019s up around 60 points, or 0.9%, on the day. Economists at S&amp;P Global Ratings highlight the rise in the average work week in the US, the pick-up in average hourly earnings and the cumulative solid growth in new jobs in June and July. It\u2019s a welcome boost after a \u201cmixed bag\u201d of corporate earnings these past several days, they say. But they do not see the US central bank acting before November\u2019s presidential election. Beth Ann Bovino and Satyam Panday continue: \u201cA steady pace of hiring, healthier consumer appetites and a bounce in producer sentiment paint a brighter US economic outlook amidst ongoing global woes. A solid August jobs report should allow Federal Reserve officials to breathe a little easier when they meet in September and keep them on track for an interest rate hike likely after the US elections in December.\u201d Wall Street futures are pointing to a strong open for US stocks after those much stronger-than-expected non-farm payrolls numbers. The signs of strength in the US economy and prospect of a rate rise there as soon as next month have also boosted the dollar. That means the pound is down sharply against the US currency. The pound had already weakened markedly on Thursday on the Bank of England\u2019s interest cut and other stimulus measures. It recovered some ground on Friday morning only to now fall back. The pound is currently down 0.5% on the day against the dollar at $1.3045. It stood at $1.3160 before the payrolls data. David Cheetham, analyst at the currency brokerage XTB.com comments: \u201cThe immediate reaction in the markets has seen the GBP-USD drop sharply below yesterday\u2019s low, gold and yields on US government debt both decline whilst US stock futures rallied. Taken together with yesterday\u2019s strong stimulus measure from the BoE the macroeconomic backdrop is now far more rosy than it was immediately post-Brexit and fresh yearly highs for the S&amp;P500 and FTSE could be just around the corner.\u201d Here is the key data on US wages in July. The Bureau of Labor Statistics says: In July, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased by 8 cents to $25.69. Over the year, average hourly earnings have risen by 2.6%. That and the jobs growth has led some to pencil in a rate rise in the US in September. But James Knightley, economist at ING, says there are still plenty of reasons why Janet Yellen and her Fed colleagues will hold off for a while. He highlights political uncertainty, mixed data and external risks: \u201cThe outcome of today\u2019s report is supportive of the view that we could see a rate hike before year-end - we have had a couple of Fed officials this week suggest that this is possible. It also backs up the assessment within the latest FOMC statement that \u201cnear-term risks to the economic outlook have diminished\u201d. Nonetheless, we have our doubts it will happen given the mixed nature of the US data flow and political uncertainty relating to the election, while external risks remain a possible constraint. \u201cAdditionally, with the RBA in Australia and the Bank of England providing more monetary stimulus and Japan boosting its fiscal stimulus we think a majority of Fed officials will be nervous about raising rates given the significant boost it could give the dollar. Instead, we think they will continue to tread cautiously with one rate hike in the first quarter of 2017 and a further one in the second half of next year.\u201d Those payroll numbers were much better than forecast in the market and accompanying news of a pick up in wages will bolster expectations of an interest rate rise from the US Federal Reserve in the months ahead. Reactions so far to the news that the US economy added 255,000 jobs in July and more jobs than previously thought in June: My colleague Jana Kasperkevic in New York reports that the positive figures come after the labour market stumbled in May, adding only 11,000 jobs. Hiring rebounded in June with a net gain of 287,000, but recent economic figures and a faltering European economy had suggested another slowdown. Here is her full news story: In a big upside surprise, the US economy has added 255,000 new jobs in July, according to government data. The forecast was for a July gain of 180,000 jobs. The June rise in jobs was also revised higher today, now seen at 292,000 additional jobs compared with the previous estimate of 287,000. The US unemployment rate was 4.9% in July. With just a few minutes to go to this month\u2019s jobs report from the US, here\u2019s a quick reminder of what markets expect. The government\u2019s US non-farm payrolls figures for July are expected to show a gain of around 180,000, down from June\u2019s bumper 287,000, but above the three-month average of 148,000. The jobless rate is forecast to fall to 4.8%. That\u2019s according to a Reuters poll of economists. And here\u2019s what Twitter thinks: Ben Broadbent, who this morning defended the Bank\u2019s four-pronged stimulus package, told Reuters that as well as cutting rates further the Bank still has more measures up its sleeve to support the economy. He also discussed the Bank\u2019s new Term Funding Scheme (TFS), which will provide loans to commercial banks at low rates to ensure they pass on this week\u2019s base rate cut. The deputy governor rebuffed any suggestion the Bank of England would use the scheme as a a back-door way to introduce negative interest rates - something governor Mark Carney has opposed. Broadbent told Reuters: \u201cThere are limits for us too. We would not want to offer that finance at hugely negative interest rates, because we would be making losses ourselves.\u201d He also echoed Carney and others in noting that monetary policy could not completely offset the likely blow from the decision to leave the EU. \u201cThere are limits to what monetary policy - indeed any demand management policy - conventional fiscal policy as well, to offset what is a structural effect on the economy,\u201d he said. The full report from Reuters is here. And if you want to know more about the ins and outs of the Bank\u2019s new stimulus package, it\u2019s broken out the key points here: The Bank of England\u2019s deputy governor Ben Broadbent has been back out talking to the press after yesterday\u2019s kitchen sink package to avert a post-referendum recession. In an interview with Reuters, Broadbent says he is likely to vote for another rate cut unless economic growth beats expectations. That echoes the tone of yesterday\u2019s minutes from the latest Monetary Policy Meeting, where Broadbent and colleagues voted for a rate cut to 0.25%. The minutes said if economic news proved consistent with the Bank\u2019s latest forecasts then \u201ca majority of members\u201d expected to support a further interest rate cut, potentially taking official borrowing costs as low as 0.1%. Ahead of the US non-farm payrolls data, out at 1.30pm BST, which are expected to show an above-average increase in employment of about 180,000, here\u2019s a quick summary of today\u2019s main developments. Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent has rejected suggestions that the central bank\u2019s bigger-than-expected stimulus package sent out a message of panic. He was \u201cpretty confident\u201d that it would work and provide some support to the economy soon. More here. Meanwhile, his boss, Mark Carney, insisted that the UK would avoid a repeat of the financial crisis. A new survey has shown a sharp deterioration in the UK job market. Carney warned yesterday that another quarter of a million people would lose their jobs in coming quarters following the Brexit vote. Stock markets have risen following the Bank of England\u2019s Super Thursday and solid corporate earnings updates in Europe. The FTSE 100 index in London is up 0.3% at 6762.70, a gain of more than 20 points. The pound has recovered some ground after yesterday\u2019s fall. It is trading 0.4% higher against the dollar at $1.3154. There is further evidence that the luxury property market in London is slowing. The UK capital and New York have fallen behind Rome and Madrid, according to Knight Frank\u2019s latest prime global cities index for the second quarter. Prime house prices fell 0.6% in London in the year to June, and by 0.5% in New York, the upmarket estate agent\u2019s survey showed. Vancouver came top of the list, with 36.4% growth, followed by Shanghai at 22.5%, Cape Town at 16.1% and Toronto at 12.6%. The top ten did not feature a single European city, with Dublin the highest-placed, in 13th place, with 4.9% house price growth. Here\u2019s confirmation from HSBC. An HSBC spokesperson said: Following the Base Rate announcement yesterday we have passed on the full reduction to customers with tracker mortgages today. We will also be passing on the reduction to mortgage customers on our Standard Variable Rate, which is already one of the lowest in the market and will reduce from 3.94% to 3.69% with effect from 1st September. Reuters flash: HSBC says it will pass the Bank of England\u2019s rate cut on to all mortgage customers on standard variable rates from 1 September. Meanwhile, Japanese carmaker Nissan has cast doubt on its long-term investment plans in Britain, following the referendum. The boss of Nissan, Carlos Ghosn, said future decisions about its Sunderland factory, which employs 6,700 people, would depend on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations. He said \u201cmost companies\u201d would be waiting for further news on Britain\u2019s trading status before making decisions about investments. He was \u201creasonably optimistic\u201d that common sense would prevail from both sides and that the UK would continue to be a key partner of the EU. He told the BBC: Well I don\u2019t think today you can talk about any impact before we see what is the new status of the UK. The question of Sunderland - Sunderland is a plant which is a European plant based in the UK. Most of the production out of Sunderland is exported to Europe. So obviously for us the relationship which is going to prevail between the UK and Europe is very important. So the future investment decisions are going to depend a lot into ... Okay, the UK is out of Europe. Fine. But what\u2019s going to be the new status? So you\u2019re going to see a period where most companies are going to be waiting to see what\u2019s going to be the new status. A new UK jobs survey showed this morning that the labour market entered \u201cfreefall\u201d after the Brexit vote. The Recruitment and Employment Confederation said the number of permanent jobs placed by recruitment firms last month fell at the fastest pace since May 2009. Rupert Harrison, chief macro strategist for multi-asset at fund management giant BlackRock, who was chief of staff to ex-chancellor George Osborne, tweeted: Bank of England governor Mark Carney has sought to reassure people that Britain won\u2019t see a repeat of the financial crisis, after the central bank unveiled a big stimulus package yesterday. He told LBC radio: People should not worry about the supply of credit, this isn\u2019t after the global financial crisis, this isn\u2019t during the euro crisis \u2013 this is a modern financial sector that is working. We\u2019re not going through the same experience that the economy went through in 2008/9/10/11/12 when it was tough. Turning our attention to the key US jobs figures out at 1:30pm BST, economists polled by Reuters are forecasting a chunky 180,000 gain in employment. In June, the number of jobs created went up by a massive 287,000. Markets will be scrutinising the data for further cues on potential Federal Reserve rate hikes. The pound has clawed back some ground after the Bank of England\u2019s new stimulus package triggered its biggest daily losses in a month. Sterling gained 0.25% against the dollar to $1.3137. Against the euro, it is now flat at 84.85p, after gaining 0.2% earlier. The Office for National Statistics has put out figures for profitability at UK companies in the first quarter. The profitability of private non-financial firms, as measured by their net rate of return, improved to 12.2% between January and March, up 0.2% from the fourth quarter of last year. At manufacturers, the net rate of return rose to 12.7% from 10.3%, while service companies recorded a rate of 18.2%, a tad lower than the 18.3% in the fourth quarter. The rate of return is calculated by expressing the economic gain, or profit, as a percentage of the capital used to produce it, the ONS explains helpfully. The Bank of England\u2019s actions lifted the FTSE 100 index to a one-year high this morning. The bluechip index rose 1.6% yesterday and a further 0.5% earlier this morning to its highest level since July 2015. It has fallen back a bit, and is now trading 0.2% higher at 6755.83. A market gauge of UK firms\u2019 borrowing costs has hit a record low after the Bank of England\u2019s stimulus package, which includes a new corporate bond-buying scheme. The yield on data provider Markit\u2019s sterling-denominated corporate IBOXX index, which comprises 680 investment-grade bonds, closed at a record low of 2.53% yesterday, compared with 2.76% the day before, Reuters reported this morning. The premium companies would pay over British government borrowing costs dropped to 154 basis points from 162 bps, the lowest level seen so far this year.

Many analysts say the pound has further to fall. Julius Baer economist David A. Meier said: The decisive BoE response to the Brexit fallout allows for inflation overshoots ahead. While foreign exchange markets reacted rather unimpressed, today\u2019s measures and the potential for additions down the road will push the GBP lower gradually. We see further support for our below-consensus 12-month EUR/GBP outlook at 0.95. John Wraith, head of UK rates strategy at UBS, said: The trends of weaker sterling and outperforming gilts have reasserted themselves and are expected to continue to dominate. In equities, despite the deceleration in UK growth we do not see a significant drag to the FTSE-100 given 75% of revenues come from outside the UK. In foreign exchange, we feel comfortable with year-end targets of 0.90 for EUR/GBP and 1.29 for GBP/USD. The path for sterling is also dependent on political considerations, including the timing of the triggering of Article 50, and the evolution of economic data, but the balance of risks is for further weakness. The Bank predicted that house prices would fall over the next year, ending years of strong growth. Prices fell in July, according to the latest Halifax figures, out this morning. The average value of a home fell 1% to \u00a3214,678 last month. The drop was the third this year and mostly offset June\u2019s 1.2% increase. However figures for a single month can be erratic but the quarterly trend shows growth has slowed from earlier in the year. Royal Bank of Scotland is yet to decide whether to pass on the Bank of England\u2019s base rate cut to its borrowers, risking a row with its governor, Mark Carney, writes Jill Treanor, the Guardian\u2019s City editor. As the 73%-taxpayer owned bank slumped to a \u00a32bn half-year loss, the bank admitted it was still reviewing the implications of the historic rate cut to 0.25% which is expected to impede its ability to generate profits as quickly as hoped. Read the full story here. Lloyds Banking Group has not announced a decision yet either, as we reported last night. Other lenders quickly took action after the Bank of England\u2019s cut yesterday, however. Spanish-owned Santander and Nationwide Building Society said they would pass on the reduction in full on the standard variable rates from September. More from Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent, who was quizzed on Radio 4. Confronted with criticism from the Brexiteers that the central bank had acted too soon and risked talking down the economy, he strongly defended the stimulus package. We felt we had ample evidence to act. The referendum no doubt marked a profound change for the UK economy. Responding to other criticism that the Bank\u2019s measures would not work, Broadbent described it as a \u201csubstantial, coherent\u201d package that \u201cwill provide support for the economy\u201d. I\u2019m pretty confident it will have some effect. Pressed whether it would have a real impact soon, the Bank\u2019s deputy governor replied: We\u2019ve already seen many mortgage rates fall. Broadbent also confirmed that there was a real prospect of another interest rate cut before the end of the year. He rejected the suggestion that the Bank\u2019s real intention was to devalue the pound. Compared to sterling\u2019s tumble since the June referendum, yesterday\u2019s move was \u201crelatively small,\u201d Broadbent noted. The pound did fall very sharply immediately after the referendum and has since been relatively stable. Certainly compared with that immediate move, the move yesterday on the announcement of these measures was relatively small. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s the day after the Bank of England unveiled its bigger-than-expected package of measures designed to prevent a post-Brexit recession. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent has just been on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme defending the package. Pressed whether the measures didn\u2019t send out a message of panic, he rejected that suggestion, and said there was no evidence to suggest that \u201ceasing monetary policy made things worse\u201d. I can\u2019t think of one instance where monetary easing was bad for confidence. The surprise package sent the pound down yesterday (it slumped 2 cents against the dollar) and shares soaring. Most Asian stock markets rose, with the Hang Seng in Hong Kong up 1.3%. European stock markets have opened higher today, with London\u2019s FTSE 100 index up 0.6%, to 6782.10 in early trading. France\u2019s CAC is trading 0.7% higher, Spain\u2019s Ibex is 0.9% ahead and Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 1.4%, while Germany\u2019s Dax is 0.3% higher. On \u2018Super Thursday,\u2019 the Bank cut interest rates to a new record low of 0.25% from 0.5% and hinted they could fall further although governor Mark Carney insisted that rates would not go negative. He also unveiled additional funds for banks to help them pass on the base rate cut to households and businesses, along with more government and corporate bond purchases by the Bank for cash, again to stimulate lending and drive borrowing costs lower. The Bank slashed its growth forecast for the UK for next year by an unprecedented amount. The economy is expected to come to a virtual standstill in coming months, although the Bank expects it to escape recession. It predicted job losses of 250,000 and slower wage growth, following the Brexit vote. Read our full story here. Business organisations and many City economists applauded the surprise package but some people were critical. Kate Barker, a former Bank of England rate-setter, warned ahead of yesterday\u2019s meeting, writing in the Times (\u00a3), that cutting interest rates would do more harm than good, and would fail to boost household or business spending. Tory politician John Redwood, a leading eurosceptic and Brexit campaigner, asked \u201cwhere is the evidence to justify the Bank\u2019s action?\u201d. He wrote on his blog: I read their forecast carefully. It is rightly riddled with uncertainty. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, was also critical, saying the measures gave the impression of \u201coverkill,\u201d and called on the government to do its bit. The contrast between what the MPC did yesterday and what they did in July was quite stark and the fact that the additional QE measures found dissent from three policymakers does appear to suggest some division on the MPC. If a company doesn\u2019t feel compelled to borrow money to invest when base rates are at 0.5%, why would it feel compelled to do so when base rates are at 0.25%? The problem in the UK isn\u2019t availability or cheapness of credit but demand for it, and that demand is only likely to come when the UK government reacts to the slowdown in the economy when it delivers its Autumn Statement later this year. We will be monitoring further reaction to the Bank of England measures as the day goes on. Today, the US non-farm payrolls figures for July are the main event. The latest jobs data are expected to show a gain of around 175,000, down from June\u2019s bumper 287,000, but above the three-month average of 148,000. The jobless rate is forecast to fall to 4.8%. In Germany, factory orders unexpectedly declined in June, by 0.4%. Data from the Economy Ministry in Berlin showed demand for investment goods slumped. But the Bundesbank has sought to reassure investors that Germany\u2019s economy merely paused for breath in the second quarter and that the Brexit vote hadn\u2019t changed the outlook for a pick-up in the current quarter. However, Siemens boss Joe Kaeser warned yesterday that political uncertainty in countries like the UK threatened to hold back orders and investment.",

The government will have to play its part too, the Bank\u2019s governor said.</p> <p>All eyes are now on the Philip Hammond\u2019s autumn statement due later this year. The new chancellor has already told Carney that <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/Documents/pdf/chancellorletter040816.pdf\">the government will \u201ctake any necessary steps\u201d</a> [pdf] and come up with its own measures.</p> <p>There are a number of things the government will be considering.</p> <h2>Tax cuts</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/05/brexit-austerity-george-osborne-david-blanchflower-economic-experts-leave-campaign\">There have been calls for a cut to the VAT rate from 20%</a> to fire up consumer spending, which is the main driver of the UK\u2019s economic growth. The government, however, will want to see more surveys and official data on how spending has held up since the referendum before it decides to take a hit to its already squeezed public coffers. </p> <p>The former chancellor George Osborne has said cuts to business taxes are needed in response to the Brexit vote. Before he was replaced by Hammond, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/03/george-osborne-looks-at-corporation-tax-cut-to-attract-overseas-investors\">Osborne said the government should get on with cutting corporation tax to below 15%</a> in a bid to encourage businesses to invest in Britain outside the EU. </p> <p>His successor will be wary of cutting without more evidence that companies are shunning the UK, and given that the prime minister, Theresa May, has talked about reforming capitalism so the system works \u201cfor everyone, not just the privileged few\u201d, a cut to business taxes is probably not be the message she wants her new chancellor to send.</p> <h2>More infrastructure spending</h2> <p><a href=\"http://news.cbi.org.uk/news/after-brexit-put-national-interest-ahead-of-political-interests-on-infrastructure-cbi-president/\">Businesses</a> are urging the government to spend more on infrastructure such as roads and rail links. They argue that record low interest rates make this a good time for it to borrow money to invest.

                "bodyText":"When Mark Carney unveiled a broad package of measures to ward off a post-EU referendum recession on Thursday, he emphasised that the Bank of England had only limited power to shore up the economy. The government will have to play its part too, the Bank\u2019s governor said. All eyes are now on the Philip Hammond\u2019s autumn statement due later this year. The new chancellor has already told Carney that the government will \u201ctake any necessary steps\u201d [pdf] and come up with its own measures. There are a number of things the government will be considering. Tax cuts There have been calls for a cut to the VAT rate from 20% to fire up consumer spending, which is the main driver of the UK\u2019s economic growth. The government, however, will want to see more surveys and official data on how spending has held up since the referendum before it decides to take a hit to its already squeezed public coffers. The former chancellor George Osborne has said cuts to business taxes are needed in response to the Brexit vote. Before he was replaced by Hammond, Osborne said the government should get on with cutting corporation tax to below 15% in a bid to encourage businesses to invest in Britain outside the EU. His successor will be wary of cutting without more evidence that companies are shunning the UK, and given that the prime minister, Theresa May, has talked about reforming capitalism so the system works \u201cfor everyone, not just the privileged few\u201d, a cut to business taxes is probably not be the message she wants her new chancellor to send. More infrastructure spending Businesses are urging the government to spend more on infrastructure such as roads and rail links. They argue that record low interest rates make this a good time for it to borrow money to invest. The spending would get money flowing through the economy, create jobs and the projects would yield long-term economic gains. Delaying the planned apprenticeship levy Disgruntled business lobby groups have already labelled Osborne\u2019s plans to introduce a near-\u00a33bn levy on bigger firms next April a \u201cpayroll tax\u201d. Now that the vote to leave the EU has hit business sentiment and demand, there are calls for it to be delayed. Hammond could agree to this to appease business leaders and boost confidence. Boosting productivity If the new chancellor does delay the apprenticeship levy he will have to come up with other ways to tackle Britain\u2019s skills shortages in areas such as construction and IT, and so help raise the country\u2019s productivity out of the doldrums. The government has committed to boosting apprenticeship numbers and creating 3m new apprentices by 2020. If May is serious about tackling inequality she will have to show that her government can provide routes into decent careers beyond university degrees. The UK lags behind other advanced economies on productivity, a measure of what is produced by employees per hour worked. Carney said boosting productivity was key to raising the UK\u2019s economic prospects, but experts say it could be years before the UK sees the gains of any measures to boost productivity, such as investment in innovation, education and infrastructure. Reduce planned rises to the national living wage The \u201cnational living wage\u201d of \u00a37.20 for over-25s was introduced in April, and the government has committed to increasing it each year. With economic prospects looking bleaker after the Brexit vote, however, some employers say such rises will be less affordable. They want the low pay commission, the independent body that advises the government on minimum wages, to recommend only a small rise in April 2017. Here again, May\u2019s government will be cautious about being seen to penalise the low-paid, given her pledge to raise living standards. Anti-poverty campaigners also argue that low pay is a significant part of the UK\u2019s productivity problem and that only higher pay thresholds will make firms improve management, training and overall efficiency. Helicopter money Carney has questioned the effectiveness of so-called \u201chelicopter money\u201d schemes, under which a central bank prints cash so that finance ministries can hand it out to citizens or spend it on big infrastructure projects. With the government under pressure to boost spending on infrastructure, however, and both Hammond and Carney vowing they have more tools to help the economy, some sort of unconventional scheme along these lines could still become a reality. One option would be for the Treasury to issue new infrastructure bonds for public investment projects. The Bank would then buy the bonds using newly created money, so financing the projects. Trade deals The biggest task for May\u2019s government will be negotiating new trade deals.

The period over which the data has been collected is broadly pre-Brexit but still helps to confirm the widely acknowledged view that the UK is a bigger importer of goods than it is an exporter. Indeed that the UK commands such an important share of European export, it is considered to be an excellent platform from which to negotiate a favourable separation from the European Union. Of course, the politics of extending a favourable deal to non-members does, in some way, defeat the purposes of having a club, so the outcome of such negotiations remain highly uncertain.</p> <p>\u201cAs for trade figures going forward the drop in sterling will have significantly improved the competiveness of our goods and services globally.

                "bodyText":"With the prospect of low interest rates for longer and further central bank stimulus measures, along with a little more stability in the oil market ahead of a forthcoming Opec meeting, stock markets moved higher once more. Banks were also in demand as the post-Brexit blues wore off and a UK competition inquiry was less arduous for the sector than it had feared. Even signs of a slowdown in the UK economy from the latest NIESR report did not dampen the enthusiasm. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: The FTSE-100 continues to forge its way higher as an upbeat start to the session on Wall Street gives those traders who are still at their desks something else to cheer. The fact that oil prices have staged something of a turn around is certainly helping bolster sentiment, although it\u2019s probably worth adding that if we see this rally for crude being sustained then it starts to up the chances of a September rate hike by the Fed \u2013 and that has the potential to take the shine off gains on a global basis. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 42.17 points or 0.62% at 6851.30 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 2.5% to 10,692.90, its highest level this year France\u2019s Cac closed 1.19% higher at 4468.07 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB edged up 0.31% to 16,796.14 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.2% better at 8665.4 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.36% to 562.4 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 16 points or 0.09%, well off its earlier highs. Meanwhile the pound continued to slip amid talk of further easing by the Bank of England, down 0.3% at $1.2999 and 0.4% lower at \u20ac1.1707. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Stock markets are continuing to move higher, with the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq in the US at new intra-day highs. In Europe, Germany\u2019s Dax is up 2.3% while the FTSE 100 is 46 points or 0.69% better. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: The FTSE bulls have come back out to play today, with the main benchmark pushing into yet another 13-month high. At a time when many would expect the UK to be in the midst of sombre post-referendum introspection, UK markets are instead focusing on the here and now of lower for longer rates and the expectation of years of QE. Amid a wave of tourists taking advantage of a weak sterling, a similarly seismic shift is also likely from an investment point of view, with foreign investors likely to sweep up discounted UK assets. More interest rate cuts and further stimulus measures are likely as the UK economy slows, according to former member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee David Blanchflower. Writing in the Guardian he says the Bank did the right thing by reducing rates last week, but adding that the uncertainty following the Brexit vote is likely to continue for years: The good news is you should be able to make money by buying shares and gold. The bad news is that this will widen inequality further, as it does nothing to help the poor, the young and ordinary strugglers who don\u2019t have assets. The full article is here: The Bank of England has suffered a setback in the bond markets in its first attempt to buy long-dated debt under its new QE programme. Reuters reports: The Bank of England failed to get enough offers for its planned purchase of \u00a31.17bn of government bonds with maturities longer than 15 years, sending gilt yields to new record lows across a range of maturities. The BoE said it received offers worth \u00a31.118bn, resulting in an uncovered reverse auction in its first attempt to buy long-dated debt since it restarted its quantitative easing asset purchase programme after nearly four years. The central bank said it would announce its response to the shortfall on Wednesday at 0800 GMT. Twenty-year gilt yields hit a record low of 1.212 percent and were last down 5 basis points at 1.22 percent. Thirty-year yields hit a record low of 1.374 percent, and were last down 4.9 basis points at 1.385 percent. Yields on five- and 10-year gilts also hit all-time lows. The Bank of England was not immediately available for further comment. The UK economy slowed down by more than expected in July in the wake of the Brexit vote, according to the latest monthly GDP estimates from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, and could foreshadow a recession by the end of 2017. NIESR said output grew by 0.3% in the three months ending in July, following growth of 0.6% in the three months to June and expectations of a figure of 0.4%. The thinktank said the estimates suggested that monthly output declined by 0.2% in July, although it warned that monthly data were volatile. But it added that the estimate was in line with its latest quarterly forecast, which predicted a contraction of 0.2% in the third quarter. James Warren, research fellow at NIESR said: We estimate that in the three months to July the UK economy grew by 0.3 per cent, a marked economic slowdown. The month on month profile suggests that the third quarter has got off to a weak start, with output declining in July. Our estimates suggest that there is around an evens chance of a technical recession by the end of 2017. US markets are following the trend elsewhere in early trading, heading higher as oil prices remain steady at around $45 a barrel. The Dow Jones Industrial Index is currently up 39 points or 0.2% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq both opened marginally ahead. Further signs of the state of the UK economy will come shortly (3pm BST) as independent thinktank NIESR issues its latest GDP estimates. After growth of 0.6% in the three months to June, analysts expect NIESR\u2019s latest estimate for the three months to June to show a decline to around 0.4%. Ana Thaker, market economist at financial group PhillipCapital UK, said: Today\u2019s UK NIESR GDP figures promise to be crucial and will provide a reliable gauge of growth in the UK for July. The first snapshot of post-Brexit Britain from NIESR will no doubt move markets following the momentous decision to cut rates last week. If figures are weak the Bank of England will likely feel vindicated and will add assurance to the markets that their decision was well timed rather than hasty. However, weaker figures could see sterling fall further below the crucial $1.30 level as economic growth fears are confirmed; weak figures combined with the beginning of looser monetary policy could see sterling extend its losing streak and settle at new lows as markets await the effectiveness of new policy measures. Sterling has fallen 1.9% this month alone and underperforms compared to major peers, whilst this was previously viewed as a temporal dip we could see this become the long term trend of the currency. Another chart showing how the pound has weakened to one-month lows today, amid talk of more stimulus measures from the Bank of England: The big problems with America\u2019s weak productivity is that it could drive up the cost of employing people (as wages are currently going up). So, if a firm has skimped on new machinery and used more workers instead, it could easily start laying them off. Bloomberg has a good explanation: Productivity compared with a year earlier fell for the first time since 2013 as lackluster global markets prompted companies to scale back capital investment plans. In the face of deteriorating corporate profits and an absence of faster economic growth, the risk is that businesses may begin to ratchet back the hiring they\u2019ve relied on to meet demand. \u201cFirms have been substituting labor for capital,\u201d Richard Moody, chief economist at Regions Financial Corp. in Birmingham, Alabama, said before the report. \u201cThe advantage for firms is that if growth does fall off, it\u2019s a lot easier to rid yourself of excess labor than it is excess capital.\u201d Worrying news from America.... US productivity shrank by 0.5% in the second quarter of the year, following a 0.6% decline in the first three months. Economists has expected productivity to snap back in Q2, and forecasts a rise of 0.5%. That will fuel concerns about the underlying health of the US economy, as productivity is measured by the output per hour of work. So, while more Americans are getting jobs - and pay rises - it doesn\u2019t seem to be translating into higher productivity. Ian McCafferty\u2019s hint that more Bank of England stimulus could be needed has hit the pound today, says FXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed. Sterling slipped below $1.30 for the first time since July 12 following comments from BoE\u2019s Ian McCafferty that more easing is likely to be required if economic conditions deteriorated. Today marks the fifth consecutive day of declines on pound and the longest losing streak since the Brexit vote... The news that Britain\u2019s manufacturing output shrank by 0.3% in June hasn\u2019t helped the mood towards the pound either. But we should remember that there are two sides to a currency pair, and the dollar is also benefitting from last Friday\u2019s strong US jobs report. Despite the latest grim trade data, Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index has hit a new 14-month high today. The blue-chip index has gained 20 points this morning to 6831, which is its highest level since June 2015 [before fears over China\u2019s economy sparked a rout] That\u2019s partly due to the weakening pound, which boosts the value of international firms who earn money overseas, and gives foreign predators more firepower. David Miller, investment director at Quilter Cheviot, explains: Despite the lurid headlines, the curious thing, as Sherlock Holmes might have observed, is that the dog isn\u2019t barking. UK financial markets are delivering positive returns.... Since the unexpected referendum result sterling has fallen, making corporate UK more competitive on a global basis, short term interest rates have been reduced, but more importantly long term borrowing costs are also significantly lower and takeover activity is picking up because UK assets are now 10% cheaper than they were a month or so ago. The DAX police are out in force, pointing out that Germany\u2019s benchmark stock index is an odd beast - and actually includes dividends paid to shareholders: Good news for German investors. Over in Frankfurt, the DAX index has surged into Bull Market territory - up 20% since February\u2019s low. The pound is heading towards its weakest levels since the June referendum, as traders digest this morning\u2019s news. Sterling is still below $1.30 against the US dollar (down 0.5% at $1.298 right now). And against the euro, the pound has lost 0.4% to around \u20ac1.17. That means one euro is worth 85.4p, close to the 85.7p hit at the end of June. That\u2019s bad news for Brits heading to the continent this summer (unless you bought your euros before June 23rd). A weak pound should help tackle Britain\u2019s trade deficit, though -- but only if there is actual demand for UK goods in Europe. If Brexit causes Europe\u2019s economy to stumble, then exporters might not get a currency bounce. Here\u2019s Larry Elliott\u2019s take on today\u2019s widening UK trade gap: City economists agree that June\u2019s trade figures are pretty dire, although it can\u2019t all be blamed on the EU referendum. Ben Gutteridge, Head of Fund Research at Brewin Dolphin, hopes that the weak pound will help in future: \u201cThe deficit in the UK Trade Balance deepened in June and by an amount more than had been expected. The period over which the data has been collected is broadly pre-Brexit but still helps to confirm the widely acknowledged view that the UK is a bigger importer of goods than it is an exporter. Indeed that the UK commands such an important share of European export, it is considered to be an excellent platform from which to negotiate a favourable separation from the European Union. Of course, the politics of extending a favourable deal to non-members does, in some way, defeat the purposes of having a club, so the outcome of such negotiations remain highly uncertain. \u201cAs for trade figures going forward the drop in sterling will have significantly improved the competiveness of our goods and services globally. Over the medium term, therefore, the UK economy can expect to enjoy a genuine boost to activity, allowing the trade balance to narrow; all else equal. But a weak pound will hit people in the pocket, points out the Resolution\u2019s Group\u2019s Duncan Weldon: Sky News\u2019s Ed Conway fears any improvement will take a while.... Economist Rupert Seggins shows that Britain\u2019s been running a trade deficit for over a decade: Former Bank of England policymaker Andrew Sentance says today\u2019s data has limited use when assessing life after Brexit: Today\u2019s figure also show that Britain ran its largest trade gap with Germany - importing \u00a35.5bn but only exporting \u00a32.67bn. Mind you, the UK ran deficits with most countries -- but did post a surplus with Ireland and the US. Alarmingly, Britain\u2019s \u00a312.5bn trade in goods deficit is the worst for any June, ever, and the highest for any month since March 2015. In June alone, Britain exported \u00a312bn of goods and services to the European Union, up by \u00a3500m compared to May. But Britain also imported \u00a320.3bn from the EU, up by \u00a3800m, so the overall trade gap with the EU worsened. Britain\u2019s trade deficit has worsened after imports hit a new alltime high. The UK\u2019s deficit on trade in goods and services jumped to \u00a35.1bn on in June 2016, up from \u00a34.2bn in May, according to the Office for National Statistics. Exports increased by \u00a31.0bn and imports increased by \u00a31.9bn. Imports reached a record high of \u00a348.9bn. The deficit on trade in goods (which strips out the service sector) rose by \u00a3900m to \u00a312.4bn in June 2016, the ONS adds. The report also shows that Britain\u2019s trade deficit with the rest of the European Union has widened by \u00a3400m over the last three months. That\u2019s because the UK continued to import more than it exported back to its EU neighbours. The ONS says: Between Quarter 1 2016 and Quarter 2 2016, exports of goods to EU countries increased by \u00a31.8 billion due to exports of cars, increasing by \u00a30.4 billion to a record quarterly high of \u00a33.2 billion; oil increased by \u00a30.3 billion and both machinery and chemicals increased by \u00a30.2 billion each. For the same period, imports from the EU increased by \u00a32.2 billion to a record quarterly high of \u00a359.4 billion. This increase reflected a \u00a30.8 billion increase in food, beverages and tobacco; a \u00a30.4 billion increase in machinery; a \u00a30.3 billion increase in oil; and a \u00a30.1 billion increase in aircraft to a record high of \u00a30.9 billion. These increases were offset by a decrease in works of art of \u00a30.2 billion. So, not a great picture for a country facing the uncertainty of Brexit. Reaction to follow! Here we go! First... UK industrial output rose by 0.1% during June, meaning output was 1.6% higher than in June 2015. But the narrower manufacturing output measure shrank by 0.3% during the month, worst than the 0.2% decline expected. There\u2019s not much immediate sign of a Brexit hit. Indeed, industrial output over the last three months grew at the fastest quarterly rate sine 1999 - after a knockout April. Transport manufacturing drove the sector forwards. Britain\u2019s EU referendum is already causing angst in the property market. CBRE, the real estate advisor, says that office values fell by 3.3% across the UK in July, with steeper falls in the capital: The fall in capital values was widely expected and pulled year-on-year growth down to 0.4%. Heightened economic uncertainty, especially for financial services firms, hit offices in the City of London, shrinking capital values by -6.1%. And Savills, the estate agent, has reported that profit at its UK commercial property division more than halved in the first six months of this year. It now hopes, though, that things are back to normal now the vote is out of the wa Here\u2019s something to ponder.... according to the markets, the Bank of England won\u2019t raise interest rates for another 66 months! That takes us all the way through to the end of 2021, or 14 years since the crisis began. One of the Bank of England\u2019s policymakers has also undermined the pound, by predicting further interest rate cuts soon. Writing in The Times, Ian McCafferty says: \u201cIf the economy proves to have turned down in line with the initial survey signals, I believe that more easing is likely to be required, but that can easily be delivered in coming months.\u201d McCafferty voted in favour of last week\u2019s rate cut to 0.25%, but opposed the Bank\u2019s new \u00a360bn quantitative easing scheme. That makes him a relatively hawkish member of the committee. Here\u2019s Jill Treanor\u2019s story on the latest push to improve Britain\u2019s banks: Oh wow, Britain\u2019s borrowing costs have just hit a new record low. 10-year UK gilts are changing hands at a yield of just 0.592%, down from 0.609% last night. This makes it an excellent time to boost government borrowing to fund infrastructure projects.... No-one will be surprised to hear that Germany has posted another whopping trade surplus. German firms exported \u20ac106.8bn of goods in June, while the country imported \u00a382bn. That leaves Berlin with a surplus of \u20ac24.9bn, up from \u20ac23.9bn in May. The FT has more details: Exports to the EU accounted for the biggest growth in June \u2013 rising 2.3 per cent to his \u20ac62.7bn in the same month Britain went to vote on membership of the bloc. Imports from the EU to Germany rose 3.3 per cent, while the country\u2019s trade balance with the eurozone narrowed as imports (3 per cent up) outstripped a 0.1 per cent rise in exports. The pound is falling because traders fear bad news at 9.30am, reckons Connor Campbell of SpreadEx: Following a deathly dull and data-less Monday thing should be a bit more interesting this morning, with another wave of UK figures on their way. The reason behind sterling\u2019s Tuesday slide appears to be the prospect of more goods trade deficit bad news, with the gap between Britain\u2019s imports and exports expected to widen to \u00a32.5 billion from \u00a32.2 billion last month. UK consumers are refusing to be alarmed by the Brexit vote, according to a new report released overnight. Retail sales jumped by 1.1% in July, the fastest rate in six months. It was driven by warmer weather, which sent shoppers scrambling for new outfits, plus discounting from stores keen to shift stock. The pound is falling like one of Britain\u2019s fantastic synchronised divers this morning. Traders are selling sterling, as traders wait for this morning\u2019s trade balance and manufacturing report. The pound dropped by half a cent against the US dollar, to $1.298. This is a near one-month low; the pound hasn\u2019t been below $1.30 since mid July. This fall is being driven by expectations that the Bank of England will keep easing monetary policy in the months ahead, as part of its Brexit plans. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, says: Sentiment remains bearish towards the UK economy and speculations may heighten over the Bank of England taking further action if economic data continues to follow this negative path. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Coming up today.... we\u2019re about to discover how Britain\u2019s economy fared in the month of the EU referendum. The latest trade figures for June are due at 9.30am, and are expected to show that the UK ran a chunky current account deficit with the rest of the world (as usual). The gap between what Britain imported and exported is tipped to widen to around \u00a32.5bn in June, compared to \u00a32.2bn in May. And an industrial production report expected to show that manufacturing output fell by 0.2% in June, following a 0.5% decline in May. Other recent data has suggested that business confidence has taken a severe knock, but that consumers are relatively relaxed about the Brexit vote, so today\u2019s data could give new insights into the state of play. Germany is also posting trade data this morning, so we\u2019ll be able to compare its (traditional) trade surplus with the UK deficit. Then at 3pm, the NIESR thinktank publishes its estimate of UK growth in the May-to-July quarter. Will that show a Brexit hit too? Also coming up today.... The Competitions and Markets Authority is publishing its report into UK banking reforms, outlining ways to improve customer service and help the public switch banks. And we\u2019re also getting corporate news from estate agent Savills, and insurer Standard Life.",

                "body":"<p>One of Britain\u2019s leading economic thinktanks has said the UK economy shrank last month as the impact of the Brexit vote led to a pronounced weakening in activity.</p> <p>The National Institute of Economic and Social Research estimated that gross domestic product contracted by 0.2% in July.</p> <p>Niesr published the findings after official government figures showed that the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/uktradejune2016\">UK trade deficit widened</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/ukindexofproductionjune2016\">factory production eased back</a> in the weeks immediately before and after the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/24/the-guardian-view-on-the-eu-referendum-the-vote-is-in-now-we-must-face-the-consequences\">EU referendum on 23 June</a>. </p> <p>James Warren, a research fellow at Niesr, said: \u201cWe estimate that in the three months to July, the UK economy grew by 0.3%, a marked economic slowdown. The month-on-month profile suggests that the third quarter has got off to a weak start, with output declining in July. Our estimates suggest that there is around an evens chance of a technical recession by the end of 2017.\u201d</p> <p>The thinktank came to a gloomy conclusion after data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that a spurt in manufacturing came to an end in June, with output dropping by 0.3%. Meanwhile, UK exports failed to match imports, with the trade deficit rising by \u00a30.9bn to \u00a35.1bn.</p> <p>The poor trade and manufacturing figures led to a fall in the pound on the foreign exchanges. At one stage, sterling dipped below $1.30 and threatened to reach a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/06/brexit-pound-plunges-to-30-year-lows-as-eu-fears-bite-into-global-markets-again\">post-Brexit vote low</a>, before later rallying.</p> <p>However the ONS said there was little evidence of industry adopting a cautious approach because of uncertainty caused by the closely fought referendum campaign. The organisation\u2019s chief economist, Joe Grice, said: \u201cAs we previously highlighted in our preliminary estimate of GDP, production and the wider economy grew strongly in April, and then remained at roughly the same level throughout May and June. </p> <p>\u201cAny uncertainties in the run-up to the referendum seem to have had little impact on production, with very few respondents to our surveys reporting it as an issue.\u201d<br></p> <p>The ONS said total production, which includes mining, output from the North Sea, energy supply and manufacturing, increased by 0.1% from May to June. Manufacturing, the biggest component of production, fell by 0.3%.</p> <p>During the three months to June \u2013 which is considered a better guide to the trend than one month\u2019s figures \u2013 production was up by 2.1% on the previous quarter, while manufacturing rose by 1.8%.</p> <p>Despite the strong quarterly increases, manufacturing and overall production remain well below the peak reached in early 2008, when the UK was on the cusp of a recession.

                "bodyText":"One of Britain\u2019s leading economic thinktanks has said the UK economy shrank last month as the impact of the Brexit vote led to a pronounced weakening in activity. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research estimated that gross domestic product contracted by 0.2% in July. Niesr published the findings after official government figures showed that the UK trade deficit widened and factory production eased back in the weeks immediately before and after the EU referendum on 23 June. James Warren, a research fellow at Niesr, said: \u201cWe estimate that in the three months to July, the UK economy grew by 0.3%, a marked economic slowdown. The month-on-month profile suggests that the third quarter has got off to a weak start, with output declining in July. Our estimates suggest that there is around an evens chance of a technical recession by the end of 2017.\u201d The thinktank came to a gloomy conclusion after data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that a spurt in manufacturing came to an end in June, with output dropping by 0.3%. Meanwhile, UK exports failed to match imports, with the trade deficit rising by \u00a30.9bn to \u00a35.1bn. The poor trade and manufacturing figures led to a fall in the pound on the foreign exchanges. At one stage, sterling dipped below $1.30 and threatened to reach a post-Brexit vote low, before later rallying. However the ONS said there was little evidence of industry adopting a cautious approach because of uncertainty caused by the closely fought referendum campaign. The organisation\u2019s chief economist, Joe Grice, said: \u201cAs we previously highlighted in our preliminary estimate of GDP, production and the wider economy grew strongly in April, and then remained at roughly the same level throughout May and June. \u201cAny uncertainties in the run-up to the referendum seem to have had little impact on production, with very few respondents to our surveys reporting it as an issue.\u201d The ONS said total production, which includes mining, output from the North Sea, energy supply and manufacturing, increased by 0.1% from May to June. Manufacturing, the biggest component of production, fell by 0.3%. During the three months to June \u2013 which is considered a better guide to the trend than one month\u2019s figures \u2013 production was up by 2.1% on the previous quarter, while manufacturing rose by 1.8%. Despite the strong quarterly increases, manufacturing and overall production remain well below the peak reached in early 2008, when the UK was on the cusp of a recession. A steady decline in North Sea oil and gas output means that production is 7.5% below the early 2008 level, while manufacturing is 4.5% lower. The struggles of manufacturing during and after the recession of 2008-09 have made it harder for Britain to close its trade gap with the rest of the world. According to the ONS, there was an increase of \u00a30.9bn to \u00a312.4bn in the UK\u2019s deficit in goods in June, offset by the continued strong performance of the service sector, which ran a surplus of \u00a37.3bn. Between the first and second quarters of 2016, the UK\u2019s deficit in goods and services combined widened by \u00a30.4bn to \u00a312.5bn. Lee Hopley, the chief economist at manufacturers\u2019 association EEF, said: \u201cThe latest data suggests manufacturing posted some significant gains in the second quarter. Growth was supported by record levels of exports of cars to the EU and aircraft to non-EU markets. \u201cClearly, indicators of sentiment post referendum suggest that we\u2019ve hit the high point for manufacturing this year. Amid the wavering levels of confidence, however, we should take away some positive news, firstly that manufacturing entered this period of uncertainty from a relatively strong stance, and the weaker exchange rate could yet bring benefits on the export side. \u201cStill, we\u2019ll need a concerted effort from government to maintain investment across the sector and ensure growth like that seen in the second quarter gets back on track.\u201d",

The FTSE 100, in negative territory for much of the day, managed to end the day at a new 14 months high. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: The FTSE-100 has certainly been in for a volatile session...and once we take into account the toll stocks moving ex-dividend have exacted on the index, we\u2019re looking at a rather upbeat performance. That said, we\u2019re in the midst of the summer lull so thinner volumes will lend themselves to exaggerated market moves, but with more positive noises being made over oil prices stabilising, Wall Street has opened in an upbeat mood too \u2013 if these tailwinds continue, then it seems that soon enough the FTSE-100 will once again be starting with a \u201c7\u201d. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 48.29 points or 0.7% at 6914.71, its best level since 3 June 2015 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.86% to 10,742.84 France\u2019s Cac closed up 1.17% at 4503.95 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 1.06% to 16,969.69 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.7% at 8719.5 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.89% to 572.33 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 129 points or 0.7%. Oil continues to rise, with Brent crude climbing 5% at one point. It is now up 4.5% at $46.05 a barrel. As for the pound, it is now down 0.36% at $1.2961 and 0.21% lower at \u20ac1.1614. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Oil continues to rise, in turn supporting global stock markets. As well as the International Energy Agency saying markets would rebalance, crude has also been boosted by comments from the Saudi oil minister about possible action to stabilise prices. Khalid al-Falih said OPEC members and non-members would discuss the market situation and any action needed at their meeting at the end of September in Algeria. Traders had been sceptical about the prospects of the OPEC meeting taking any action to stem production, especially since Saudi Arabia reported record output in July. But these new comments have helped send Brent crude up 3.4% to $45.57, while West Texas Intermediate is 3.5% higher at $43.21. So on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has been testing new highs, and is currently up 131 points or 0.7%. The pound continues to weaken. It is now at around \u20ac1.1600 against the euro, down 0.33% and at its lowest level since 6 July. In the wake of the Brexit vote it hit a post referendum low of \u20ac1.1575 on that date, according to Caxton FX analyst Alexandra Russell-Olive. Against the dollar, sterling is down 0.35% at $1.2965. US markets are in buoyant mood after the oil price steadies, US weekly jobs claims fell again and a number of companies including department store group Macy\u2019s and US listed Chinese internet group Alibaba issued positive updates. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 49 points or 0.26%, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are also moving higher. Oil prices have edged higher after the International Energy Agency said crude markets would rebalance in the coming months. In its latest monthly report, it predicted oil stocks would reduce in the third quarter for the first time in more than two years. It said: Oil\u2019s drop...has put the \u2018glut\u2019 back into the headlines even though our balances show essentially no oversupply during the second half of the year. Brent crude is currently up 0.6% at $44.32 a barrel, having earlier fallen as low as $43.46. The US benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, is up 0.5% at $41.93 a barrel after hitting $41.1. Former deputy governor of the Bank of England, Sir Charles Bean, has been nominated by UK chancellor Philip Hammond to the Budget Responsibility Committee of the Office for Budget Responsibility. The vacancy at the independent OBR, which scrutinises the government\u2019s finances, comes because Sir Stephen Nickell is due to step down in December. Sir Charles said: I am delighted that the Chancellor has nominated me for appointment to the OBR\u2019s Budget Responsibility Committee. Sir Stephen Nickell and the rest of the BRC have done excellent work in establishing the credibility and reputation of the OBR, and I will be honoured to take up the post should the Treasury Committee wish me to do so. Earlier it was announced that the Office for National Statistics had begun recruiting its first data analytics apprentices, following a critical review into the quality of economic data by Sir Charles. Over to Russia, and a preliminary report from the Federal Statistics Service showed a 0.6% fall in GDP in the second quarter. But this is an improvement on recent quarters: Back with Brexit, and another suggestion that the UK economy is suffering after the vote to leave the European Union. A Reuters poll of nearly 60 economists indicated they expected the economy to contract by 0.1% in the third and fourth quarters. Ahead of the vote, they had expected similar growth to the 0.6% recorded in the second quarter. Most of those surveyed also thought the Bank of England would reduce interest rates again in November to just 0.1% after this month\u2019s reduction in borrowing costs. Two thirds of those who answered a question on fiscal measures expected the government to come up with some sort of fiscal stimulus in the Autumn statement. Back to Mongolia! The FT points out that the country\u2019s currency, the t\u00f6gr\u00f6g*, has hit a new record low today, thanks to those worries over its economy. * - bonus mark to anyone who knew that 1 t\u00f6gr\u00f6g = 100 m\u00f6ng\u00f6s If job creation was an Olympic sport, then the USA would be taking home yet another medal. The weekly job figures, just released, show that the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefit fell by 1,000 last week, to 266,000. That suggests that the US labour market is in robust health, with employers still creating new jobs. This is the 75th week running in which the initial claims figure has been below 300,000, the traditional threshold for a strong labour market. Bloomberg\u2019s Joe Weisenthal has more details: Today is so quiet that we\u2019d happily trek to Outer Mongolia for a decent bit of news..... ...and, bang on cue, Mongolian bonds are suffering a serious rout, after the government warned it faces an economic crisis. Reuters has the details: Bonds maturing in 2021 and 2022 fell 4.6 cents and 5 cents respectively, to their lowest since end-June . The 2018 bond fell 1.8 cents to 2-1/2-month lows. The selloff was sparked by the new finance Minister Battogtokh Choijilsuren, who warned earlier this week that the government may struggle to pay public sector wages. The Mongolian People\u2019s Party won a sweeping victory last month. But the honeymoon didn\u2019t last long, with Choijilsuren warning that: \u201cThe economic situation is difficult but our government is optimistic that we can develop a comprehensive plan to get out of this crisis.\u201d Choijilsuren also spoke about \u201ca deep state of economic crisis\u201d, leading investors to worry about Mongolia\u2019s ability to avoid a default. Mongolia is rich in minerals, and commodities such as coal and copper, but has been hit by falling demand from emerging economies such as China. It\u2019s shaking up to be a calm day on Wall Street, where traders expect the main share indices to open slightly higher in 80 minutes time. Sofa maker DFS isn\u2019t worried about Brexit, though. The company has hiked its profit forecast this morning, and hopes to get a sales boost out of sponsoring the Olympics (a curious tie-up, until you remember where most of us watch the action). CEO Ian Filby has told us that he expects the consumer market to remain quite resilient, despite the EU referendum uncertainty. A new survey has shown that consumer confidence has dipped in August to a two-year low. The Thomson Reuters/Ipsos Primary Consumer Sentiment Index (PCSI) eased to 49.2 from 49.4 in July. That level was last seen in early 2014. The survey found that Brits are more concerned about losing their jobs, but actually less pessimistic about the wider economy. Rating agency Moody\u2019s has joined the chorus of concern over Britain\u2019s property sector. In a new report, it predicts that the buy-to-let sector will be particularly badly hit by the Brexit vote. Recent changes to stamp duty rules, which hit second home owners, will also hurt BTL prices. Kamran Sabir, a Moody\u2019s vice president, says: \u201cWith reduced demand for credit and downward pressure on house prices, economic uncertainty will likely reverse previously positive market conditions for the UK mortgage market.\u201d The weakening pound is going to hit British holidaymakers in the pocket. Holiday group TUI has warned that sterling\u2019s recent tumble will inevitably make package tours more expensive: It\u2019s one of those days... Capital Economics predict that UK house price inflation will fall to 2% by the end of this year. They do see some glimmers of light in today\u2019s report by Britain\u2019s surveyors: This morning\u2019s RICS survey reported that the new buyer enquiries balance improved a little, from minus 36% in June to minus 27% in July. (See Chart.) And the new sales instructions balance rose from minus 45% to minus 33%. But the big picture is that the market is softening. After all, most of the readings from June were deep in negative territory and multi-year lows. So despite the modest improvements seen this month, the survey still points to fewer new buyers and sellers in July than in June. And, with the newly agreed sales balance at minus 34% and the past prices balance at 5%, the data are consistent with falling sales and low, single-digit house price growth. Swiss bank USB reckons that the pound will fall to $1.25 in the next three months, as the Bank of England launches more stimulus measures: UBS strategists Constantin Bolz and Thomas Flury say: \u201cIn our view, it is very likely that further monetary easing will be delivered in the coming months, which would weaken sterling.\u201d Ouch. Sterling has fallen to its lowest level against the US dollar since July 7. The pound has shed more than half a cent to $1.295, as traders react to the slowdown in UK housing market. Sterling is also suffering from the Bank of England\u2019s new QE programme. That\u2019s because the BoE will sending a lot of pounds overseas, to buy UK government debt from foreign investors. Kit Juckes, currency expert at French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, explains: The foreign exchange conclusion of the BOE buying bonds off foreigners is very simple and sterling-negative. Throw in a soft RICS housing survey released overnight and the pound\u2019s woes don\u2019t get any less. More property gloom, via the FT.... Derwent London, the UK property landlord, has become the latest real estate group to caution that Britain\u2019s vote to leave Europe is likely to lower demand for office space in London and it has cut its expectations for growth in rental income for this year. The group, which has assets in London locations such as Clerkenwell and Fitzrovia, is braced for a slowdown in momentum in the second half of the year and has reduced its estimate of rental growth for the whole of 2016 to 1-5 per cent from a previous forecast of 5-8 per cent. Ana Thaker, market economist at PhillipCapital UK, predicts the UK housing market will suffer from the Brexit vote for some time: RICS housing prices showed that prices dipped by a drop to +5 for the month of July indicating one of the most significant drops since the middle of 2013. This trend looks set to continue as the UK struggles with the fallout and the housing market is likely to be a crucial gauge of consumer sentiment following its rapid rise over the last two years. A weaker currency is likely to fuel demand from abroad but the domestic market looks set to suffer which will permeate other crucial areas of the economy. The government should look to act swiftly to stem any unrest in these sectors so as not to cause panic amongst consumers. The former head of London estate agent Greene &amp; Co reckons buyers should be cautious: Some more context: Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index had tumbled by 50 points, or almost 1%, in early trading. And housebuilding companies are leading the selloff, following the news that house price growth has hit a three-year low. Berkeley Group has fallen by 5.4%, Taylor Wimpey are down 2.1% and Barratt Development has lost 1.9%. Travis Perkins, which supplies building products, are down 2.5%. Today\u2019s report from RICS contains several charts, showing how the UK housing market slowed sharply in July. These two illustrates how house price growth slowed in July, and the number of people enquiring about properties. The slowdown is worst in the East and West midlands: And this chart shows how RICS\u2019s survey is often a good leading indicator of where the housing market is headed: Britain\u2019s house prices rose at the slowest rate in three years in July, in the latest sign that the EU referendum has hurt the economy. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors reports this morning that house price growth, and transaction levels, fell sharply last month following the Brexit vote. RICS\u2019s headline price balance fell to +5 in July from +15 in June, its lowest level since April 2013. This means that just 5% more respondents nationally saw a rise rather than fall in prices. RICS says: \u2022 House price growth falters in July and near term expectations remain negative \u2022 Sales and enquiries drop further - although expectations point to a more stable picture in the coming months \u2022 Stock levels at record lows in most parts of the UK as new instructions decline markedly The decline was particularly sharp in London, reflecting concerns that the capital will suffer from the June 23 vote to leave the EU. But.... RICS also reckons that the property sector is only suffering a wobble, rather than a full-blown meltdown. Most surveyors expect prices to be higher in 12 months time, and a majority expect to be handling more sales too. That\u2019s partly because Britain still suffers from an \u201cacute shortage of property for sale\u201d. Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at Rics, remains optimistic, saying: \u201cThe rebound in the key 12 month indicators in the July survey suggest that confidence remains more resilient than might have been anticipated.\u201d Noble Francis, economics director at the Construction Products Association, flags up that house prices in some London areas are already falling: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. Today, City investors are fretting about the Bank of England\u2019s new stimulus programme after its new bond-buying spree drove UK borrowing costs to record lows. Some gilts yields turned negative yesterday after the BoE bought up \u00a31.17bn of government bonds. That\u2019s very bad news for pension funds who rely on government debt for their income. As we report this morning: Anticipation that the Bank will keep buying bonds has helped push up their price \u2013 which in turn pushes down on the yield \u2013 and for some three- and four-year bonds the price rose so much that the yield turned negative. Negative yields have happened once before since the 23 June vote, effectively meaning that the government does not have to pay any money to encourage investors to buy its debt. Pensioners face a double-whammy right now, with the BoE also slashing interest rates to just 0.25%. Ros Altmann, the former pensions minister, fears that Mark Carney and colleagues are wilfully ignoring savers, saying: The Bank wants to stimulate the economy by bringing down interest rates, but the Bank is not acknowledging the negative impact these measures are having on pension deficits, and neither is the government. It\u2019s possible that gilt yields could hit fresh record lows today, given that pension funds are reluctant to give up their precious long-dated government debt. Also coming up today.... Holiday firm TUI is updating the City on its financial performance, in the light of the Brexit vote. The oil price is under pressure after the OPEC cartel warned that demand could be weak in 2017. We get another insight into the US economy at 1.30pm BST, when the weekly jobless report is released. Traders are expecting European stock markets to drop a little in early trading: And so far, that\u2019s it. Fingers crossed for more news....",

There was a modest upward revision (2 tenths of a percentage point) to June\u2019s figure, but it is still a miss. Car sales were actually the strong point of the report, rising 1.1%. There had certainly been some good volume numbers, but with GM having offered deep discounts we thought that the value of auto sales may not be quite so good.</p> <p>In terms of other categories, there was a 2.7% drop in gasoline station sales, due to price falls, but there was also weakness in sporting goods (-2.2%), building materials (-0.5%) and food/beverages (-0.6%). Looking at the \u201ccontrol group\u201d which excludes volatile items and has a better relationship with overall consumer spending growth, it was also flat on the month. This suggests that after a pretty disappointing second quarter GDP, the economy isn\u2019t exactly roaring ahead at the start of the third quarter.</p> <p>We have also had some softer than expected producer price inflation numbers, with the headline annual rate dropping into negative territory at -0.2% year on year, while the core (ex food and energy inflation rate slowed markedly to 0.7% year on year from 1.3%.</p> <p>So with activity being softer than hoped and pipeline inflation pressures looking benign it doesn\u2019t offer much support to the view the Fed will be hiking rates imminently. We favour the next Fed move higher to come in the first quarter of 2017.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57adc4d9e4b05ef4244a4ed6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-12T12:49:04.866Z\">1.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The US retail sales figures also showed a 0.3% fall excluding automobiles compared with expectations of a 0.2% rise.</p> <p>The data puts the Federal Reserve is something of a quandary, say analysts.

Brexit may not have put developers off building yet but this slow down needs to be reversed if enough new homes are to be built over the next few years. Work has dropped quarter-on-quarter and so too has the number of new homes approved in the capital \u2013 with a 22% drop in Q2 2016 from the previous year.</p> <p>But, as ever with construction and house building, it\u2019s all about the pipeline. Next year will see huge construction projects like HS2 and Crossrail take centre stage \u2013 having a huge knock on benefit for housing and infrastructure opportunities. This will open up new areas of London and once the bricks start being laid momentum will keep growing. London desperately needs more homes to be built. Planning inefficiency is one of the main delays leading many developers to re-think projects. One of the new government\u2019s top priorities should be a new willingness to challenge the rigid planning system and bring new homes to London.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ad96bee4b0f231200da2b8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-12T09:29:35.340Z\">10.29am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Employers obviously want free movement to continue, according to the NIESR study.

Meanwhile, Brexit negotiations will be protracted, so businesses will hold off committing to major capital expenditure for a long time to come. In addition, the public investment plans won\u2019t be reviewed until the Autumn Statement at the end of the year and few construction projects are genuinely \u2018shovel ready\u2019. Accordingly, we continue to think that a slump in construction activity will play a key role in pushing the overall economy into recession over the coming quarters.</p> <p>The chart shows the downturn in construction output has been broad based.

                "bodyText":"US oil drillers have added rigs for the seventh week in a row, taking the edge off crude prices. Seventeen rigs in total were added last week compared to just one the previous week. Of these 15 were oil rigs and 2 gas, the largest weekly rise for more than a year. Following the figures Brent crude is still ahead but has moved from a 1.6% rise to a 0.65% increase at $46.34 a barrel. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. In a quiet day\u2019s trading, the main impetus in the end came from a poor set of US data, including retail sales, which suggested weakness in the world\u2019s second largest economy and a possible delay to any US rate rise. An early dip on Wall Street helped take away any impetus from European markets, despite oil continuing to hold firm after its recent gains. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished virtually flat, up just 1.31 points or 0.02% at 6916.02 although the index was up nearly 2% on the week Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.27% to 10,713.43 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.08% at 4500.19 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB edged up 0.17% to 16,997.83 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.04% at 8716.4 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.66% to 576.12 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 49.41 points or 0.27%. Meanwhile, despite an initial hit to the dollar following the US data, the pound failed to hold onto any gains and is currently down 0.3% at $1.2917. Against the euro, sterling has fallen 0.59% to \u20ac1.1564. A Chinese slowdown, the fallout from Brexit and a Trump presidency are among the main worries among businesses, according to Oxford Economics: The International Monetary Fund has appointed a new senior representative for Greece, replacing an American with a Dutch national specialising in financial crises and social security reform (no comment necessary). Dennis Botman will take over from Wes McGrew who ends his three year assignment this month and will return to the IMF\u2019s headquarters. A spokesman said: Mr Botman... previously worked in the Asia and Pacific Department\u2014as the deputy chief on Japan as well as the IMF\u2019s Resident Representative in the Philippines\u2014the Economic Modeling Division in the Research Department, and the Fiscal Affairs Department. He participated in numerous missions, including in Europe (e.g. Germany, UK), and his research covers a variety of topics, including general equilibrium modeling, financial crises and speculative attacks, aging and social security reform in Europe and Japan, and public finance. Back in the UK and Aberdeen Asset Management is detecting signs of calm in the property market after the post-Brexit slump. The firm has revised the fair value adjustment of its property fund from -7% on 6 July to -5%. Chief executive Martin Gilbert said: There is further evidence that calm and order are being restored to the UK commercial property market. The impact of the vote to leave the EU is being felt most in the Central London office market, which the portfolio has little exposure to, whereas the retail and logistics markets are holding up relatively well along with longer-leased properties and those less dependent upon future rental growth. The quality of our holdings has allowed us to re-assess the fair value adjustment we are applying in the light of further emerging evidence. Of course the situation remains very fragile so we will remain watchful and act accordingly in the interests of all our underlying investors. Something to note for early next week: Stock markets and the dollar are still in negative territory - just - after the disappointing US data. Analyst Connor Campbell at Spreadex said: A worrisome afternoon of US data ensured that trading continued at the same uninspired pace it did during the morning. Dipping back under 18600 the Dow Jones was suitably unimpressed with what the US economy threw up this Friday. Retail sales were the most alarming figure, an upwards revision to 0.8% for June failing to compensate for the 0.0% growth managed across July; things get even worse when the automobile sector is stripped out, core retail sales plunging by -0.3% against the 0.2% increase that had been expected. Unsurprisingly given those sales figures the preliminary UoM consumers sentiment reading failed to see the recovery forecast, coming in at 90.4 against 90.0 last month and the 91.5 analysts had estimated. Yet the Dow Jones didn\u2019t bear the brunt of the bad news; that honour went to the dollar, which immediately began to suffer as its hopes of a 2016 rate hike were dealt a significant blow. Brexit concerns appear to have been replaced by uncertainty ahead of the US election, according to the consumer confidence report. The survey\u2019s chief economist, Richard Curtin said: Confidence inched upward in early August due to more favorable prospects for the overall economy offsetting a small pullback in personal finances. Most of the weakness in personal finances was among younger households who cited higher expenses than anticipated as well as somewhat smaller expected income gains. Concerns about Brexit have faded amid rising references to the outcome of the presidential election as a source of uncertainty about future economic prospects... Overall, the data remains consistent with real personal consumption expenditures improving at an annual rate of 2.6% through mid 2017, with new and existing home sales also benefitting from low mortgage rates. More weaker than expected US economic data, and thus more food for thought for Janet Yellen and her colleagues at the Federal Reserve. The University of Michigan survey of consumer sentiment came in at 90.4 in August\u2019s preliminary reading, up from the final figure of 90 for July but below the expected level of 91.5. Wall Street has reacted to the disappointing US economic data, notably retail sales, by coming off the all time highs it hit on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 41 points or 0.23% lower while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq have also opened lower. The International Monetary Fund has warned that China\u2019s economic transition to more balanced, sustainable growth will be \u201ccomplex, challenging and potentially bumpy\u201d. In its latest assessment of the Chinese economy, the fund said China\u2019s economy slowed to 6.9% growth last year, which is projected to ease to 6.6% this year due to slower private investment and weak external demand. It said: \u201cThe economy is advancing on many dimensions of rebalancing, particularly switching from industry to services and from investment to consumption. But other aspects are lagging, such as strengthening state-owned enterprise and financial governance and containing rapid credit growth.\u201d The Washington-based fund welcomed the \u201cimpressive progress\u201d on structural reforms in many areas, notably interest rate liberalisation, internationalisation of the renminbi, and urbanisation; and the 13th five-year plan, with its ambitious goals centred on economic rebalancing. IMF directors \u201cstressed the need for decisive action to tackle rising vulnerabilities; reduce the reliance on credit-financed, state-led investment; and improve governance, risk pricing, and resource allocation in the state-owned enterprise and financial sectors\u201d. Inflation in China dipped below 1.5% in 2015 and is expected to pick up to around 2% this year, reflecting the rebound in commodity prices and the weaker renminbi since mid-2015 (the currency has lost some 4.5% of its value). China\u2019s current account surplus is projected to decline to 2.5% of GDP this year, from 3% of GDP in 2015, as imports increase and the services deficit widens, with Chinese tourists continuing to head abroad. Here\u2019s a chart showing the movement in US retail sales: The Fed is not likely to raise rates this year, according to economist James Knightley of ING Bank: US retail sales for July are disappointing, coming in flat on the month versus expectations of a 0.4% month on month gain. There was a modest upward revision (2 tenths of a percentage point) to June\u2019s figure, but it is still a miss. Car sales were actually the strong point of the report, rising 1.1%. There had certainly been some good volume numbers, but with GM having offered deep discounts we thought that the value of auto sales may not be quite so good. In terms of other categories, there was a 2.7% drop in gasoline station sales, due to price falls, but there was also weakness in sporting goods (-2.2%), building materials (-0.5%) and food/beverages (-0.6%). Looking at the \u201ccontrol group\u201d which excludes volatile items and has a better relationship with overall consumer spending growth, it was also flat on the month. This suggests that after a pretty disappointing second quarter GDP, the economy isn\u2019t exactly roaring ahead at the start of the third quarter. We have also had some softer than expected producer price inflation numbers, with the headline annual rate dropping into negative territory at -0.2% year on year, while the core (ex food and energy inflation rate slowed markedly to 0.7% year on year from 1.3%. So with activity being softer than hoped and pipeline inflation pressures looking benign it doesn\u2019t offer much support to the view the Fed will be hiking rates imminently. We favour the next Fed move higher to come in the first quarter of 2017. The US retail sales figures also showed a 0.3% fall excluding automobiles compared with expectations of a 0.2% rise. The data puts the Federal Reserve is something of a quandary, say analysts. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.xom, said: Investors had waited with bated breath to see what today\u2019s US retail sales numbers would say about the strength of the American economy, but have been left disappointed by a result that leaves opinions divided. Neither particularly strong, nor catastrophic, the slight decline in monthly data shows that the world\u2019s largest economy is merely ticking along, which will leave Fed chair Janet Yellen with a head-scratcher. An interest rate rise will remain in the back of her mind, but with no real clues as to whether consumers would withstand monetary tightening, the wait goes to see if and when she\u2019ll exact one. Peter Read, co-founder of trading network Pelican, said: Fed Chair Janet Yellen will be disappointed to not be able to add today\u2019s retail sales data to the body of evidence she is building that supports raising interest rates later in the year. The possible intervention on rates received a notable backer in San Francisco Fed chief John Williams this week, which comes off the back of a second successive better than expected non-farm payroll result last week. However, Yellen and Co. will know that today\u2019s surprisingly poor data is a significant drop from last month\u2019s figures and further global market uncertainty, including equally poor Chinese data, may tempt the Fed to exercise caution. Next week\u2019s inflation data will give observers further food for thought. July\u2019s retail sales in the US are disappointing, coming in unchanged compared to expectations of a 0.4% increase However June\u2019s figure was revised up from a 0.6% increase to 0.8%. The news has weakened the dollar, with the slowdown in sales suggesting the Federal Reserve may have less room to raise interest rates. The pound has hit a day\u2019s high of $1.3030 while oil prices and gold have both risen after the figures. Better than expected US retail sales - the figures are due shortly - could provide more fuel to those hawks within the Federal Reserve who believe an interest rate rise is justified this year. And it will also give more support to the dollar. Analyst Lukman Otunuga at FXTM said: With expectations continually fluctuating over the Fed raising US interest rates in 2016, dollar sensitivity has become a dominant theme in the currency markets If today\u2019s retail sales exceed expectations then this period of sensitivity could be dispelled with bulls sending the dollar higher. Sentiment is still somewhat bullish towards the dollar and today\u2019s key release could potentially provide another compelling reason for the Fed to break the trend of central caution. Following the recent weakness in the pound after the Brexit vote and the Bank of England\u2019s stimulus package, here\u2019s a chart from Bloomberg clearly illustrating the bad time sterling has had: Eurozone economic growth was confirmed at 0.3% in the second quarter, half the first quarter\u2019s growth rate, while the EU as a whole expanded by 0.4%. Germany grew 0.4% between April and June, more than expected; Spain 0.7% and the Netherlands 0.6%. However, France and Italy recorded zero growth. UK construction output fell 0.7% in the second quarter, and by 0.9% in June, ahead of the EU referendum. European stock markets are lacklustre, and broadly flat, ahead of US retail sales data at 1.30pm BST and the International Monetary Fund\u2019s report on China at 2.00pm BST. The National Housing Federation warns that a slowdown in housebuilding similar to that of the 2008 recession would over the next decade: Wipe out more than a third of GDP growth (\u00a3142.5bn). Result in the loss of nearly 120,000 construction jobs. The federation notes that a poll by Reuters of almost 60 economists has predicted that GDP will decline by 0.1% for the next two quarters, pushing the UK into recession. David Orr, chief executive of the National Housing Federation said believes that housing associations could pick up the baton from housebuilders. We know that an uncertain economic environment will cause builders to put the brakes on. Our country\u2019s prosperity and thousands of citizens\u2019 livelihoods depend on a strong building sector \u2013 we cannot let a slowdown take hold.\u201d Housing associations have a track record of building through tough times, having upped their output through the last recession when private developers could not. With the right flexibility from Government, and at no extra cost to the taxpayer, housing associations can keep the nation building. Let\u2019s take a look at the markets. They are a bit dull today... FTSE 100 index in London up 5.2 points at 6919.97, up 0.08% Dax in Frankfurt down 0.18% at 10,723.77 CAC in Paris down 0.03% at 4502.69 Ibex in Madrid up 0.03% at 8722.00 FTSE MiB in Milan up 0.19% at 17,001.84 Still to come: US retail sales at 1.30pm BST and the International Monetary Fund\u2019s latest assessment on the Chinese economy. According to the investor confidence index from retail investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, confidence bounced back somewhat in August from the Brexit blues. The August reading is up 19% from July to 80, but is still below the pre-Brexit level of 92, and below the long-term average of 101. Investors have become more confident in European shares, although sentiment is still modestly negative. As you might expect, investors are most confident about the US, followed by global emerging markets. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: The sharp fall and subsequent recovery in confidence underlines how volatile sentiment has been in the last few months, and why it\u2019s a particularly inappropriate time to be hanging too much significance on one or two data points. The UK stock market is still trading near its long term historical average, and looks attractive when compared to government bonds, some of which have traded at negative yields in recent days, offering investors the dubious privilege of actually paying for the privilege of lending money to the UK government. When it comes to income, the UK stock market is pretty much the only game left in town, with cash on its back, bonds yielding next to nothing, and buy to let being taxed to the bone. Income-seekers investing in the stock market must accept fluctuations in prices and dividends however. Investors remain most confident in the US stock market despite relatively high valuations, which is understandable seeing as economic growth and monetary policy appear to be going in different directions on either side of the Atlantic. The latest GDP figures show the eurozone growing at the same pace as the US economy between April and June, by 0.3%. You can read the full release here (pdf). Here\u2019s an expert\u2019s view on the fall in UK construction output. Andrew Bridges, managing director of London estate agents Stirling Ackroyd, points out that big infrastructure projects like HS2 and Crossrail will boost construction: There\u2019s been a dip in total new housing work \u2013 but housing remains a stable and reliable source of construction work. Brexit may not have put developers off building yet but this slow down needs to be reversed if enough new homes are to be built over the next few years. Work has dropped quarter-on-quarter and so too has the number of new homes approved in the capital \u2013 with a 22% drop in Q2 2016 from the previous year. But, as ever with construction and house building, it\u2019s all about the pipeline. Next year will see huge construction projects like HS2 and Crossrail take centre stage \u2013 having a huge knock on benefit for housing and infrastructure opportunities. This will open up new areas of London and once the bricks start being laid momentum will keep growing. London desperately needs more homes to be built. Planning inefficiency is one of the main delays leading many developers to re-think projects. One of the new government\u2019s top priorities should be a new willingness to challenge the rigid planning system and bring new homes to London. Employers obviously want free movement to continue, according to the NIESR study. They cannot see how a points-based system could work in low-skilled sectors. They are interested in the use of sector-based schemes but are concerned that any system should involve minimal additional cost and bureaucracy. They are also concerned that any visa systems will not allow them to respond quickly to fluctuating labour requirements. The study re-interviewed employers who took part in research on free movement before the referendum. Following the Brexit vote, a number are looking more seriously at how they might recruit more UK workers but can see no easy answers. The CEO of a bakery company employing 280 staff, including 168 EU migrants, said: The outer\u2019s view is that migration will stop and we\u2019ll suddenly have a sensible level of tens of thousands net migration whereas anybody I know who works in a food manufacturing industry is thinking \u2018oh crikey, if that happens, we\u2019re going to be seriously stuffed in terms of what we can do to make food\u2019. Employers in three sectors that employ large numbers of EU nationals \u2013 hospitality, food and drink, and construction \u2013 reveal they were unprepared for the Leave result and believe it is bad for business, new research by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research shows. The study reveals employers were surprised by June\u2019s referendum result and some expressed strong feelings including \u2018shock\u2019, \u2018horror\u2019 or devastation. Employers are worried about recruitment once free movement ends, are concerned for the wellbeing of their EU workers who have been left in the dark about their future, and want a say in future immigration policy. The research covering 17 employers with workforces of between 30 and 15,000, reveals their EU workers feel they are unwelcome in the UK and have even experienced hostile comments from customers. This led many companies to issue reassuring messages about the value of EU staff to the business. The research reveals: \u00b7 Few employers sent out information to their workforces about the referendum before the vote but many regretted not doing so \u00b7 Workplace discussion about the referendum has been livelier after polling day than before \u00b7 A number of employers have needed to put in place policy to deal with xenophobic incidents involving the public towards their EU employees In other news, Eurostar workers have begun a four-day strike, in a dispute over their work-life balance \u2013 bringing misery to travellers this weekend. PA reports: Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union will walk out from Friday to Monday, followed by three days over the bank holiday weekend from 27 August. A picket line will be mounted outside London St Pancras station, where trains depart for Paris and Brussels. One train in each direction between London and Brussels was cancelled on Friday, and Eurostar said it expected to operate a normal service on Saturday. The company said it was working on plans for Sunday and Monday and would be able to accommodate all customers booked to travel. More economic data from the eurozone \u2013 it\u2019s a mixed bag. Industrial production bounced back in June, rising by 0.6%, but this was not enough to offset May\u2019s steep fall of 1.2%, according to Eurostat figures. GDP growth in the 19-nation currency bloc slowed to 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.6% in the first quarter, as previously estimated. GDP in the European Union rose by 0.4%. Germany grew 0.4% between April and June, Spain 0.7% and the Netherlands 0.6%. However France and Italy recorded zero growth. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: June\u2019s official data confirm that the construction sector re-entered recession in the first half of this year, as public sector cuts and Brexit risk took their toll. The downturn looks set to deepen in Q3; July\u2019s construction PMI broadly is consistent with output falling by about 3.5% quarter-on-quarter. Meanwhile, Brexit negotiations will be protracted, so businesses will hold off committing to major capital expenditure for a long time to come. In addition, the public investment plans won\u2019t be reviewed until the Autumn Statement at the end of the year and few construction projects are genuinely \u2018shovel ready\u2019. Accordingly, we continue to think that a slump in construction activity will play a key role in pushing the overall economy into recession over the coming quarters. The chart shows the downturn in construction output has been broad based. The surge in housebuilding has run out of steam, while the fiscal squeeze has depressed output in the public and infrastructure sectors. Meanwhile, Brexit risk has kept a lid on private industrial and commercial work. Back to the UK construction figures. Eurozone bond yields are recovering from their record lows \u2013 supported by oil price rises and comments from a top US central banker that the Fed should raise interest rates this year. Bonds react to moves in crude prices because of the impact they have on inflation. And San Francisco Fed president John Williams cited the prospect of higher inflation as a reason for rate hikes in an interview last night. German 10-year bond yields, the eurozone benchmark, rose to minus 0.15% this morning, pulling away from the record low of minus 0.20% hit early last in the wake of the Brexit vote. Other eurozone bond yields are also rising. RBC\u2019s chief European macro strategist Peter Schaffrik told Reuters: Since we had that drop to a record low in July, German bond yields have been pretty stable and oil prices will have a role in where we go from here. We will have to wait until next month for July figures, to ascertain the impact from the Brexit vote on construction and the rest of the economy. UK construction output fell 0.7% in the second quarter from the first, the Office for National Statistics said. New work was down 0.8% while repair and maintenance dropped 0.5%. In June alone, construction fell 0.9% from May. Renzi is considering fresh stimulus measures to revive Italy\u2019s flagging economy, the Financial Times reported last night (\u00a3). The pound is also having a bad time this week, and is trading near a one-month low today. Traders are betting on further monetary easing from the Bank of England. Sterling has fallen nearly 3% since the Bank unveiled a bigger-than-expected stimulus package last week and dropped to $1.2952 this morning, after hitting a one-month low of $1.2936 yesterday. The poor GDP figures for Italy are a big blow for prime minister Matteo Renzi, ahead of a referendum on constitutional reform in November. He has said he will resign if he loses the referendum. Aside from the economic slowdown, Renzi needs to contain the country\u2019s worsening banking crisis. The Italian economy ground to a halt in the second quarter, disappointing analysts who had pencilled in 0.2% growth. In the first quarter, it grew by 0.3%. European stock markets have turned positive, with the exception of the Dax in Frankfurt, which is down 0.2%, while the FTSE 100 in London is flat. Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB is now 0.35% ahead and Spain\u2019s Ibex has gained 0.2%. Strong corporate earnings and higher energy stocks, which are tracking crude oil prices, have pushed European shares to the highest in seven weeks. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose as high as 346.93 this morning, recouping all of its post-Brexit losses. Germany\u2019s annual GDP growth slowed to 1.8% from 1.9% in the first quarter, according to Germany\u2019s statistics office Destatis in Wiesbaden. European markets have opened slightly lower, as expected. The FTSE 100 index in London is down about 7 points at 6907.94, a 0.1% fall. Germany\u2019s Dax is down 0.2%, France\u2019s CAC and Spain\u2019s Ibex edged down 0.1%, and Italy\u2019s FTSE Mib was flat in early tradng. Oil prices are edging higher, supported by the prospect of talks by exporters about ways to prop up the market. Brent crude is trading 9 cents higher at $46.13 a barrel, a 0.2% gain, while US West Texas Intermediate crude has risen 0.5% to $43.69, up 20 cents, after touching a high of $44.17 earlier. European stock markets are expected to open slightly lower, but have had a good week, while bond yields have been falling to new record lows. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, has sent us his thoughts, as usual: This week\u2019s break higher by the German DAX through the 10,500 level, along with new all-time highs for all three of the US main benchmarks does appear to have given European equity markets the extra impetus to kick on further yesterday. The move higher in the DAX while welcome, does appear to be an outlier, in terms of the rest of the core Eurozone markets, and despite outperforming the rest of Europe it still hasn\u2019t been able to wipe out all of its losses year to date. As for the UK, continued weakness in the pound, which is now at 5 year lows on its trade weighted index, has driven the FTSE100 and FTSE250 to their highest levels in 14 months. A sharp turnaround in oil prices also helped sentiment, after the Saudi Arabian oil minister said that oil producing countries would look at discussing prices when they meet in Algiers at the end of next month. This sort of jawboning has been a familiar tactic over the last few months by OPEC and non OPEC members as they attempt to put a floor under prices near $40 a barrel. While it can be effective in the short term, the eventual actions have rarely matched the narrative. Back to the German growth data. Higher exports coupled with strong government and household spending made up for weaker investment in construction and machinery. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. There is a fair amount of economic data coming out today. The first estimate for German GDP for the second quarter is already out. It shows Europe\u2019s biggest economy growing at 0.4%, twice as fast as expected. It\u2019s a slowdown from the first quarter though, when Germany expanded 0.7%. We will also get preliminary Italian GDP data, at 9am BST, with another 0.2% growth number expected, down slightly from 0.3% in the first quarter. The broader eurozone GDP number (the final estimate) is expected to be confirmed at 0.3%, at 10am BST. UK construction output for June is out at 9.30am. Construction has struggled over the past year, shrinking in the past two quarters, which means that it is fallen into recession. Construction output is estimated to have fallen by 0.4% in the second quarter. Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec, said: We suspect that at least some of this hesitancy, and possibly some of the prior weakness too, was due to fears over a \u2018leave\u2019 vote in the referendum on 23 June. The forthcoming figures are for June, early estimates of which were published by the ONS at the time of last week\u2019s GDP data. These suggested that the sector shrank by 1.0% over the month following a (revised) decline of 1.5% in May. Of course the main interest will be in the economic data for all sectors for July onwards, following the result of the referendum. In this respect anecdotal indicators are not encouraging with, for example, the construction PMI edging down to a new seven year low of 45.9 in July. This would tend to suggest that output in the sector declined at a faster pace than before the referendum, with a possibility that the economy as a whole has begun to contract as well. In China, industrial production rose by 6% in July, down from 6.2% growth in June, but markets seem less concerned about the slowdown in China than they were at the beginning of the year. The International Monetary Fund will publish its article IV assessment on the Chinese economy at 2pm BST. In the US, retail sales, released at 1.30pm BST, will shed further light on the strength of the economy.",

                "bodyText":"PS: It\u2019s also worth noting that the oil price has hit a one-month high, with Brent crude trading around $48.12 per barrel. Persistent speculation that the OPEC cartel might actually agree a production freeze are the main factor. City AM has more details. Hello again. Just popping back to record that Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 closed at a new 14-month high tonight. The index of blue-chip shares ended the day 25 points higher, at 6,941 - as the weak pound benefited international firms like mining group Anglo American (up 1.8%) and Glaxo (up 1.2%). OK, we seem to have run out of news for the day. And it\u2019s sunny out there. So I\u2019m wrapping up for the day, but we\u2019ll be back it anything important happens.... GW Newsflash: the Bank of England has successfully bought \u00a31.17bn of UK government bonds, as part of its new stimulus programme. So, no repeat of last week\u2019s failed reserve auction, when the BoE couldn\u2019t prise enough long-dated bonds out of their owners\u2019 clutches. However.... today\u2019s auction was for bonds of 3 to 7-years maturity, not the longer dated stuff. That auction is taking place tomorrow.... The US stock market has hit fresh record highs at the start of trading, despite the weak Empire manufacturing report. The Dow Jones industrial average, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq all ticked up to new all-time highs, expending last week\u2019s rally. A closely watched survey of US business confidence in the New York area has come in way below forecasts, giving us another reason to worry. The Empire Manufacturing index slumped to -4.21 this month, down from +0.55 in July. Economists had expected it to rise to 2.00; instead, firms in the area warned that work conditions have weakened. Remember Mark Carney\u2019s warning on 4 August that lenders had no excuses not to pass on the cut in interest rates to 0.25% to borrowers? Lloyds Banking Group has finally responded, saying it will pass on the full cut to all mortgage customers on its variable-rates deals. It\u2019s significant, as Lloyds is the largest lender in the country since the takeover of HBOS during the crisis. Here are the new rates: Halifax Homeowner Variable Rate \u20133.99% currently - falls to 3.74% as does the Halifax Standard Variable Rate and the Lloyds Bank Homeowner Variable Rate. This is thought to affect around a third of its 3 million mortgage customers. The bank, 9% owned by taxpayers, is also warning savers that they will take a hit. It is not immediately clear what the scale of the cut will be. The bank said. \u201cWe will not make any changes to our savings rates for existing customers until we have reduced our mortgage reversionary rates (Halifax Homeowner Variable Rate, Halifax Standard Variable Rate and Lloyds Bank Homeowner Variable Rate) with effect from 1 October 2016\u201d The pound is losing ground against the US dollar, as well as the euro. Sterling just hit a one-month low of $1.2883, as traders hunker down ahead of some crucial economic data that may show the impact of the Brexit vote. Tomorrow we get July\u2019s inflation report, followed by unemployment surveys on Wednesday and then July\u2019s retail sales figures on Thursday. Ana Thaker, Market Economist at PhillipCapital UK, explains why it matters: This week\u2019s data is a crucial set as it is some of the first to cover the entire month of July and take into account the full effect of Brexit on the UK economy. Sterling looks to have significant downside risk this week as hedge funds increase bearish bets on the currency in the futures market with contracts topping levels last seen in 1992. Whilst we cannot always rely on hedge funds to get it right, market sentiment has declined for Sterling and may do so further as more economic data is released. Good news for Sports Direct workers! The retail chain has coughed up \u00a31m in backpay for employees who received less than the minimum wage, due to its policy of compulsory searches after their shifts had finished. The payments, which could be worth \u00a31,000 each, follow a Guardian investigation into working practices at Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse - which also prompted a parliamentary investigation. Simon Goodley reports: The agreement, which is understood to have been struck between the union Unite, the retailer and HM Revenue &amp; Customs, includes workers directly employed by Sports Direct and staff hired through temporary employment agencies. Two agencies, The Best Connection and Transline, provide most of the 3,000 workers in the company\u2019s warehouse in Shirebrook, Derbyshire. Payments are expected to begin to be made from the end of this month. Those familiar with the deal, however, say that 1,700 Transline agency workers may initially receive half the back pay they are owed, because the agency is refusing to refund unpaid wages from before it took over contracts from a rival agency two years ago. More here: The prospect of fresh government action to stimulate economic growth has pushed global stocks higher. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has settled at a new 14-month high, while other European markets are at their best levels since the EU referendum. Only Japan is missing out on the rally, following its disappointing growth figures. The mood in the City is pretty quiet, frankly, as we\u2019re now deep into the August slowdown. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says that the prospect of yet more central bank action is pushing money into shares: The month of August typically exhibits the lowest volumes of the summer and given the fact that today marks assumption day across Europe, we are looking likely to see a more unpredictable day. With the Bank of England\u2019s recent QE programme, coupled with heightened expectations of action from the Bank of Japan, there is a clear underlying bullish sentiment for stocks, with investors favouring stocks in this low interest rate environment. The pound has slipped to a new three-year low against the euro this morning, as Brexit angst continues to weigh it down. Sterling fell to \u20ac1.1555 against the single currency, its lowest level since 2013. That means it has shed almost 12% since Britain voted to leave the EU - something for holidaymakers to ponder as they head over the Channel.... Apart from that, the foreign exchange markets are pretty quiet: Customers at banking giant Santander are waking up to the news that their 123 current account just became rather less lucrative. Santander has slashed the interest rate on the account to 1.5%, from 3%, following the Bank of England\u2019s decision to slash benchmark borrowing costs to 0.25%. Another small milestone for Germany\u2019s stock market: Back to Japan...and the disappointing news that its economy only expanded by a tiny 0.05% in the last quarter. Norio Miyagawa, senior economist at Mizuho Securities, says the Japanese economy is still troubled despite the best efforts of its government and central bank. \u201cConsumer spending is weak, and the reason is low wage gains. There is alot of uncertainty about overseas economies, and this is holding back capital expenditure. \u201cThe government has already announced a big stimulus package, so the next question is how the Bank of Japan will respond after its comprehensive policy review, which is sure tolead to a delay in its price target.\u201d Japan\u2019s economy looks a little better, though, if you consider nominal GDP (growth plus inflation). That shows that the economy is steadily clawing its way out of its deflationary swamp: UK borrowing costs are close to record lows this morning. The 10-year British gilt is changing hands at an interest rate of just 0.51%, a new alltime low, meaning the UK could borrow extremely cheaply for the next decade. Rupert Harrison, chief macro strategist at investment group BlackRock, has tweeted that this gives chancellor Philip Hammond the chance to borrow and spend more: Harrison, incidentally, is former chief of staff to ex-chancellor George Osborne.... The takeover battle raging in Britain\u2019s bookmaking industry has taken another twist this morning. William Hill has formally rejected a \u00a33.16bn bid filed by rivals 888 Holdings and Rank Group over the weekend, saying it \u201csubstantially undervalued\u201d its business. More here. Accountancy software firm Sage are usually too dull to catch our eye. But not today! Sage\u2019s shares have slumped by 4% this morning, after it fell victim to a security breach. The company admitted over the weekend than the personal details of workers at 280 British companies may have been compromised, after an internal login was used to gain unauthorised access to their data. European stock markets have opened calmly, as investors take the weak Japanese growth figures in their stride. (Alternatively, they\u2019re shattered after watching the Olympics all night). Either way, European markets are close to their highest levels in seven years. Here\u2019s the situation: The FTSE 100: up 5 points at 6920 Germany\u2019s DAX: up 12 points at 10,726 French CAC: up 3 points at 4,503. HSBC economist Jing Li has told his clients to expect new stimulus measures from China soon: \u201cIn light of persistent headwinds from the external sector, weak business sentiment, and a cooling property market, we believe that policymakers need to accelerate policy easing and reforms.\u201d In China, shares have hit a seven-month high as investors anticipate fresh government stimulus efforts. The benchmark Shanghai Composite index jumped by 2.5% today to close at 3,125. That level was last seen in early January, as world stock markets were hit by a global selloff. The rally is sparked by speculation that Beijing will take fresh steps to help its economy, after a raft of weak economic data. Last week, for example, we got disappointing trade, latest industrial production, retail sales and fixed asset investment data. Japan\u2019s economy minister, Nobuteru Ishihara, has warned that Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU threatens its recovery. Ishihara said (via Reuters): \u201cJapan\u2019s economy is likely to achieve a recovery driven by private demand\u201d though the government must be mindful of risks such as slowing emerging market growth and uncertainty over the fate of Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After a weekend of sporting excitement, we\u2019ve come down to earth this morning with the worrying news that Japan\u2019s economy stagnated in the last quarter. Japanese GDP was virtually unchanged in the three months between April and June, according to new data released overnight (just as Andy Murray was rounding off Super Sunday in style). Economists had expected growth of 0.2% during the quarter, following the +0.5% growth recorded in January-March. On an annualized basis (basically, multiplying the quarterly figure by 4) , GDP expanded by a meagre 0.2%, much worse than the 1.9% recorded three months ago. It suggests that prime minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s huge, three-pronged stimulus programme is failing to shake the country out of its long stretch of economic weakness: We\u2019ll be mopping up reaction to this data, along with other key events through the day. There\u2019s not much in the diary, though, apart from the US Empire Manufacturing survey at 1.30pm BST, plus financial results from UK housebuilder Bovis.",

                "bodyText":"The British public\u2019s confidence in the economy recovered in August as the country appeared to shrug off concerns that the Brexit vote would harm prospects for jobs and higher wages. The rebound in sentiment followed a slump in July as consumers fretted about the impact that leaving the EU would have on disposable incomes. Low earners and public sectors workers were the most pessimistic in the latest monthly survey, while the highest earners and private sector workers were the most confident about the outlook for their finances. Confidence measures are watched closely by economists, who say a drop can cause people to stop spending, which hurts the economy and stifles investment. Expectations for finances over the next 12 months picked up to 49.8 on the Markit household finances index in August, from 47.1 in July. Anything below 50 signals deterioration, so households believe the outlook is stable, but they are still feeling cautious. Jack Kennedy, a senior economist at the financial data provider, said that July represented a wobble following the Brexit vote. \u201cConcerns seem to have eased in line with the removal of some of the immediate political uncertainty arising from the shock referendum result, combined with a strong monetary policy response from the Bank of England aimed to cushion the economy and head off any lurch towards recession,\u201d he said. A counterpoint to Markit was provided by a survey from the pollster TNS, which found household confidence had fallen sharply since the vote to leave the EU, with 33% of Britons believing the economy has worsened compared with a year ago, up 11 percentage points from April. The snap poll of 1,199 people also showed that fewer expected to see a pay rise in the next 12 months and more thought the economy would fare worse over the next year. \u201cThe latest data suggests that confidence in the economy is back down at levels last seen in 2011/12, when the country [last flirted with] recession,\u201d said Luke Taylor, the head of social and political attitudes at TNS. Retail sales data on Thursday will provide the first official steer on how consumer demand has been affected by the unexpected result of the 23 June referendum, after other measures have painted a mixed picture. Major retailers including Tesco, Next and John Lewis say they have not been affected so far by the referendum result, and the British Retail Consortium said spending in shops bounced in July. A CBI survey of wholesalers and retailers, however, found that sales volumes declined more rapidly in July than at any time since January 2012, with weaker consumer confidence a likely factor in the immediate period following the referendum. The long-running GfK survey, Britain\u2019s main gauge of consumer morale and considered a reliable indicator of future household spending over the years, suffered its sharpest drop since 1990 last month.",

But the headline unemployment figure of 5.72% \u2013 the lowest in almost three years \u2013 masked the growing trend towards part-time working as the economy transitions from the investment-driven mining boom to a service-focused base. Full-time employment actually fell by 45,400 jobs in July, while the number of part-time jobs was up by 71,600. The participation rate, which refers to the number of people either employed or actively looking for work, was flat at 64.9%. The data also shows that 72,000 new jobs were created in the first seven months of 2016, compared with more than 150,000 in the same period last year. Full-time job creation has gone into reverse in that time by almost 65,000 compared with jobs growth of almost 90,000 in the same period last year. Savanth Sebastian, an economist at CommSec, also noted a slowdown in new jobs being advertised earlier this year, adding that the uncertainty caused by the lengthy federal election campaign could have had a dampening effect on hiring. \u201cThe softer results across the labour market mirror other indicators across the economy, including retail sales,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that the sluggish first half of 2016 resulted in employers managing their major cost base (employees) more carefully. \u201cThe hope would be that now the election is out of the way consumers and businesses will go back to spending, investing and hiring \u2013 particularly given the ultra-low interest rates on offer and significant improvements in the household budget.\u201d In Western Australia, where the jobless rate of 6.3% is the second highest in the country behind South Australia, employment minister Michaelia Cash tried to put some positive spin on the growth in part-time jobs. \u201cI\u2019m not going to demonise part-time employment. I\u2019m going to support it and applaud it because it does represent a good choice for so many people.\u201d Labor\u2019s employment spokesman Brendan O\u2019Connor said almost one in 10 Australians were looking for more work but could not find it.",

It said there had been a surge in \u201cclose-in bookings\u201d \u2013 those made six weeks before flying \u2013 from southern European travellers heading to Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds and Scotland, as well as the capital.<br></p> <p>\u201cFor so long it has been, \u2018I love going to London but it\u2019s so expensive.\u2019 Now it\u2019s so much cheaper, we\u2019ve seen a big increase in short-term bookings to London and regional UK,\u201d said Kenny Jacobs, Ryanair\u2019s chief marketing officer.<br></p> <p>However, Ryanair\u2019s biggest increase in business has come from Americans and Chinese flying to Europe and then using its network to come to Britain and shop. \u201cWe are carrying 20% more Americans this summer, and have seen a 10% increase in the number of Chinese coming into places such as Rome and Berlin, then using Ryanair to get around Europe. It is absolutely linked to the weakness of sterling.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"496ed06d557edf1928f4b6bc9455228b827927b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/496ed06d557edf1928f4b6bc9455228b827927b4/0_133_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tourists in London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tourists are flocking to the UK.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Taylor/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to this week\u2019s official retail sales data, purchases of watches and jewellery were up 16.6% on the year, a rise largely attributed to foreign buyers. For European and Chinese visitors, prices in British stores are now roughly 18% and 13% below mid-August 2015. For Americans it is around 16%, while for Australians everything is now a fifth cheaper.</p> <p>Meanwhile, CAISSA Touristic, one of China\u2019s leading tour operators, said that over the past two months it had seen a 20% increase in inquiries and bookings involving travel to the UK.<br></p> <h2>British tourists abroad</h2> <p>The weak pound has added hundreds of pounds to the cost of many people\u2019s summer holidays. According to M&amp;S Bank, the typical cost of a one-week overseas summer holiday for a family of four, including flights, accommodation, meals and spending money, had risen by \u00a3429 compared to last year due to the fall in sterling.</p> <p>In Sorrento in southern Italy, the typical cost of a three-course evening meal for a British family of four, including a bottle of wine and soft drinks, has effectively risen by 22% in a year, with the bill around \u00a386 this year compared with just under \u00a371 a year ago, based on recent exchange rates. Corfu in Greece has recorded a similar percentage rise \u2013 from around \u00a342 to \u00a352.<br></p> <h2><br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3639a6b9413cb376e626d0c2db255928bac57f56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3639a6b9413cb376e626d0c2db255928bac57f56/0_132_4500_2699/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Playa De Levante beach in Benidorm\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Playa De Levante beach in Benidorm.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, the typical cost of a glass of wine in a Sorrento bar has effectively leapt 53% in a year, from \u00a31.41 (\u20ac2) in August 2015 to \u00a32.16 (\u20ac2.50). These figures were provided by Post Office Travel Money, which publishes an annual family holiday report. It said bars and restaurants in several of the resorts surveyed had cut their prices to attract tourists.</p> <h2>The staycation</h2> <p>Are the British swapping the Balearic Islands for the Isle of Wight? According to tourist authorities on the Isle of Wight, there has been a \u201cvery significant leap\u201d in its website traffic, while Visit East Anglia said its enquiries had risen by a quarter. </p> <p>But talk of a staycation boom may be premature.

                "bodyText":"The dramatic slide in sterling since the Brexit vote has given British holidaymakers enough pain already. But there was a further shock in store this week after some airports offered less than \u20ac1 to \u00a31 at two major airports. At Stansted and Luton, travellers found they could not even exchange \u00a31 for \u20ac1, which at least prepared them for the financial squeeze at their destinations. Those holidaying in Europe are finding that meals, coffees, drinks and other items are typically at least 22% more expensive than a year ago. There has, however, been a benefit for the British economy. On Thursday, official data showed that retail sales leapt 1.4% in July following a drop in June \u2013 apparently helped by an influx of big-spending overseas tourists from the likes of the US, China and Hong Kong. Here are some of the consequences of the pound\u2019s slump against the euro. Foreign visitors to the UK It\u2019s not just London experiencing a surge in visitors exploiting the cheap pound, according to Ryanair. It said there had been a surge in \u201cclose-in bookings\u201d \u2013 those made six weeks before flying \u2013 from southern European travellers heading to Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds and Scotland, as well as the capital. \u201cFor so long it has been, \u2018I love going to London but it\u2019s so expensive.\u2019 Now it\u2019s so much cheaper, we\u2019ve seen a big increase in short-term bookings to London and regional UK,\u201d said Kenny Jacobs, Ryanair\u2019s chief marketing officer. However, Ryanair\u2019s biggest increase in business has come from Americans and Chinese flying to Europe and then using its network to come to Britain and shop. \u201cWe are carrying 20% more Americans this summer, and have seen a 10% increase in the number of Chinese coming into places such as Rome and Berlin, then using Ryanair to get around Europe. It is absolutely linked to the weakness of sterling.\u201d According to this week\u2019s official retail sales data, purchases of watches and jewellery were up 16.6% on the year, a rise largely attributed to foreign buyers. For European and Chinese visitors, prices in British stores are now roughly 18% and 13% below mid-August 2015. For Americans it is around 16%, while for Australians everything is now a fifth cheaper. Meanwhile, CAISSA Touristic, one of China\u2019s leading tour operators, said that over the past two months it had seen a 20% increase in inquiries and bookings involving travel to the UK. British tourists abroad The weak pound has added hundreds of pounds to the cost of many people\u2019s summer holidays. According to M&amp;S Bank, the typical cost of a one-week overseas summer holiday for a family of four, including flights, accommodation, meals and spending money, had risen by \u00a3429 compared to last year due to the fall in sterling. In Sorrento in southern Italy, the typical cost of a three-course evening meal for a British family of four, including a bottle of wine and soft drinks, has effectively risen by 22% in a year, with the bill around \u00a386 this year compared with just under \u00a371 a year ago, based on recent exchange rates. Corfu in Greece has recorded a similar percentage rise \u2013 from around \u00a342 to \u00a352. Meanwhile, the typical cost of a glass of wine in a Sorrento bar has effectively leapt 53% in a year, from \u00a31.41 (\u20ac2) in August 2015 to \u00a32.16 (\u20ac2.50). These figures were provided by Post Office Travel Money, which publishes an annual family holiday report. It said bars and restaurants in several of the resorts surveyed had cut their prices to attract tourists. The staycation Are the British swapping the Balearic Islands for the Isle of Wight? According to tourist authorities on the Isle of Wight, there has been a \u201cvery significant leap\u201d in its website traffic, while Visit East Anglia said its enquiries had risen by a quarter. But talk of a staycation boom may be premature. Ryanair said that it carried a record number of British holidaymakers to Europe in July, the first full month after the referendum. \u201cYou are still getting a pint of lager for \u00a31 in parts of Spain and Portugal, while you\u2019ll struggle to find it anywhere under \u00a32.50 in Britain,\u201d said Jacobs at Ryanair. \u201cWhen people like Nigel Farage say that Brexit will encourage Brits to holiday at home, he\u2019s talking absolute nonsense.

He says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In simple terms, HM is \u201cmonetary financing of fiscal spending\u201d, a central bank who prints money for its government to spend; a practice definitely not included in the Bundesbank\u2019s instruction manual. However, we should keep an open mind after all - Mario Draghi sees it as a \u201cvery interesting concept\u201d and Loretta Mester from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland considers it a possible \u201cnext step if \u2026 we wanted to be more accommodative\u201d.</p> <p>It is therefore important that we analyse, in simple terms, how HM could work. The first step would be to assess whether this type of monetary financing is allowed under current laws and regulations. In most jurisdictions, rules exist and limit the actions of a central bank.</p> <p>Examples include Article 123 of the Treaty of Lisbon (EU), Article 5 of the Fiscal Act (Japan) and the Treasury Fed Accord of 1951 (US). However, loopholes and safe harbour clauses are easy to identify as most central banks are allowed to do \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 to fulfil their mandate. </p> <p>In practice, the central bank would deliver money to the treasury by receiving a meaningless asset (i.e. a zero coupon perpetual bond) in exchange, or \u2013 preferably - without any quid pro quo agreement. In either case, there would be no planned reimbursement for the sums extended. It is important that \u2013 at least for some time \u2013 this money creation is seen as permanent and irreversible, to avoid creating fears of challenging times ahead, and the associated desire to save, not spend or invest. </p> <p>The more orthodox central bankers have nothing to fear as they would be in the driving seat.

These are anaemic aggregate demand, persistence of excess supply and a growing social inequality. Any HM initiative must be dedicated to projects that aim to cure these.</p> <p>It should help the majority of households by increasing their welfare and enhancing their disposable income, fostering confidence and promoting consumer spending, in order to benefit the majority of the population rather than enrich asset-holders by inflating financial asset prices. There could also be spending on long-term themes like education, and on structural issues strangling the economy, such as the banking\u2019s sector non-performing assets. </p> <p>We need a fiscal plan that aims to generate real prosperity without incurring public indebtedness, or offsetting its benefits with fears of a gloomier future in which debts must be repaid. It should also attempt to create inflation expectations, and trigger higher interest rates. While higher borrowing costs would mean weaker businesses would not survive, the profitability of the banking sector would be enhanced and insurance companies would receive crucial support. Perhaps, this policy could also lower the liabilities of defined benefit pension funds. Ultimately, inflation is the only solution to today\u2019s global debt problem. Some inflation would reduce the real value of the accumulated debt.</p> <p>All this considered, the question is how much money should be created and spent? The calibration of an HM policy would be much easier than that of QE. While QE relies on an uncertain transmission mechanism, whether banks will lend more or hoard the additional cash, the multiplier effect of HM is easier to forecast. </p> <p>Only once the growth and inflation objectives are reached, would an exit policy be publicly discussed.

July is usually the second highest month for receipts during the financial year, reflecting the timing of corporation tax and self-assessment (SA) payments.<br></p> <p>2) The underlying reason for the slightly smaller surplus than last year was that the 2.2 per cent growth in central government accrued receipts (excluding APF transfers) was slower than the 4.2 per cent growth in central government spending (excluding grants to local authorities). <strong>The rise in central government spending mostly reflected growth in departmental spending</strong>. Growth in central government receipts was depressed by weak income tax receipts, although this partly reflects timing effects as the first self-assessment (SA) payment deadline fell on a weekend this year.<br></p> <p>3) <strong>Meeting our March <em>EFO</em> forecast for PSNB in 2016-17 would require it to fall by \u00a319.8 billion over the full financial year. A third of the way through the financial year, PSNB was only \u00a33.0 billion lower than last year.</strong> While prospects for the rest of the year are subject to greater uncertainty than usual due to the result of the EU referendum, it is still worth noting that receipts and spending data are volatile from month to month and prone to revision, especially at this relatively early stage of the year.<br></p> <p>4) <strong>However, despite these timing effects, there is still evidence that growth in PAYE, NICs and stamp duty land tax (SDLT) was slower in the first four months of the year than would be required to meet our March forecast for the year as a whole.</strong> July\u2019s data cover the first full month since the UK\u2019s referendum on membership of the EU, but a very substantial proportion of the data in this month\u2019s release is either a forecast or still reflects economic activity prior to the referendum.

That would indicate that the economy was motoring along pretty well.</p> <p>A poor reading, though, might reignite concerns that growth is slowing - despite the moderate price pressures, low unemployment and strong consumer spending reported this week.</p> <p>And a quick truffle through this morning\u2019s research notes show that analysts are a little concerned.</p> <p>Paul Hollingsworth of Capital Economics expects to be underwhelmed:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The first post-referendum set of public borrowing figures look set to be disappointing.

The Baker Hughes weekly report showed 10 rigs were added in all, taking the total to 491 and marking the eighth weekly increase in a row. All of them were oil rigs with no gas rigs added. The crude price, which was at eight week highs earlier in the week on hopes of a deal next month to freeze output, is hovering in negative territory following the figures. Brent crude is down 0.49% at $50.64 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - has slipped lower and is off 0.06% at $48.19. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the week. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back on Monday. Heading into the weekend, the uncertainty over when the US Federal Reserve could raise interest rates has made for a cautious end to the trading week. Dovish minutes on Wednesday suggested a rate hike was off the table in the near future but subsequent comments from Fed members seemed to indicate otherwise. With oil slipping back from its recent highs, markets came under pressure again, although the August lull has meant trading volumes are thin. The final scores showed: The FTSe 100 finished down 10.01 points or 0.15% at 6858.95, with the index recording its worst weekly performance since mid-June Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.55% to 10,544.36 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.82% lower at 4400.52 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 2.18% to 16,310.06 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 1.16% at 8450.6 In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.91% to 561.32 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 24 points or 0.13% lower. And here comes the denial: A Bloomberg report suggesting that the UK government wants to trigger Article 50 - the start of the two year Brexit process - by next April has sent the pound lower. Up until now, the UK was expected to delay Article 50 until at least the end of next year. ETX Capital said: Big sell-off in sterling this afternoon amid rumours the UK wants to invoke Article 50 in the first half of 2017. Cable is down more than 1% and flirting with the $1.30 level again after a report said Theresa May would like to start the exit process before French and German elections next year. That means invoking Article 50 by April, putting paid to speculation that the UK would have several years to prepare to leave the EU. The less time the UK has to get things in order, the greater the market fears the fallout. But sterling is still on course to end the week higher, having enjoyed solid gains on much stronger-than-expected retail sales yesterday, which suggests consumers at least are not downcast. The pound is currently down 0.9% at $1.3052 and 0.6% lower against the euro at $1.1521. As expected, US markets have followed the trend elsewhere, slipping back in early trading on talk of the Federal Reserve perhaps hiking rates sooner than had been expected. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 94 points or 0.5% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both opened around 0.2% lower. Earlier this week there were protests outside the Bank of England against its quantitative easing programme, with calls for different measures to be used. One such is so-called helicopter money, and one supporter of the idea is Marino Valensise, head of the multi asset and income at Barings. He says: In simple terms, HM is \u201cmonetary financing of fiscal spending\u201d, a central bank who prints money for its government to spend; a practice definitely not included in the Bundesbank\u2019s instruction manual. However, we should keep an open mind after all - Mario Draghi sees it as a \u201cvery interesting concept\u201d and Loretta Mester from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland considers it a possible \u201cnext step if \u2026 we wanted to be more accommodative\u201d. It is therefore important that we analyse, in simple terms, how HM could work. The first step would be to assess whether this type of monetary financing is allowed under current laws and regulations. In most jurisdictions, rules exist and limit the actions of a central bank. Examples include Article 123 of the Treaty of Lisbon (EU), Article 5 of the Fiscal Act (Japan) and the Treasury Fed Accord of 1951 (US). However, loopholes and safe harbour clauses are easy to identify as most central banks are allowed to do \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 to fulfil their mandate. In practice, the central bank would deliver money to the treasury by receiving a meaningless asset (i.e. a zero coupon perpetual bond) in exchange, or \u2013 preferably - without any quid pro quo agreement. In either case, there would be no planned reimbursement for the sums extended. It is important that \u2013 at least for some time \u2013 this money creation is seen as permanent and irreversible, to avoid creating fears of challenging times ahead, and the associated desire to save, not spend or invest. The more orthodox central bankers have nothing to fear as they would be in the driving seat. They would have the power to impose conditions and participate in the decision-making process of how this money should be spent. In addition to ageing demographics in a number of key economic areas, there are three issues today that should be tackled. These are anaemic aggregate demand, persistence of excess supply and a growing social inequality. Any HM initiative must be dedicated to projects that aim to cure these. It should help the majority of households by increasing their welfare and enhancing their disposable income, fostering confidence and promoting consumer spending, in order to benefit the majority of the population rather than enrich asset-holders by inflating financial asset prices. There could also be spending on long-term themes like education, and on structural issues strangling the economy, such as the banking\u2019s sector non-performing assets. We need a fiscal plan that aims to generate real prosperity without incurring public indebtedness, or offsetting its benefits with fears of a gloomier future in which debts must be repaid. It should also attempt to create inflation expectations, and trigger higher interest rates. While higher borrowing costs would mean weaker businesses would not survive, the profitability of the banking sector would be enhanced and insurance companies would receive crucial support. Perhaps, this policy could also lower the liabilities of defined benefit pension funds. Ultimately, inflation is the only solution to today\u2019s global debt problem. Some inflation would reduce the real value of the accumulated debt. All this considered, the question is how much money should be created and spent? The calibration of an HM policy would be much easier than that of QE. While QE relies on an uncertain transmission mechanism, whether banks will lend more or hoard the additional cash, the multiplier effect of HM is easier to forecast. Only once the growth and inflation objectives are reached, would an exit policy be publicly discussed. Any overheating would be controlled by fiscal and monetary measures. He concludes: I believe that HM is superior to QE, and much better suited to our current challenges. It represents a pragmatic and superior alternative to any other policy, although it cannot be a panacea for structural issues such as poor demographics. In a heavily indebted world, suffering from low economic growth and facing serious political issues originating from inequality, HM has the potential to outperform any other policy. We must consider it now, or be forced to implement it in a hurry when the next economic recession hits. Ahead of the US open, European markets are in negative territory as investors shy away from shares on renewed talk of a possible US interest rate rise after some hawkish comments from Federal Reserve board members. The Stoxx 600 is down around 0.7%, heading for its biggest weekly loss since the middle of June. Earlier in the week the index hit a seven week high, but such volatility is typical of summer markets with light volumes. Meanwhile Germany\u2019s Dax has dropped 0.39% and France\u2019s Cac is down 0.86%. The FTSE 100 is virtually flat, however, down just 0.09% although it too is on track for its biggest weekly fall since mid-June. Oil remains above $50 a barrel although it has slipped back from recent highs, with Brent crude down 0.5% at $50.63. Sterling is fairly flat against the dollar at $1.3078 but is down 0.34% against the euro at \u20ac1.1557. Several hours ago, I promised fresh news about the economic crisis in Mongolia (we\u2019re a broad church in the liveblog). And S&amp;P have stepped up (ahem) by downgrading Mongolia\u2019s credit-rating from B to B-. That\u2019s deep into \u2018junk\u2019 territory, and just five notches above default. The credit rating agency also slashed its growth forecast in 2016 to 1.3%, down from 2.6%. It says: Our lower growth estimate stems partly from the ancillary effects of Mongolia\u2019s weaker terms of trade and partly from the country\u2019s mixed mining policies, which discouraged foreign direct investment. Another key deteriorating risk factor for Mongolia relates to its public finances. Mongolia has been hit hard by China\u2019s slowing economy, which eroded demand for its natural resources. That has left Mongolia short of foreign currency reserves, and pushed its deficit up. The country\u2019s new finance minister warned of a \u201cdeep economic crisis\u201d last week, which could leave it unable to pay civil servants\u2019 salaries. The Mongolian currency, the togrog, has been sliding in value ever since, forcing Mongolia\u2019s central bank to hike interest rates by 4.5% (!) yesterday, to 15%. Mongolia hasn\u2019t been a world power for centuries, so it\u2019s not too surprising that this crisis has slipped under the radar. But it\u2019s still worth taking seriously. Bloomberg have done a great piece on Mongolia\u2019s problems - here\u2019s a flavour: Mongolia, a mineral-rich and landlocked $12 billion economy bordering Russia and China, is staring at a full-blown balance of payments crisis. It\u2019s caused barely a ripple in global financial markets, but the nation\u2019s economic meltdown offers instructive lessons to far bigger resource-reliant economies like Brazil, Venezuela, Russia and Saudi Arabia. This is an economy that gives new meaning to what economists call the resource curse. An overabundance of natural resources can result in lopsided economic growth, government waste and boom-bust cycles that can leave a country\u2019s finances in tatters. \u201cMongolia should be much richer than it is,\u201d said Lutz Roehmeyer, a money manager at Landesbank Berlin Investment who helps oversee about $12 billion of investments including local-currency Mongolian debt. \u201cThere is nowhere else in the world where it is so easy to dig up resources without any problems and sell the commodities to China with such low transportation costs.\u201d Britain\u2019s independent fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, has warned that the government is on track to overshoot its borrowing targets in 2016-17. The OBR is concerned that tax receipt growths have slowed this year, pulling July\u2019s surplus down to only \u00a31bn. Unless that changes, Britain would fail to cut the deficit to \u00a355.5bn this financial year (from \u00a375.3bn), it fears. Here\u2019s the OBR\u2019s official response to today\u2019s figures (i\u2019ve bolded the key points): 1) Public sector net borrowing (PSNB) recorded a surplus of \u00a31.0 billion in July, a \u00a30.2 billion deterioration on last year\u2019s surplus. The surplus was \u00a30.9 billion below market expectations. July is usually the second highest month for receipts during the financial year, reflecting the timing of corporation tax and self-assessment (SA) payments. 2) The underlying reason for the slightly smaller surplus than last year was that the 2.2 per cent growth in central government accrued receipts (excluding APF transfers) was slower than the 4.2 per cent growth in central government spending (excluding grants to local authorities). The rise in central government spending mostly reflected growth in departmental spending. Growth in central government receipts was depressed by weak income tax receipts, although this partly reflects timing effects as the first self-assessment (SA) payment deadline fell on a weekend this year. 3) Meeting our March EFO forecast for PSNB in 2016-17 would require it to fall by \u00a319.8 billion over the full financial year. A third of the way through the financial year, PSNB was only \u00a33.0 billion lower than last year. While prospects for the rest of the year are subject to greater uncertainty than usual due to the result of the EU referendum, it is still worth noting that receipts and spending data are volatile from month to month and prone to revision, especially at this relatively early stage of the year. 4) However, despite these timing effects, there is still evidence that growth in PAYE, NICs and stamp duty land tax (SDLT) was slower in the first four months of the year than would be required to meet our March forecast for the year as a whole. July\u2019s data cover the first full month since the UK\u2019s referendum on membership of the EU, but a very substantial proportion of the data in this month\u2019s release is either a forecast or still reflects economic activity prior to the referendum. That means there is still little firm evidence on how the referendum result might affect the public finances this year. More here. The pound has dropped by half a cent against the US dollar so far today, to $1.312. But even so, sterling has still gained 1.6%, or two cents, this week. The pound has rallied as new inflation, unemployment and retail sales figures all came in stronger than expected, easing fears of an immediate slump following the Brexit vote. Here\u2019s our new Boom or Doom round-up of the week\u2019s economic data: In other news, Britain\u2019 s housing market seemed to cool last month, with estate agents seeing fewer potential buyers.... John McDonnell MP, Shadow Chancellor, is concerned that Britain\u2019s \u00a31bn surplus in July is smaller than a year ago. He says: Today\u2019s public finances show a budget surplus that has fallen compared to this time last year. And the Treasury\u2019s own comparisons of independent economic forecasts show a dramatic revision downwards in growth and upwards in inflation, unemployment and public sector net borrowing. McDonnell argues that the government should be urgently revising its fiscal plans, rather than leaving us all in suspense until the autumn statement: The UK economy needs immediate investment from the Government, rather than sticking to the failed policies of George Osborne which have helped create the problem. Britain is on hold waiting for Philip Hammond to tell us whether he will stick to his predecessor\u2019s planned cuts to investment, and firms and households can\u2019t wait until the autumn to find out. \u201cThe country needs a different plan that will end austerity, and start to invest in the infrastructure and housing a 21st century economy demands. That\u2019s why Labour would invest \u00a3500 billion to rebuild and transform our economy.\u201d Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics has crunched today\u2019s public finance numbers, and concluded that the government is on track to miss its borrowing target for 2016-17. Here\u2019s his workings out: He reckons this will give Philip Hammond little wriggle room (unless he abandons deficit reduction altogether, I guess) \u201cJuly\u2019s relatively small surplus means that the Chancellor will be able to put together only a modest package of measures to support the economy in the Autumn Statement later this year.\u201d Chancellor Philip Hammond will be \u201cslightly disappointed\u201d that July\u2019s surplus dipped to just below \u00a31bn, from \u00a31.2bn in July 2015, reckons Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight. July usually sees a surplus in the public finances as it is a key month for tax receipts). While the public finances are expected to be increasingly pressurized by the Brexit vote going forward, it was premature for there to have been much impact in July. However, the ONS did indicate that the July figures included forecasts and the data can also be influenced by different timings of tax payments. George Osborne has put down his gun and turned to Twitter: And here it is... Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, isn\u2019t terribly impressed by today\u2019s numbers: \u201cJuly\u2019s surplus was smaller than the \u00a31.2bn surplus recorded in July 2015 and left public borrowing in the fiscal year to date at \u00a323.7bn, only 11.3% lower than the \u00a326.7bn seen in the same period in 2015-16. This compares with the OBR\u2019s Budget forecast of a 26.3% drop in borrowing for 2016-17 as a whole. That forecast will be history, though, though, if Philip Hammond tears up gun-totin\u2019 George Osborne\u2019s fiscal strategy..... Here\u2019s Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, on today\u2019s public finance data: \u2018July is normally one of the bumper months for tax receipts, because HMRC gets a lot of payments of income tax from self-employed people, and also quarterly corporation tax payments from companies, which is why the government found itself quids in last month. Of course the elephant in the room is Brexit, and what effect this will have on tax receipts going forward, but so far the hard economic data has actually been pretty robust, though it\u2019s obviously very early days. Laith adds that chancellor Philip Hammond may tear up the government\u2019s austerity programme in the autumn statement: That could well see previous borrowing targets thrown out of the window, if the new government decides supporting the economy is more important than keeping a lid on debt.\u2019 PwC chief economist John Hawksworth has cast his expert eye over Britain\u2019s public finances, and concluded that they\u2019re not too shabby. \u201cThe public finances were in surplus by \u00a31 billion in July, which is a reasonable performance albeit slightly down on the \u00a31.2 billion budget surplus recorded in July 2015. \u201cFor the four months to July, the cumulative budget deficit in this financial year is running around \u00a33 billion lower than in the same period last year, though the rate of deficit reduction has been slower than the OBR forecast back in March. But while there\u2019s no immediate sign of a Brexit shock, the full impact of June\u2019s referendum won\u2019t be seen for some time (as ONS chief economist Joe Grice also warned this morning). Hawksworth explains: \u201cOverall, as with other official data released this week for retail sales and the unemployment claimant count, there is no real sign yet of a downturn in economic fortunes following the Brexit vote. But it will be some months before we get a clearer picture of this as it will take time for companies to adjust their investment and hiring plans to the new post-referendum environment.\u201d The Chief Secretary to the Treasury, David Gauke, says today\u2019s public finances show Britain is in good shape to handle the aftermath of the EU referendum vote. Here\u2019s his official statement: \u201cWith the public finances in surplus in July, our economy starts from a position of strength to face any economic turbulence following the vote to leave the EU. \u201cAs we keep working to cut the deficit, we are well-placed to handle any challenges and seize the opportunities as our economy adjusts. We are determined to build on our economic strengths to ensure Britain is a country that works for everyone.\u201d Correction: The UK national debt is \u00a31.6 TRILLION, of course, not \u00a31.6bn. Apologies, and thanks to those of you who kindly pointed it out. #grauniad. July\u2019s \u00a31bn surplus won\u2019t make much of a dent in Britain\u2019s national debt. The UK now owes \u00a31.6 trillion  to investors, which equates to 82.9% of GDP (the value of all the goods and services currently produced by the UK economy in a year). But the national debt does seem to be levelling out, as a percentage of GDP. Fraser Munro, public sector finance statistician at the ONS, is tweeting the key points from today\u2019s data. This chart shows how the UK has borrowed less this year, than in 2015-2016. More details: Anyone looking for evidence of Brexit vote impact in today\u2019s report should tread cautiously, says the ONS, as the figures could easily be revised in future. The data presented in this bulletin presents the latest fiscal position of the public sector as at 31 July 2016 and so includes the first post-EU referendum data. However, estimates for the latest period always contain a substantial forecast element and so any post-referendum impact may not become clear for some time. The BBC\u2019s Joe Lynam reminds us that July\u2019s public finances are usually decent, as firms often pay their quarterly corporation tax bills. Breaking: Britain ran a surplus of \u00a31bn in July, thanks to a pick-up in corporation tax receipts. That\u2019s less than some analysts had expected. But this means that so far this financial year, UK has borrowed \u00a33bn less than a year ago, suggesting that the government\u2019s deficit-reduction plan may still be on course. The Public sector net borrowing requirement in July came in at minus \u00a31.472bn last month, the Office for National Statistics reports. Excluding the impact of state-owned banks, and the surplus shrinks to \u00a3977m. Corporation tax receipts were the strongest for any July since 2011, the ONS adds. And this means that Britain has borrowed \u00a323.7bn since the start of the financial year in April, which is the smallest deficit since the financial crisis. More here: Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit agrees with Joe Grice.... Today\u2019s public finances will show whether the UK government is still on track to hit its deficit targets for this financial year. Former chancellor George Osborne has his mind on other issues, though \u2013 he\u2019s been spied blasting a machine gun at a former Viet Cong base near Ho Chi Minh city. Probably less dangerous than inflicting his threatened punishment budget on the UK.... A lacklustre start to trading has seen London\u2019s FTSE 100 index drop by 17 points, or 0.24%, to 6852 points. But budget airline easyJet is defying the selloff. Its shares have jumped by 2.6% to the top of the Footsie leaderboard. The Times\u2019s Dominic Walsh has heard some chatter about a possible takeover, but it sounds pretty speculative. And in a quiet summer, it doesn\u2019t take much to move shares. So we shall see.... Oil has hit its highest level since the EU referendum, driven by ongoing speculation that producers could reach some kind of deal soon. Brent hit $51.22 per barrel, an eight-week high, putting it on track for its eighth day in a row. Traders are calculating that the OPEC cartel might agree some measures to shore up the oil price, when they meet in Algeria in September The Telegraph\u2019s Tara Cunningham flags up that oil has now gained 22% since August 2, putting it in a Bull Market again. Quite a turnaround in two weeks.... This was billed as the week when Britain would discover the economic pain caused by the Brexit vote. And the patient looks to be in better health than some experts had feared. So far, we\u2019ve learned that: Inflation: rose to 0.6% in July from 0.5%, but with no evidence of a Brexit effect Unemployment: A welcome fall in the claimant count in July, while the jobless rate remained at 4.9% in April-June Retail Sales: Smashed expectations in July, with a 1.4% jump So can we put fears of a Brexit recession to bed? Not according to Joe Grice, the chief economist of the Office for National Statistics. Speaking on Bloomberg TV this morning, Grice explained that it\u2019s too early to really know the impact of the EU referendum vote. For example, the labour market report shows that Brexit uncertainty in the run-up to the referendum didn\u2019t hurt the economy much, but doesn\u2019t really show the impact of the vote. The 1.4% jump in July retail sales, though, is \u201chard\u201d evidence of what\u2019s happening in the real economy. All retail sectors did well, especially department stores and clothing shops. But.... They don\u2019t tell us anything about what businesses were doing, they don\u2019t say anything about trade.....but they do say that consumers were spending strongly. That suggests that fears of a \u201ccatastrophic fall in consumer confidence\u201d immediately after the referendum can be crossed off, as it hasn\u2019t happened, Grice adds. But still.... Does that mean there won\u2019t be a recession? No. The story is still to unfold. More details here. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After a week of largely encouraging economic data from Britain, there\u2019s still one important measure before we can clock off for the weekend - July\u2019s UK public finances. Due at 9.30am, this will show whether the British government had to borrow from international investors to balance the books in the weeks after the EU referendum. July is usually a good month for tax receipts, so the City is hoping that Westminster may actually have run a surplus - of perhaps \u00a32.2bn. That would indicate that the economy was motoring along pretty well. A poor reading, though, might reignite concerns that growth is slowing - despite the moderate price pressures, low unemployment and strong consumer spending reported this week. And a quick truffle through this morning\u2019s research notes show that analysts are a little concerned. Paul Hollingsworth of Capital Economics expects to be underwhelmed: The first post-referendum set of public borrowing figures look set to be disappointing. We have pencilled in a surplus of \u00a31bn in July, marginally lower than a year ago. And the team at RBS Capital Markets fears Britain may actually have run up a deficit in July: July is seasonally a good month for tax receipts with a second wave of self-assessment tax payments, quarterly corporation tax instalments and the first of three payments through the year by oil and gas firms. The OBR has said it planned for modest tax receipts from those oil and gas companies on the back of weak commodity prices. Our simple arithmetic process points to a surplus on the government budget of \u00a31bn for July, but in light of modest expectations for those tax receipts and poor outturns in earlier months of this financial year the risk is for a smaller surplus or possibly even a deficit. There\u2019s not much else on the agenda today, but we\u2019ll keep an eye on the oil price, and a nasty economic crisis unfolding in Mongolia (more on that shortly....) And in the absence of much news, European stock markets are expected to be pretty flat...",

                "body":"<p>Athletes know all about productivity. Their lives are spent eking out improvements in performance through new training methods, better diets and learning from their rivals. A personal best is productivity writ large: doing better this year than you did last.</p> <p>Sometimes progress is dramatic. The Olympic record in the long jump set by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDTNFhiQ8ig\">Jesse Owens </a>in Berlin in 1936 lasted for 24 years. Eight years later there was another big advance. Nobody has managed to beat the Olympic-best of 8.90 metres managed by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEt_Xgg8dzc\">Bob Beamon </a>in Mexico City. This year\u2019s victor in Rio, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWX2LdlxsQ\">Jeff Henderson</a>, won with a jump more than a half a metre off Beamon\u2019s record.</p> <p>More often, gains are slow and incremental. Athletes run a few hundredths of a second faster, throw the hammer, the shot or the javelin a few centimetres further. New technology often plays a part: it has only been possible to break the six-metre barrier in the pole vault because carbon-fibre poles are more flexible and less likely to break.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the murkier side of sport. Productivity improvements are not always just the result of pumping more iron and pounding round the track: they can be achieved by the use of performance-enhancing drugs. It is notable that progress in many events has stalled since testing regimes have been tightened up.</p> <p>The limitations of the human body may mean that it will prove impossible to run 100 metres in less than nine seconds or long jump more than 10 metres. Productivity gains will become slower and slower until they stop altogether. Ultimately, though, it doesn\u2019t really matter that Henderson was unable to beat Beamon\u2019s (altitude-assisted) record. All he needed to do was beat the rest of the field in Rio. Seeing the medals decided in the sixth and final round was still gripping viewing.</p> <p>It matters a lot more that the US, Henderson\u2019s country, saw productivity not just slow but actually fall over the past year. What this means is that output per worker in 2016 is lower than it was in 2015: the world\u2019s biggest economy became less effective at producing goods and services. Falling productivity means Americans are seeing their living standards decline. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/18/uk-productivity-gap-widens-to-worst-level-since-records-began\">The UK\u2019s recent productivity performance has been almost as dismal</a>: output per worker grew by 0.2% in the latest 12-month period, well down on its pre-financial crisis trend of 2.3%.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2016/aug/16/why-are-uk-workers-so-unproductive\">Why are UK workers so unproductive?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Historically, just as with Owens and Beamon in the long jump, there are sometimes big leaps forward. Technological advances such as the printing press, the steam engine and the internal combustion engine change societies radically and can act as the catalyst for faster productivity growth. Yet, in the decades between these paradigm shifts, progress is more incremental.</p> <p>Michael Pearce, global economist at Capital Economics says the rate of productivity growth has been slowing in advanced countries almost continuously since the 1960s. \u201cThere are plenty of possible reasons for this, including the fading boost to productivity from previous waves of innovation, the diminishing gains from further economic integration, and the shift of global activity away from manufacturing and towards services.\u201d</p> <p>The postwar period experienced a rapid spurt in productivity. In part, that was because it took time to fully exploit the technological advances of the late 19th and early 20th century. That was particularly true of Europe and Japan, where slow growth during the 1930s and the devastating impact of the second world war meant there was scope for a prolonged period of catch-up with the world leader, the US.<br></p> <p>But they couldn\u2019t keep up the blistering rate of progress. Rather like someone who is totally unfit joining a running club, they initially make rapid improvements as the pounds are shed and the legs get stronger, closing the gap with the faster athletes. But progress eventually slows.</p> <p>Similarly, it is still possible to squeeze productivity gains out of mature technologies but they are harder to achieve. It is more than a century since the first cars appeared on the streets, yet the auto industry is still looking for ways to make better cars more efficiently. <br></p> <p>Economies can grow even when productivity is exceptionally weak, as it has been in the years since the global recession. That\u2019s possible if the labour force expands or if people work longer hours. The problem seems to be the weakness of investment. Companies are tending to employ more labour to work with ageing capital equipment, leading to weaker productivity.<br></p> <p>Central banks have become like the dodgy coaches administering drugs to their athletes. They have found ways of making performance look better than it would otherwise be. Instead of artificial stimulants they have used ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing.</p> <p>In theory, individual countries are not supposed to use these unconventional measures to the detriment of their rivals. Loose monetary policy is deemed to be fine if it is for domestic purposes \u2013 raising the growth rate or steering clear of deflation \u2013 but not if it is to secure a competitive advantage by driving down the currency.</p> <p>But everybody suspects everybody else of cheating.

                "bodyText":"Athletes know all about productivity. Their lives are spent eking out improvements in performance through new training methods, better diets and learning from their rivals. A personal best is productivity writ large: doing better this year than you did last. Sometimes progress is dramatic. The Olympic record in the long jump set by Jesse Owens in Berlin in 1936 lasted for 24 years. Eight years later there was another big advance. Nobody has managed to beat the Olympic-best of 8.90 metres managed by Bob Beamon in Mexico City. This year\u2019s victor in Rio, Jeff Henderson, won with a jump more than a half a metre off Beamon\u2019s record. More often, gains are slow and incremental. Athletes run a few hundredths of a second faster, throw the hammer, the shot or the javelin a few centimetres further. New technology often plays a part: it has only been possible to break the six-metre barrier in the pole vault because carbon-fibre poles are more flexible and less likely to break. Then there\u2019s the murkier side of sport. Productivity improvements are not always just the result of pumping more iron and pounding round the track: they can be achieved by the use of performance-enhancing drugs. It is notable that progress in many events has stalled since testing regimes have been tightened up. The limitations of the human body may mean that it will prove impossible to run 100 metres in less than nine seconds or long jump more than 10 metres. Productivity gains will become slower and slower until they stop altogether. Ultimately, though, it doesn\u2019t really matter that Henderson was unable to beat Beamon\u2019s (altitude-assisted) record. All he needed to do was beat the rest of the field in Rio. Seeing the medals decided in the sixth and final round was still gripping viewing. It matters a lot more that the US, Henderson\u2019s country, saw productivity not just slow but actually fall over the past year. What this means is that output per worker in 2016 is lower than it was in 2015: the world\u2019s biggest economy became less effective at producing goods and services. Falling productivity means Americans are seeing their living standards decline. The UK\u2019s recent productivity performance has been almost as dismal: output per worker grew by 0.2% in the latest 12-month period, well down on its pre-financial crisis trend of 2.3%. Historically, just as with Owens and Beamon in the long jump, there are sometimes big leaps forward. Technological advances such as the printing press, the steam engine and the internal combustion engine change societies radically and can act as the catalyst for faster productivity growth. Yet, in the decades between these paradigm shifts, progress is more incremental. Michael Pearce, global economist at Capital Economics says the rate of productivity growth has been slowing in advanced countries almost continuously since the 1960s. \u201cThere are plenty of possible reasons for this, including the fading boost to productivity from previous waves of innovation, the diminishing gains from further economic integration, and the shift of global activity away from manufacturing and towards services.\u201d The postwar period experienced a rapid spurt in productivity. In part, that was because it took time to fully exploit the technological advances of the late 19th and early 20th century. That was particularly true of Europe and Japan, where slow growth during the 1930s and the devastating impact of the second world war meant there was scope for a prolonged period of catch-up with the world leader, the US. But they couldn\u2019t keep up the blistering rate of progress. Rather like someone who is totally unfit joining a running club, they initially make rapid improvements as the pounds are shed and the legs get stronger, closing the gap with the faster athletes. But progress eventually slows. Similarly, it is still possible to squeeze productivity gains out of mature technologies but they are harder to achieve. It is more than a century since the first cars appeared on the streets, yet the auto industry is still looking for ways to make better cars more efficiently. Economies can grow even when productivity is exceptionally weak, as it has been in the years since the global recession. That\u2019s possible if the labour force expands or if people work longer hours. The problem seems to be the weakness of investment. Companies are tending to employ more labour to work with ageing capital equipment, leading to weaker productivity. Central banks have become like the dodgy coaches administering drugs to their athletes. They have found ways of making performance look better than it would otherwise be. Instead of artificial stimulants they have used ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing. In theory, individual countries are not supposed to use these unconventional measures to the detriment of their rivals. Loose monetary policy is deemed to be fine if it is for domestic purposes \u2013 raising the growth rate or steering clear of deflation \u2013 but not if it is to secure a competitive advantage by driving down the currency. But everybody suspects everybody else of cheating. The Americans are convinced that the Chinese are deliberately holding down the level of the yuan in order to boost exports. The reluctance of the US Federal Reserve to raise interest rates is deemed, in part, to be the result of concerns about an over-strong dollar. The Japanese have openly admitted that they would like to see the yen lower. Concerns about the strength of the euro help explain why the European Central Bank is mulling the possibility of fresh stimulus measures this autumn. The Bank of England is in a different position. A cheaper pound would have been necessary at some point if the UK was ever to start closing its colossal balance of payments deficit. Brexit has delivered that depreciation without it looking like an act of beggar-thy-neighbour policy. Threadneedle Street is taking full advantage of the situation: dropping strong hints of further interest rate cuts to come is designed to ensure that the unlooked for competitive boost provided by the referendum is not dissipated. If this were the Olympics, the closest comparison would be the Devil Take the Hindmost race in the cycling omnium. There, the rider at the back of the field drops out every couple of laps, and each contestant pedals furiously to ensure it is not them. Eventually, central banks hope to create the conditions for an acceleration in productivity growth. The idea is that boosting demand will lead to better supply-side performance. That, though, is taking some time. The past few years have been a slow-bicycle race led by China, with the US the best of the developed countries. Eventually, innovation and more skilled workforces will result in higher productivity. For now, though, central banks are expending a lot of effort for less growth than in previous decades.

                "bodyText":"In the past the unemployment rate was a pretty good measure of the health of the economy. The current rate of 5.7% for much of the past 30 years would have meant the economy was in quite robust health. But over the past decade, the increasing growth of part-time employment means that the gauging the economy\u2019s fitness requires much more than just taking the unemployment pulse rate. Last week the Australian Bureau of Statistics announced that the unemployment rate had fallen to 5.7% in seasonally adjusted terms. While that big number is always the first thing reported from the labour force figures, for me looking at the actual employment growth is a better indicator of what is going on in the economy. But even here we need to look at what type of employment is growing \u2013 rather than just the big overall number. The monthly employment growth paints a less rosy picture than the 5.7% unemployment rate would suggest. After five months of full-time employment falling, in trend terms the growth of 1,239 people employed full-time saw a 0.02%increase. The big growth was all in part-time employment \u2013 up 10,576 jobs or 0.3%. And yet even this showed a falling off of growth from earlier in the year: It also saw a mere 0.06% increase in the amount of hours worked in July. Hours worked is in many ways the best measure of employment health. Part-time employment can mean anything from one hour a week to 34 hours, and equally full-time employment includes anything from 35 hours and above. Hours worked not only can shows the shift from full-time to part-time it can also detect changes within each category. There is also a strong link between employment growth and the growth in hours worked. At the moment the growth of hours worked is sagging below that of employment. This isn\u2019t too bad if it means employers are either just temporarily reducing hours, or still hiring workers, but just for part-time until things improve. The worry is that the slowing hours worked growth is predicting future slowing employment growth: But the big story of employment at the moment is part-time employment growth and it is not just about that versus full-time work; it is involves gender and age. For most of 2014 and 2015 male full-time employment growth was quite lacklustre while full-time employment growth for women was pretty solid. But this year, full-time jobs have been hard to find for both genders: While part-time workers are likely to be women (there are currently 2.6m women working part-time compared to 1.2m men) the big growth in part-time employment in the past few years has been for men. In the past five years the number of men employed part-time has increased by 21.5% compared to an increase of just 1.9% for full-time work. The shift of men towards part-time work is one which has been happening now for a quarter of a century. In 1990, 80% of men in the prime working age range of 25 to 64 years were working full-time. Just 3.8% of prime aged men were working part-time. Now only 72.4% of prime aged men work full-time, while 10% are working part-time. There are now fewer men in their prime working age working full-time than ever before. Conversely, there are now more prime-aged women working full-time than ever, and the peak has been steady now for nearly five years: In effect, the story since the GFC has been of male full-time employment shrinking, while part-time work has grown. But for women, part-time work has grown while full-time employment has remained steady. Men working full-time still dominate the labour market. Of all employment, full-time men accounts for 43% alone, but since 2012 there are more women employed in total than there are men in full-time work \u2013 something unthinkable 25 years ago: But the rise and fall in part-time employment is also about age. Over the past decade the main growth in employment numbers is full-time employment of prime aged workers \u2013 not surprisingly given they are the biggest section of the population. But in the past year there has been a greater increase in actual part-time employment for 25-64 years olds than for full-time, and the same scenario is reflected for youth and for worked over 65 years of age. But when we look at the increase in employed workers as a percentage of the people in each age group the rise in part-time employment becomes obvious: In the past decade, the percentage of youth working part-time has increased from 28.8% of people aged 15-24 to 31.6%. In the same time the percentage of youth working full-time has fallen from 35.4% to just 27.2%. But while full-time work has evaporated for the youth, older workers have been staying in the workforce in much greater numbers \u2013 both in full-time and very much so in part-time. At the start of this century just 3% of those over 65 were working part-time, but now 7.3% of those supposedly in the retirement age are working part-time: Now part-time work often gets a bad rap, when in reality it is not always bad \u2013 it can be a first start for many workers and can be necessary when raising a child. For those over the age of 65 the reasons for work are less obvious \u2013 either out of need, or because better health allows more people to stay working. Certainly since 2004 there has been a steady increase in the numbers of older workers. But with the increase in part-time employment across the board has also come an increase in underemployment: The underemployment rate across all age groups is much higher now than it was in 2003 when the unemployment rate was much the same as it is now. The shift towards part-time employment over the past decade means more than in the past we need to look at much more than just the unemployment rate to gauge the health of the labour market. At the moment while the unemployment rate remains well below 6%, the weakness in the growth of full-time employment and hours worked suggests the labour market is a long way from peak fitness.",

                "bodyText":"Volkswagen has settled a damaging dispute with two of its suppliers that hit car production at more than half of its German factories. After more than 20 hours of negotiations that lasted through the night, the German carmaker said on Tuesday that it had reached an agreement with CarTrim, which makes seats, and ES Automobilguss, which manufactures cast iron parts for gearboxes. The dispute affected almost 28,000 workers at six of VW\u2019s 10 factories in Germany. The Wolfsburg-based company halted production of the popular Golf and Passat cars at the start of the week, as well as assembly of engines, gearboxes and emissions systems. In a statement, VW said that the suppliers would start delivering parts again \u201cin the near future\u201d and that the affected factories would gradually resume production. Reeling from the emissions scandal, which has resulted in a sales slump and billions of euros of costs, VW had indicated that it would be pushing for price cuts from its suppliers. It has set aside \u20ac18bn to cover litigation and other costs of the scandal, after admitting last September that 11million diesel-powered cars around the world were fitted with software designed to cheat emissions tests. Last week VW asked a German court to take action against Prevent, the Bosnia-based parent group of CarTrim and ES Automobilguss, for refusing to follow an order to resume deliveries. The dispute centred on a cancelled contract. Prevent\u2019s German subsidiaries stopped delivering parts to VW when it refused to reimburse the supplier for changes made at its factories before the start of a new contract that was then cancelled. Olaf Lies, the economy minister of the state of Lower Saxony, where VW is based, and a member of the company\u2019s supervisory board, has said that the dispute had hit VW at the worst possible time. Whether VW\u2019s management should face questions for being overly reliant on a single supplier required clarification, he said. Germany\u2019s economy ministry had urged both sides to drop their dispute, expressing concern about the impact on jobs. The German Association of Supply Chain Management, Procurement and Logistics has warned of knock-on effects on 500 other companies that supply parts for the Golf. A VW spokeswoman said it was difficult to predict when production would be resumed and that decisions would be made on a site-by-site basis.

As you\u2019d expect, I pay for my personal expenses whilst away and only reclaim what is a business expense.</p> <p>My personal life is obviously a private matter as it is for anyone else. But I deeply regret being the cause of so much adverse publicity and the damage that has been done to the Group\u2019s reputation. It has detracted from the great work which you do for our customers on a daily basis and from the major accomplishments of the past five years. This includes the Government shareholding having reduced from over 40% to around 9% with over \u00a316 billion plus dividends having been returned to taxpayers.</p> <p>More broadly I have been a strong advocate of expecting the highest professional standards from everyone at the bank, and that includes me. I will continue to strive to meet those standards. Having the highest professional standards raises the bar against which we are judged and as I have always said we must recognise that mistakes will be made. I don\u2019t expect anyone to get everything right all the time. The important point being how we learn from those mistakes and the decisions and actions we take afterward.</p> <p>As we look forward, it is your hard work over the last five years returning the Group to financial health that means we are best placed among our peers to continue supporting the UK economy and to help Britain prosper. We chose to focus on helping the UK economy \u2013 in particular through our support for first time buyers, small businesses and UK corporates \u2013 and as a result by choice, our future is inextricably linked with the future success of the UK economy.</p> <p>The extended period of low interest rates that we now face has created uncertainties for the UK economy and new challenges for the Group.

                "bodyText":"Most European markets ended the day higher, albeit not showing substantial gains as investors remained cautious ahead of any comments from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen about US interest rates in her speech on Friday. But the FTSE 100 missed out, dragged down by mining shares after a fall in profits at Glencore. The weaker oil price in the wake of an unexpected rise in US crude stocks also hit sentiment. Brent is now down 1.9% at $49 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate is 3% lower at $46.65. The final scores on the markets showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 32.73 points or 0.48% at 6835.78 Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.28% to 10622.97 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.32% at 4435.47 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was 0.68% better at 16891.63 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.87% at 8655.5 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.01% to 567.94 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 27 points or 0.15%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. French unemployment has fallen in July, but not quite as much as expected: Elsewhere, Iceland\u2019s central bank has cut interest rates for the first time since December 2014, citing concerns about low inflation. Reducing its key interest rate by 0.5 percentage points to 5.25%, the bank said: The inflation outlook has improved since the Bank\u2019s last forecast. If the exchange rate remains unchanged, the outlook is for inflation to remain below target until early 2017. According to the forecast, it will edge upwards when import prices stop declining and the effects of the currency appreciation subside. Inflation will rise more slowly than previously forecast, however, and will not be as high as was previously projected. If the exchange rate continues to rise, and other things being equal, inflation will be lower than is provided for in the baseline forecast... Whether interest rates will be lowered further or need to be raised again will depend on economic developments and on the success of the capital account liberalisation process. The recent signs that the UK economy is - so far - holding up after the Brexit vote continue to support the pound. Sterling is now at a three week high against the dollar, up 0.35% at $1.3235, while it has climbed 0.8% against the euro to \u20ac1.1762. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Crude prices took a knock today as the US posted its fourth inventories build-up in five weeks. Despite being in so-called driving season, the build-up of surplus oil means that domestic demand is not keeping up with supply, which has become increasingly reliant upon international imports as output falls. On the oil price, David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco, said: The EIA reported a 2.5 million barrel build in crude stocks against expectations of a 500,000 drawdown. WTI and Brent slumped on the report which was consistent with last night\u2019s American Petroleum Institute release... Crude oil has been amongst the most volatile markets this week as investors prepare themselves for Janet Yellen\u2019s speech on Friday at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium On Tuesday it whipsawed from negative to positive territory on a story that Iran was prepared to \u2018support joint action to prop up the oil market\u2019. However, this headline missed out on another crucial quote from the (anonymous) source which said that even if an agreement was reached to freeze output, there was very little chance that anyone would stick to it. This latter point is entirely consistent with previous attempts by OPEC members to manipulate the oil market. Even in the days when the group operated as a cartel and brought in quotas for members, nobody stuck to them Oil took another lurch lower first thing this morning after yet another headline. In this an Iranian oil ministry official wasn\u2019t prepared to confirm that Iran would even attend the meeting in Algeria next month, suggesting a repeat of April\u2019s disastrous talks in Doha. Brent crude has fallen 1.7% to $49.09 a barrel following the unexpected rise in US oil stocks. West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is down 2.6% at $46.91. Oil prices are under pressure again after a surprise rise in US crude stocks, suggesting lack of demand and excess supply. Weekly crude stocks rose 2.5m barrels to 523.59m, compared to expectations of a 0.5m fall, according to the Energy Information Administration. Weekly gasoline stocks climbed 36,000 barrels to 232.7m, rather than the expected 1.2m decline. Another factor for the Federal Reserve to consider when contemplating an interest rate rise. US existing home sale fell by a higher than expected 3.2% to an annualised 5.39m units in July, according to the National Association of Realtors. Analysts had expected a smaller dip to 5.51m. The association said: Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, says existing sales fell off track in July after steadily climbing the last four months. \u201cSeverely restrained inventory and the tightening grip it\u2019s putting on affordability is the primary culprit for the considerable sales slump throughout much of the country last month,\u201d he said. \u201cRealtors are reporting diminished buyer traffic because of the scarce number of affordable homes on the market, and the lack of supply is stifling the efforts of many prospective buyers attempting to purchase while mortgage rates hover at historical lows.\u201d A Bank of England bond buying programme for medium term gilts has seen increased demand. The Bank received offers worth 3.1 times the number it wanted to buy of 7 to 15 year gilts. Last week the figure was 2.85 times. In other words the Bank received total offers of \u00a33.625bn and accepted \u00a31.169bn. It may be a couple of days until Janet Yellen, the chair of the US Federal Reserve, makes her speech at the Jackson Hole symposium but investors remain cautious ahead of the event. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has dipped 20 points or 0.11% in early trading, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have both opened marginally lower. Further weakness in the oil price ahead of the latest US crude inventory figures, due later, is adding to the uncertainty. Crude saw a sharp spike on Tuesday afternoon following reports that Iran might back plans to support the oil price at next month\u2019s meeting of producers. But growing doubts about the chances of this happening, along with a rise in oil stocks reported by the American Petroleum Institute, saw the price fall back. Here is our full story on the Scottish government\u2019s spending and earnings figures for 2015-16: The Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland (Gers) figures showed that during 2015-16 the country\u2019s tax receipts were \u00a3400 less than the UK average at \u00a310,000, after several decades during which oil had pushed Scottish tax receipts above the UK level. The gap between Scottish tax revenues and spending had also grown sharply, Gers revealed. While overall tax receipts fell by \u00a3400 a head, the Scottish and UK governments spent \u00a31,200 a head more on public services in the country, and on Scotland\u2019s share of UK and overseas spending. Compared with spending at UK level, that led to a gulf of \u00a31,600 a head between what was raised in taxes and spent in Scotland. Yet overall government spending as a share of the economy increased again to reach nearly 44% of Scotland\u2019s GDP, compared with 40% at UK level. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s First Minister, has commented on the Scottish public finances data published this morning. She said the figures - which showed Scotland\u2019s North Sea revenues fell 97% in 2015-16 to just \u00a360m - were difficult and the drop in oil prices meant Scotland had \u201csuffered an economic shock which has had an impact on our fiscal position\u201d. She added: It is a challenge we have had for some time now \u2013 how to grow and diversify our onshore economy. I accept Scotland faces, whatever our constitutional arrangements, a very challenging fiscal position [but] the fundamentals of our economy are strong. Mickey Levy, chief US and Asia economist at German bank Berenberg, has some personal insight to offer on Jackson Hole. He attended the meeting every year for 23 years with his last one in 2013 and says the media is missing the point by focusing on Yellen\u2019s speech and the timing of the next US rate rise. The purpose of the symposium is to get leading monetary policymakers to focus on and discuss specific broader issues critical to the conduct of monetary policy. It is not designed to focus on the next FOMC meeting or the timing of Fed policy changes, but that\u2019s what the media who cover the event hype, so that\u2019s what will be reported. Here is how it works according to Levy, who says the format, the venue, and food menus have remained virtually the same for the past 25 years: Nearly a year before every meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City picks a topic and a handful of academics to prepare serious research papers. At the symposium, the papers are presented at panels chaired by leading global central bankers (including Fed members) and each paper is critiqued by formal discussants. Symposium participants are then able to ask questions and make comments. The papers and Yellen\u2019s speech are embargoed until they are presented. There is no wandering around the hallways\u2014everybody is in the meeting, which is long and formally structured. Yellen is expected to kick off proceedings on Friday morning: The Fed Chair gives the opening remarks at the symposium on Friday morning, 8am Mountain Time (10am Eastern Time). There is no Q&amp;A session following the Chair\u2019s presentation. Often, the Chair\u2019s presentation covers the general topic of the papers that are being presented. The last panel of the symposium, late Saturday morning, will involve four leading central bankers and policymakers commenting and discussing more current issues facing monetary policy. This will include a Fed member and an ECB member. US traders are treading water as they await the annual meeting of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Representatives from central banks will gather on Thursday but the main proceedings get underway on Friday. The event is hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, and has been since 1978. Prominent central bankers, finance ministers, and academics from around the world gather to discuss the themes around a pre-decided topic. This year\u2019s meeting has the catchy title: Designing Resilient Monetary Policy Frameworks for the Future. The formal agenda is not published until Thursday evening in Jackson Hole (1am Friday morning UK time). But we do know that US Fed chair Janet Yellen will be giving a speech on Friday. The speech is eagerly awaited by investors looking for clues as to when the Fed will next hike rates. The Federal Open Market Committee appears to be divided on the subject, leaving investors confused and uncertain. They will look to Yellen to shed some light when she gives her speech, entitled, \u201cThe Fed\u2019s Monetary Policy Toolkit\u201d. The Bank of England\u2019s representatives will be Minouche Shafik, deputy governor for markets and banking, and Kristin Forbes, an external member of the Monetary Policy Committee. Wall Street is expected to open modestly higher: The FTSE 100 is lagging other European indices, down -0.2% or 10 points at 6,858. The FTSE is being dragged lower by the mining companies, which have been hit by the sliding price of oil and other commodities. Glencore is the biggest faller, down 4.3% after reporting a sharp drop in first-half profits. Other major markets are rising: Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.5% at 10,641 France\u2019s CAC: +0.6% at 4,450 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.8% at 16,918 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.8% at 8,646 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.5% at 345 Returning to Scotland and the 97% drop in North Sea revenue in 2015-16... The figures were published as part of the Government Expenditure &amp; Revenue Scotland 2015-16. As well as plunging oil revenues as North Sea fields mature and the oil price weakens, the data showed the deficit (the difference between what the government earned and spent) in Scotland was \u00a314.8bn in 2015-16. That amounted to 9.5% of gross domestic product. It compares with a UK deficit of \u00a375.3bn, or 4% of GDP. The huge drop in North Sea revenues last year creates a potential headache for Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s First Minister and leader of the SNP, who is considering a second referendum on Scottish independence following the Brexit vote. It makes it easier for those opposed to Scottish independence to argue that Scotland\u2019s economy would be better off if it remains in the UK. However, Sturgeon has referred to Scottish government figures that forecast Brexit could cost Scotland\u2019s economy as much as \u00a311.2bn by 2030, and cut public revenues by \u00a33.7bn. Oil prices are down following an unexpected increase in US crude stocks. The rise in stocks has revived fears over a supply glut. Brent crude is down 1% or 52 cents at $49.46 a barrel, after touching an intraday low of $49.07. US West Texas Intermediate crude fell 80 cents or 1.7% to $47.30 a barrel. Figures published on Tuesday by the American Petroleum Institute showed US stocks had risen by 4.5 million barrels in the week ending 19 August. Analysts expected a 455,000 fall in the number of barrels. The US government will publish its own weekly crude stocks data later today. The pound is rising, up 0.3% against the dollar at $1.3230. It is up 0.5% against the euro, at \u20ac1.1728. It seems that speculators are trimming their bets against sterling after much of the economic data relating to July and August suggests the Brexit vote has had a limited impact so far. The Scottish government\u2019s North Sea revenues collapsed in 2015-16 to just \u00a360m from \u00a31.8bn a year earlier. As the graphic below shows, it is a far cry from the rewards reaped by Scotland in 2008-09, when North Sea revenues were \u00a311.6bn. The \u00a360m revenue last year was the smallest on record since the Scottish parliament was convened in 1998-99. It represented a 78.5% share of North Sea revenues. The North Sea is a mature oil asset, meaning much of it has already been extracted with the remaining oil more costly and complex to get out of the ground. Its decline comes at a time when oil prices have fallen sharply, hitting revenue with a double blow. My colleague Sean Farrell has obtained the memo sent by Lloyds boss Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio to the bank\u2019s staff. Here is the message in full: Having returned to work I wanted to use the opportunity to address the recent media coverage of my private life. As you may have read, my expenses were reviewed in light of speculation by certain newspapers and the Group has confirmed that they are fully compliant. As you\u2019d expect, I pay for my personal expenses whilst away and only reclaim what is a business expense. My personal life is obviously a private matter as it is for anyone else. But I deeply regret being the cause of so much adverse publicity and the damage that has been done to the Group\u2019s reputation. It has detracted from the great work which you do for our customers on a daily basis and from the major accomplishments of the past five years. This includes the Government shareholding having reduced from over 40% to around 9% with over \u00a316 billion plus dividends having been returned to taxpayers. More broadly I have been a strong advocate of expecting the highest professional standards from everyone at the bank, and that includes me. I will continue to strive to meet those standards. Having the highest professional standards raises the bar against which we are judged and as I have always said we must recognise that mistakes will be made. I don\u2019t expect anyone to get everything right all the time. The important point being how we learn from those mistakes and the decisions and actions we take afterward. As we look forward, it is your hard work over the last five years returning the Group to financial health that means we are best placed among our peers to continue supporting the UK economy and to help Britain prosper. We chose to focus on helping the UK economy \u2013 in particular through our support for first time buyers, small businesses and UK corporates \u2013 and as a result by choice, our future is inextricably linked with the future success of the UK economy. The extended period of low interest rates that we now face has created uncertainties for the UK economy and new challenges for the Group. And as a UK focused bank we are not immune to the factors likely to shape the UK economic outlook, but I believe we will be well positioned to meet them. With that in mind please be assured that I am as committed as ever to leading the Group forward to deliver our strategy and to meet our future ambitions. Thank you again for your messages of support over the last few weeks. I have greatly appreciated them. Best wishes Ant\u00f3nio Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, believes UK house prices will fall in 2016 and 2017 as greater uncertainty surrounding Brexit creeps in. We suspect that house prices could ease back by around 3% over the latter months of 2016 and there could well be a further 5% drop in 2017. We believe housing market activity is likely to be limited over the coming months and prices will weaken as heightened uncertainty following the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU weighs down on consumer confidence and willingness to engage in major transactions, and also hampers economic activity. The fundamentals for house buyers look likely to soften over the coming months with unemployment rising and purchasing power softening. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics has a different interpretation of the BBA figures, arguing there are clear signs that Brexit is weighing on consumers\u2019 minds. July\u2019s mortgage approvals data bring clear evidence that the Brexit vote has made households reluctant to undertake major financial commitments. Following a 5% month-to-month fall in June, approvals fell a further 5.3% in July, leaving them at their lowest since January 2015 and down 19% year-over-year. The decline in approvals corresponds closely with the drop in RICS\u2019 measure of new buyer enquiries and indicators of consumer confidence, so the slowdown seems demand led. Housing transactions, which only edged down in July, have yet to register the full adverse impact of the Brexit vote. The BBA\u2019s July data are the first set of borrowing figures since the Brexit vote on 23 June. Rebecca Harding, BBA chief economist, says despite the drop in mortgage approvals the figures overall suggest the impact of the vote has had little negative impact so far. A breakdown of the numbers reinforces the picture that consumers have so far shrugged off Brexit uncertainty. Consumer credit was 6% higher in July than a year earlier, reflecting strong retail sales and - in the case of personal loans and overdrafts - low interest rates. Borrowing by companies meanwhile increased by \u00a32.3bn in July after a small fall in June. Harding: The data does not currently suggest borrowing patterns have been significantly affected by the Brexit vote, but it is still early days. Many borrowing decisions will also have been taken before the referendum. We are also clearly still a nation of shoppers and the Brexit vote has done nothing to change the fact that we use credit cards for short-term purchases. Strong retail sales figures appear closely associated with strong consumer credit growth. Businesses also appear to be borrowing as usual: the upward trend that characterised the first few months of this year is continuing. June\u2019s data looks like a blip, probably caused by pre-Brexit nervousness. But it is too early to tell how the data over the next few months will reflect the result of the decision to leave the EU. Britain\u2019s high-street banks approved the fewest mortgages since January 2015 in July. Mortgage approvals for house purchase (excluding remortgages) fell 19% last month compared with a year earlier, to 37,662 according to the British Bankers Association. Antonio Horta-Osorio, the chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group, is expected to apologise to staff today following allegations that he had an affair with a senior academic. The married father of three is expected to send a message to the bank\u2019s 75,000 staff expressing \u201cdeep regret\u201d for any embarrassment and reputational damage to the bank. He is not expected to resign. At 9.30 the Scottish government will publish figures that are expected to show a sharp decline in tax revenues from the oil and gas sector, following the drop in oil prices. Opponents of Nicola Sturgeon and Scottish independence are likely to jump on any weakness in the figures as a reason why Scotland\u2019s economic future would be more secure as part of the UK. But Sturgeon has argued that Brexit could cost the Scottish economy as much as \u00a311bn by 2030. The pound is roughly unchanged this morning, down 0.1% against the dollar at $1.3182. It\u2019s a similar story against the euro, with the pound down 0.01% \u20ac1.1671. WPP is the FTSE 100\u2019s top riser this morning after the world\u2019s largest advertising group said full-year revenue was likely to grow more than previously expected. The top of the table this morning: And at the other end of the table, the miners are among the biggest fallers: Here is our full story on WPP\u2019s better-than-expected first-half results: Europe\u2019s major markets are down in early trading: FTSE 100: -0.2% at 6,852 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.5% at 10,545 France\u2019s CAC: -0.5% at 4,399 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.3% at 8,557 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.02% at 16,755 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.3% at 343 Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of the world\u2019s largest advertising group WPP, says he is still worried about the potential fallout from the Brexit vote. Sorrell was firmly in the remain camp in the run-up to the 23 June referendum and told BBC Radio 4\u2019s programme the UK\u2019s exit from the EU would be a long and uncertain process. It\u2019s very early days. What we did see from April to June was caution in front of the vote. What we saw after the vote in July was the UK perking up a bit. But that begs the question as to what the UK would have done in the absence of a Brexit vote or if the vote had gone the other way. We still worry. Business wants certainty. The government wants the best negotiating position with the EU and the two are actually in conflict. We would like a quick clean solution from a business point of view but the government needs a little bit of scope and time for negotiation. So there is going to be a considerable degree of uncertainty in the future. Sorrell said building trade agreements with both EU countries and non-EU countries was \u201ca very long-term task and it\u2019s going to take a lot longer I think that people anticipate.\u201d He added growth was going to be slow and difficult. With all that said, WPP reported better-than-expected first half results. Things were going so well the group said the outlook for the full year had improved, and it revised up its forecast for full-year revenue growth to \u201cwell over\u201d 3%, from an earlier forecast of \u201cover 3%\u201d. So Sorrell\u2019s main points seem to be that although there appears to have been little negative impact from Brexit so far, things could have been even better if the vote had gone the other way and things could get worse as the complexity of agreeing trade deals become apparent. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Official data has confirmed the German economy slowed in the second quarter, when GDP increased by 0.4%. It compared with growth of 0.7% in the first quarter. The annual growth rate for the second quarter was confirmed at 3.1%. Household and public sector spending, as well as exports, were drivers of growth in the second quarter. Investment however was a drag. Carsten Brzeski, ING\u2019s chief economist in Germany, comments on the outlook for Europe\u2019s largest economy: Private consumption should remain an important growth driver on the back of low inflation, low interest rates, low unemployment and higher wages. In addition, at least in the short run, the refugee crisis will continue to support domestic demand and the construction sector should rebound quickly after the technical correction on the second quarter. The economy\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel, however, remains the lack of new investment. To kick-start investment in an ageing economy, some government support is needed. Not only at the national level but also at the European level. Also today we will provide a preview of the 2016 Jackson Hole meeting of central bankers, which kicks off on Thursday. At 9.30am the British Bankers Association will publish mortgage figures for July, giving us some clues on the state of the UK housing market in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote. Later in the US housing data will offer an insight into the market there, and what implications it might have for interest rates. We will bring you all the developments throughout the day.",

Her comments at Jackson Hole in the US on Friday afternoon will be scrutinised for hints about when the central bank could raise interest rates, with various analysts expecting her to be hawkish, dovish or neutral. With that uncertainty it is no surprise that investors have been erring on the side of caution. And after recent falls in the oil price, along with a drop in pharmaceutical shares following comments on excessive pricing by US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, stock markets ended the day in negative territory. The final scores showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 finished 18.88 points or 0.28% lower at 6816.90</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.88% to 10529.59</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.65% at 4406.61</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.07% to 16710.78</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.65% at 8599.5</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.37% to 565.83</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently fairly stable, down just 6 points or 0.04%.</p> <p><em>On that note, we\u2019ll close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow.</em></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57bf1645e4b0486629890140\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-25T16:02:23.821Z\">5.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, adds his voice to those expecting a US rate rise in December:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Esther George of the Kansas Fed gave markets something to chew over, with yet another hawkish comment coming in a long line of Fed members keen to talk about higher rates. After appearances from Dudley and Fischer last week, today\u2019s input from voting member George adds yet another voice to the increasingly deafening push for a rate hike in the coming months. With the election looking unpredictable, the likeliness is that members will see December as the month to press the button once more, one year on from the contentious 2015 rise. It is hard to see Janet Yellen delivering anything other than a relatively hawkish outlook tomorrow [at Jackson Hole] and with the dollar having suffered heavily in recent weeks, tomorrow could be a turning point for foreign exchange markets.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57bf0813e4b0568600c043aa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-25T15:08:16.331Z\">4.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Another comment suggesting that the Jackson Hole gathering of central bankers in the US could be a damp squib, despite expectations that Fed chair Janet Yellen could hint at future rate rises. David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Investors continue to hold back from taking on additional market exposure ahead of tomorrow\u2019s speech from Janet Yellen at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium. Few expect the Fed Chairman to say anything explicit about the likelihood or timing of what would be the US central bank\u2019s first rate hike since December last year. Nevertheless, there are hopes that she may give some clues as to the Fed\u2019s thinking over the state of the US economy, and indeed any risks facing the global economy as well.</p> <p>Last week we heard hawkish rhetoric from three Fed members. Then on Sunday Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer provided an upbeat outlook for the US economy saying that he expected growth to pick up following a particularly weak second quarter. Not only that, but he said that the Fed\u2019s targets for inflation and unemployment (the dual mandate) were close to being hit. If Yellen is similarly upbeat in her speech tomorrow, then investors will price in an increased possibility of a September hike.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a50a3b0195a5e2b38fe60a4075ed6a990ed708ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a50a3b0195a5e2b38fe60a4075ed6a990ed708ae/0_329_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Uncertainty over Federal Reserve rate outlook\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Uncertainty over Federal Reserve rate outlook</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>But despite all this chatter and speculation, it seems unlikely that Yellen will want to paint herself into a corner over the future direction of US monetary policy.</p> <p>Consequently, it could be that there\u2019s little of substance in the speech. While we\u2019ve had a clutch of Fed-heads out there trying to persuade investors that September is still \u201clive\u201d when it comes to a rate hike, the minutes from the last meeting in July showed that only one out of ten FOMC-voting members was in favour of tightening monetary policy. In addition, we\u2019ll get a stack of fresh economic data ahead of the Fed\u2019s next meeting, including Non-Farm Payrolls, Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing PMIs and inflation numbers. There\u2019s really no point in committing to any course of action until the Fed sees these reports.</p> <p>Finally, I don\u2019t believe that the FOMC has the faintest idea what they should do at the next meeting. And unfortunately we now have a central bank which pays too much attention to stock market movements and appears to relish its ability to influence short-term investor behaviour.</p> <p>Overall, I think there\u2019s just too much importance being attached to this speech. Jackson Hole was a fairly obscure event in years gone by. It only attained its current significance when Ben Bernanke used it as a forum for market manipulation in the wake of the 2008/9 financial crisis.

                "bodyText":"it has been the main obsession with stock markets for most of the week, but the long awaited speech by Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is almost upon us. Her comments at Jackson Hole in the US on Friday afternoon will be scrutinised for hints about when the central bank could raise interest rates, with various analysts expecting her to be hawkish, dovish or neutral. With that uncertainty it is no surprise that investors have been erring on the side of caution. And after recent falls in the oil price, along with a drop in pharmaceutical shares following comments on excessive pricing by US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, stock markets ended the day in negative territory. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 18.88 points or 0.28% lower at 6816.90 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.88% to 10529.59 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.65% at 4406.61 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.07% to 16710.78 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.65% at 8599.5 In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.37% to 565.83 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently fairly stable, down just 6 points or 0.04%. On that note, we\u2019ll close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, adds his voice to those expecting a US rate rise in December: Esther George of the Kansas Fed gave markets something to chew over, with yet another hawkish comment coming in a long line of Fed members keen to talk about higher rates. After appearances from Dudley and Fischer last week, today\u2019s input from voting member George adds yet another voice to the increasingly deafening push for a rate hike in the coming months. With the election looking unpredictable, the likeliness is that members will see December as the month to press the button once more, one year on from the contentious 2015 rise. It is hard to see Janet Yellen delivering anything other than a relatively hawkish outlook tomorrow [at Jackson Hole] and with the dollar having suffered heavily in recent weeks, tomorrow could be a turning point for foreign exchange markets. Another comment suggesting that the Jackson Hole gathering of central bankers in the US could be a damp squib, despite expectations that Fed chair Janet Yellen could hint at future rate rises. David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco, said: Investors continue to hold back from taking on additional market exposure ahead of tomorrow\u2019s speech from Janet Yellen at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium. Few expect the Fed Chairman to say anything explicit about the likelihood or timing of what would be the US central bank\u2019s first rate hike since December last year. Nevertheless, there are hopes that she may give some clues as to the Fed\u2019s thinking over the state of the US economy, and indeed any risks facing the global economy as well. Last week we heard hawkish rhetoric from three Fed members. Then on Sunday Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer provided an upbeat outlook for the US economy saying that he expected growth to pick up following a particularly weak second quarter. Not only that, but he said that the Fed\u2019s targets for inflation and unemployment (the dual mandate) were close to being hit. If Yellen is similarly upbeat in her speech tomorrow, then investors will price in an increased possibility of a September hike. But despite all this chatter and speculation, it seems unlikely that Yellen will want to paint herself into a corner over the future direction of US monetary policy. Consequently, it could be that there\u2019s little of substance in the speech. While we\u2019ve had a clutch of Fed-heads out there trying to persuade investors that September is still \u201clive\u201d when it comes to a rate hike, the minutes from the last meeting in July showed that only one out of ten FOMC-voting members was in favour of tightening monetary policy. In addition, we\u2019ll get a stack of fresh economic data ahead of the Fed\u2019s next meeting, including Non-Farm Payrolls, Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing PMIs and inflation numbers. There\u2019s really no point in committing to any course of action until the Fed sees these reports. Finally, I don\u2019t believe that the FOMC has the faintest idea what they should do at the next meeting. And unfortunately we now have a central bank which pays too much attention to stock market movements and appears to relish its ability to influence short-term investor behaviour. Overall, I think there\u2019s just too much importance being attached to this speech. Jackson Hole was a fairly obscure event in years gone by. It only attained its current significance when Ben Bernanke used it as a forum for market manipulation in the wake of the 2008/9 financial crisis. It would be better for all if it went back to being a boring conference for boring people. Back with the UK, and the strong retail sales figures from the CBI back up the idea that any negative effects of Brexit on the economy will only appear slowly, writes economic editor Larry Elliott: While we wait for Fed chair Janet Yellen on Friday, and any hints she gives on US interest rates, there is at least one board member of the US central bank suggesting a rise could be imminent. Speaking on CNBC, Dallas Federal Reserve president Robert Kaplan said the bank should be able to hike rates in the not too distant future, and the case for a rise was strengthening. He said progress was being made on employment and - more slowly - inflation. The latest PMI data means a US rate rise in September is unlikely but could signal a move in December, said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at Markit: The ongoing lacklustre economic growth signalled by the flash PMI suggests GDP growth is failing to accelerate in the third quarter from the weak 1.2% pace seen in the second quarter. Historical comparisons indicate that the PMI is signalling an annualised GDP growth rate of just under 1% in the third quarter, based on the data for July and August. With job creation also waning alongside subdued price pressures (the August PMI is consistent with non-farm payrolls rising by just under 130,000), the survey data will fuel expectations that the Fed will be in no rush to tighten policy again. However, as anecdotal evidence from the survey suggests that business activity is being dampened by uncertainty due to the upcoming presidential election, there\u2019s a good chance that the economy will pick up speed again after the vote, leaving a December rate hike on the table. After the better than expected US durable goods and jobless claims figures, a service sector survey for August has missed forecasts. The IHS Markit service sector initial PMI came in at 50.9, down from 51.4 in July and below forecasts of 52. This was the weakest rise in services activity since February. Markit said: U.S. service providers indicated another month of lacklustre growth in August, with business activity, new orders and employment all rising at a slower pace than in July. Survey respondents generally cited subdued underlying demand conditions and uncertainty ahead of the presidential election as factors that had dampened growth in August. Nonetheless, the balance of service sector firms expecting a rise in business activity over the year ahead remained well above the survey-record low seen in June. The composite PMI slipped from 51.8 in July to 51.5. As investors await Fed chair Janet Yellen\u2019s speech at the Jackson Hole symposium on Friday, US markets are heading lower in early trading. There is growing uncertainty over the timing of any US interest rate rise, and Yellen\u2019s comments will be scoured for any hints. Meanwhile the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 12 points while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.18% lower. Neil Wilson, market analyst at ETX Capital is decidedly underwhelmed at the prospect of Jackson Hole: Don\u2019t expect much from Jackson Hole. The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\u2019s annual economic policy symposium is a serious, sombre affair. It is not a policy meeting, nor is it meant to drive expectations for future policy decisions. It\u2019s a talking shop and we should take the goods on offer with a healthy dose of salt. Markets are incredibly quiet this August (in sharp contrast to last year) so investors are latching on to anything they can, which gives this meeting a lot more attention than it probably deserves. Investors will hang on every word uttered by Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve chair. ...But Yellen\u2019s habit of keeping markets guessing with alternately hawkish and dovish remarks should be kept in mind. Indeed what the meeting will highlight is just how hard it is for central banks to normalise policy after years of accommodation. Economists taking part in a Reuters poll believe the Brexit vote will weigh on UK house prices over the next couple of years. Average UK house prices are expected to rise by 2.8% in 2016, 1.3% in 2017, and 2.4% in 2018. London property prices are forecast to increase by 2% in 2016, by zero in 2017, and by 2% in 2018. Some more strong data out of the US. Durable goods orders increased by 4.4% in July, following a 4.2% fall in June according to the US Commerce Department. Economists had forecast a weaker rise of 3.3%. Rob Carnell, chief international economist at ING, says the better-than-expected data do not alter his view that the Federal Reserve will hold rates at its September meeting: Some marginally better than expected durable goods orders don\u2019t change our view that a September rate hike from the Fed is difficult to support. After two consecutive quarters of outright declines in US business investment, durable goods orders for July provide a first insight into how investment in the third quarter is shaping up. And our take on the figures is that the negativity is beginning to abate. But this is far from a big turnaround. The headline 4.4% month-on-month growth in July only just offsets last month\u2019s fall, and the trend for core goods orders and shipments are still both negative. Over in the US, the latest figures showed new claims for unemployment benefit fell unexpectedly by 1,000 in the week ending 20 August to 261,000. It was the third successive weekly fall, and a five-week low according to the US Labor Department data. Economists had forecast a rise to 265,000 new claims. Claims have been below 300,000 - a threshold associated with a strong labour market - for 77 weeks in a row. It is the longest stretch since 1970. The four-week rolling average fell by 1,250 to 264,000 last week. Sticking with Sports Direct, Legal &amp; General Investment Management says it will vote against the re-election of the retailer\u2019s chairman Keith Hellawell at the annual meeting on 7 September. It would be the third consecutive year LGIM has voted against Hellawell\u2019s re-election. It also proposes to vote against the re-election of all non-executive directors at the company. It follows a Guardian investigation last year that revealed Sports Direct warehouse workers were effectively being paid less than the minimum wage because of lengthy security checks at the end of shifts. Earlier this month Sports Direct said warehouse workers would receive back pay totalling about \u00a31m after the retailer admitted breaking the law by not paying the national minimum wage. Sports Direct is back in the headlines after a major investor group spoke out about the retailer\u2019s corporate governance failings. The Investor Forum has 40 members and represents 27% of Sports Direct\u2019s independent shareholders, including Legal &amp; General, Aviva, Standard Life and Fidelity. It was set up two years ago and this is apparently the first time it has made public concerns about a company. Governance failings are clearly resulting in declines in operating performance and long term shareholder value and, given the lack of progress and the broader impact on all stakeholders, the Forum now considers it important to make public its recommendations to the Sports Direct International board. The Investor Forum calls on the board and its founder Mike Ashley to launch an independent review of the company\u2019s \u201centire corporate governance framework\u201d at the annual meeting on 7 September. They must commit to implementing the recommendations of that review, it adds. Andy Griffiths, executive director of the Forum: It is highly unusual for the Investor Forum to consider it necessary to make public their concerns and recommendations in this way. In prior situations we have always managed to work privately with companies to create effective long term solutions. We do not take this step lightly and whilst we welcome SDI\u2019s move to hold an open day, we still have not received an appropriate level of commitment to respond to investor concerns and, as a result, the usual options have been exhausted. Phillip Inman, the Guardian\u2019s economics correspondent, has written a handy list of five problems facing central bankers as they head to Jackson Hole for the annual symposium. Here they are in short: Markets are addicted to low rates Negative interest rates A stagnant eurozone Fragile emerging markets Currency wars Read the piece in full here: Applications for British citizenship by EU nationals living in the UK jumped 14% in the run-up to the EU referendum in June. Figures from the Home Office suggest there was a rush for British passports as uncertainty built before the referendum. The 14% rise in passport applications to 15,501 included a 26% rise in applications from Italians and a 9% rise from Polish nationals in Britain. Separate figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that in 2015, one in eight people - or 8.6m - living in the UK were born abroad. It was a 3.5% increase, up from 8.3m in 2014. Annual net migration to Britain fell by 9,000 to 327,000 in the 12 months to March 2016. The price of Brent crude oil has fallen below $49 a barrel, and is currently down 0.2% at $48.94. Prices are under pressure as hopes fade that oil producing countries will reach a deal to limit production, and on the latest evidence that stocks are rising in the US. US government data published on Thursday showed weekly crude stocks rose by 2.5m barrels to 523.59m. Analysts had expected the figures from the Energy Information Administration to show a 0.5m fall. The pound is coming under some pressure. It is down 0.2% against the dollar at $1.32, and down 0.5% against the euro at \u20ac1.1688. Ruth Gregory at Capital Economics says the strong UK retail sales reported by the CBI won\u2019t last as the impact of the Brexit vote starts to creep into the data: With labour market conditions likely to deteriorate and rising inflation set to undermine real wage growth, it would be fairly surprising if retail sales growth didn\u2019t slow at all in the aftermath of the leave vote. It shouldn\u2019t be too dire for retail sales though, she adds: We think that other supportive factors \u2013 including low interest rates \u2013 should prevent household purchases from slowing too sharply. What\u2019s more, the upbeat tone of the forward-looking indicators provide us with some reassurance that we\u2019re not likely to see a marked collapse in consumer spending ahead. There is no sign of Brexit uncertainty weighing on consumer confidence in the CBI\u2019s latest retail survey. Shoppers were encouraged to hit the high streets by the sunny weather, shrugging off any Brexit fears. Specifically, 35% of retailers said sales volumes were up in August compared with a year earlier, while 26% said they were down. It gave a balance of +9%, rebounding from -14% in July. It was far better than the -12% predicted by retailers. Anna Leach, CBI head of economic analysis says it\u2019s not all good news: The summer weather has brought shoppers out onto the high street with retailers reporting that sales growth has risen, outdoing expectations, although firms do expect sales growth to ease next month. While the fall in sterling has boosted visitor numbers to the UK, it is likely to push up the price of imported goods over time which will mean households will be more likely to rein back spending on non-essentials. And we\u2019re back... Guardian Towers is being evacuated following a fire alarm... we\u2019ll be back as soon as possible Jasper Lawler, analyst at CMC markets, has this take on Thursday\u2019s share price falls across Europe: European healthcare stocks have been caught in the storm of another attack on price gauging in the industry from presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton. Shire and Hikma Pharmaceuticals are amongst the top fallers on the FTSE 100 whilst Qiagen in Germany was a top faller in the Stoxx 600 Healthcare euro price index. The FTSE 350 Mining Index is off by over 2% from the open. Poorly-received earnings from Glencore on Wednesday and lower oil prices continue to weigh on commodity-sensitive shares. European equity losses are building this morning, driven lower by pharmaceutical stocks following comments by US presidential hope Hilary Clinton. Her comments about excessive price rises in the industry - with specific reference to Mylan raising the cost of allergy treatment EpiPens - are weighing on the sector. Clinton said it was \u201cthe latest troubling example of a company taking advantage of its consumers\u201d. She continued: ...it\u2019s wrong when drug companies put profits ahead of patients, raising prices without justifying the value behind them. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve put forward a plan, hrc.io/2c7gjuI, to address exorbitant drug price hikes like these. As part of my plan, I\u2019ve made clear that pharmaceutical manufacturers should be required to explain significant price increases, and prove that any additional costs are linked to additional patient benefits and better value. Since there is no apparent justification in this case, I am calling on Mylan to immediately reduce the price of EpiPens. Europe\u2019s STOXX 600 index is down 1.14% at 341, with pharmaceutical companies among the biggest fallers: Carsten Brzeski, ING chief economist for Germany and Austria, says the weak August Ifo survey suggests German business confidence has been struck down by the Brexit vote. Oops. It seems that German businesses always take a bit longer to digest the news but today\u2019s Ifo suggests that German businesses have suddenly woken up to Brexit reality. Germany\u2019s most prominent indicator, the Ifo index, decreased sharply in August to 106.2, from 108.3 in July; the strongest monthly drop since May 2012. The drop was equally driven by decreases of both the current assessment and the expectations component. The expectations component is now at its lowest level since October 2014. What we had feared could happen did unfortunately happen: German businesses continued a longer tradition of delayed reactions to single and unexpected events. It is not the first time that the Ifo reacts with a delay of one or two months to global events. Today\u2019s Ifo reading is a good reminder that the relative benign reaction of Eurozone data to the Brexit vote should not be taken as given. The negative confidence impact is for real. Morale among German businesses weakened unexpectedly in August according to the latest Ifo survey. The headline business climate index, based on a survey of about 7,000 firms, fell to 106.2 this month from 108.3 in July. Economists had forecast a slight improvement to108.5. Clemens Fuest, Ifo head, said: Business confidence in Germany has clearly worsened. The German economy has fallen into a summer slump. Europe\u2019s major markets are all down this morning. It follows falls on Wall Street on Wednesday and in Asia on Thursday. Investors are feeling cautious ahead of Jackson Hole, and the recent drop in the oil price as hopes of an OPEC deal fade is also denting sentiment. FTSE 100: -0.7% at 6,790 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.8% at 10,538 France\u2019s CAC: -0.9% at 4,397 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.9% at 16,738 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.6% at 8,606 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.8% at 342 More than a million cars have rolled off production lines at UK factors since the beginning of 2016. The latest industry figures showed a total of 1.02 million cars were built in the first six months of the year. It was a 12.3% increase compared with the same period a year earlier. In July alone, the number of cars made in the UK rose by 7.6% to 126,566 vehicles. It was the 12th consecutive month of growth. Mike Hawes from the industry trade body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, says production is \u201cbooming\u201d with demand for British built cars from around the world. Manufacturers have invested billions to develop exciting new models and produce them competitively here in the UK. Future success will depend on continued new car demand and attracting the next wave of investment so Britain must demonstrate it remains competitive and open for business. There are concerns however that following the Brexit vote foreign car companies will be less willing to invest in UK car plants. The rise in production volumes in 2016 is the result of past investment so it will take a while for any Brexit effect to feed through to manufacturing numbers. Figures published this morning show French business confidence faltered in August. The French statistics office INSEE said the index for firms in the industrial sector dropped to 101 from 103 in July. The weaker confidence was most keenly felt among food and drinks manufacturers. The wider gauge of business morale also dipped to 101 this month from 102 in July. Confidence in the services sector was stable at 101. European markets are expected to open lower: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Central bankers and leading economists will arrive for the keenly anticipated Jackson Hole symposium which kicks off today with a reception and opening dinner. The full agenda for the meeting will be published at 6pm Mountain Time today (1am Friday in the UK). It should be available here. The main event of course will be the speech by Janet Yellen, chair of the Federal Reserve. She will be speaking on Friday at 3pm UK time. Investors will be listening closely for any hints on the timing of the next interest rate rise. There will be more clues on whether or not the Brexit vote has knocked confidence among UK consumers when we get the CBI\u2019s latest retail sales survey for August. Also today: The final estimate of Spanish GDP for the second quarter The German IFO business climate index for August In the US we will get jobless claims figures for last week, durable goods data, and the services PMI survey for August We will be bringing you all the key developments as the day unfolds.",

An uncertainty-driven slowdown still seems likely. But with a number of recent surveys from the CBI and others showing bouncebacks from post-vote lows, strong official retail sales numbers for July, and the support offered by the package of measure announced by the Bank of England, predictions that the economy will fall into recession look unduly pessimistic.\u201d </p> <h2><strong>Nina Skero, s</strong>enior economist, <strong>Centre for Economics and Business Research</strong> </h2> <p>\u201cFor some time, the UK economy has relied on domestic consumers as the principle source of growth. Encouraged by a robust labour market, rising house prices and low inflation UK households have consistently contributed around 0.5 percentage points to quarterly GDP growth figures for the past couple of years. </p> <p>\u201cHowever, whether consumers will continue to spend at the same level in 2017 is rather uncertain. A weaker pound will translate into more expensive imports and therefore higher inflation. As many companies either postpone hiring or freeze wages in response to increased uncertainty, the labour market will also cool somewhat. Finally, slower house price growth or even price declines will weigh on consumer confidence.\u201d</p> <h2>Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte</h2> <p>\u201cThe UK entered the post-referendum period with good momentum. Household spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of the economy and is growing at the fastest rate in eight years. We see few signs that Brexit has derailed the consumer recovery.\u201d </p> <h2>John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC</h2> <p>\u201cWe will have to wait until late October for the first official GDP estimates for the third quarter, but today\u2019s data confirms that the UK economy was in reasonable shape going into the referendum vote, while other recent data suggests that the consumer side of the economy held up reasonably well over the summer.\u201d</p> <h2>Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation</h2> <p> \u201cThe UK economy was firing ahead in the lead up to the referendum, but not quite on all cylinders. While household spending remained the major growth driver businesses also didn\u2019t let the referendum get in the way of capital expenditure plans, with business investment returning to growth after a weak start to the year. However, the familiar story of net trade dragging on growth surfaced again.</p> <p>\u201cThis quarterly growth rate is likely to be a high point this year, but sterling\u2019s plunge could see net trade finally coming to the party in the second half counteracting some Brexit-related weakness in business investment.\u201d </p> <h2>Howard Archer, chief European &amp; UK economist at IHS Markit</h2> <p>\u201cIt is likely to be some considerable time before the economy again expands anything like 0.6% quarter-on-quarter. We suspect that the UK\u2019s vote to leave the European Union in the 23 June referendum will significantly weigh down on UK economic activity for a prolonged period, primarily due to prolonged uncertainty over the outlook affecting business investment and employment. We also suspect that consumer fundamentals will progressively decline... On the positive side, the sharply weakened pound should boost exports.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe now believe that resilient consumer spending will keep the economy growing in the third quarter... Nevertheless, we still believe there is a very real risk that the economy will stagnate in the fourth quarter of 2016 and could even contract marginally early on in 2017.\u201d</p> <h2>Scott Bowman, UK economist at Capital Economics</h2> <p>\u201cLooking ahead, growth looks set to slow significantly in the second half of the year as uncertainty related to the Brexit vote takes its toll. The monthly output indices showed that activity fell in May and rose only slightly in June, with almost all of the second quarter\u2019s growth coming in April. Admittedly, consumer spending appears to have held up well since the referendum. But survey measures of business activity have taken large hits and a significant portion of firms say they will invest less as a result of the Brexit vote.</p> <p>\u201cAccordingly, we think that growth will fall to around zero in the third quarter and fourth quarter, as uncertainty about future trading relationships hits investment.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer of Close Brothers Asset Management</strong></h2> <p>\u201cBetter than expected July retail and jobs data suggests that the \u201cBrexit\u201d bogeyman isn\u2019t quite as scary as once thought, with consumer spending robust, and lower sterling supporting exports and industrial production. But, it\u2019s by no means a completely positive picture. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/03/uk-services-sector-contraction-adds-to-recession-fears-pmi\">Services PMIs provide less encouraging reading</a>, suggesting a more mixed economic outlook.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK economy is in the midst of a period of known \u2018unknowns\u2019 and it is too early to make a judgement on the likely health of the UK domestic economy over the coming years \u2013 let alone post-Brexit. In the meantime, monetary stimulus and a weaker currency will support growth. If we see the government propose a new policy of fiscal stimulus in the autumn, it will be a key buffer against Brexit-related fallout.\u201d</p>",

A weaker pound will translate into more expensive imports and therefore higher inflation. As many companies either postpone hiring or freeze wages in response to increased uncertainty, the labour market will also cool somewhat. Finally, slower house price growth or even price declines will weigh on consumer confidence.\u201d Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte \u201cThe UK entered the post-referendum period with good momentum. Household spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of the economy and is growing at the fastest rate in eight years. We see few signs that Brexit has derailed the consumer recovery.\u201d John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC \u201cWe will have to wait until late October for the first official GDP estimates for the third quarter, but today\u2019s data confirms that the UK economy was in reasonable shape going into the referendum vote, while other recent data suggests that the consumer side of the economy held up reasonably well over the summer.\u201d Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation \u201cThe UK economy was firing ahead in the lead up to the referendum, but not quite on all cylinders. While household spending remained the major growth driver businesses also didn\u2019t let the referendum get in the way of capital expenditure plans, with business investment returning to growth after a weak start to the year. However, the familiar story of net trade dragging on growth surfaced again. \u201cThis quarterly growth rate is likely to be a high point this year, but sterling\u2019s plunge could see net trade finally coming to the party in the second half counteracting some Brexit-related weakness in business investment.\u201d Howard Archer, chief European &amp; UK economist at IHS Markit \u201cIt is likely to be some considerable time before the economy again expands anything like 0.6% quarter-on-quarter. We suspect that the UK\u2019s vote to leave the European Union in the 23 June referendum will significantly weigh down on UK economic activity for a prolonged period, primarily due to prolonged uncertainty over the outlook affecting business investment and employment. We also suspect that consumer fundamentals will progressively decline... On the positive side, the sharply weakened pound should boost exports.\u201d \u201cWe now believe that resilient consumer spending will keep the economy growing in the third quarter... Nevertheless, we still believe there is a very real risk that the economy will stagnate in the fourth quarter of 2016 and could even contract marginally early on in 2017.\u201d Scott Bowman, UK economist at Capital Economics \u201cLooking ahead, growth looks set to slow significantly in the second half of the year as uncertainty related to the Brexit vote takes its toll. The monthly output indices showed that activity fell in May and rose only slightly in June, with almost all of the second quarter\u2019s growth coming in April. Admittedly, consumer spending appears to have held up well since the referendum. But survey measures of business activity have taken large hits and a significant portion of firms say they will invest less as a result of the Brexit vote. \u201cAccordingly, we think that growth will fall to around zero in the third quarter and fourth quarter, as uncertainty about future trading relationships hits investment.\u201d Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer of Close Brothers Asset Management \u201cBetter than expected July retail and jobs data suggests that the \u201cBrexit\u201d bogeyman isn\u2019t quite as scary as once thought, with consumer spending robust, and lower sterling supporting exports and industrial production. But, it\u2019s by no means a completely positive picture. Services PMIs provide less encouraging reading, suggesting a more mixed economic outlook. \u201cThe UK economy is in the midst of a period of known \u2018unknowns\u2019 and it is too early to make a judgement on the likely health of the UK domestic economy over the coming years \u2013 let alone post-Brexit. In the meantime, monetary stimulus and a weaker currency will support growth. If we see the government propose a new policy of fiscal stimulus in the autumn, it will be a key buffer against Brexit-related fallout.\u201d",

Oh, hang on, as you were, nothing\u2019s imminent.\u201d In other words, the dollar rose and then the dollar fell. Stocks trimmed gains and then recovered.</p> <p>Hunter at Capital Economics says Yellen\u2019s acknowledgement that \u201cthe case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened\u201d would appear to increase the likelihood of a near-term rate hike. </p> <p>He continues:</p> <p>\u201cOn balance, however, we think most officials will want to see more concrete evidence of a rebound in GDP growth and a rise in inflation towards the 2% target, with a December move still appearing the most likely outcome.</p> <p>\u201cIn a fairly upbeat assessment of current economic conditions, Yellen acknowledged the recent strength of consumption, despite the weakness of GDP growth. She also highlighted that even that subdued pace of growth \u201chas been sufficient to generate further improvement in the labour market\u201d. However, she repeated the warning that the future path of monetary policy will depend on the incoming data.\u201d</p> <p>And on the consultancy\u2019s view on when rates will rise, Hunter concludes: </p> <p>\u201cOverall, along with the more upbeat tone of the recent data, we think the odds of a September rate hike have probably increased. They will increase further if we are right in forecasting that non-farm payrolls increased by a solid 180,000 in August (data due next Friday). Nonetheless, with real GDP expanding by just 1.2% over the past 12 months and inflation continuing to run below target, we still think most Fed officials will want to wait until December before next raising rates.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c057c7e4b0396caaf99785\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-26T14:59:19.380Z\">3.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are some reassuring words for any readers struggling to make sense of today\u2019s Jackson Hole speech from Janet Yellen.</p> <p>Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, says the Fed Chair\u2019s address provided an opportunity for \u201cWall Street to play one of its favourite games: interpreting a speech by Janet Yellen.\u201d</p> <p>He writes:</p> <p>\u201cTruly, in terms of making her pronouncements cryptic, the most powerful central banker in the world is the daughter and heir to her predecessor but one, Alan Greenspan.</p> <p>Nothing Yellen has come up with comes close yet to Greenspan\u2019s \u201cI know you think you understand what you thought I said but I\u2019m not sure you realise that what you heard is not what I meant\u201d but <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20160826a.htm\">her presentation at the Jackson Hole symposium</a> was a pretty good effort.\u201d</p> <p><em>Full analysis following soon</em></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c05621e4b09fcabd06c924\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-26T14:49:35.448Z\">3.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Rob Carnell, chief international economist at the bank ING says it was a speech full of caveats from Janet Yellen and that \u201ca September rate hike remains awkward to sell to markets unless the inflation data start to move higher\u201d.</p> <p>He has pulled out two main messages, and one sub-message, from the lengthy Jackson Hole speech.</p> <p>\u201cThe first of the main messages was that <strong>the economy has continued to improve and that made the case for a rate hike more likely in the months ahead</strong>. </p> <p>\u201cBut \u201cmore likely\u201d does not mean \u201clikely\u201d, and markets are still reluctant to buy into a September rate hike story, at least without more information on the evolution of jobs growth, the pace of economic activity, or higher inflation.</p> <p>\u201cThe second message, which we suspect markets may also have problems accepting at face value, is that <strong>in the event of a return to crisis, more quantitative easing, coupled with \u201cforward guidance\u201d would likely provide sufficient stimulus to avert catastrophe</strong> (our words). This message might very well be filed under the heading of \u201cWell, they would say that wouldn\u2019t they.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cBut buried at the end of the speech, after a section that seemed to draw heavily on the recent paper by the San Francisco Fed President, John Williams\u2019, <strong>Yellen proposed an enhanced role for fiscal policy</strong>. She talked about the need for measures designed to improve productivity (fiscal, not monetary), as well as enhancing (fiscal) automatic stabilisers.

She said the case for a rate hike has strengthened in recent months. Also, the US economy continues to expand and has reached maximum employment with price stability. This saw the dollar pop higher initially and precious metals fall.

New policy tools, which helped the Federal Reserve respond to the financial crisis and Great Recession, are likely to remain useful in dealing with future downturns.

Similarly, stock markets initially trimmed gains on the prospect of higher interest rates and then rose again when traders had digested Yellen\u2019s remarks and decided it was too soon to worry. </p> <p><strong>Aberdeen Asset Management fixed income investment manager James Athey comments:</strong><br></p> <p> \u201cWhile the bulk of Yellen\u2019s opening remarks at Jackson Hole focussed on monetary policy over the long term, she stated that in her opinion the case for a rate hike has strengthened in recent months. But the lack of any specific signal with regards to the September meeting means markets are unlikely to react adversely to this fairly throwaway comment. Yellen\u2019s comments were largely focussed on the debate around the effectiveness of the Fed\u2019s toolkit.</p> <p>\u201cOf course she defended the success of previous policy and indeed the ability of the Fed to respond effectively in the future, however she wasn\u2019t shy of highlighting the need for government to assist in the heavy lifting through the use of supportive fiscal policy \u2013 a plea we regularly hear from ECB President Mario Draghi.<br></p> <p>\u201cHowever the elephant in the room is that the Fed may well be worshipping at a false idol. There\u2019s more and more evidence to show that inflation just isn\u2019t behaving in the way that economists think it should. The Fed should stop targeting consumer inflation and start looking at a wider suite of measures to judge the health of the economy and the appropriateness of their policy. Sadly it looks like the wide open plains of Wyoming have not inspired any soul searching.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57c04d6ce4b0486629890578\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-26T14:17:03.350Z\">3.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>So it\u2019s a hawkish message from Yellen, but is she telling us anything we didn\u2019t know already?</p> <p>Well, markets appear to be struggling to make sense of the message from Yellen.

                "bodyText":"Fed chair Janet Yellen has told the Jackson Hole meeting of central bankers that the case for rate rises has \u201cstrengthened\u201d but she gave markets little guidance on timing, saying they would be \u201cgradual\u201d and happen \u201cover time\u201d He fellow policymaker and vice chair Stanley Fischer followed up the speech with an interview where he highlighted a strengthening US economy and jobs market Stock markets initially trimmed gains on Yellen\u2019s speech, then recovered on relief that any rate rise could be some way off, only to drop again on Fischer\u2019s sanguine remarks US growth was revised slightly lower In the UK, the FTSE 100 has closed up 21 points, or 0.3%, at 6,838 Official UK data confirmed GDP grew 0.6% in the second quarter, with little evidence that the EU referendum at the end of the quarter had hurt investment. Consumer spending remained the main driver But economists warned that the second quarter figures would come to represent a high point for this year, with growth in the following months hit weaker business confidence on the back of the Brexit vote On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all the comments, we will be back on Tuesday. Here is CNBC\u2019s report on its interview with Fed vice chair Stanley Fischer, who gave markets more to mull over when he highlighted the US economy\u2019s recent strength. Hints that the Fed could raise rates as soon as next month, saw US stock markets erase earlier gains. Now Fed policymaker Stanley Fischer is talking about Janet Yellen\u2019s speech, adding fuel to the debate over whether the US central bank could raise rates as soon as September. He has been speaking to CNBC and appears to be hinting a near-term rate rise is still on the table. The dollar is strengthening and US stocks have trimmed gains. Here\u2019s a rather unsympathetic assessment of how financial markets reacted to Janet Yellen\u2019s speech from David Lamb, head of dealing a FEXCO Corporate Payments. He says traders are \u201cunable to see their terminals for the egg on their faces\u201d. Lamb comments: \u201cThe currency markets frequently live and die by the \u2018shoot first and ask questions later\u2019 motto. Today they were asking awkward questions just seconds after firing. \u201cNo sooner had the Fed\u2019s Chair uttered the magic words \u2018the case has strengthened\u2019 and trigger-happy traders were snapping up dollars in expectation of an near-immediate rate rise. \u201cBut as the seconds ticked by, it became increasingly clear that a hike is inevitable, but not imminent. \u201cCue a huge correction that saw the dollar slump well below its pre-announcement levels \u2013 leaving many traders unable to see their terminals for the egg on their faces. \u201cThe caveats came thick and fast. There\u2019s a range of possible rate rise scenarios, they could still be blown of course, and the killer line \u2013 gradual hikes are appropriate.\u201d US stock markets are rallying in the wake of Janet Yellen\u2019s speech, says Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading company IG. He believes Yellen opted to \u201cplease both hawks and doves\u201d. Beauchamp comments: \u201cThe \u2018Dip-buyers anonymous\u2019 team is working at full steam this afternoon, as Janet Yellen finds the right tone to encourage investors to step back into the market at the end of a tedious week. Clearly a modest rise in rates is taken as a sign of confidence in the economy, while the passing reference to other policy measures being potentially necessary in future crises was viewed as leaving the door open to the kind of broader monetary stimulus practised by the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan.\u201d Looking ahead, he adds: \u201cGiven the enthusiastic reception equity markets have given Janet Yellen, it looks like the steady grind higher will continue into the end of August.\u201d Andrew Hunter, US economist at the consultancy Capital Economics says Janet Yellen\u2019s comments are \u201cconsistent with a US rate hike by year-end\u201d. To re-cap, the Fed chair said the case for rate rises had strengthened, she rebuffed suggestions monetary policy had lost some of its power and made that now so familiar call from central bankers for fiscal policy to do its share of the heavy lifting. But there was little in the way of guidance on when US interest rates might rise and so markets were left doing a little dance that I would sum up - if readers will forgive the lack of sophistication - as \u201cOh no, rate hikes!!! Oh, hang on, as you were, nothing\u2019s imminent.\u201d In other words, the dollar rose and then the dollar fell. Stocks trimmed gains and then recovered. Hunter at Capital Economics says Yellen\u2019s acknowledgement that \u201cthe case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened\u201d would appear to increase the likelihood of a near-term rate hike. He continues: \u201cOn balance, however, we think most officials will want to see more concrete evidence of a rebound in GDP growth and a rise in inflation towards the 2% target, with a December move still appearing the most likely outcome. \u201cIn a fairly upbeat assessment of current economic conditions, Yellen acknowledged the recent strength of consumption, despite the weakness of GDP growth. She also highlighted that even that subdued pace of growth \u201chas been sufficient to generate further improvement in the labour market\u201d. However, she repeated the warning that the future path of monetary policy will depend on the incoming data.\u201d And on the consultancy\u2019s view on when rates will rise, Hunter concludes: \u201cOverall, along with the more upbeat tone of the recent data, we think the odds of a September rate hike have probably increased. They will increase further if we are right in forecasting that non-farm payrolls increased by a solid 180,000 in August (data due next Friday). Nonetheless, with real GDP expanding by just 1.2% over the past 12 months and inflation continuing to run below target, we still think most Fed officials will want to wait until December before next raising rates.\u201d Here are some reassuring words for any readers struggling to make sense of today\u2019s Jackson Hole speech from Janet Yellen. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, says the Fed Chair\u2019s address provided an opportunity for \u201cWall Street to play one of its favourite games: interpreting a speech by Janet Yellen.\u201d He writes: \u201cTruly, in terms of making her pronouncements cryptic, the most powerful central banker in the world is the daughter and heir to her predecessor but one, Alan Greenspan. Nothing Yellen has come up with comes close yet to Greenspan\u2019s \u201cI know you think you understand what you thought I said but I\u2019m not sure you realise that what you heard is not what I meant\u201d but her presentation at the Jackson Hole symposium was a pretty good effort.\u201d Full analysis following soon Rob Carnell, chief international economist at the bank ING says it was a speech full of caveats from Janet Yellen and that \u201ca September rate hike remains awkward to sell to markets unless the inflation data start to move higher\u201d. He has pulled out two main messages, and one sub-message, from the lengthy Jackson Hole speech. \u201cThe first of the main messages was that the economy has continued to improve and that made the case for a rate hike more likely in the months ahead. \u201cBut \u201cmore likely\u201d does not mean \u201clikely\u201d, and markets are still reluctant to buy into a September rate hike story, at least without more information on the evolution of jobs growth, the pace of economic activity, or higher inflation. \u201cThe second message, which we suspect markets may also have problems accepting at face value, is that in the event of a return to crisis, more quantitative easing, coupled with \u201cforward guidance\u201d would likely provide sufficient stimulus to avert catastrophe (our words). This message might very well be filed under the heading of \u201cWell, they would say that wouldn\u2019t they.\u201d \u201cBut buried at the end of the speech, after a section that seemed to draw heavily on the recent paper by the San Francisco Fed President, John Williams\u2019, Yellen proposed an enhanced role for fiscal policy. She talked about the need for measures designed to improve productivity (fiscal, not monetary), as well as enhancing (fiscal) automatic stabilisers. A cynic might paraphrase the speech as \u201cThings are looking brighter, but if it all goes wrong don\u2019t panic, there\u2019s always fiscal policy\u201d.\u201d David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco has been looking at that rollercoaster market reaction to the speech by Janet Yellen. He comments: \u201cHer speech was undeniably hawkish. She said the case for a rate hike has strengthened in recent months. Also, the US economy continues to expand and has reached maximum employment with price stability. This saw the dollar pop higher initially and precious metals fall. Nevertheless, she anticipates that gradual rate hikes are appropriate... \u201cBut as is so often the case, the initial market reaction can be misleading. As traders scanned below the headlines for the meat in the speech, perceptions over Dr Yellen\u2019s thinking changed. Gold and silver have surged as the dollar slumped. Possibly this is connected to her comments that the overall economic situation remains uncertain.\u201d Janet Yellen has also used her speech to join the chorus of central bankers insisting they are not all out of ammunition. Her speech to the Jackson Hole meeting, entitled \u201cThe Federal Reserve\u2019s Monetary Policy Toolkit: Past, Present, and Future\u201d, unsurprisingly concludes that it\u2019s a well-stocked and effective toolkit. Yellen says: \u201cAlthough fiscal policies and structural reforms can play an important role in strengthening the U.S. economy, my primary message today is that I expect monetary policy will continue to play a vital part in promoting a stable and healthy economy. New policy tools, which helped the Federal Reserve respond to the financial crisis and Great Recession, are likely to remain useful in dealing with future downturns. Additional tools may be needed and will be the subject of research and debate. But even if average interest rates remain lower than in the past, I believe that monetary policy will, under most conditions, be able to respond effectively.\u201d There are echoes of Bank of England governor Mark Carney, who shortly after the EU referendum said: \u201cThe charge that central banks are out of monetary ammunition is wrong, but the widespread absence of global price pressures demands that our firepower be well aimed.\u201d Also reacting to Janet Yellen\u2019s speech at Jackson Hole, Lee Ferridge, head of multi-asset strategy at State Street Global Markets North America has shared this view: \u201cDespite recent hints of an ongoing policy rethink at the FOMC [Federal Open Markets Committee], Janet Yellen\u2019s Jackson Hole speech did not break much new ground. Her comments could help arrest the dollar\u2019s recent decline and deal a blow to the rally in risky assets that we have seen in recent weeks. A move at the September meeting remains less likely but a move before year end now looks a distinct possibility should US data continue to improve.\u201d Some more reactions coming in to Janet Yellen\u2019s speech now, which as we noted earlier left the markets in a bit of a muddle. The dollar initially strengthened as the Fed chair hinted at further rate rises but then lost those gains, possibly as the timing of any such tightening seems to be some way off. Similarly, stock markets initially trimmed gains on the prospect of higher interest rates and then rose again when traders had digested Yellen\u2019s remarks and decided it was too soon to worry. Aberdeen Asset Management fixed income investment manager James Athey comments: \u201cWhile the bulk of Yellen\u2019s opening remarks at Jackson Hole focussed on monetary policy over the long term, she stated that in her opinion the case for a rate hike has strengthened in recent months. But the lack of any specific signal with regards to the September meeting means markets are unlikely to react adversely to this fairly throwaway comment. Yellen\u2019s comments were largely focussed on the debate around the effectiveness of the Fed\u2019s toolkit. \u201cOf course she defended the success of previous policy and indeed the ability of the Fed to respond effectively in the future, however she wasn\u2019t shy of highlighting the need for government to assist in the heavy lifting through the use of supportive fiscal policy \u2013 a plea we regularly hear from ECB President Mario Draghi. \u201cHowever the elephant in the room is that the Fed may well be worshipping at a false idol. There\u2019s more and more evidence to show that inflation just isn\u2019t behaving in the way that economists think it should. The Fed should stop targeting consumer inflation and start looking at a wider suite of measures to judge the health of the economy and the appropriateness of their policy. Sadly it looks like the wide open plains of Wyoming have not inspired any soul searching.\u201d So it\u2019s a hawkish message from Yellen, but is she telling us anything we didn\u2019t know already? Well, markets appear to be struggling to make sense of the message from Yellen. US stocks initially trimmed gains only to rise again. The dollar has now reversed its initial gains against the pound and euro. Here are some of the early reactions (including from UK commentators, who are counting down to a long weekend with a public holiday on Monday): Those remarks on a stronger case for rate hikes in the US have seen US stock markets trim some of their gains and pushed the dollar up against the euro and pound. This key extract from the speech shows Janet Yellen and her fellow policymakers are still keen to come across as avid data watchers, but she clearly sees a better case for rate rises: \u201cIn light of the continued solid performance of the labor market and our outlook for economic activity and inflation, I believe the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened in recent months. Of course, our decisions always depend on the degree to which incoming data continues to confirm the Committee\u2019s outlook,\u201d she said. Yellen has told her audience at Jackson Hole that the case for raising US interest rates has strengthened in recent months. She cited improvements in the jobs market and hopes for modest GDP growth. Here is the full speech. US markets are up in early trading as investors await Yellen\u2019s speech at Jackson Hole. Twenty minutes to go. Dow Jones: +0.3% at 18,495 S&amp;P 500: +0.3% at 2,178 Nasdaq: +0.2% at 5,222 Before Janet Yellen speaks in less than an hour, there have been some important developments in the cruise liner industry. David Hasselhoff of Knight Rider and Baywatch fame will set sail on his first official fan cruise on 4 November next year. The six-day tour on Costa Favolosa will begin in Italy and call at various European ports. The ticket price starts at \u20ac599 (\u00a3513) and \u201cDavid is on board with you for the duration of the cruiser\u201d, apparently. Events will include a concert, a get-together with the Hoff, an autograph session and \u2013 an evening with David \u201cin the large theatre\u201d.... Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s have recalled some 500ml cartons of their Cookie Dough flavour ice cream over fears they might contain small pieces of metal. Four batches are thought to have been affected and UK customers have been asked to check batch numbers printed at the bottom of their pots. The ice-cream maker advised customers to throw the product away if it was from one of the batches. It said in a safety notice: The company has identified a specific production period during which Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s Cookie Dough 500ml may have been affected and, as safety remains a top priority, Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s is voluntarily recalling four batch codes of Cookie Dough 500ml from sale. As a precaution, everyone with a 500ml tub of Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s Cookie Dough in their freezers at home should check the batch number on the bottom of their tub to make sure it\u2019s not affected. And, if it matches the batch numbers listed above, they should not eat the product and, instead, we ask them to discard the product in the usual household bin. (The batch codes affected are L62110L011, L62111L011, L62112L011 and L62113L011.) Fancy an ice cream anyone? Simon Smith, chief economist at FxPro, thinks Janet Yellen should take a cautious approach to her Jackson Hole speech, which is coming up in a hour an a quarter. Smith says: Yellen will do her best to sound upbeat on the US economy, but not to tie her hands into tightening policy this year. The Fed has led the market down the garden path once too often on this front, not least at last year\u2019s Jackson Hole summit, so she\u2019d do well to keep her options open this time and not cause a similar furore this year.\u201d He adds makes the point that central bankers are running out of rope when it comes to monetary policy stimulus: The issue is that monetary policy is reaching its limits, even the various forms of quantitative easing and negative interest rates being imposed. This is most true for Japan and the eurozone. That may encourage central bankers to be even more aggressive in their approach, but there are always unintended consequences. This is certainly true in the eurozone, given the costs that negative rates impose on banks and (increasingly) their customers. US GDP growth for the second quarter has been revised down a touch to an annual rate of 1.1%, from an earlier estimate of 1.2%. The second estimate from the US Commerce Department was in line with the expectations of economists polled by Reuters. It followed 0.8% growth in the first quarter. European markets remain subdued as we await Yellen\u2019s speech. The FTSE 100 is down just three points at 6,820. It\u2019s a similar story across Europe, with the STOXX 600 index down 0.1 points to 341.9. Earlier in Japan, figures showed consumer prices fell for the fifth month in a row in July, dealing a blow to prime minister Shinzo Abe and his bid to combat deflation. Annual deflation deepened last month, with consumer prices falling by 0.5% in the year to July. It followed a 0.4% drop in June and was the biggest fall in more than three years as businesses delayed price hikes because of weak demand. The data will intensify the pressure on Japan\u2019s central bank to announce more stimulus, on top of the huge amount of money it has already pumped into the world\u2019s third largest economy. Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics: While economic activity is on the mend, the slump in import prices suggests that underlying inflation will continue to fall in coming months. The Bank of Japan will find it increasingly difficult to blame falling energy prices for the decline in overall consumer prices. Ana Thaker, Market Economist at PhillipCapital UK, says investors will be looking to this afternoon\u2019s US GDP number, as well as Yellen\u2019s speech, for clues about the timing of the next rate rise. Strong data combined with a hawkish Yellen could see the dollar rally as August comes to a close and markets look towards the [rate-setting] FOMC meeting in September. The Fed are relying on strong economic data to advocate a long anticipated rate hike so data over the last half of 2016 is crucial to both markets and the Fed in determining the direction of policy and markets. We are at a crucial point in the course of monetary policy for the Fed and data points are more pertinent than ever. Markus Allenspach, head of fixed income research at Julius Baer, says Yellen is unlikely to give any clear signals about September\u2019s Fed meeting: For weeks already, the market is waiting anxiously for Yellen\u2019s speech, as members of the Federal Reserve often presented conflicting views in the public about the necessity and timing of rate hikes. We doubt, however, that Yellen will give clear directions today; in her view, monetary policy decisions are taken by the FOMC as a committee. Esther George, president of the Kansas City Federal Reserve and host of the Jackson Hole meeting, has been speaking to Bloomberg from the event. Having already voted against the majority for a rate rise, she suggests she\u2019ll vote again for higher rates at the Fed\u2019s September meeting. When I look at where we are with the job market, when I look at inflation and our forecasts for that, I think it\u2019s time to move. Where it will look by the September meeting we\u2019ll have to wait and see if anything changes fundamentally. Ahead of Yellen\u2019s speech, traders are forecasting a one in three chance of a US rate rise in September. Back to the main event of the day in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Once Friday\u2019s proceedings get underway at Jackson Lake Lodge, we won\u2019t have long to wait for Janet Yellen\u2019s speech as the chair of the US Federal Reserve is first up at 8am Mountain Time (3pm in the UK). The meeting runs from 8am to 2pm on both Friday and Saturday, with a series of papers presented, speeches given, and discussions held. As Larry Elliott, the Guardian\u2019s economics editor put it, \u201cJackson Hole is Davos for central bankers\u201d. The Bank of England\u2019s Minouche Shafik will give a speech titled adapting to changes in the financial market landscape at 3.50pm UK time. Other topics up for discussion on Friday include negative interest rates, and \u201calternative monetary frameworks\u201d. The main topic on Saturday is central bank balance sheets. The full agenda is published here. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY Item Club, says predictions of a self-inflicted Brexit recession are overdone. An uncertainty-driven slowdown still seems likely. But with a number of recent surveys from the CBI and others showing bouncebacks from post-vote lows, strong official retail sales numbers for July, and the support offered by the package of measures announced by the Bank of England, predictions that the economy will fall into recession look unduly pessimistic. The pound is up slightly against the dollar at $1.3203 (+0.1%). It is flat against the euro at \u20ac1.688. UK data this week has generally been better-than-expected and a survey published overnight by YouGov/Cebr showed a surge in consumer confidence in August. The headline index increased 3.2 points to 109.8 in August. It was the biggest monthly jump since February 2013 after the economy performed better than expected. The August rise followed a sharp drop in July, suggesting initial shock and fears over the June Brexit vote subsided this month. YouGov interviews about 6,000 consumers a month, asking them about their household finances, property prices, job security and business activity in the workplace. The only indicator to show a drop in August was job security over the next 12 months. Here is the Guardian\u2019s full story on the second estimate of Q2 growth, which was confirmed at 0.6%: Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics is decidedly gloomy about the outlook for the UK economy. He says consumers will start to feel the pinch from rising inflation next year: Looking ahead, consumers might be able to maintain strong growth in their spending for another quarter, but when inflation picks up in earnest early next year and firms follow through on plans to freeze hiring, they will have to slow down. Meanwhile, the slight rise in business investment in Q2 provides little reassurance about the post-referendum outlook, since few businesses anticipated the Leave vote and surveys suggest firms are recoiling from major financial commitments in Q3. As a result, we continue to see a high risk that the economy enters a mild recession over the coming quarters. Deloitte\u2019s chief economist Ian Stewart, says the consumer recovery is going strong: The UK entered the post-referendum period with good momentum. Household spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of the economy and is growing at the fastest rate in eight years. We see few signs that Brexit has derailed the consumer recovery. Scott Bowman at Capital Economics, says the Brexit vote will weigh on growth in the second half of the year: UK households shrugged off pre-referendum uncertainty, driving an acceleration in GDP growth in the second quarter. Looking ahead, growth looks set to slow significantly in the second half of the year as uncertainty related to the Brexit vote takes its toll. We think that growth will fall to around zero in Q3 and Q4, mainly due to falls in business investment. Here are three key charts from the second estimate of Q2 growth, which came in at 0.6%... 1. The UK economy has grown every quarter since the first quarter of 2013: 2. On the output side of the economy, only the services sector is back above pre-crisis levels: 3. Households shrugged off uncertainty in the run-up to the 23 June referendum, as consumer spending continued to be a key driver of growth: Joe Grice, chief economist at the ONS has commented on this mornings figures which confirmed the UK economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter, following 0.4% growth in the first quarter. Today\u2019s figures reinforce the picture that the economy grew strongly in April, and then remained relatively flat in May and June. Business investment grew in the second quarter, partly thanks to companies spending on transport equipment such as cars and planes. However, levels of investment remained lower than at the same period last year. Our survey returns, which include the period leading up to and immediately following the referendum, show no sign so far of uncertainty having significantly affected investment or GDP. The ONS says there is no sign in the GDP data that uncertainty in the run-up to the EU referendum affected investment. The second estimate of growth (confirmed at 0.6%) gives a more detailed picture of how different parts of the economy performed between April and June. Specifically it shed some light on the spending side. Business investment increased by 0.5% over the quarter, beating expectations of a 0.8% fall and a 0.6% fall in the first quarter. Household spending was the strongest in almost two years in the second quarter, up 0.9% from 0.7% in the first quarter. In terms of output, services growth was confirmed at 0.5% and industrial output growth was confirmed at 2.1%. Construction output was revised down however, falling by 0.7% and not 0.4% as initially thought. Growth of 0.6% in the second quarter has been confirmed by the Office for National Statistics. More soon. French consumer confidence ticked up in August, to 97 from 96 in July. It followed a drop in confidence in the previous two months according to the INSEE figures. Confidence among households about their personal finance situation improved sharply, jumping seven points to highest level since October 2007. The French economy was flat in the second quarter, a second estimate of GDP from the statistics office INSEE showed. Zero growth between April and June followed 0.7% growth in the first quarter. INSEE said there was a sharp slowdown in household spending, while trade made a positive contribution after imports fell more than exports. There is little movement in European markets this morning as investors await Janet Yellen\u2019s speech at Jackson Hole. They will be looking for clues from the Fed chair about whether to expect the next rise in US interest rates in September, December, or 2017. FTSE 100: -0.2% at 6,802 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.1% at 10,537 France\u2019s CAC: +0.1% at 4,409 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.7% at 16,587 Spain\u2019s IBEX: 0.3% at 8,623 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.03% at 342 The Jackson Hole economic symposium has been hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City since 1978. Representing the Bank of England are Minouche Shafik, deputy governor for markets and banking, and Kristin Forbes, an external member of the Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee. Bank of England governor Mark Carney, and European Central Bank president Mario Draghi, will not attend. Also coming up today... We will get the second estimate of UK growth in the second-quarter from the Office for National Statistics. Economists polled expect growth to be confirmed at 0.6%. But Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, says there is a risk that the number could be revised lower, \u201cparticularly since we did see some evidence of a slowdown in late May and June as the referendum date approached\u201d. The latest estimate will provide more details on how the different parts of the economy performed between April and June. So far the consumer side of the economy appears to have held up well since the Brexit vote on 23 June, but those numbers as well as business investment figures will be closely scrutinised in the coming months for signs of waning confidence. In the US (before Yellen speaks at 3pm UK time) we will get the second estimate of Q2 growth from the world\u2019s largest economy. European markets are expected to open slightly lower this morning as traders pause for breath before Yellen\u2019s speech. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The day has finally arrived. At 8am Mountain Time, or 3pm UK time, the chair of the US Federal Reserve Janet Yellen will deliver her keenly anticipated speech at the 2016 Jackson Hole symposium. The event is hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, and got underway last night with a reception and dinner at the Jackson Lake Lodge in Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming. The full agenda for the meeting of the world\u2019s central bankers can be found here. This year\u2019s theme is Designing Resilient Monetary Policy Frameworks for the Future. But the main event awaited by investors all week is Yellen\u2019s speech. The title of the speech is The Fed\u2019s Monetary Policy Toolkit, but traders and commentators will be looking specifically for any hints on the timing of the next Fed rate rise. This is what markets have been waiting for all week. We will bring you commentary in the run-up to the speech, the speech itself, and reaction thereafter. Thank you for joining us.",
