After weeks of weakness the impetus to buy the dollar appears too strong to hold back, which would provide a cogent reason for why indices have little ability to move higher.

If we can take the latest GDP data at face value, then the first quarter of 2016 saw US activity slide to an almost standstill. Yet, the labour market continues to fare well and was the one bright spot amid a general soft patch last month</p> <p>Over time, activity and labour data are likely to converge, but right now there is little evidence to untangle how this will play out. Were the April jobs figures to come in on a softer note, then this would endorse the weakness in activity and imply that lagging variables such as employment are also now turning lower. Conversely, if the labour data stays resilient then we will further linger in a state of limbo as either it is the activity data that is the aberration or the lags have yet to kick in. The April jobs report may in fact accentuate the stagflationary trends (soft activity, rising inflation) noted of late:</p> <p><strong>Payrolls to come in a tad softer than expectations</strong> (ING: +190,000; consensus: +200,000). While some indicators continue to signal a robust hiring backdrop, the softer ADP print suggests that there are some (albeit marginal) downside risks to jobs growth in April. </p> <p><strong>Upward bias in the unemployment rate still in place</strong> (ING: 5.0%; consensus: 4.9%). The discrepancy between payrolls and the household survey (from which the unemployment rate rate is derived) is still evident, while the very strong labour force growth is unlikely to endure. A slight correction in both components may put some upward pressure on the unemployment rate.</p> <p><strong>Robust underlying wage pressures should result in decent headline wage growth </strong>(ING: 2.4% year on year; consensus 2.4%). We note that the headline AHE measure has been hovering at the lower end of a range of US wage indicators, with the Atlanta Fed\u2019s wage growth tracker continuing to tick higher (on a moving average basis). Thus, we think the odds of a positive wage growth surprise are slightly higher this month.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-05-05T15:07:26.095Z\">at 4.07pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-572b53e7e4b0d509448a6423\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-05T14:13:07.499Z\">3.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US crude stocks rise by more than forecast</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US crude stocks increased by a higher than expected 2.8m barrels last week, according to the Energy Information Administration.</p> <p>Analysts had forecast a rise of 1.7m barrels.

                "bodyText":"Some reasonable results from the likes of BT helped stock markets recover some poise after the volatile start to trading in May. There were more signs of weakness in the global economy, including disappointing UK services data and US jobs figures. But oil moved higher as supply concerns outweighed news of higher than expected US crude inventories, giving some support to commodity stocks. But there was little to really enthuse investors ahead of Friday\u2019s US non-farm payroll numbers, and the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up just 5.23 points or 0.09% at 6117.25 Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.24% to 9851.86 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.11% at 4319.46 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.07% to 17,923.90 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.41% at 8689.4 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.94% to 601.48 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 41 points or 0.24%. On that note, we\u2019ll close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow for non-farm payroll day. More on Greece, where strikes are set for the weekend and a parliamentary vote on reforms is due on Sunday: Global economic pressures which have dissuaded the US Federal Reserve from raising interest rates again could be waning, according to one of the central bank\u2019s policymakers. St Louis Fed president James Bullard said in a speech in California: International influences on the U.S. economy have been widely discussed in global financial markets during the last several years. Those factors appear to be waning during the first half of 2016. Financial stress has fallen according to recent readings. The effects of a stronger dollar appear to be waning. But he said there was evidence for both the Fed\u2019s view of a gradual pace of rate increases and the market\u2019s belief in only a few increases: Evidence from labor markets, inflation readings and global influences suggests the [Federal Reserve\u2019s] median projection may be more nearly correct. Evidence from readings on GDP growth and market-based inflation expectations suggests the market view of the path of the policy rate may be more nearly correct. Which does not appear to shut the door to a June hike, following December\u2019s increase. Markets are struggling to make any headway ahead of Friday\u2019s US non-farm payroll numbers. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, says: While markets have stabilised after days of losses, there seems little that can revive bullish sentiment as the day heads to its close. Despite an early attempt at a rally, indices remain under pressure, and it looks as if sellers will continue to dominate as the week enters its final session. ...Stocks remain under pressure, and with non-farm payrolls tomorrow the outlook remains resolutely grim. Further US dollar strength provides the reason for why there is little hope for indices at the present time. After weeks of weakness the impetus to buy the dollar appears too strong to hold back, which would provide a cogent reason for why indices have little ability to move higher. Ahead of non-farm payrolls, the market waits to see if the figure can best the number produced by ADP figures on Wednesday. Meanwhile Greece\u2019s unions have called a general strike for Friday and Saturday to protest against the tax and pension reforms due to be debated in parliament over the weekend, Reuters is reporting. Over in Greece, there has been talk of a possible weekend parliamentary vote on pension reforms, ahead of the Eurogroup meeting on Monday. The Syriza government is reportedly meeting on Friday: A solid US non-farms report on Friday could spark a near term revival in the US dollar, says Rob Carnell at ING Bank: April jobs report might uphold the stagflationary trend in US data. If we can take the latest GDP data at face value, then the first quarter of 2016 saw US activity slide to an almost standstill. Yet, the labour market continues to fare well and was the one bright spot amid a general soft patch last month Over time, activity and labour data are likely to converge, but right now there is little evidence to untangle how this will play out. Were the April jobs figures to come in on a softer note, then this would endorse the weakness in activity and imply that lagging variables such as employment are also now turning lower. Conversely, if the labour data stays resilient then we will further linger in a state of limbo as either it is the activity data that is the aberration or the lags have yet to kick in. The April jobs report may in fact accentuate the stagflationary trends (soft activity, rising inflation) noted of late: Payrolls to come in a tad softer than expectations (ING: +190,000; consensus: +200,000). While some indicators continue to signal a robust hiring backdrop, the softer ADP print suggests that there are some (albeit marginal) downside risks to jobs growth in April. Upward bias in the unemployment rate still in place (ING: 5.0%; consensus: 4.9%). The discrepancy between payrolls and the household survey (from which the unemployment rate rate is derived) is still evident, while the very strong labour force growth is unlikely to endure. A slight correction in both components may put some upward pressure on the unemployment rate. Robust underlying wage pressures should result in decent headline wage growth (ING: 2.4% year on year; consensus 2.4%). We note that the headline AHE measure has been hovering at the lower end of a range of US wage indicators, with the Atlanta Fed\u2019s wage growth tracker continuing to tick higher (on a moving average basis). Thus, we think the odds of a positive wage growth surprise are slightly higher this month. US crude stocks increased by a higher than expected 2.8m barrels last week, according to the Energy Information Administration. Analysts had forecast a rise of 1.7m barrels. Meanwhile gasoline stocks rose unexpectedly by 536,000 compared to expectations of a 144,000 barrel decline. But stockpiles of distillate, which includes diesel and heating oil, fell by 1.3m barrels, more than the 83,000 decline expected. Brent is currently up 3% at $46 a barrel despite the higher than expected inventory figures. The price is being supported by the wildfire threatening Canada\u2019s oil sands region, as well as growing tensions in Libya. In the latest pay revolt nearly 24% of shareholders at Reckitt Benckiser voted against the remuneration policy and nearly 18% voted against the remuneration report. At Ladbrokes 42% voted against the remuneration report. The latest data on US jobs will not give much grounds for optimism for Friday\u2019s non-farm numbers, says David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco. He said: [Weekly jobless claims] have generally been a bright spot over the past few years. They used to come in around the high 300,000s \u2013 even topping 400,000 at the end of 2012. But now we are used to seeing claims coming in below 300,000 on a regular basis. But now traders will focus on the main event which is tomorrow\u2019s Non-Farm Payroll release. Early expectations were for an increase of just over 200,000. But the \u201cwhisper number\u201d will probably be well below that following yesterday\u2019s grim ADP number. Today\u2019s jobless claims together with a worse than expected Challenger Job-cut number haven\u2019t helped either. More US employment data ahead of Friday\u2019s non-farm numbers. After a jump in the number of US workers laid off last month it is probably no surprise that jobless claims rose last week. According to the Labor department the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose 17,000 to 274,000, the largest increase since February of last year. Analysts had expected a figure of around 260,000. Donald Trump also says he\u2019d scrap a swathe of federal regulations which are (he argues) holding back US firms. He told CNBC: \u201cWe\u2019re lowering taxes very substantially and we\u2019re going to be getting rid of a tremendous amount of regulations.\u201d With the Republican nomination in the bag, Donald Trump is now turning his attention to how he\u2019d run the American economy if he makes it to the White House. And he\u2019s just declared that he would probably replace Janet Yellen as chair of the Federal Reserve when her current term expires. Yellen\u2019s crime? Not being a Republican, apparently. Speaking to CNBC, Trump declared: I have nothing against Janet Yellen whatsoever. She\u2019s been doing her job, and I have absolutely nothing against her. I don\u2019t know her, but she\u2019s a very capable person and people that I know have a very high regard for her. But she\u2019s not a Republican\u2026 When her time is up, I would most likely replace her because of the fact that it would be appropriate. But in a typical piece of Trump logic, the billionaire businessman also backed Yellen\u2019s monetary policy stance: She\u2019s a low interest-rate person, she\u2019s always been a low interest-rate person \u2026and I must be honest, I\u2019m a low interest rate person. If we raise interest rates, and the dollar starts getting too strong, we\u2019re going to have some very major problems. Yellen\u2019s current four-year term expires in February 2018, but she could potentially serve a second term (as did her predecessor, Ben Bernanke). Bloomberg\u2019s Jon Ferro questions Trump\u2019s logic on this one: You can watch a clip of the interview here. We also have worrying news from America. The number of US workers laid off last month jumped, and hit the highest level for an April in seven years. It indicates American companies are feeling the pinch, after its economy slowed to virtual stagnation in the first quarter of 2016. Reuters has the details: Layoffs by U.S.-based companies accelerated in April, sending year-to-date job cuts to the highest level since 2009, a private study reported Thursday. Domestic companies announced plans to let go 65,141 workers last month, a 35 percent increase from March, according to the report by outplacement firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas . In the first four months of the year, employers said they would hand out 250,061 pink slips. That is the highest total for the January-to-April period since 2009. \u201cWe continue to see large scale layoffs in the energy sector, where low oil prices are driving down profits. However, we are also seeing heavy downsizing activity in other areas, such as computers and retail, where changing consumer trends are creating a lot of volatility,\u201d Challenger CEO John A. Challenger said in a statement. Meanwhile in London, the boss of consumer goods group Reckitt Benckiser has apologised over a humidifier steriliser scandal that has claimed around 100 lives. Julia Kollewe reports: Rakesh Kapoor, chief executive of Reckitt Benckiser told shareholders at an AGM in central London: \u201cI\u2019m personally very sorry and very much regret that our Oxy product caused harm to people in Korea.\u201d He said the company had \u201cmade a mistake\u201d and vowed to ensure that \u201csomething like this never happens again\u201d. He will meet representatives from one patient group, who were demonstrating outside the AGM, in his office on Friday. The humidifier steriliser is believed to have killed nearly 100 people and injured others. It was invented in Korea and only sold there. Reckitt acquired the firm that made the steriliser in 2001. Some of these products were also manufactured by rival companies. Kapoor\u2019s comments come three days after the head of Reckitt Benckiser Korea and Japan was struck while apologising for the scandal. James Sproule, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, fears the Britain\u2019s economy is suffering from more than the Brexit jitters. Sproule warns: \u201cThese figures will be put down to uncertainty over the EU referendum, but while this may explain part of the fall, we should also consider whether there are underlying factors feeding into a less rosy economic picture. \u201cThe question we must ask is whether growth is built on solid foundations. My concern is that the exceptional period we are living in of low rates and cheap money is not the basis of a sustainable economy. We do not know what the outcome of the referendum will be, or the exact effects on the economy in the short and longer term, but this uncertainty is not an excuse to take our eye off the ball on more fundamental issues of economic sustainability.\u201d And this chart, from the Indie\u2019s Ben Chu, underlines how worrying this week\u2019s data is: With Britain\u2019s economy seemingly slowing, there\u2019s even less chance of the Bank of England raising interest rates in the next few months. Some economists are even speculating that the BoE could cut rates this year. And Chris Williamson of data firm Markit has confirmed that the Bank has previously eased monetary policy when its PMI readings have been this week. This graph plots Markit\u2019s PMI (dark blue) against interest rate cuts (light blue) and bouts of quantitative easing (grey). Williamson says: The three Markit/CIPS PMI surveys collectively indicated the weakest rate of expansion since March 2013, with growth slowing across the board. The combined Output Index fell from 53.6 in March to 51.9 in April. The latest reading is consistent with a near-stalling of economic growth, down to just 0.1% in April. The deterioration in April pushes the surveys into territory which has in the past seen the Bank of England start to worry about the need to revive growth, either by cutting interest rates or non-standard measures such as quantitative easing. This chart shows why the weak service sector data probably show that UK growth has slowed sharply. It\u2019s from German bank Berenberg. Their economist Kallum Pickering, says there are \u201csubstantial downside risks\u201d to UK growth, but.. If, as we expect, the UK votes to remain in the EU, then the growth rate should recover to its trend rate of 0.5% qoq in the second half of the year. While there are some risks relating to the current account deficit and concerns that households are returning to pre-Lehman borrowing and saving habits, underlying fundamentals are sound. Anthony Cheung of City firm Amplify Trading agrees that the UK economic picture has deteriorated: Dean Turner, Economist at UBS Wealth Management, agrees that Britain\u2019s economy appears to have weakened in April. And that means growth in the current quarter will be lower than in January-March, when GDP expanded by only 0.4%. Turner says: Uncertainty over the EU Referendum is clearly taking its toll on activity and with this backdrop, we expect second quarter GDP growth to dip below the already disappointing first quarter print. With such subdued levels of growth, we expect the Bank of England will hold fire on interest rates in next week\u2019s MPC meeting, and for many months thereafter.\u201d Britain\u2019s services sector makes up around three-quarters of the economy, so this slowdown is pretty worrying. David Noble, CEO of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, says June\u2019s EU referendum is partly to blame. \u201cThe UK\u2019s services sector is stuck between a rock and a hard place. Mounting global economic uncertainty at the top of the supply chain and the reality of the new National Living Wage at the bottom mean that firms are feeling the pinch from both ends. As a result, the sector credited with being the main driver of the UK\u2019s economic fortunes appears to be slowing down. \u201cThe looming EU referendum has had a profound effect on the sector, keeping prices relatively stagnant and delaying new orders. At the other end of the supply chain, the National Living Wage has compounded cost increases, resulting in the overall rate of input price inflation hitting a 27-month high. Together, these factors have squeezed margins while fewer than half of businesses expect to grow over the next twelve months. Breaking: Britain\u2019s service sector\u2019s growth has slumped to its lowest level in three years. Markit, the data firm, says its service sector PMI has fallen to 52.3 in April, down from 53.7 in March. That\u2019s the weakest level since February 2013, and close to the 50-point mark that splits expansion from contraction. Firms reported that job creation slowed last month, while business optimism has fallen to a three year low too. This makes a hat-trick of bad UK economic news this week. Construction firms reported yesterday that growth has hit a three-year low, while the factory PMI showed that manufacturing is now contacting. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, fears that UK economic growth almost stalled last month: \u201cThe slowdown in the service sector follows similar weakness in manufacturing and construction to make a triple-whammy of disappointing news on the health of the economy at the start of the second quarter. \u201cThe PMI surveys are collectively indicating a near- stalling of economic growth, down from 0.4% in the first quarter to just 0.1% in April. \u201cSome of the slowdown may be attributable to the early timing of Easter, though April also saw an increase in the number of companies reporting that uncertainty about the EU referendum caused customers to hold back on purchases, exacerbating already-weak demand linked to global growth jitters and ongoing government spending cuts. More to follow.... Here we go..... Lets see if those forecasts of a small slowdown are accurate. As well as posting stronger profits, BT has announced a \u00a36bn investment in broadband and 4G coverage: You can now buy shares in Britain\u2019s luxury chocolate firm, Hotel Chocolat. The company floated on the stock market this morning, raising \u00a320m each for its two founders. The IPO will also yield \u00a312m to fund new store openings, as its expansion drive continues. Launching a new print newspaper, in this time of digital revolution, was always a risky move. So you can understand why Trinity Mirror is pulling its latest offering, The New Day, after seeing sales falling to 30,000. But the speed of the move is a shock \u2013 the paper only launched 9 weeks ago. The news broke last night (here\u2019s Mark Sweney\u2019s piece), and Trinity has confirmed it to shareholders this morning, saying: Although The New Day has received many supportive reviews and built a strong following on Facebook, the circulation for the title is below our expectations. As a result, we have decided to close the title on 6 May 2016. Whilst disappointing, the launch and subsequent closure have provided new insights into enhancing our newspapers and a number of these opportunities will be considered over time. But that\u2019s not the only bad news. Trinity has also revealed that revenues from print advertising has fall almost 20% - highlighting the tough conditions across media.... Europe\u2019s stock markets have made a nervous start to trading, after two days of losses. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is up 15 points, or 0.2%, while Germany\u2019s DAX is up 0.3% and the French CAC is flat. BT is leading the London risers, up 3%, after reporting a 5% jump in underlying earnings this morning. Supermarket group Morrisons has gained 1.7%; after a troubled time, it posted a 0.7% rise in underlying sales this morning. It also reported that Amazon is about to start supplying its customers with Morrisons\u2019 products, though a deal announced recently. Energy firm Centrica, though, has slumped by 7% after it announced plans to sell around \u00a3770m of new shares to cut its debt pile. Turkey\u2019s stock markets has plunged by 2% at the start of trading, as investors react to the country\u2019s latest political crisis. Investors are alarmed by reports that prime minister Ahmet Davuto\u011flo is poised to resign, following a power struggle with president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. The Turkish lira is also suffering, shedding 5% overnight. Davuto\u011flo and Erdo\u011fan held crunch talks last night, but failed to mend their disagreements over key areas such as economic policy. Local reports suggest that elections for a new party leader to replace Davuto\u011flo could soon be called, causing fresh instability at a time when Turkey is already grappling with high inflation and the refugee crisis. Anxiety over a possible global downturn has hit stock markets in Asia again. The Hong Kong, South Korea and Philippines markets all shed around 0.5%. This send stocks across the region down for the seventh day running, its longest losing streak of the year Sharon Zollner of ANZ Bank New Zealand Ltd explains that signs of economic slowdown is hurting confidence again: Markets seem to be at something of a crossroads at present, waiting for clearer signals on whether U.S. activity will bounce back in the second quarter,\u201d. \u201cIf the global economy were to tip into recession at some point, what ammo, precisely, do central banks have left that won\u2019t do more harm than good?\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. So far this week, the UK economic data has been quite disappointing. Construction firms are growing at the slowest rate in three years, and activity across Britain\u2019s manufacturers is actually shrinking again. And investors are worried that the service sector, which makes up around 80% of the economy, may also be weakening. At 9.30am, the latest Service Sector PMI hits the wires, and it may show that growth slowed in April. A bad reading will surely reinforce concerns that the UK economy is running out of steam, with the Brexit referendum of 23 June casting a darker shadow over the country. CMC Markets\u2019 Michael Hewson has the details: Both manufacturing and construction PMI\u2019s came in short of expectations with manufacturing slipping into contraction territory for the first time since early 2013. Given how important the services sector is to the UK economy we really need to see a decent number here or run the risk that we see a growth downgrade next week from the latest Bank of England inflation report. Expectations are for a slight decline to 53.6 from 53.7. After two days of heavy falls, European stock markets are expected to inch higher this morning. But there\u2019s still plenty of angst about global growth prospects, and recent fluctuations in the foreign exchange markets. And on the corporate front, we\u2019re getting results from telecoms firms BT, supermarket chain Morrisons, and newspaper group Trinity Mirror.",

                "bodyText":"A wealthy British investor has been dragged into a deadly dispute over a South African mine, after a community leader was killed amid allegations that excavating the site would damage the environment. Threatening comments by Mark Caruso, the chief executive of the firm at the heart of the dispute, have also served to heighten tensions, say locals. Graham Edwards, chief executive of the property group Telereal Trillium, owns a stake of at least 23% in the Australian mining firm Mineral Commodities (MRC), which wants to mine for titanium at Xolobeni in South Africa\u2019s Eastern Cape. The plan faces opposition from members of the local Amadiba community, who say it will cause environmental problems and disturb ancestral gravesites on the 14-mile-long stretch of coastal sand dunes. Tensions in the community have escalated since the shooting earlier this year of Sikhosiphi \u201cBazooka\u201d Rhadebe, who was chairman of the Amadiba crisis committee. There is no suggestion that the company had any involvement with violence against opponents of its project. But local people have expressed dismay over the aggressive rhetoric deployed by Caruso, chief executive of MRC. In an email to \u201cstakeholders\u201d in the project in 2015, Caruso quoted the biblical line used by Samuel L Jackson\u2019s character in the Quentin Tarantino film Pulp Fiction before he shoots some drug dealers. \u201cFrom time to time I have sought the Bible for understanding and perhaps I can direct you to Ezekiel 25:17,\u201d wrote Caruso. \u201cAnd I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger, those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee.\u201d In a separate email, Caruso vowed to crush enemies of the project. \u201cI am enlivened by [the] opportunity to grind all resistance to my presence and the presence of MRC \u2026 into the animals [sic] of history as a failed campaign,\u201d he said. In March this year, Rhadebe was shot eight times in the head by men posing as policemen. Several other anti-mining activists have also been killed or injured. The Amadiba community member Sinegugu Zukulu said: \u201cMRC is determined to disrupt our way of life. This proposed mine has brought us conflict in the community since the process was started. \u201cA community that used to live in peace is now in conflict. Graham Edwards must do an honorable thing tell MRC to leave us alone.\u201d Edwards has taken to Facebook to take issue with objections to the mine, after activists staged a protest outside the London offices of Telereal Trillium. \u201cAs I understand it, the mining process here involves taking sand, filtering it with water and magnetism and then replacing the sand,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is difficult to understand the ecological damage that this is purported to cause. I would have thought that the economic benefits to the local community would be welcomed, but obviously that is for the local community to decide. \u201cI am surprised that your group feel that they have better information as to who committed this horrible crime than the authorities, but if you really do have evidence as to the guilty party then please do share it \u2013 particularly with the police.\u201d He also shared details of a survey, conducted by an independent firm, into local attitudes to the project. But sources said that while he was still in favour of the project, he was alarmed by the rhetoric employed by Caruso and planned to make his displeasure known. Edwards declined to comment. MRC said a poll of 200 locals showed that 77% either supported the mine unconditionally or wanted it to build local infrastructure. The company declined to comment on Caruso\u2019s biblical quotation. \u201cHistory shows not only have we invested substantially in mining development in South Africa but we have also done so working within the law in discharging our obligations under our prospecting and mining permits,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe believe that it is possible for responsible mining development to co-exist with environmental, social, and cultural purviews and this is what results in sustainable economic development.\u201d",

The Snap ticket will allow travellers to get to Paris or Brussels for \u00a325 each way, but time of travel will only be given 48 hours in advance. Passengers have to sign up via Facebook and specify whether they would prefer to travel in the morning or afternoon. The fare must be booked at least seven days before travel and once passengers have paid for their ticket they are locked in, even if they don\u2019t like their allocated departure time. That means anyone who chooses a weekday morning could end up on the first Paris train of the day at 5.40am, while anyone who opts for the afternoon might not reach the City of Lights until 11.32pm. The \u00a325 one-way price, based on a return journey, undercuts Eurostar\u2019s previous lowest fare of \u00a329 one way, and appears designed to increase occupancy of the firm\u2019s new trains. Eurostar\u2019s 10 e320 trains, so called because they can reach 320km/h (200mph), can carry 900 passengers, compared with the 750 in its original fleet. Offering passengers a financial incentive to be more flexible is also intended to help the company spread demand across its Channel tunnel services, helping it fill seats that would otherwise be empty. Eurostar hopes the service will be popular with those who have less rigid schedules, such as students and pensioners. Its commercial director, Nick Mercer, said its research had convinced the company there was a \u201cstrong appetite for spontaneous travel\u201d. Enticing last-minute travellers could also help Eurostar recover from a difficult period in which passenger numbers fell following the terror attacks in Paris and Brussels. It is also hoping for an increase in cross-Channel traffic from this summer\u2019s Euro 2016 football tournament in France. Eurostar was a joint venture between the French and Belgian railway services and a special-purpose vehicle called London and Continental Railways owned by the UK government until the Treasury took control of the UK\u2019s 40% stake in 2014.

The new bikes employ pedelec technology, which stores energy from pedalling and releases it when the rider reaches a hill. The Brompton system has been developed in partnership with Formula One team Williams and is a slimmed down version of the Kers (kinetic energy recovery system) technology that racing cars use to gain extra speed. \u201cThe guy on his \u00a32,500 carbon-frame road bike will wonder why you\u2019re cruising past him in a suit,\u201d said Will Butler-Adams, the chief executive of Brompton. The move into electric bicycles is part of an ambitious global expansion plan orchestrated from a gleaming new factory in the west London suburb of Greenford. At 84,000 sq ft, the floorspace of the site is bigger than the pitch at Wembley Stadium and four times the size of Brompton\u2019s previous home. The move cost the company about \u00a32m, a sum equal to its pre-tax profit in 2015, achieved on turnover of \u00a327.5m. While the factory itself is shiny, new and packed with new technology, the work that goes on here hinges on some old-fashioned craftsmanship. Abdul El Saidi, 56, is Brompton\u2019s brazing manager. He is responsible for passing on the decades-old craft, which is similar to welding, to new trainees. All 250 staff, from the engineers to the receptionists, have to try their hand at brazing when they start work at the business. . For new recruits the stakes are high \u2013 all have their initials stamped on individual bike components for the sake of quality control. But the money isn\u2019t bad either. A new brazer can expect a starting salary north of \u00a330,000, partly because it isn\u2019t easy to find people suited to such a job. \u201cNot many people know about brazing, which was a problem for Brompton,\u201d said El Saidi, who demonstrates the steady hand, patience and eye for detail required for a top brazer. \u201cTechnology has taken over engineering and welding jobs so there\u2019s not much training. In the 1970s when I started, there were full classes of people learning to weld. It was big money. But if I lost my job here, there\u2019s not a job elsewhere. The world has changed a lot.\u201d If El Saidi\u2019s story of industrial decline sounds like a familiar tale of Britain\u2019s diminishing place in global manufacturing, Brompton is at least bucking the trend. About 80% of its bikes are exported to 44 markets. Two of the largest markets are Germany and South Korea, often held up as shining examples of export-led economies. The working practices at Brompton feel like a cosy reminder of days long past, with the production line staffed by people rather than robots. Do any of them own a Brompton, given that the machines start at a cool \u00a3785? \u201cNah, I\u2019ve got a Ferrari,\u201d joked one of Brompton\u2019s bike makers, as he screwed in a crucial component. Every member of the production line staff is responsible for a different part of the bike and between them they can assemble one in about three and a half minutes. Their target for the year is 47,500 and the company is soon to add a second production line in the belief it can roll out 100,000 bikes a year by 2022. To do so, it will need to use all of the tools at its disposal. Although the bicycles help people to save on public transport, they could not be described as cheap, and at 9.5kg are technically portable but not for a long period of time. \u201cYou have to have ambition,\u201d said Butler-Adams. \u201cThere are more than a billion people in China. Not all of them are going to ride a Brompton but there\u2019s an opportunity there. \u201cMost people in the world have never seen one [a Brompton] but globally there is net migration to cities and they\u2019ve got the same challenges with space and lack of exercise.\u201d While China represents an opportunity, it will not be easy to break into the market. Working-class Chinese cannot afford one of the costly machines, while many among the burgeoning middle classes see cycling to work as beneath them. But since founder Andrew Ritchie first developed a folding bike in 1975 \u2013 naming it after the Brompton Oratory church across the road from his flat \u2013 the company has defied its critics. It has also developed a cult following, as evidenced by fan groups such as the London Brompton Club page on Facebook, which has 2,800 members. There are even competitions for who can fold one up the quickest - the record is 5.6 seconds. \u201cThere are Brompton owners who are tall, small, old, young. We don\u2019t give a stuff,\u201d said Butler-Adams. \u201cThe flipping thing works. If it works in London, it can work all over the world.\u201d",

                "body":"<p>On its last full day of trading, the Ladbrokes betting shop in Morden, south-west London, stayed open until 10 at night. It was Friday 24 May 2013, the beginning of one of those spring-summer weekends for which the schedules of global sport combine to throw up a glut of events that can be gambled on. A European football final, a super-middleweight title fight, a Grand Prix, high-season horse races, a golf tournament. The manager of the Morden Ladbrokes, a 55-year-old Londoner named Andrew Iacovou, sat behind his shop\u2019s counter with a computer, a scroll printer, a coin tray and, beside his knees, a safe \u2013 waiting to take bets.</p> <p>A balding and naturally slight man who spent his free hours in the gym, Iacovou had worked for Ladbrokes for more than 20 years. Quiet but not unconfident and well liked by his regular customers, he was one of the company\u2019s 15,500 employees, around 11,000 of whom worked in Ladbrokes\u2019 2,200 shops. Iacovou had run a Ladbrokes in Wimbledon, a Ladbrokes in Earlsfield and another Ladbrokes in Morden before moving to his current branch, a glass-fronted shop next to a supermarket, just across the A24 from Morden tube. For more than two decades with the firm, he had seen through changes to the staff uniform (tomato-red polo shirts, now) as well as a series of dispiriting adjustments to his daily workload. In the 1990s, when Iacovou first met his wife, Anita, then a Post Office employee, he worked at the Wimbledon branch. It shut to customers at 5.30pm and Iacovou would close down the premises by 6pm, ready to walk Anita home.</p> <p>His Morden branch, in 2013, was open seven days a week, from 8.30am or 9am until 10pm. Iacovou generally worked five of those days, sometimes six, often from start to finish. For some hours in the afternoon he would be joined at the till by an assistant, a cashier who helped him process handwritten bets that came in over the counter. Otherwise, Iacovou manned the shop alone, relying on his regulars for company. They were mostly male, mostly retired, often on their way to or from the nearby Ganley\u2019s pub.</p> <p>There was a rosy-faced man in his 60s, called Michael, who sat at a shop kiosk and frowned at length over his spread-out betting slips, ruminating before committing to a day\u2019s wagers. There was a taxi driver, Alan the Taxi, who parked in the rank outside and came in to bet the occasional \u00a35 on football. A fellow cabbie, John the Taxi, didn\u2019t gamble, but he came in and out to use the loo. Both drivers brought with them takeaway coffees for Iacovou, who could not leave the shop unless his cashier was there. The branch had a regular named Ray, who bet horses, and Kistensamy, who bet horses, and Bill, who only bet dogs. There was a relative newcomer, Shafique Aarij, a man in his 20s with pocked skin who had drawn attention to himself by combing his hair, nervously, whenever he played on one of the shop\u2019s electronic gambling machines.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2017/jan/06/the-big-gamble-the-dangerous-world-of-british-betting-shops-podcast\">The big gamble: the dangerous world of British betting shops \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That Friday, Aarij complained to the manager about a problem with one of these machines. Iacovou had to come out from behind his counter to see what was wrong. It was one of dozens of menial but mounting tasks he had to see to: filling the coupon trays; scissoring out form guides from the Racing Post and arranging them on magnetic display boards; alternating posters in the street-facing windows; managing customers who approached his till holding winning slips (and those who came anyway, as losers, to moan); monitoring the amount of money in the coin tray, in the till, and in the safe; monitoring the door, in case someone too young or too unsavoury-looking should try to enter; monitoring the shop\u2019s four gambling machines, in case any of them should break down, the colours on the simulated casino games turn funny or the calibration on the touchscreens slip out of sync. At the end of the day these machines had to be laboriously emptied of takings and the shop otherwise shut down. Though Iacovou\u2019s branch closed to customers at 10, that night he did not get back to his home in Cheam until midnight. He was exhausted, his wife recalled, and he slept in his uniform.</p> <p>In the morning, Iacovou took the bus back to the Morden branch, arriving at around 8am, in time to meet a colleague from another Ladbrokes who had come to collect a set of spare keys. The pair chatted briefly. There had been a time when they might have been rostered to spend Saturday together in the shop, but no longer. Iacovou was not expecting his cashier to arrive until after lunch. The managers said goodbye to each other and Iacovou began to prepare for trade, turning on the machines and checking that each of their coin and note slots were functioning properly. He put up pages from the Racing Post and took out cleaning products to tidy his counter area. The posters in the street-facing window that morning said \u201cWin\u201d, \u201cFREE BET\u201d, \u201cGuaranteed\u201d, \u201cDebit cards accepted\u201d. Iacovou opened a locked door that separated the shop floor from his service area and sat down at his till. As it turned 8.30am, he pressed a button to unseal the shop\u2019s magnetically locked front door, and was open for business.</p> <p>The first customer was Shafique Aarij. That morning he was carrying a shoulder bag. He went to one of the gambling machines. As had happened the day before, Aarij signalled to Iacovou that there was a problem with his machine. The manager stood up and started to unlock the door beside his counter. As soon as the latch was turned, Aarij pushed in. He grabbed Iacovou around the neck. The two men struggled. Aarij took a claw hammer from his bag and struck Iacovou over the head with it. He struck again, and again, and then he turned his attention to the safe.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/13/the-death-and-life-of-a-great-british-pub\">The death and life of the great British pub | Tom Lamont</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>2. A part of British life</h2> <p><strong>It is a rare British high street </strong>that has not come to be kitted out, today, in the colours of the bookmakers. In every town, on every retail row, the routine sweep of bank and salon and shrunken supermarket will be studded at almost mathematical intervals by the red of a Ladbrokes storefront or the blue and yellow of a William Hill, likely as well by the blue of a Coral, the blue and red of a Betfred, the pale green of a Stan James or the clover-leaf shade of a Paddy Power. In total, there are around 9,000 licensed betting shops in the UK, around half of those operated by Ladbrokes and William Hill. The two corporations are great and bitter rivals, tracing a contempt for one another back to the 1930s. Difficult as it is to credit now, both companies once shared a snotty attitude about the idea of bookmakers having <em>shops</em>.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it would be very nice,\u201d said Mr William Hill, founder of William Hill, in 1956, \u201cto see at every street corner a betting shop.\u201d There was never a Mr Ladbrokes; the company was named for a country house where its founders trained horses in the 1880s. Up to the 1960s it reckoned itself too posh for street-level trade. Bookmakers at the time operated under licence only at racetracks, or took bets from private customers by post or telephone. Profits made in this way were undermined by a thriving black market in illegal street betting. Before the tonnes of lurid acrylic got hoisted into place on shop fronts nationwide, British bookmaking had as its most visible identifier a lone man or boy, waiting with a satchel of money on any street corner that had a choice of escape routes.</p> <p>Betting shops were legalised in 1961. A year later, the Times audited the country, describing the first bookmakers\u2019 shops, and reporting on the genteel (a \u201cclean, sky-blue parlour\u201d) as well as the already run-down (a \u201cseedy, litter-strewn room containing listless youths sucking pencils\u201d). All had windows that were blacked out, at government insistence, to discourage loitering. An employee known as a \u201cmarker\u201d would stand by a blackboard, close to a telephone or later a loudspeaker that broadcast racing commentary, chalking up results. Another employee, called a \u201csettler\u201d, calculated odds in their head. Cashiers took in money and sometimes gave it out. Customers could not drink in betting shops, but they could smoke. These were bolt-holes, very often in the backstreets, stuffy but social, somewhere to be.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"14de28ee7ea067fa8a11bd1b0e10ce1b9bd707a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14de28ee7ea067fa8a11bd1b0e10ce1b9bd707a0/0_46_3008_1805/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Machines in betting shop\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Fixed-odds betting terminals, or FOBTs, offer a digitised version of roulette as well as arcade-style games.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Segre/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And they were popular, particularly with working-class men. Once Ladbrokes and William Hill could not ignore the potential profits any longer, they began to open branches, or take over existing ones, and from the mid-1960s on, the two companies\u2019 spread was rapid and aggressive. Between them they absorbed dozens of smaller now-forgotten firms \u2013 Solomons &amp; Flanagan, JJ Simonds, Ken Munden, Fred Parkinson.</p> <p>William Hill had 100 shops by 1970, and Ladbrokes more than 400. \u201cThey are part of British life now,\u201d said Hill not long before he died. His company was bought by Sears Holdings Limited in 1971, and then traded on again through a number of conglomerates. Both William Hill and Ladbrokes became PLCs, floated on the stock market. They had 1,000 shops each, then 2,000. Wooden writing benches, pencilled over with decades\u2019 worth of redundant figuring, were removed from branches and replaced by plasticky kiosks. Instead of pencils came that icon of the modern betting shop, the complimentary pen: stubby, flat edged, much-chucked in frustration, apparently of limitless supply.</p> <p>Regulation changes in the 1980s allowed TVs to be installed in shops, bringing in races and results direct from horse and greyhound tracks. (That killed the role of the fast-chalking \u201cmarkers\u201d.) Cashiers, in the 1990s, got networked computers. (Thus the \u201csettlers\u201d also became redundant.) Plinky, pound-at-a-time fruit machines came in and then, around the turn of the millennium, the first modern gambling machines \u2013 \u201cfixed-odds betting terminals\u201d, or FOBTs (pronounced fobtees), offering a digitised version of roulette as well as other arcade-style games that could be gambled on. The major bookmakers also launched and invested in dotcom operations, but they were not especially light-footed about it, and their profits were eaten into by an online-only service named Betfair that empowered its customers to act as bookies themselves, setting odds and taking bets from one another. Takings fell.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Like characters in a sci-fi\u00a0film, veteran betting shop staff\u00a0now\u00a0speak of a happier time \u2013 \u2018before the machines\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At around the same time, betting on the industry\u2019s totemic sports, horse racing and greyhound racing, dropped away. Staff observed that a younger generation of gambler had come to see track racing as jargon-heavy, too favourable to those with specialist knowledge \u2013 dad\u2019s fancy \u2013 and they preferred to bet on football instead. Broadly speaking, there was less profit for bookmakers there: in football, unlike in a 15- or 30-rider horse race, only one side could fail to win. Takings fell further. A new piece of legislation, the 2005 Gambling Act, had enforced a limit of four FOBTs per betting shop. The money fed into these four machines became ever more important to each shop\u2019s viability.</p> <p>Like characters in a certain type of sci-fi film, veteran staff now speak of a happier time \u2013 \u201cbefore the machines\u201d. FOBTs, when they came, were accepting of much larger sums than the fruit machines that preceded them. Up to \u00a3100 could be fed in and gambled every 20 seconds, an amount later curbed, under changing government regulations, to \u00a350 every 20 seconds. Losers lost faster, and losing became an identifiably scratchier thing. Staff explained: the customer who backed a too-slow horse or a crap dog might afterwards rail at fate or the gods, or even the employees behind their counters. But they could not plausibly claim to have been cheated. Machine players brought with them a new paranoia. FOBTs are fixed, thus the name \u2013 fixed-odds betting terminals. Over time they will pay back to customers 97.4% of the money that is put into them. Even so, it became a common thing for staff to be accused of rigging equipment, of dialling up losing streaks, of modulating people\u2019s electronic luck.</p> <p>Many shop workers I spoke to had stories about looking on, impotent, as the machines under their charge were angrily destroyed by the customers who had been playing them. Worse, somehow, was when a machine was <em>calmly</em> destroyed. The deputy manager of a William Hill in Hull said: \u201cYou just watch, there\u2019s nothing else to do. It\u2019s normal. It\u2019s normal for people to smash up the shop.\u201d (A representative of William Hill said this was \u201crare\u201d.) A woman working at an Oxfordshire Ladbrokes told me she had watched all four FOBTs in her shop get wrecked by a man swinging a stool; by the next day\u2019s trade, she said, her ruined machines had all been replaced. According to figures I have seen, the number of incidents of damage to machines in Ladbrokes branches rose steadily between 2010 and 2015.</p> <p>A senior figure at Ladbrokes during this period became increasingly concerned by the situation at shop-level \u201cgetting silly, getting crazy\u201d. They told me it was their belief that with the introduction of the machines, betting shops had more or less become \u201cmini casinos\u201d. And how many casinos, they asked, got by without bouncers to cope with aggrieved gamblers? How many were run by individuals on their own?</p> <h2>3. Work alone, or don\u2019t work</h2> <p><strong>Even after the markers</strong> were made redundant by TV, and the settlers run off by desktop computers, it was rare for employees to work in their betting shops alone; until it wasn\u2019t. While staff at William Hill were told by company bosses, often and emphatically, that they would not be asked to man branches by themselves at night, Ladbrokes began to draw up what it called a \u201csingle-scheduling\u201d policy in 2010. The policy meant that, subject to certain conditions, including a risk assessment of individual branches and a tick-box check of employee competence, shops could be run by one person for periods of the day and night. In fact, in the majority of shops, there would be a mandatory number of hours during which there could only be one person rostered to work.</p> <p>Single-manning, as staff started to call it, was trialled and then expanded around Ladbrokes\u2019 betting shops between 2011 and 2013. People at all levels of the company told me they were in no doubt as to why it was introduced. \u201cIt was a cost-cutting exercise,\u201d said an area manager who was then in charge of 15 branches in the south-east. A senior person in Ladbrokes\u2019 retail department at the time told me: \u201cThey recognised there were considerable savings to be made. Why double-man a shop between 10am and 1pm, or after 6pm, when it\u2019s quiet?\u201d</p> <p>Another well-placed source inside Ladbrokes at the time said they believed that by reducing staff from two to one in more than 2,000 shops, the company saved approximately \u00a315m a year. <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/ladbrokes-staff-raped-killed-firm-7994485\">The Mirror reported</a> that between 2009 and 2011, Ladbrokes\u2019 annual wage bill dropped by a third. (Ladbrokes said this was a result of cuts in staffing at all levels, not specifically on shop floors.)</p> <p>At shop level, a choice: work on your own, or risk your job. An area manager who worked in the north and oversaw the running of more than 60 branches told the 200-odd employees under his charge: \u201cWe can either close this amount of shops and make this amount of people redundant, or we can single-man.\u201d The area manager remembered \u201ca lot of emotion. A lot of staff felt it wasn\u2019t safe.\u201d (Ladbrokes acknowledged that \u201csome of our employees have strong opinions on working alone\u201d and said it encouraged feedback.)</p> <p>Though most shops would still be able to budget for a second employee \u2013 a cashier on minimum wage \u2013 during the busier afternoon horse-racing hours, most Ladbrokes\u2019 shop staff could now expect to work alone before midday and after 6pm. At first, those who agreed to single-man were paid extra \u2013 something like an additional 40p an hour. (The hourly pay for branch managers, who are known internally at Ladbrokes as customer service managers, varies by area and age. In 2016, for a 23-year-old in the Wirral, it is \u00a38.51 per hour.) A source inside Ladbrokes\u2019 head office at the time pointed out that the additional money was soon stopped.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7ae6190189c46d36a69cc2735131c4d807bb5db0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ae6190189c46d36a69cc2735131c4d807bb5db0/0_62_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Betting shop\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Employees said they feared the sack if they complained in public forums about their working conditions.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Internal Ladbrokes sources spoke candidly to me on the condition that I not use their names. So did most of the dozens of betting shop workers I consulted for this story. Entering branches around the UK, and introducing myself as a reporter, I became used to a singular response: behind the counter their eyes would flick, instinctively, to the nearest CCTV camera.</p> <p>Employees said they feared the sack if they complained in public forums about their working conditions. A Ladbrokes branch manager in Wales said that, when she posted a comment on Facebook in reference to the attack on Andrew Iacovou in Morden, she was contacted within 20 minutes by the firm\u2019s London office and told to delete it or she would enter a disciplinary process. A Ladbrokes employee in Birmingham reported the same. Many of the part-time-working students and other junior staff I interviewed insisted they did not expect to be in their jobs for ever, that a pervasive industry gloom would soon flush them out \u2013 but that they needed good references, so could their names be left out of my story? I met working parents, working parents-to-be, second-generation staff who worked in branches <em>with</em> their parents, and other employees who could not risk dismissal, so asked to speak anonymously.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One area manager recalled his shame at telling staff unnerved by\u00a0working alone that they were really\u00a0in no extra danger</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But they spoke. The area manager in the north recalled his shame at telling staff who were unnerved by single-manning in its early phase that they were really in no extra danger. Back then, said the area manager, \u201cI supported the company line, telling my staff: \u2018We <em>need</em> to do this.\u2019\u201d He told any staff who felt unsafe working alone that \u201cif there <em>is</em> a robbery, as long as you hand over all the money, it\u2019s unlikely the robbers will do anything to you. You\u2019re probably at no more risk of a robbery on your own than you are with two people.\u201d A senior figure at Ladbrokes told me that, from the introduction of single-manning in 2010 until the end of 2014, the company kept no figures recording whether a branch was single- or double-manned at the time of a criminal incident.</p> <p>For a time, said the area manager in the north, single-manning \u201cseemed pretty innocuous\u201d. Persuading his staff became easier when other major betting chains started to single-man. Employees at Betfred, Stan James, Coral and Paddy Power told me they were all asked to work in their shops alone on a frequent basis. \u201cFor a while it did work fine,\u201d said the area manager. \u201cAnd then Andrew Iacovou happened.\u201d</p> <h2>4. The Morden branch</h2> <p><strong>Andrew and Anita Iacovou first met</strong> inside a Ladbrokes. It was a Saturday in April 1995, Grand National weekend. Anita had put an each-way bet on a horse called Party Politics. \u201cIntuition,\u201d she said. When her horse finished second, she took her ticket to Iacovou, who was working behind the counter. They started talking. Iacovou was 37 and had grown up not far away, in South Norwood. His father was Greek and his mother English. Anita was 34, second-generation Indian, with dark hair that she tied back in a knot. Iacovou must have been distracted, chatting, because he shorted Anita on her winnings. When she went back to check \u2013 \u00a333, wasn\u2019t it? \u2013 Iacovou asked her out. They married in 1999 and later had two sons.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"21eec2d22c55096c45bac56bc02bae2f0365c501\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21eec2d22c55096c45bac56bc02bae2f0365c501/0_10_772_965/400.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Iacovou\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018In 2010, Andrew Iacovou was moved to the branch near Morden tube.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Metropolitan Police</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2005, the family moved to a flat in Cheam. For five years, until 2010, Iacovou worked at a Ladbrokes a walk away, on Tudor Drive. Then he was moved to the branch near Morden tube. \u201cHe told me he didn\u2019t feel safe there,\u201d Anita recalled. Twice, during Iacovou\u2019s evening shifts, the windows of his branch were broken by vandals. Anita\u2019s brother, Anil Punjabi, sometimes drove Anita and her sons to pick him up after work. But after a while, Punjabi recalled, Iacovou asked him not to bring the family on these trips, fearing they would be vulnerable in the car outside.</p> <p>The sensation of safety is not a hard currency; it cannot be passed around in token form. The Morden Ladbrokes had CCTV cameras inside it, a steel-framed front door with a magnetic lock, a latch-lock on the door between the shop floor and the service area, and an employee panic button under the counter. As dozens of shop employees pointed out to me, however, it is still possible to feel unsafe in the middle of a fortress like this, particularly at night, particularly when unaccompanied.</p> <p>The deputy manager of a Betfred in Sussex was working on her own when one night she was threatened with rape by a frustrated machine gambler. \u201cHe told me: \u2018You\u2019d like it.\u2019 I remember thinking: \u2018There\u2019s nowhere I can run.\u2019\u201d The Betfred deputy rang the police that night, and again the following night, and again the night after that, because the same man kept returning to the shop as soon as her assistant cashier left for the evening. For a while she took anti-anxiety medication, she said, to be able to keep working, and then she resigned. A female Ladbrokes worker in Oxfordshire recalled being told by a customer: \u201cI\u2019m going to come back at 10 o\u2019clock, when you close, and <em>take you</em>.\u201d She was 19. Employees, particularly women \u2013 of whom the betting-shop industry has an unusually high number, around 50% in branches \u2013 told me they had often asked husbands or friends to sit in shops with them on evenings they were rostered to work alone.</p> <p>Certain branches in certain areas were from the start deemed too dangerous to be single-manned. The neighbourhood around Andrew Iacovou\u2019s Morden shop was not judged by Ladbrokes\u2019 risk-assessment team to present any special danger. Part of the way Ladbrokes decided this was by considering unpleasant incidents that had already taken place inside a shop. It rated such incidents by degree. Verbal abuse from a customer was a \u201clevel one\u201d; physical abuse a \u201clevel two\u201d; physical abuse that resulted in hospitalisation a \u201clevel three\u201d. Suffer enough twos or threes and head office would take a shop off the single-manning list, at least for a short while. Andrew Iacovou\u2019s Morden branch had not had enough level twos or level threes.</p> <p>Anita worried for her husband. You did not have to search especially hard for stories about violence in British betting shops at the time. A <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GtrManchesterPolice/posts/479406142129410\">machete robbery at a Betfred in Ashton-in-Makerfield in March 2013</a>. A man who had entered a Ladbrokes in Southampton in April 2013, and <a href=\"http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/10736140.Betting_shop_cashier_risked_life_to_tackle_knifepoint_robber/?ref=rss\">leapt over the counter with a kitchen knife</a>. Between them, the Iacovous had an arrangement: Andrew would call Anita from his shop, usually at about 8.30am, when he would have settled in, and then again at intervals through the day. On Saturday 25 May, Anita did not receive the expected call. She rang the shop and got no answer. She continued to call.</p> <p>Trying to work out what had happened later, police investigators rewatched CCTV footage recorded in the shop. They saw Shafique Aarij struggle with Iacovou behind the counter. This was at 8.33am. They saw Aarij hit Iacovou with a hammer, multiple times. Blood spotted his face, and he wiped at it. Within minutes of the attack Aarij had left the shop. Examining the shop\u2019s safe, police saw that its handle had received a hammer blow, but had remained locked. They knew from shop records that \u00a3296.86 had disappeared from the till. Aarij must have taken this when he fled, at around 8.35am.</p> <p>8.45am. 9am. 9.15am. For between 45 minutes and an hour, nobody outside the Morden branch was aware that anything unusual had happened inside. Andrew Iacovou lay in such a way behind his counter that he could not be seen from the shop floor. Customers came and went. Someone played on one of the machines. Eventually Kistensamy, one of the regulars, approached the counter and saw a body. He ran to the supermarket next door and raised the alarm. An ambulance came. Iacovou was pronounced dead by paramedics at 10.28am.</p> <h2>5. \u201cA tough year\u201d</h2> <p><strong>From branch to branch, rumours</strong> of a murder spread. Staff at a William Hill in Glasgow heard that an employee had been stabbed. At a Coral in Hemel Hempstead it was said that someone had been shot. In a Facebook group for industry professionals (the group is called \u201cI No Longer Fear Hell, I\u2019ve Worked in a Betting Shop\u201d and has over 14,000 members) Iacovou was discussed within hours of his death. \u201cWhat happened? Robbery gone wrong? Was he single-manning?\u201d The suggestion that Iacovou had lain undiscovered for so long was especially distressing to people. This was one of their great fears.</p> <p>In the Facebook group, a discussion about possible strike action led nowhere. A hopeless, gravedigger humour set in instead. \u201cIf you\u2019re single-manning and something happens,\u201d someone asked, \u201cwho will call for help?\u201d Someone replied: \u201cGhostbusters.\u201d Members discussed the wild inconsistency with which glass security screens were installed in shops, many premises going without (\u201cShow me one bank that doesn\u2019t have them for cash transactions\u201d). They compared notes about how easily a magnetically sealed front door could be forced by a determined intruder (\u201cI weigh 11 stone and \u2026 \u201d). They remembered the old days (\u201cI started in \u201994 \u2026 home by 5.30pm in the winter\u201d) and exchanged grim warnings about the future (\u201cNext time it could be any one of you\u201d). One especially distressing rumour about Iacovou spread between them: that before he died, the manager had been able to press the panic alarm beneath his counter, and that this alarm, while it had registered at Ladbrokes\u2019 central security office, had somehow gone unanswered.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It was assumed that Aarij was a cleaner who must have pressed the panic button by mistake</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I was told by well-placed sources that this rumour was accurate. When the alarm registered at Ladbrokes\u2019 security office, a live CCTV feed from the shop was checked by a control room operator; but the operator saw only Aarij, not Iacovou. The operator also saw the cleaning materials that Iacovou had put out on his service area. It was assumed that Aarij was a cleaner who must have pressed the panic button by mistake. (A Ladbrokes spokesperson said that after this killing, \u201cchanges were made with regard to how our security control room responds to incidents\u201d.)</p> <p>In Cheam, Anita Iacovou heard nothing all morning. At 2pm, police visited her at the flat. Ladbrokes\u2019 security chief came too, as did a second Ladbrokes\u2019 representative. Anita was asked to step in to her bedroom to speak with a policewoman. Anita said, instinctively: \u201cHe\u2019s in the hospital.\u201d The policewoman said no, Andrew was dead. Anita said, \u201cYou\u2019re joking,\u201d and the policewoman said no. The two children were at home. Anita called them into the room to tell them what had happened. There is not a lot more she can recall of the afternoon. She knows she turned to the two Ladbrokes representatives, in the family living room, and asked: why was he ever left there alone?</p> <p>Aarij, 21, was found by police five days later, hiding at a friend\u2019s home in east London. When interviewed at Sutton police station, Aarij accepted that he had gone to the betting shop in Morden that morning to steal money. That he had armed himself with a hammer beforehand. That he knew there was likely to be only one person on duty. When police asked why he had killed Iacovou, Aarij told them: \u201cWhen the siren was ringing I got scared and I became upset and then I was not in my senses.\u201d Police charged Aarij with murder. At trial in November 2013 he was found guilty. In January 2014 he was sentenced to life in prison, with a minimum of 26 years.</p> <p>Ladbrokes paid a modest sum to Anita Iacovou and her family. (A well-placed source put it at \u00a3140,000.) Ladbrokes also launched a JustGiving page in Iacovou\u2019s memory, kicking off donations with \u00a310,000. The company paid for Iacovou\u2019s funeral, in July 2013. During Aarij\u2019s murder trial, Ladbrokes arranged for taxis to take Anita and her family to and from court. In its December report for shareholders, the company described 2013 as \u201ca tough year\u201d. Delicate mention was made of the murder. It was called \u201ca random violent attack\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"950ea2ca2a647fa16bcd81454b0cf31f633ab431\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/950ea2ca2a647fa16bcd81454b0cf31f633ab431/0_0_5700_3420/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Empty betting shop\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Shortly after Morden, an internal investigation found Ladbrokes\u2019 single-scheduling policy to be adequate.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images/Image Source</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The area manager in the north recalled: \u201cThe thinking was we sell it as a one-in-a-million anomaly that can never happen again.\u201d A senior figure at Ladbrokes at the time confirmed this. \u201cThose were conversations that were being had at senior level. It was taken as: \u2018The shell doesn\u2019t land in the same place twice.\u2019\u201d Another senior figure at Ladbrokes at the time said: \u201cThere was a naivety.\u201d</p> <p>Shortly after Morden, an internal investigation was launched, and Ladbrokes\u2019 single-scheduling policy found to be adequate. When a new branch opened in the Leicester area that year, it was added, like hundreds of others, to the list of Ladbrokes that could be run by one person. In early 2014, a woman in her 20s was interviewed for a job at the branch. A court later imposed restrictions on the reporting of this woman\u2019s name \u2013 she would come to be known internally at the company as Miss X.</p> <p>During her interview, Miss X asked about the possibility of the shop being robbed. Weren\u2019t betting shops targeted all the time?</p> <p>\u201cThey just want the money,\u201d Miss X was told. \u201cHand the money over and everything will be fine.\u201d</p> <p>She got the job.</p> <h2>6. The rise of the machines</h2> <p><strong>Keen to turn up new markets,</strong> bookmakers not long ago started offering odds on the chancellor\u2019s spring Budget. What colour would George Osborne\u2019s tie be? How many times would the phrase \u201cLabour\u2019s economic mess\u201d be used? Really, though, nobody in the betting world can look forward to the spring, when chancellors generally shake down this industry with indecent rigour. Betting firms have for some years paid an unusually high rate of tax \u2013 more than \u00a31bn annually. Between 2011 and 2015 the operating profit before tax of Ladbrokes\u2019 retail arm fell from \u00a3152.3m to \u00a3116.1m, and its tax obligations in that period only went up. When Osborne\u2019s 2014 Budget raised the duty on takings from FOBTs from 20 to 25%, it was reckoned to cost the industry something like an extra \u00a370m a year. At the time, a Ladbrokes spokesperson complained: \u201cThe pips are squeaking.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6a402ed2348220a400228cdd6a5d1f8084fec103\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a402ed2348220a400228cdd6a5d1f8084fec103/0_113_4000_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Betting shops in Hastings\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018While the high street has come out strongly in favour of thrift and convenience, betting shops have clung on.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And yet, these hundreds of branches of Ladbrokes, all those William Hills and Paddy Powers and Betfreds \u2013 they were everywhere, around Birmingham\u2019s Bullring, up and down Aberdeen\u2019s Union Street, Cardiff-wide, packed into London\u2019s boroughs. In a decade when the high street has come out strongly in favour of thrift and convenience, betting shops have clung on as an unlikely modern super-presence. Of course, they are not much use to the thrifty. But they\u2019re not especially convenient either \u2013 placing a bet is a transaction far more easily accomplished invisibly, online, than in a material shop, where you\u2019ll likely trample in over a carpeting of abandoned bet slips (these boxy, overbright spaces always tend to look as if a major parade has <em>just</em> passed through) and in that climate of tension and boredom, biro out a prediction longhand. Win, and you\u2019ll have to go back. If you mislay your little receipt, write it off.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Walk into one of Britain\u2019s 9,000 betting shops in 2016 and you will rarely find it full or even busy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>They would once have been as densely packed as pubs, stopped at with the religious regularity of churches, taut with etiquette, like a public library \u2013 but walk into one of Britain\u2019s 9,000 betting shops in 2016 and you will rarely find it full or even busy. Who are all the shops for? Usually men. Their expressions often sullen. There\u2019s a William Hill in Hull in which, by unspoken agreement, Turks stick to one side of the shop and Kurds to the other. In one Ladbrokes in Sheffield, the white, Asian, eastern European and Somali customers mix well. Privately, informally, staff divide the modern class of betting-shop punter into two broad groups: the Older Gentlemen (in for the horses) and the Machine Gamblers. At Andrew Iacovou\u2019s branch in Morden, there was an elderly regular from the West Indies, known to the others as Rocky, who didn\u2019t gamble on either horses or the machines. He just seemed to want a place to be, and often cleaned up the discarded betting slips to help out.</p> <p>Bookmakers buy lots of television advertising time to promote gambling through their websites and mobile-phone apps, while their vast estates of retail outlets go just about unmentioned. Betting shops can seem marginal places today, even through the eyes of those who run them. Yet as pubs vanish, churches vanish, libraries vanish, the marginalised have not vanished.</p> <p>Walking around near Morden tube, three years after Iacovou\u2019s murder, I wondered if I would be able to find any of his former customers. I soon realised that I only had to speak to men on the street \u2013 those who looked to be of retirement age and who looked to be doing nothing in particular. They all knew Iacovou\u2019s Ladbrokes. They had dispersed, since his death, to the Paddy Power a few hundred metres away, to the Stan James across the road, to the Ladbrokes on Tudor Drive, to the William Hill further along the A24.</p> <p>Who are all these shops for? Better to ask what they\u2019re for. When the Labour government in 2005 made law a maximum of four FOBTs per betting shop, it had meant to limit peoples\u2019 exposure to the machines. Four ought to be enough. But a betting firm such as Ladbrokes will retain only about \u00a32 from every \u00a3100 spent on its FOBTs. The machines are profitable only on a high-volume/low-margin basis; that is to say, after factoring spend on staffing, real estate, and renting the machines (most of which are owned by third-party companies), there\u2019s no money in them unless they\u2019re played widely and played often.</p> <p>An unintended effect of the 2005 Gambling Act may have been to encourage bookmakers to open more shops, and to move existing shops from the back streets to more visible parts of cities and towns. <a href=\"http://www.greatyarmouthmercury.co.uk/news/william_hill_wins_appeal_to_open_second_betting_shop_in_great_yarmouth_1_3677735\">Locals in Great Yarmouth recently campaigned to stop a ninth betting shop opening in the town centre</a>. Last year, residents of Thornton Heath tried to resist a 14th betting shop opening within a single postal district. In 2010, on Birmingham\u2019s Stephenson Street, a Ladbrokes opened next door to a Ladbrokes. There are 26 branches of William Hill in greater Hull, and when I asked why, a spokesman explained it was \u201cto cater to local demand\u201d. (The Association of British Bookmakers, or ABB, the industry body that represents the major chains, said that the overall number of betting shops has actually decreased in recent years, and added: \u201cOver 60% of existing betting shops have been trading from the same location for over 20 years.\u201d)</p> <p>After 2005, bookmakers began to open their shops earlier in the morning and later at night. According to the ABB, this was to broadcast and take bets on evening sporting events. But senior industry employees told me that it was to create extra hours of machine use \u2013 a feeling shared on shop floors. \u201cFour walls around the FOBTs,\u201d was how one manager described her branch. \u201cWe\u2019re chaperones for the machines these days,\u201d said another manager, \u201ceveryone knows that.\u201d</p> <h2>7. The Ladbrokes experience</h2> <p><strong>When I questioned the ABB </strong>about single-manning and other working conditions in betting shops, a spokesman pointed out that those who work in petrol stations and newsagents often do so alone. Other industry sources said that lorry drivers and taxi drivers worked solo, too. The comparisons were not unfair, but they did not take full account of the nature of betting shops, or their peculiar presence. Known to be everywhere, known to have cash. As likely as not staffed by a woman, more likely than not staffed alone. They were often near pubs, nightclubs, takeaways, cab ranks. They stayed open late. Ever since the extension of opening hours, branch workers told me, they had been more likely to have to deal with customers who were drunk or on drugs. They also told me about the other sort of difficult customer: the non-customer, bewildered, unstable, otherwise desperate, drifting in because they could not reliably expect to idle anywhere else during unsociable hours without being ushered on.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bff7680ed4c68c71720c164d0b55a5583c1a854f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bff7680ed4c68c71720c164d0b55a5583c1a854f/0_160_4000_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Branch of Ladbrokes betting shop\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Betting shops were often near pubs, nightclubs, takeaways, cab ranks. They stayed open late.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>An employee of Ladbrokes in Birmingham, Harry Vale, was taken aback in 2013 to be asked by his area manager to start buying food and drink for people who came into his shop. Not just complimentary cups of tea but full meals, from McDonald\u2019s or Greggs. \u201cWe had a ringbinder with their favourites written down,\u201d Vale said, adding that the free food initiative, dreamed up in 2013 and introduced in multiple branches around the Midlands, did not seem to him the wisest arrangement when it came to the issue of vulnerable or unstable people hanging around in betting shops. But, then, Vale was pretty new to the business at the time, and a great many industry conventions can seem baffling to the uninitiated.</p> <p>For instance, there is \u201cbanking\u201d, an industry-wide practice by which betting-shop staff are asked to take excess cash out of their safes and then travel, often with thousands of pounds hidden about their person, to deposit it at the nearest bank or Post Office. (\u201cWe\u2019re only supposed to take \u00a35,000 at a time,\u201d said a branch worker in Oxfordshire, adding that she had once taken as much as \u00a39,000 on a single trip, distributing it about herself in different pockets.)</p> <p>And then there was \u201cthe Ladbrokes Experience\u201d, a company initiative launched in 2013, not long after the Morden murder, that would have Ladbrokes staff come out from behind their locked counters and interact with customers. \u201cWe had to go to our teams and brief this,\u201d recalled the area manager in the north, \u201cafter Andrew Iacovou. That they had to be on the shop floor at all times. That the only time they were allowed to stay behind the counter was if they felt they had a very specific threat.\u201d</p> <p>Mia Whitaker, 21 that year, was working in a Ladbrokes in the Moor area of Sheffield. She had good reason to want to stay behind her counter, her own Ladbrokes experience having been made horrible by two regulars, young taxi drivers, who came in to play the FOBTs or to watch sport. When Whitaker passed them on the shop floor, she recalled, \u201cthey would try to touch my bum and my chest\u201d. They offered taunting comments and gestures, coming in at night and when she was alone in the branch.</p> <p>Whitaker complained to her line manager, and later to Ladbrokes\u2019 central security office. (Ladbrokes told the Guardian: \u201cIf an employee raises concerns, we would investigate and where necessary take action.\u201d) The security office sent a trespass order to Whitaker\u2019s shop, meant for the two men, but when it arrived by post Whitaker said none of her colleagues would present it. Her manager suggested instead that he have a quiet word with the drivers \u2013 they were regular customers. Whitaker didn\u2019t have the nerve to present the trespass order herself. The taxi drivers knew what her hours were, and where her bus stop was. So for more than a year after that, until Whitaker left the job, the men kept coming into their local betting shop, where they could expect to play the machines, or to watch the evening darts, and to harass the 21-year-old who was nominally in charge.</p> <p>Looking back on this later, after a season of contained and uncontained chaos in the betting shops, Whitaker would have reason to be relieved that things only went so far.</p> <h2>8. The wild west</h2> <p><strong>One weekend, the manager of a Ladbrokes</strong> in Scotland was robbed by two men while she was alone in her branch. She later described the experience. \u201cOne had a hammer,\u201d she said. \u201cOne had a screwdriver. One of them pinned me in a corner with a hammer above my head, while the other one emptied the till. To me it felt like hours. I was thinking: \u2018I\u2019m not getting home from here.\u2019 I thought of the man in London. I thought: \u2018They\u2019re taking me out in a box today.\u2019 I thought: \u2018I\u2019m never going home.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In June 2013, a month after Andrew Iacovou\u2019s killing, a <a href=\"http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/armed-robbers-threaten-betting-shop-5668530\">Ladbrokes in Cardiff was robbed by two men, one carrying what police described as \u201ca small axe\u201d</a>. In July, a Ladbrokes in Newcastle was robbed by a man with a seven-inch vegetable knife. In August, a Coral employee in Ewell, Surrey, was robbed in their branch by two men, claiming to be armed. In September, <a href=\"http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/robbers-threaten-chop-up-betting-5853047\">thieves threatened to \u201cchop up\u201d a Coral employee</a> in his branch in Gorton, Manchester. They stole money and a plug-in telephone.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>July 2014: a Ladbrokes in Leyland, Lancashire, a female employee locked in the toilet while \u00a32,500 was stolen</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Branch workers around the country described to me a feeling during this period that they were being kept out on the shop floor as a hindrance, but no real impediment, to incident; on display like scarecrows, and about as formidable a deterrent. \u201c<a href=\"http://www.canterburytimes.co.uk/Robber-jailed-10-years/story-20949583-detail/story.html\">Pleasure doing business with you</a>,\u201d a thief who robbed a William Hill in Whitstable in 2013 told staff on his way out. A member of a gang that robbed a Ladbrokes in Darlington in September that year returned to the same shop, the same day, to claim the \u00a3134 he had won on a FOBT while casing the joint. The same month, a man robbed a Ladbrokes in Welwyn Garden City by walking in with a bottle wrapped in wires and tape and telling the woman staffing the shop it was a bomb. She hid behind a door while the thief put the package on the counter and left with \u00a3500. After the bomb squad had been and gone, and the thief traced and arrested, it transpired he was out on licence for another robbery, of another Ladbrokes, with another lone-working employee, in 2010.</p> <p>\u201cIt had become like the wild west,\u201d said a senior figure inside Ladbrokes at the time. \u201cRobberies with shotguns. Staff and customers getting beaten up. People getting hospitalised. We were getting staff coming back to work [after incidents] with PTSD. They were shell-shocked.\u201d The Morden killing had already confirmed in this employee the opinion that nobody was realistically safe to work alone in betting shops. \u201cBut I was not allowed that view. I said [to my superiors]: \u2018This is not good.\u2019 I said: \u2018This is wrong.\u2019 But I was not allowed that view. So you make your noises and you get on with your job.\u201d</p> <p>Others made noises. A petition, launched online, \u201cto make it compulsory for high-street bookmakers to have two members of staff present during opening hours\u201d, gathered 3,824 signatures by November 2013. Nothing changed, and people got on with their jobs.</p> <p>In February 2014, the Labour MP for Islwyn, Chris Evans, raised the matter in a Westminster debate. Evans had once been a low-level betting shop employee himself. He proposed that the government might consider legislation to insist that staff in shops be equipped with panic alarms, so that they could at least call for help if they got into trouble. The Tory MP for Shipley, Philip Davies, responded first, voicing concerns about \u201cputting too much obligation on betting shops\u201d. (Davies has more than once <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/dec/25/tory-mp-benefits-gambling-industry\">been accused by newspapers</a> of receiving personal benefits from links to the gambling industry \u2013 allegations he has denied.) Davies said that \u201cwe could end up, not with single-manned betting shops, but with no betting shops, and nobody in work\u201d. Evans said: \u201cAll I am looking for is simple, common-sense, cheap things \u2026 \u201d</p> <p>The debate puttered out.</p> <p>March 2014: a Stan James in Oxford, one armed robber saying to the other, of a lone-working employee made to kneel on the floor, \u201cShoot him. Shoot him.\u201d April 2014: a Paddy Power in Cheshunt, robbed by armed men in balaclavas on Grand National Saturday. July 2014: a Ladbrokes in Leyland, Lancashire, a female employee locked in the toilet while the shop was robbed of \u00a32,500. September 2014: a William Hill in Brighouse, West Yorkshire, a man carrying a piece of metal piping. October 2014: a Coral in Glasgow, a man carrying a piece of paper. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you, just give me the money, I\u2019ve got a knife,\u201d Kenneth Duncan wrote on a betting slip that he handed to 20-year-old Amber Johnstone. \u201cI\u2019m 5ft 6in. I look my age,\u201d Johnstone told me. \u201cI think the guy noticed a young girl on her own in the shop and saw it as a perfect opportunity.\u201d Duncan made off with \u00a3375. Johnstone could not sleep for months afterwards, and eventually entered therapy.</p> <p>Spokespeople for the bookmakers were often careful to stress to the public, after such robberies, that not much money was kept in any one location. \u201cIt is never as much as people think,\u201d said a Coral spokesperson, after the 2013 robbery in Ewell. There were strict limits on the amount of cash kept in branches \u2013 not more than \u00a32,000 in a Ladbrokes, that figure varying slightly from chain to chain. Limits were strictly enforced \u2013 thus the compulsion for employees to pad themselves with cash mid-shift and scurry to the nearest bank \u2013 though branch workers questioned at times just what these limits were in place to protect. It must have been with limited relief, for instance, that bottom-rung staff at William Hill read in a recent brochure for shareholders that the company had managed to reduce the average amount of cash lost during robberies \u2013 down something like \u00a380 per raid on the year.</p> <h2>9. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m alive\u201d </h2> <p><strong>After years of proud defiance,</strong> in 2014 William Hill informed its staff that they would now be asked to work alone in their shops during the evening. A spokesman told me: \u201cAs the over-the-counter part of the business declined, and costs and taxes increased, it made sense to operate to the right level of staffing.\u201d A Hull-based deputy manager recalled: \u201cWe were told over fancy sandwiches in a hotel.\u201d</p> <p>William Hill described staff reaction as \u201cmixed\u201d. To the deputy manager and her colleagues, the move felt like a stunning reversal. The policy was rolled out across two-thirds of William Hill\u2019s shops. By October 2014, executives at the company felt warmly enough towards single-manning to defend it from possible regulation. In a consultation with the government\u2019s Gambling Commission about betting shop licence conditions, William Hill stated it would be \u201can undue and unjustifiable interference for regulators to dictate staffing levels\u201d in betting shops. The deputy manager of a William Hill in Bletchley, Buckinghamshire, had not long before been released from hospital, his face unrecognisably bruised and his lung punctured after an attack by two machine gamblers who would not leave when he tried to close up his shop. He had been alone. \u201cThe blame for this criminal act should lay firmly with the perpetrators,\u201d a William Hill spokesman told me, adding: \u201cIt would be wrong to use this case to make a point on lone working generally.\u201d</p> <p>That spring, the Liberal Democrat MP for Carshalton and Wallington, Tom Brake, invited representatives from Ladbrokes to his Westminster office. One of Brake\u2019s constituents had raised concerns about the industry\u2019s response, or lack of it, to Iacovou\u2019s death. The trio of Ladbrokes reps huddled with Brake around a table at Portcullis House and explained a possible new safety initiative. Special software would be installed on betting shop computers, Brake was told, programmed to alert Ladbrokes\u2019 central security office if staff did not use their mouse or keyboard for 45 minutes. In the meeting the MP asked the representatives if they would consider more substantial measures, such as abandoning single-manning. Brake recalled being told no: \u201cThe finances didn\u2019t stack up.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5bcf0b04b380494a9b6f6375683742798d899ac3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5bcf0b04b380494a9b6f6375683742798d899ac3/0_187_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"William Hill better shop\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018William Hill stated it would be \u2018an undue and unjustifiable interference for regulators to dictate staffing levels\u2019 in betting shops.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The mouse-movement initiative was \u201ca nonsense\u201d, a senior figure inside Ladbrokes at the time admitted. \u201cA lot of things can happen to someone in 45 minutes.\u201d (It was never implemented.)</p> <p>Multiple sources suggested that more tangible measures were being considered, such as portable panic alarms. As well as being equipped with a button to contact Ladbrokes\u2019 central security office, the alarms contained motion sensors. Lie flat for more than 15 seconds and an alarm would be triggered. In theory, no staff member wearing an alarm would suffer Iacovou\u2019s fate of prolonged non-discovery. Devices were distributed to about half the company\u2019s shops in 2014 and 2015, at first to the locations deemed most at risk of violent incident. Miss X\u2019s Ladbrokes, in the Leicester area, was not among those branches to get alarms.</p> <p>She was working the evening shift on Friday 5 June 2015. It was a quiet night. TVs in the shop broadcast foreign horse racing and a tennis match on clay at the French Open, but there were no customers in to gamble on it. Miss X whiled away the time behind the counter on her phone. At 8.58pm, a little more than an hour before closing, a regular she recognised called Vijay Singh came into the shop and started playing on the machines. He wore a black T-shirt and faded jeans, and had his dark hair spiked with gel. Singh played for about 25 minutes, gambling and losing around \u00a3400.</p> <p>At 9.24pm, he signalled to Miss X that there was something wrong with his machine. Miss X opened the locked door that secured her service area from the shop floor, and checked the machine. She found no fault. She returned behind her counter and picked up her phone. Minutes later, Singh again said there was a problem with his machine. This time, when Miss X emerged, he grabbed her by the wrists. Singh pushed her backwards through the service area and forced her into a bathroom at the rear of the building.</p> <p>Twenty minutes passed.</p> <p>At 9.49pm, Singh emerged from the rear of the shop with blood on his jeans. On his way towards the exit, he tried to open the till behind the counter, but could not. Instead he picked up a bag of loose coins and left.</p> <p>Another 20 minutes passed.</p> <p>Nobody was aware that there had been an attack in the branch until Miss X regained consciousness, at around 10.10pm, and dialled 999 herself. Hiding in the bathroom, she told the dispatch controller she had been beaten, throttled, threatened with murder and sexually assaulted. Her nose was broken and her neck was fractured.</p> <p>Waiting for officers to arrive, she said to the controller: \u201cI\u2019m so scared.\u201d She said: \u201cHe was on the machines. I think he lost a lot of money.\u201d She said: \u201cI\u2019m in so much pain \u2026 I\u2019m bleeding so much \u2026 I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m alive.\u201d</p> <p>The controller asked if there was anybody else in the shop with her.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid not.\u201d</p> <p>Half a second\u2019s pause. \u201cYou\u2019re just working there on your own, are you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p> <h2>10. A judge\u2019s verdict</h2> <p><strong>It was the week leading up</strong> to another Grand National weekend, in April 2016, when I visited Anita Iacovou in Cheam. Her youngest son answered the door. Anita apologised for not being able to stand up; she was suffering from a medical condition that made mobility difficult. Beside her in her chair in the front room she had packets of boxed medicine, a pile of letters and a tabloid newspaper, turned to the runners and riders for the big race. Anita said she was still fond of betting shops, and that she had been down the road to the nearest one that morning. Reaching for the tabloid, she pointed out her pick for the Grand National: number eight, an outsider with odds of 40/1 called On His Own.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Anita Iacovou said that Andrew\u2019s death had been denied its only possible positive outcome</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Morden Ladbrokes where her husband worked had not reopened since the day of his death. Sheets of pale plastic had been put up in the windows where the posters had once been. Anita knew what had happened in that other Ladbrokes in the Leicester area in the summer of 2015 \u2013 the Daily Mail had telephoned her afterwards to ask her opinion. She had followed developments in the Midlands since then, with pity and even some guilt. Anita recalled that, at her husband\u2019s funeral in July 2013, she had asked the priest to speak a few words about the fact of Andrew working alone when he died. Senior figures from Ladbrokes were in attendance that day. There was a definite thickening of the atmosphere, guests recalled, when the priest sermonised about the value of money against the value of a human life. The family expected something substantial would change afterwards, and when it didn\u2019t, and then the attack on Miss X happened, Anita said that Andrew\u2019s death had been denied its only possible positive outcome.</p> <p>As we spoke in her front room, Ladbrokes was about to stage its spring AGM. Without knowing it, Anita had been on a list of possible \u201cproblem attendees\u201d at these gatherings ever since 2013. According to a source, it had been feared that she would show up, asking awkward questions; but really Anita\u2019s fight was quieter than that. She only wanted to feel that her husband\u2019s death had meant something.</p> <p>William Hill continues to single-man its shops. A spokesman told me the company was \u201ccontinually monitoring\u201d the situation, but it was \u201cvery unlikely\u201d they would all be dual-manned again. Betfred, Coral, Paddy Power and Stan James continue to single-man. Ladbrokes, in the weeks after the attack in the Leicester area, quietly suspended single-manning in surrounding shops, but it was soon reinstated.</p> <p>The company\u2019s CEO, Jim Mullen, decided last year that single-scheduling would become voluntary for staff working after 7pm. This opt-out policy would be extended gradually across the Ladbrokes\u2019 estate and extra staff hired, employees were told. They could expect it in every branch by January 2016. In January 2016, the date for completion was pushed back to October 2016. Scepticism had already set in behind counters about that word \u201cvoluntary\u201d. Some had already tried to opt out of single-manning, they told me, and had been pressured into reconsidering. \u201cThreatened with being relocated,\u201d a manager in north Wales reported. \u201cIt\u2019s a choice that doesn\u2019t really seem like a choice,\u201d said a manager in Edinburgh. (Ladbrokes said: \u201cWe would never tolerate victimisation of an employee for raising a concern of any nature.\u201d)</p> <p>Vijay Singh was arrested on 7 June 2015, two days after his attack on Miss X. He was in hiding at his brother-in-law\u2019s house, where bloody jeans were found stuffed in a cabinet. When Singh\u2019s brother-in-law was interviewed by police, he disclosed that the first thing Singh had said after coming out of Ladbrokes on the night of the attack was: \u201cI\u2019ve just killed somebody.\u201d Only later did Singh learn Miss X had survived the ordeal. When he was brought to trial at Stafford crown court in May 2016, charged with attempted murder, sexual assault by penetration, and theft, Miss X testified for the prosecution.</p> <p>The trial lasted just over two weeks \u2013 ample time for more incidents to occur. In Manchester, police pursued an eastern European man who had spent \u201cseveral hours\u201d playing a FOBT in a city-centre Ladbrokes, waiting for the manager to be left alone, before pulling a knife. In Ware, a pregnant Ladbrokes employee was robbed in her shop. Meanwhile, in Stafford, at the end of a draining trial, the jury in the case was sent out to deliberate.</p> <p>They were gone for hours. The court\u2019s public gallery emptied, and a representative from Ladbrokes, who for days had been transcribing the events of the trial on a laptop, went for his lunch. I walked to the nearest betting shop \u2013 a Ladbrokes on Stafford\u2019s main shopping parade, next to an off-licence and below a solicitor\u2019s office. At the back of the branch, behind the counter, a young employee read a newspaper. He had a chunky plastic panic alarm clipped awkwardly to the collar of his red polo shirt. On the shop floor, an old man waited for the two o\u2019clock at Kempton. By the door were the four FOBTs, one taken up by a middle-aged man playing a puzzle game called The Sky\u2019s The Limit, another taken by a thirtysomething playing roulette. The other machines were idle, their high-definition screens programmed to flash through routine announcements: ads for the games that might be played on them, and bald warnings about the risks of playing these games incautiously. One machine flashed a message, black-on-red, that told customers not to gamble when upset. The other said in capital letters: \u201cSTAY IN CONTROL.\u201d</p> <p>After five hours\u2019 deliberation, the jury returned with a verdict. Singh was guilty. Judge Michael Chambers, presiding, described the crimes as \u201chorrendous\u201d and said that Singh could expect \u201csubstantial imprisonment\u201d. Preparing to dismiss the jury, Chambers thanked them for their time and said that, as he was sure they would agree, one aspect of the case had been especially troubling. How, Chambers wondered aloud, could Ladbrokes ever have allowed a young woman to be working on her own that night? The judge called it \u201cforeseeable\u201d that someone like Singh would take advantage of such a situation. \u201cIn my view,\u201d Chambers said, \u201cLadbrokes\u2019 actions in this case can be viewed as extremely negligent.\u201d</p> <p>The judge then turned from the jury to look at the public gallery, where the Ladbrokes representative sat behind a laptop. \u201cI hope,\u201d the judge said, slowly and clearly, \u201cyou will record that.\u201d The representative typed.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">here</a>.</p>",
                "bodyText":"On its last full day of trading, the Ladbrokes betting shop in Morden, south-west London, stayed open until 10 at night. It was Friday 24 May 2013, the beginning of one of those spring-summer weekends for which the schedules of global sport combine to throw up a glut of events that can be gambled on. A European football final, a super-middleweight title fight, a Grand Prix, high-season horse races, a golf tournament. The manager of the Morden Ladbrokes, a 55-year-old Londoner named Andrew Iacovou, sat behind his shop\u2019s counter with a computer, a scroll printer, a coin tray and, beside his knees, a safe \u2013 waiting to take bets. A balding and naturally slight man who spent his free hours in the gym, Iacovou had worked for Ladbrokes for more than 20 years. Quiet but not unconfident and well liked by his regular customers, he was one of the company\u2019s 15,500 employees, around 11,000 of whom worked in Ladbrokes\u2019 2,200 shops. Iacovou had run a Ladbrokes in Wimbledon, a Ladbrokes in Earlsfield and another Ladbrokes in Morden before moving to his current branch, a glass-fronted shop next to a supermarket, just across the A24 from Morden tube. For more than two decades with the firm, he had seen through changes to the staff uniform (tomato-red polo shirts, now) as well as a series of dispiriting adjustments to his daily workload. In the 1990s, when Iacovou first met his wife, Anita, then a Post Office employee, he worked at the Wimbledon branch. It shut to customers at 5.30pm and Iacovou would close down the premises by 6pm, ready to walk Anita home. His Morden branch, in 2013, was open seven days a week, from 8.30am or 9am until 10pm. Iacovou generally worked five of those days, sometimes six, often from start to finish. For some hours in the afternoon he would be joined at the till by an assistant, a cashier who helped him process handwritten bets that came in over the counter. Otherwise, Iacovou manned the shop alone, relying on his regulars for company. They were mostly male, mostly retired, often on their way to or from the nearby Ganley\u2019s pub. There was a rosy-faced man in his 60s, called Michael, who sat at a shop kiosk and frowned at length over his spread-out betting slips, ruminating before committing to a day\u2019s wagers. There was a taxi driver, Alan the Taxi, who parked in the rank outside and came in to bet the occasional \u00a35 on football. A fellow cabbie, John the Taxi, didn\u2019t gamble, but he came in and out to use the loo. Both drivers brought with them takeaway coffees for Iacovou, who could not leave the shop unless his cashier was there. The branch had a regular named Ray, who bet horses, and Kistensamy, who bet horses, and Bill, who only bet dogs. There was a relative newcomer, Shafique Aarij, a man in his 20s with pocked skin who had drawn attention to himself by combing his hair, nervously, whenever he played on one of the shop\u2019s electronic gambling machines. That Friday, Aarij complained to the manager about a problem with one of these machines. Iacovou had to come out from behind his counter to see what was wrong. It was one of dozens of menial but mounting tasks he had to see to: filling the coupon trays; scissoring out form guides from the Racing Post and arranging them on magnetic display boards; alternating posters in the street-facing windows; managing customers who approached his till holding winning slips (and those who came anyway, as losers, to moan); monitoring the amount of money in the coin tray, in the till, and in the safe; monitoring the door, in case someone too young or too unsavoury-looking should try to enter; monitoring the shop\u2019s four gambling machines, in case any of them should break down, the colours on the simulated casino games turn funny or the calibration on the touchscreens slip out of sync. At the end of the day these machines had to be laboriously emptied of takings and the shop otherwise shut down. Though Iacovou\u2019s branch closed to customers at 10, that night he did not get back to his home in Cheam until midnight. He was exhausted, his wife recalled, and he slept in his uniform. In the morning, Iacovou took the bus back to the Morden branch, arriving at around 8am, in time to meet a colleague from another Ladbrokes who had come to collect a set of spare keys. The pair chatted briefly. There had been a time when they might have been rostered to spend Saturday together in the shop, but no longer. Iacovou was not expecting his cashier to arrive until after lunch. The managers said goodbye to each other and Iacovou began to prepare for trade, turning on the machines and checking that each of their coin and note slots were functioning properly. He put up pages from the Racing Post and took out cleaning products to tidy his counter area. The posters in the street-facing window that morning said \u201cWin\u201d, \u201cFREE BET\u201d, \u201cGuaranteed\u201d, \u201cDebit cards accepted\u201d. Iacovou opened a locked door that separated the shop floor from his service area and sat down at his till. As it turned 8.30am, he pressed a button to unseal the shop\u2019s magnetically locked front door, and was open for business. The first customer was Shafique Aarij. That morning he was carrying a shoulder bag. He went to one of the gambling machines. As had happened the day before, Aarij signalled to Iacovou that there was a problem with his machine. The manager stood up and started to unlock the door beside his counter. As soon as the latch was turned, Aarij pushed in. He grabbed Iacovou around the neck. The two men struggled. Aarij took a claw hammer from his bag and struck Iacovou over the head with it. He struck again, and again, and then he turned his attention to the safe. 2. A part of British life It is a rare British high street that has not come to be kitted out, today, in the colours of the bookmakers. In every town, on every retail row, the routine sweep of bank and salon and shrunken supermarket will be studded at almost mathematical intervals by the red of a Ladbrokes storefront or the blue and yellow of a William Hill, likely as well by the blue of a Coral, the blue and red of a Betfred, the pale green of a Stan James or the clover-leaf shade of a Paddy Power. In total, there are around 9,000 licensed betting shops in the UK, around half of those operated by Ladbrokes and William Hill. The two corporations are great and bitter rivals, tracing a contempt for one another back to the 1930s. Difficult as it is to credit now, both companies once shared a snotty attitude about the idea of bookmakers having shops. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be very nice,\u201d said Mr William Hill, founder of William Hill, in 1956, \u201cto see at every street corner a betting shop.\u201d There was never a Mr Ladbrokes; the company was named for a country house where its founders trained horses in the 1880s. Up to the 1960s it reckoned itself too posh for street-level trade. Bookmakers at the time operated under licence only at racetracks, or took bets from private customers by post or telephone. Profits made in this way were undermined by a thriving black market in illegal street betting. Before the tonnes of lurid acrylic got hoisted into place on shop fronts nationwide, British bookmaking had as its most visible identifier a lone man or boy, waiting with a satchel of money on any street corner that had a choice of escape routes. Betting shops were legalised in 1961. A year later, the Times audited the country, describing the first bookmakers\u2019 shops, and reporting on the genteel (a \u201cclean, sky-blue parlour\u201d) as well as the already run-down (a \u201cseedy, litter-strewn room containing listless youths sucking pencils\u201d). All had windows that were blacked out, at government insistence, to discourage loitering. An employee known as a \u201cmarker\u201d would stand by a blackboard, close to a telephone or later a loudspeaker that broadcast racing commentary, chalking up results. Another employee, called a \u201csettler\u201d, calculated odds in their head. Cashiers took in money and sometimes gave it out. Customers could not drink in betting shops, but they could smoke. These were bolt-holes, very often in the backstreets, stuffy but social, somewhere to be. And they were popular, particularly with working-class men. Once Ladbrokes and William Hill could not ignore the potential profits any longer, they began to open branches, or take over existing ones, and from the mid-1960s on, the two companies\u2019 spread was rapid and aggressive. Between them they absorbed dozens of smaller now-forgotten firms \u2013 Solomons &amp; Flanagan, JJ Simonds, Ken Munden, Fred Parkinson. William Hill had 100 shops by 1970, and Ladbrokes more than 400. \u201cThey are part of British life now,\u201d said Hill not long before he died. His company was bought by Sears Holdings Limited in 1971, and then traded on again through a number of conglomerates. Both William Hill and Ladbrokes became PLCs, floated on the stock market. They had 1,000 shops each, then 2,000. Wooden writing benches, pencilled over with decades\u2019 worth of redundant figuring, were removed from branches and replaced by plasticky kiosks. Instead of pencils came that icon of the modern betting shop, the complimentary pen: stubby, flat edged, much-chucked in frustration, apparently of limitless supply. Regulation changes in the 1980s allowed TVs to be installed in shops, bringing in races and results direct from horse and greyhound tracks. (That killed the role of the fast-chalking \u201cmarkers\u201d.) Cashiers, in the 1990s, got networked computers. (Thus the \u201csettlers\u201d also became redundant.) Plinky, pound-at-a-time fruit machines came in and then, around the turn of the millennium, the first modern gambling machines \u2013 \u201cfixed-odds betting terminals\u201d, or FOBTs (pronounced fobtees), offering a digitised version of roulette as well as other arcade-style games that could be gambled on. The major bookmakers also launched and invested in dotcom operations, but they were not especially light-footed about it, and their profits were eaten into by an online-only service named Betfair that empowered its customers to act as bookies themselves, setting odds and taking bets from one another. Takings fell. At around the same time, betting on the industry\u2019s totemic sports, horse racing and greyhound racing, dropped away. Staff observed that a younger generation of gambler had come to see track racing as jargon-heavy, too favourable to those with specialist knowledge \u2013 dad\u2019s fancy \u2013 and they preferred to bet on football instead. Broadly speaking, there was less profit for bookmakers there: in football, unlike in a 15- or 30-rider horse race, only one side could fail to win. Takings fell further. A new piece of legislation, the 2005 Gambling Act, had enforced a limit of four FOBTs per betting shop. The money fed into these four machines became ever more important to each shop\u2019s viability. Like characters in a certain type of sci-fi film, veteran staff now speak of a happier time \u2013 \u201cbefore the machines\u201d. FOBTs, when they came, were accepting of much larger sums than the fruit machines that preceded them. Up to \u00a3100 could be fed in and gambled every 20 seconds, an amount later curbed, under changing government regulations, to \u00a350 every 20 seconds. Losers lost faster, and losing became an identifiably scratchier thing. Staff explained: the customer who backed a too-slow horse or a crap dog might afterwards rail at fate or the gods, or even the employees behind their counters. But they could not plausibly claim to have been cheated. Machine players brought with them a new paranoia. FOBTs are fixed, thus the name \u2013 fixed-odds betting terminals. Over time they will pay back to customers 97.4% of the money that is put into them. Even so, it became a common thing for staff to be accused of rigging equipment, of dialling up losing streaks, of modulating people\u2019s electronic luck. Many shop workers I spoke to had stories about looking on, impotent, as the machines under their charge were angrily destroyed by the customers who had been playing them. Worse, somehow, was when a machine was calmly destroyed. The deputy manager of a William Hill in Hull said: \u201cYou just watch, there\u2019s nothing else to do. It\u2019s normal. It\u2019s normal for people to smash up the shop.\u201d (A representative of William Hill said this was \u201crare\u201d.) A woman working at an Oxfordshire Ladbrokes told me she had watched all four FOBTs in her shop get wrecked by a man swinging a stool; by the next day\u2019s trade, she said, her ruined machines had all been replaced. According to figures I have seen, the number of incidents of damage to machines in Ladbrokes branches rose steadily between 2010 and 2015. A senior figure at Ladbrokes during this period became increasingly concerned by the situation at shop-level \u201cgetting silly, getting crazy\u201d. They told me it was their belief that with the introduction of the machines, betting shops had more or less become \u201cmini casinos\u201d. And how many casinos, they asked, got by without bouncers to cope with aggrieved gamblers? How many were run by individuals on their own? 3. Work alone, or don\u2019t work Even after the markers were made redundant by TV, and the settlers run off by desktop computers, it was rare for employees to work in their betting shops alone; until it wasn\u2019t. While staff at William Hill were told by company bosses, often and emphatically, that they would not be asked to man branches by themselves at night, Ladbrokes began to draw up what it called a \u201csingle-scheduling\u201d policy in 2010. The policy meant that, subject to certain conditions, including a risk assessment of individual branches and a tick-box check of employee competence, shops could be run by one person for periods of the day and night. In fact, in the majority of shops, there would be a mandatory number of hours during which there could only be one person rostered to work. Single-manning, as staff started to call it, was trialled and then expanded around Ladbrokes\u2019 betting shops between 2011 and 2013. People at all levels of the company told me they were in no doubt as to why it was introduced. \u201cIt was a cost-cutting exercise,\u201d said an area manager who was then in charge of 15 branches in the south-east. A senior person in Ladbrokes\u2019 retail department at the time told me: \u201cThey recognised there were considerable savings to be made. Why double-man a shop between 10am and 1pm, or after 6pm, when it\u2019s quiet?\u201d Another well-placed source inside Ladbrokes at the time said they believed that by reducing staff from two to one in more than 2,000 shops, the company saved approximately \u00a315m a year. The Mirror reported that between 2009 and 2011, Ladbrokes\u2019 annual wage bill dropped by a third. (Ladbrokes said this was a result of cuts in staffing at all levels, not specifically on shop floors.) At shop level, a choice: work on your own, or risk your job. An area manager who worked in the north and oversaw the running of more than 60 branches told the 200-odd employees under his charge: \u201cWe can either close this amount of shops and make this amount of people redundant, or we can single-man.\u201d The area manager remembered \u201ca lot of emotion. A lot of staff felt it wasn\u2019t safe.\u201d (Ladbrokes acknowledged that \u201csome of our employees have strong opinions on working alone\u201d and said it encouraged feedback.) Though most shops would still be able to budget for a second employee \u2013 a cashier on minimum wage \u2013 during the busier afternoon horse-racing hours, most Ladbrokes\u2019 shop staff could now expect to work alone before midday and after 6pm. At first, those who agreed to single-man were paid extra \u2013 something like an additional 40p an hour. (The hourly pay for branch managers, who are known internally at Ladbrokes as customer service managers, varies by area and age. In 2016, for a 23-year-old in the Wirral, it is \u00a38.51 per hour.) A source inside Ladbrokes\u2019 head office at the time pointed out that the additional money was soon stopped. Internal Ladbrokes sources spoke candidly to me on the condition that I not use their names. So did most of the dozens of betting shop workers I consulted for this story. Entering branches around the UK, and introducing myself as a reporter, I became used to a singular response: behind the counter their eyes would flick, instinctively, to the nearest CCTV camera. Employees said they feared the sack if they complained in public forums about their working conditions. A Ladbrokes branch manager in Wales said that, when she posted a comment on Facebook in reference to the attack on Andrew Iacovou in Morden, she was contacted within 20 minutes by the firm\u2019s London office and told to delete it or she would enter a disciplinary process. A Ladbrokes employee in Birmingham reported the same. Many of the part-time-working students and other junior staff I interviewed insisted they did not expect to be in their jobs for ever, that a pervasive industry gloom would soon flush them out \u2013 but that they needed good references, so could their names be left out of my story? I met working parents, working parents-to-be, second-generation staff who worked in branches with their parents, and other employees who could not risk dismissal, so asked to speak anonymously. But they spoke. The area manager in the north recalled his shame at telling staff who were unnerved by single-manning in its early phase that they were really in no extra danger. Back then, said the area manager, \u201cI supported the company line, telling my staff: \u2018We need to do this.\u2019\u201d He told any staff who felt unsafe working alone that \u201cif there is a robbery, as long as you hand over all the money, it\u2019s unlikely the robbers will do anything to you. You\u2019re probably at no more risk of a robbery on your own than you are with two people.\u201d A senior figure at Ladbrokes told me that, from the introduction of single-manning in 2010 until the end of 2014, the company kept no figures recording whether a branch was single- or double-manned at the time of a criminal incident. For a time, said the area manager in the north, single-manning \u201cseemed pretty innocuous\u201d. Persuading his staff became easier when other major betting chains started to single-man. Employees at Betfred, Stan James, Coral and Paddy Power told me they were all asked to work in their shops alone on a frequent basis. \u201cFor a while it did work fine,\u201d said the area manager. \u201cAnd then Andrew Iacovou happened.\u201d 4. The Morden branch Andrew and Anita Iacovou first met inside a Ladbrokes. It was a Saturday in April 1995, Grand National weekend. Anita had put an each-way bet on a horse called Party Politics. \u201cIntuition,\u201d she said. When her horse finished second, she took her ticket to Iacovou, who was working behind the counter. They started talking. Iacovou was 37 and had grown up not far away, in South Norwood. His father was Greek and his mother English. Anita was 34, second-generation Indian, with dark hair that she tied back in a knot. Iacovou must have been distracted, chatting, because he shorted Anita on her winnings. When she went back to check \u2013 \u00a333, wasn\u2019t it? \u2013 Iacovou asked her out. They married in 1999 and later had two sons. In 2005, the family moved to a flat in Cheam. For five years, until 2010, Iacovou worked at a Ladbrokes a walk away, on Tudor Drive. Then he was moved to the branch near Morden tube. \u201cHe told me he didn\u2019t feel safe there,\u201d Anita recalled. Twice, during Iacovou\u2019s evening shifts, the windows of his branch were broken by vandals. Anita\u2019s brother, Anil Punjabi, sometimes drove Anita and her sons to pick him up after work. But after a while, Punjabi recalled, Iacovou asked him not to bring the family on these trips, fearing they would be vulnerable in the car outside. The sensation of safety is not a hard currency; it cannot be passed around in token form. The Morden Ladbrokes had CCTV cameras inside it, a steel-framed front door with a magnetic lock, a latch-lock on the door between the shop floor and the service area, and an employee panic button under the counter. As dozens of shop employees pointed out to me, however, it is still possible to feel unsafe in the middle of a fortress like this, particularly at night, particularly when unaccompanied. The deputy manager of a Betfred in Sussex was working on her own when one night she was threatened with rape by a frustrated machine gambler. \u201cHe told me: \u2018You\u2019d like it.\u2019 I remember thinking: \u2018There\u2019s nowhere I can run.\u2019\u201d The Betfred deputy rang the police that night, and again the following night, and again the night after that, because the same man kept returning to the shop as soon as her assistant cashier left for the evening. For a while she took anti-anxiety medication, she said, to be able to keep working, and then she resigned. A female Ladbrokes worker in Oxfordshire recalled being told by a customer: \u201cI\u2019m going to come back at 10 o\u2019clock, when you close, and take you.\u201d She was 19. Employees, particularly women \u2013 of whom the betting-shop industry has an unusually high number, around 50% in branches \u2013 told me they had often asked husbands or friends to sit in shops with them on evenings they were rostered to work alone. Certain branches in certain areas were from the start deemed too dangerous to be single-manned. The neighbourhood around Andrew Iacovou\u2019s Morden shop was not judged by Ladbrokes\u2019 risk-assessment team to present any special danger. Part of the way Ladbrokes decided this was by considering unpleasant incidents that had already taken place inside a shop. It rated such incidents by degree. Verbal abuse from a customer was a \u201clevel one\u201d; physical abuse a \u201clevel two\u201d; physical abuse that resulted in hospitalisation a \u201clevel three\u201d. Suffer enough twos or threes and head office would take a shop off the single-manning list, at least for a short while. Andrew Iacovou\u2019s Morden branch had not had enough level twos or level threes. Anita worried for her husband. You did not have to search especially hard for stories about violence in British betting shops at the time. A machete robbery at a Betfred in Ashton-in-Makerfield in March 2013. A man who had entered a Ladbrokes in Southampton in April 2013, and leapt over the counter with a kitchen knife. Between them, the Iacovous had an arrangement: Andrew would call Anita from his shop, usually at about 8.30am, when he would have settled in, and then again at intervals through the day. On Saturday 25 May, Anita did not receive the expected call. She rang the shop and got no answer. She continued to call. Trying to work out what had happened later, police investigators rewatched CCTV footage recorded in the shop. They saw Shafique Aarij struggle with Iacovou behind the counter. This was at 8.33am. They saw Aarij hit Iacovou with a hammer, multiple times. Blood spotted his face, and he wiped at it. Within minutes of the attack Aarij had left the shop. Examining the shop\u2019s safe, police saw that its handle had received a hammer blow, but had remained locked. They knew from shop records that \u00a3296.86 had disappeared from the till. Aarij must have taken this when he fled, at around 8.35am. 8.45am. 9am. 9.15am. For between 45 minutes and an hour, nobody outside the Morden branch was aware that anything unusual had happened inside. Andrew Iacovou lay in such a way behind his counter that he could not be seen from the shop floor. Customers came and went. Someone played on one of the machines. Eventually Kistensamy, one of the regulars, approached the counter and saw a body. He ran to the supermarket next door and raised the alarm. An ambulance came. Iacovou was pronounced dead by paramedics at 10.28am. 5. \u201cA tough year\u201d From branch to branch, rumours of a murder spread. Staff at a William Hill in Glasgow heard that an employee had been stabbed. At a Coral in Hemel Hempstead it was said that someone had been shot. In a Facebook group for industry professionals (the group is called \u201cI No Longer Fear Hell, I\u2019ve Worked in a Betting Shop\u201d and has over 14,000 members) Iacovou was discussed within hours of his death. \u201cWhat happened? Robbery gone wrong? Was he single-manning?\u201d The suggestion that Iacovou had lain undiscovered for so long was especially distressing to people. This was one of their great fears. In the Facebook group, a discussion about possible strike action led nowhere. A hopeless, gravedigger humour set in instead. \u201cIf you\u2019re single-manning and something happens,\u201d someone asked, \u201cwho will call for help?\u201d Someone replied: \u201cGhostbusters.\u201d Members discussed the wild inconsistency with which glass security screens were installed in shops, many premises going without (\u201cShow me one bank that doesn\u2019t have them for cash transactions\u201d). They compared notes about how easily a magnetically sealed front door could be forced by a determined intruder (\u201cI weigh 11 stone and \u2026 \u201d). They remembered the old days (\u201cI started in \u201994 \u2026 home by 5.30pm in the winter\u201d) and exchanged grim warnings about the future (\u201cNext time it could be any one of you\u201d). One especially distressing rumour about Iacovou spread between them: that before he died, the manager had been able to press the panic alarm beneath his counter, and that this alarm, while it had registered at Ladbrokes\u2019 central security office, had somehow gone unanswered. I was told by well-placed sources that this rumour was accurate. When the alarm registered at Ladbrokes\u2019 security office, a live CCTV feed from the shop was checked by a control room operator; but the operator saw only Aarij, not Iacovou. The operator also saw the cleaning materials that Iacovou had put out on his service area. It was assumed that Aarij was a cleaner who must have pressed the panic button by mistake. (A Ladbrokes spokesperson said that after this killing, \u201cchanges were made with regard to how our security control room responds to incidents\u201d.) In Cheam, Anita Iacovou heard nothing all morning. At 2pm, police visited her at the flat. Ladbrokes\u2019 security chief came too, as did a second Ladbrokes\u2019 representative. Anita was asked to step in to her bedroom to speak with a policewoman. Anita said, instinctively: \u201cHe\u2019s in the hospital.\u201d The policewoman said no, Andrew was dead. Anita said, \u201cYou\u2019re joking,\u201d and the policewoman said no. The two children were at home. Anita called them into the room to tell them what had happened. There is not a lot more she can recall of the afternoon. She knows she turned to the two Ladbrokes representatives, in the family living room, and asked: why was he ever left there alone? Aarij, 21, was found by police five days later, hiding at a friend\u2019s home in east London. When interviewed at Sutton police station, Aarij accepted that he had gone to the betting shop in Morden that morning to steal money. That he had armed himself with a hammer beforehand. That he knew there was likely to be only one person on duty. When police asked why he had killed Iacovou, Aarij told them: \u201cWhen the siren was ringing I got scared and I became upset and then I was not in my senses.\u201d Police charged Aarij with murder. At trial in November 2013 he was found guilty. In January 2014 he was sentenced to life in prison, with a minimum of 26 years. Ladbrokes paid a modest sum to Anita Iacovou and her family. (A well-placed source put it at \u00a3140,000.) Ladbrokes also launched a JustGiving page in Iacovou\u2019s memory, kicking off donations with \u00a310,000. The company paid for Iacovou\u2019s funeral, in July 2013. During Aarij\u2019s murder trial, Ladbrokes arranged for taxis to take Anita and her family to and from court. In its December report for shareholders, the company described 2013 as \u201ca tough year\u201d. Delicate mention was made of the murder. It was called \u201ca random violent attack\u201d. The area manager in the north recalled: \u201cThe thinking was we sell it as a one-in-a-million anomaly that can never happen again.\u201d A senior figure at Ladbrokes at the time confirmed this. \u201cThose were conversations that were being had at senior level. It was taken as: \u2018The shell doesn\u2019t land in the same place twice.\u2019\u201d Another senior figure at Ladbrokes at the time said: \u201cThere was a naivety.\u201d Shortly after Morden, an internal investigation was launched, and Ladbrokes\u2019 single-scheduling policy found to be adequate. When a new branch opened in the Leicester area that year, it was added, like hundreds of others, to the list of Ladbrokes that could be run by one person. In early 2014, a woman in her 20s was interviewed for a job at the branch. A court later imposed restrictions on the reporting of this woman\u2019s name \u2013 she would come to be known internally at the company as Miss X. During her interview, Miss X asked about the possibility of the shop being robbed. Weren\u2019t betting shops targeted all the time? \u201cThey just want the money,\u201d Miss X was told. \u201cHand the money over and everything will be fine.\u201d She got the job. 6. The rise of the machines Keen to turn up new markets, bookmakers not long ago started offering odds on the chancellor\u2019s spring Budget. What colour would George Osborne\u2019s tie be? How many times would the phrase \u201cLabour\u2019s economic mess\u201d be used? Really, though, nobody in the betting world can look forward to the spring, when chancellors generally shake down this industry with indecent rigour. Betting firms have for some years paid an unusually high rate of tax \u2013 more than \u00a31bn annually. Between 2011 and 2015 the operating profit before tax of Ladbrokes\u2019 retail arm fell from \u00a3152.3m to \u00a3116.1m, and its tax obligations in that period only went up. When Osborne\u2019s 2014 Budget raised the duty on takings from FOBTs from 20 to 25%, it was reckoned to cost the industry something like an extra \u00a370m a year. At the time, a Ladbrokes spokesperson complained: \u201cThe pips are squeaking.\u201d And yet, these hundreds of branches of Ladbrokes, all those William Hills and Paddy Powers and Betfreds \u2013 they were everywhere, around Birmingham\u2019s Bullring, up and down Aberdeen\u2019s Union Street, Cardiff-wide, packed into London\u2019s boroughs. In a decade when the high street has come out strongly in favour of thrift and convenience, betting shops have clung on as an unlikely modern super-presence. Of course, they are not much use to the thrifty. But they\u2019re not especially convenient either \u2013 placing a bet is a transaction far more easily accomplished invisibly, online, than in a material shop, where you\u2019ll likely trample in over a carpeting of abandoned bet slips (these boxy, overbright spaces always tend to look as if a major parade has just passed through) and in that climate of tension and boredom, biro out a prediction longhand. Win, and you\u2019ll have to go back. If you mislay your little receipt, write it off. They would once have been as densely packed as pubs, stopped at with the religious regularity of churches, taut with etiquette, like a public library \u2013 but walk into one of Britain\u2019s 9,000 betting shops in 2016 and you will rarely find it full or even busy. Who are all the shops for? Usually men. Their expressions often sullen. There\u2019s a William Hill in Hull in which, by unspoken agreement, Turks stick to one side of the shop and Kurds to the other. In one Ladbrokes in Sheffield, the white, Asian, eastern European and Somali customers mix well. Privately, informally, staff divide the modern class of betting-shop punter into two broad groups: the Older Gentlemen (in for the horses) and the Machine Gamblers. At Andrew Iacovou\u2019s branch in Morden, there was an elderly regular from the West Indies, known to the others as Rocky, who didn\u2019t gamble on either horses or the machines. He just seemed to want a place to be, and often cleaned up the discarded betting slips to help out. Bookmakers buy lots of television advertising time to promote gambling through their websites and mobile-phone apps, while their vast estates of retail outlets go just about unmentioned. Betting shops can seem marginal places today, even through the eyes of those who run them. Yet as pubs vanish, churches vanish, libraries vanish, the marginalised have not vanished. Walking around near Morden tube, three years after Iacovou\u2019s murder, I wondered if I would be able to find any of his former customers. I soon realised that I only had to speak to men on the street \u2013 those who looked to be of retirement age and who looked to be doing nothing in particular. They all knew Iacovou\u2019s Ladbrokes. They had dispersed, since his death, to the Paddy Power a few hundred metres away, to the Stan James across the road, to the Ladbrokes on Tudor Drive, to the William Hill further along the A24. Who are all these shops for? Better to ask what they\u2019re for. When the Labour government in 2005 made law a maximum of four FOBTs per betting shop, it had meant to limit peoples\u2019 exposure to the machines. Four ought to be enough. But a betting firm such as Ladbrokes will retain only about \u00a32 from every \u00a3100 spent on its FOBTs. The machines are profitable only on a high-volume/low-margin basis; that is to say, after factoring spend on staffing, real estate, and renting the machines (most of which are owned by third-party companies), there\u2019s no money in them unless they\u2019re played widely and played often. An unintended effect of the 2005 Gambling Act may have been to encourage bookmakers to open more shops, and to move existing shops from the back streets to more visible parts of cities and towns. Locals in Great Yarmouth recently campaigned to stop a ninth betting shop opening in the town centre. Last year, residents of Thornton Heath tried to resist a 14th betting shop opening within a single postal district. In 2010, on Birmingham\u2019s Stephenson Street, a Ladbrokes opened next door to a Ladbrokes. There are 26 branches of William Hill in greater Hull, and when I asked why, a spokesman explained it was \u201cto cater to local demand\u201d. (The Association of British Bookmakers, or ABB, the industry body that represents the major chains, said that the overall number of betting shops has actually decreased in recent years, and added: \u201cOver 60% of existing betting shops have been trading from the same location for over 20 years.\u201d) After 2005, bookmakers began to open their shops earlier in the morning and later at night. According to the ABB, this was to broadcast and take bets on evening sporting events. But senior industry employees told me that it was to create extra hours of machine use \u2013 a feeling shared on shop floors. \u201cFour walls around the FOBTs,\u201d was how one manager described her branch. \u201cWe\u2019re chaperones for the machines these days,\u201d said another manager, \u201ceveryone knows that.\u201d 7. The Ladbrokes experience When I questioned the ABB about single-manning and other working conditions in betting shops, a spokesman pointed out that those who work in petrol stations and newsagents often do so alone. Other industry sources said that lorry drivers and taxi drivers worked solo, too. The comparisons were not unfair, but they did not take full account of the nature of betting shops, or their peculiar presence. Known to be everywhere, known to have cash. As likely as not staffed by a woman, more likely than not staffed alone. They were often near pubs, nightclubs, takeaways, cab ranks. They stayed open late. Ever since the extension of opening hours, branch workers told me, they had been more likely to have to deal with customers who were drunk or on drugs. They also told me about the other sort of difficult customer: the non-customer, bewildered, unstable, otherwise desperate, drifting in because they could not reliably expect to idle anywhere else during unsociable hours without being ushered on. An employee of Ladbrokes in Birmingham, Harry Vale, was taken aback in 2013 to be asked by his area manager to start buying food and drink for people who came into his shop. Not just complimentary cups of tea but full meals, from McDonald\u2019s or Greggs. \u201cWe had a ringbinder with their favourites written down,\u201d Vale said, adding that the free food initiative, dreamed up in 2013 and introduced in multiple branches around the Midlands, did not seem to him the wisest arrangement when it came to the issue of vulnerable or unstable people hanging around in betting shops. But, then, Vale was pretty new to the business at the time, and a great many industry conventions can seem baffling to the uninitiated. For instance, there is \u201cbanking\u201d, an industry-wide practice by which betting-shop staff are asked to take excess cash out of their safes and then travel, often with thousands of pounds hidden about their person, to deposit it at the nearest bank or Post Office. (\u201cWe\u2019re only supposed to take \u00a35,000 at a time,\u201d said a branch worker in Oxfordshire, adding that she had once taken as much as \u00a39,000 on a single trip, distributing it about herself in different pockets.) And then there was \u201cthe Ladbrokes Experience\u201d, a company initiative launched in 2013, not long after the Morden murder, that would have Ladbrokes staff come out from behind their locked counters and interact with customers. \u201cWe had to go to our teams and brief this,\u201d recalled the area manager in the north, \u201cafter Andrew Iacovou. That they had to be on the shop floor at all times. That the only time they were allowed to stay behind the counter was if they felt they had a very specific threat.\u201d Mia Whitaker, 21 that year, was working in a Ladbrokes in the Moor area of Sheffield. She had good reason to want to stay behind her counter, her own Ladbrokes experience having been made horrible by two regulars, young taxi drivers, who came in to play the FOBTs or to watch sport. When Whitaker passed them on the shop floor, she recalled, \u201cthey would try to touch my bum and my chest\u201d. They offered taunting comments and gestures, coming in at night and when she was alone in the branch. Whitaker complained to her line manager, and later to Ladbrokes\u2019 central security office. (Ladbrokes told the Guardian: \u201cIf an employee raises concerns, we would investigate and where necessary take action.\u201d) The security office sent a trespass order to Whitaker\u2019s shop, meant for the two men, but when it arrived by post Whitaker said none of her colleagues would present it. Her manager suggested instead that he have a quiet word with the drivers \u2013 they were regular customers. Whitaker didn\u2019t have the nerve to present the trespass order herself. The taxi drivers knew what her hours were, and where her bus stop was. So for more than a year after that, until Whitaker left the job, the men kept coming into their local betting shop, where they could expect to play the machines, or to watch the evening darts, and to harass the 21-year-old who was nominally in charge. Looking back on this later, after a season of contained and uncontained chaos in the betting shops, Whitaker would have reason to be relieved that things only went so far. 8. The wild west One weekend, the manager of a Ladbrokes in Scotland was robbed by two men while she was alone in her branch. She later described the experience. \u201cOne had a hammer,\u201d she said. \u201cOne had a screwdriver. One of them pinned me in a corner with a hammer above my head, while the other one emptied the till. To me it felt like hours. I was thinking: \u2018I\u2019m not getting home from here.\u2019 I thought of the man in London. I thought: \u2018They\u2019re taking me out in a box today.\u2019 I thought: \u2018I\u2019m never going home.\u2019\u201d In June 2013, a month after Andrew Iacovou\u2019s killing, a Ladbrokes in Cardiff was robbed by two men, one carrying what police described as \u201ca small axe\u201d. In July, a Ladbrokes in Newcastle was robbed by a man with a seven-inch vegetable knife. In August, a Coral employee in Ewell, Surrey, was robbed in their branch by two men, claiming to be armed. In September, thieves threatened to \u201cchop up\u201d a Coral employee in his branch in Gorton, Manchester. They stole money and a plug-in telephone. Branch workers around the country described to me a feeling during this period that they were being kept out on the shop floor as a hindrance, but no real impediment, to incident; on display like scarecrows, and about as formidable a deterrent. \u201cPleasure doing business with you,\u201d a thief who robbed a William Hill in Whitstable in 2013 told staff on his way out. A member of a gang that robbed a Ladbrokes in Darlington in September that year returned to the same shop, the same day, to claim the \u00a3134 he had won on a FOBT while casing the joint. The same month, a man robbed a Ladbrokes in Welwyn Garden City by walking in with a bottle wrapped in wires and tape and telling the woman staffing the shop it was a bomb. She hid behind a door while the thief put the package on the counter and left with \u00a3500. After the bomb squad had been and gone, and the thief traced and arrested, it transpired he was out on licence for another robbery, of another Ladbrokes, with another lone-working employee, in 2010. \u201cIt had become like the wild west,\u201d said a senior figure inside Ladbrokes at the time. \u201cRobberies with shotguns. Staff and customers getting beaten up. People getting hospitalised. We were getting staff coming back to work [after incidents] with PTSD. They were shell-shocked.\u201d The Morden killing had already confirmed in this employee the opinion that nobody was realistically safe to work alone in betting shops. \u201cBut I was not allowed that view. I said [to my superiors]: \u2018This is not good.\u2019 I said: \u2018This is wrong.\u2019 But I was not allowed that view. So you make your noises and you get on with your job.\u201d Others made noises. A petition, launched online, \u201cto make it compulsory for high-street bookmakers to have two members of staff present during opening hours\u201d, gathered 3,824 signatures by November 2013. Nothing changed, and people got on with their jobs. In February 2014, the Labour MP for Islwyn, Chris Evans, raised the matter in a Westminster debate. Evans had once been a low-level betting shop employee himself. He proposed that the government might consider legislation to insist that staff in shops be equipped with panic alarms, so that they could at least call for help if they got into trouble. The Tory MP for Shipley, Philip Davies, responded first, voicing concerns about \u201cputting too much obligation on betting shops\u201d. (Davies has more than once been accused by newspapers of receiving personal benefits from links to the gambling industry \u2013 allegations he has denied.) Davies said that \u201cwe could end up, not with single-manned betting shops, but with no betting shops, and nobody in work\u201d. Evans said: \u201cAll I am looking for is simple, common-sense, cheap things \u2026 \u201d The debate puttered out. March 2014: a Stan James in Oxford, one armed robber saying to the other, of a lone-working employee made to kneel on the floor, \u201cShoot him. Shoot him.\u201d April 2014: a Paddy Power in Cheshunt, robbed by armed men in balaclavas on Grand National Saturday. July 2014: a Ladbrokes in Leyland, Lancashire, a female employee locked in the toilet while the shop was robbed of \u00a32,500. September 2014: a William Hill in Brighouse, West Yorkshire, a man carrying a piece of metal piping. October 2014: a Coral in Glasgow, a man carrying a piece of paper. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you, just give me the money, I\u2019ve got a knife,\u201d Kenneth Duncan wrote on a betting slip that he handed to 20-year-old Amber Johnstone. \u201cI\u2019m 5ft 6in. I look my age,\u201d Johnstone told me. \u201cI think the guy noticed a young girl on her own in the shop and saw it as a perfect opportunity.\u201d Duncan made off with \u00a3375. Johnstone could not sleep for months afterwards, and eventually entered therapy. Spokespeople for the bookmakers were often careful to stress to the public, after such robberies, that not much money was kept in any one location. \u201cIt is never as much as people think,\u201d said a Coral spokesperson, after the 2013 robbery in Ewell. There were strict limits on the amount of cash kept in branches \u2013 not more than \u00a32,000 in a Ladbrokes, that figure varying slightly from chain to chain. Limits were strictly enforced \u2013 thus the compulsion for employees to pad themselves with cash mid-shift and scurry to the nearest bank \u2013 though branch workers questioned at times just what these limits were in place to protect. It must have been with limited relief, for instance, that bottom-rung staff at William Hill read in a recent brochure for shareholders that the company had managed to reduce the average amount of cash lost during robberies \u2013 down something like \u00a380 per raid on the year. 9. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m alive\u201d After years of proud defiance, in 2014 William Hill informed its staff that they would now be asked to work alone in their shops during the evening. A spokesman told me: \u201cAs the over-the-counter part of the business declined, and costs and taxes increased, it made sense to operate to the right level of staffing.\u201d A Hull-based deputy manager recalled: \u201cWe were told over fancy sandwiches in a hotel.\u201d William Hill described staff reaction as \u201cmixed\u201d. To the deputy manager and her colleagues, the move felt like a stunning reversal. The policy was rolled out across two-thirds of William Hill\u2019s shops. By October 2014, executives at the company felt warmly enough towards single-manning to defend it from possible regulation. In a consultation with the government\u2019s Gambling Commission about betting shop licence conditions, William Hill stated it would be \u201can undue and unjustifiable interference for regulators to dictate staffing levels\u201d in betting shops. The deputy manager of a William Hill in Bletchley, Buckinghamshire, had not long before been released from hospital, his face unrecognisably bruised and his lung punctured after an attack by two machine gamblers who would not leave when he tried to close up his shop. He had been alone. \u201cThe blame for this criminal act should lay firmly with the perpetrators,\u201d a William Hill spokesman told me, adding: \u201cIt would be wrong to use this case to make a point on lone working generally.\u201d That spring, the Liberal Democrat MP for Carshalton and Wallington, Tom Brake, invited representatives from Ladbrokes to his Westminster office. One of Brake\u2019s constituents had raised concerns about the industry\u2019s response, or lack of it, to Iacovou\u2019s death. The trio of Ladbrokes reps huddled with Brake around a table at Portcullis House and explained a possible new safety initiative. Special software would be installed on betting shop computers, Brake was told, programmed to alert Ladbrokes\u2019 central security office if staff did not use their mouse or keyboard for 45 minutes. In the meeting the MP asked the representatives if they would consider more substantial measures, such as abandoning single-manning. Brake recalled being told no: \u201cThe finances didn\u2019t stack up.\u201d The mouse-movement initiative was \u201ca nonsense\u201d, a senior figure inside Ladbrokes at the time admitted. \u201cA lot of things can happen to someone in 45 minutes.\u201d (It was never implemented.) Multiple sources suggested that more tangible measures were being considered, such as portable panic alarms. As well as being equipped with a button to contact Ladbrokes\u2019 central security office, the alarms contained motion sensors. Lie flat for more than 15 seconds and an alarm would be triggered. In theory, no staff member wearing an alarm would suffer Iacovou\u2019s fate of prolonged non-discovery. Devices were distributed to about half the company\u2019s shops in 2014 and 2015, at first to the locations deemed most at risk of violent incident. Miss X\u2019s Ladbrokes, in the Leicester area, was not among those branches to get alarms. She was working the evening shift on Friday 5 June 2015. It was a quiet night. TVs in the shop broadcast foreign horse racing and a tennis match on clay at the French Open, but there were no customers in to gamble on it. Miss X whiled away the time behind the counter on her phone. At 8.58pm, a little more than an hour before closing, a regular she recognised called Vijay Singh came into the shop and started playing on the machines. He wore a black T-shirt and faded jeans, and had his dark hair spiked with gel. Singh played for about 25 minutes, gambling and losing around \u00a3400. At 9.24pm, he signalled to Miss X that there was something wrong with his machine. Miss X opened the locked door that secured her service area from the shop floor, and checked the machine. She found no fault. She returned behind her counter and picked up her phone. Minutes later, Singh again said there was a problem with his machine. This time, when Miss X emerged, he grabbed her by the wrists. Singh pushed her backwards through the service area and forced her into a bathroom at the rear of the building. Twenty minutes passed. At 9.49pm, Singh emerged from the rear of the shop with blood on his jeans. On his way towards the exit, he tried to open the till behind the counter, but could not. Instead he picked up a bag of loose coins and left. Another 20 minutes passed. Nobody was aware that there had been an attack in the branch until Miss X regained consciousness, at around 10.10pm, and dialled 999 herself. Hiding in the bathroom, she told the dispatch controller she had been beaten, throttled, threatened with murder and sexually assaulted. Her nose was broken and her neck was fractured. Waiting for officers to arrive, she said to the controller: \u201cI\u2019m so scared.\u201d She said: \u201cHe was on the machines. I think he lost a lot of money.\u201d She said: \u201cI\u2019m in so much pain \u2026 I\u2019m bleeding so much \u2026 I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m alive.\u201d The controller asked if there was anybody else in the shop with her. \u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid not.\u201d Half a second\u2019s pause. \u201cYou\u2019re just working there on your own, are you?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d 10. A judge\u2019s verdict It was the week leading up to another Grand National weekend, in April 2016, when I visited Anita Iacovou in Cheam. Her youngest son answered the door. Anita apologised for not being able to stand up; she was suffering from a medical condition that made mobility difficult. Beside her in her chair in the front room she had packets of boxed medicine, a pile of letters and a tabloid newspaper, turned to the runners and riders for the big race. Anita said she was still fond of betting shops, and that she had been down the road to the nearest one that morning. Reaching for the tabloid, she pointed out her pick for the Grand National: number eight, an outsider with odds of 40/1 called On His Own. The Morden Ladbrokes where her husband worked had not reopened since the day of his death. Sheets of pale plastic had been put up in the windows where the posters had once been. Anita knew what had happened in that other Ladbrokes in the Leicester area in the summer of 2015 \u2013 the Daily Mail had telephoned her afterwards to ask her opinion. She had followed developments in the Midlands since then, with pity and even some guilt. Anita recalled that, at her husband\u2019s funeral in July 2013, she had asked the priest to speak a few words about the fact of Andrew working alone when he died. Senior figures from Ladbrokes were in attendance that day. There was a definite thickening of the atmosphere, guests recalled, when the priest sermonised about the value of money against the value of a human life. The family expected something substantial would change afterwards, and when it didn\u2019t, and then the attack on Miss X happened, Anita said that Andrew\u2019s death had been denied its only possible positive outcome. As we spoke in her front room, Ladbrokes was about to stage its spring AGM. Without knowing it, Anita had been on a list of possible \u201cproblem attendees\u201d at these gatherings ever since 2013. According to a source, it had been feared that she would show up, asking awkward questions; but really Anita\u2019s fight was quieter than that. She only wanted to feel that her husband\u2019s death had meant something. William Hill continues to single-man its shops. A spokesman told me the company was \u201ccontinually monitoring\u201d the situation, but it was \u201cvery unlikely\u201d they would all be dual-manned again. Betfred, Coral, Paddy Power and Stan James continue to single-man. Ladbrokes, in the weeks after the attack in the Leicester area, quietly suspended single-manning in surrounding shops, but it was soon reinstated. The company\u2019s CEO, Jim Mullen, decided last year that single-scheduling would become voluntary for staff working after 7pm. This opt-out policy would be extended gradually across the Ladbrokes\u2019 estate and extra staff hired, employees were told. They could expect it in every branch by January 2016. In January 2016, the date for completion was pushed back to October 2016. Scepticism had already set in behind counters about that word \u201cvoluntary\u201d. Some had already tried to opt out of single-manning, they told me, and had been pressured into reconsidering. \u201cThreatened with being relocated,\u201d a manager in north Wales reported. \u201cIt\u2019s a choice that doesn\u2019t really seem like a choice,\u201d said a manager in Edinburgh. (Ladbrokes said: \u201cWe would never tolerate victimisation of an employee for raising a concern of any nature.\u201d) Vijay Singh was arrested on 7 June 2015, two days after his attack on Miss X. He was in hiding at his brother-in-law\u2019s house, where bloody jeans were found stuffed in a cabinet. When Singh\u2019s brother-in-law was interviewed by police, he disclosed that the first thing Singh had said after coming out of Ladbrokes on the night of the attack was: \u201cI\u2019ve just killed somebody.\u201d Only later did Singh learn Miss X had survived the ordeal. When he was brought to trial at Stafford crown court in May 2016, charged with attempted murder, sexual assault by penetration, and theft, Miss X testified for the prosecution. The trial lasted just over two weeks \u2013 ample time for more incidents to occur. In Manchester, police pursued an eastern European man who had spent \u201cseveral hours\u201d playing a FOBT in a city-centre Ladbrokes, waiting for the manager to be left alone, before pulling a knife. In Ware, a pregnant Ladbrokes employee was robbed in her shop. Meanwhile, in Stafford, at the end of a draining trial, the jury in the case was sent out to deliberate. They were gone for hours. The court\u2019s public gallery emptied, and a representative from Ladbrokes, who for days had been transcribing the events of the trial on a laptop, went for his lunch. I walked to the nearest betting shop \u2013 a Ladbrokes on Stafford\u2019s main shopping parade, next to an off-licence and below a solicitor\u2019s office. At the back of the branch, behind the counter, a young employee read a newspaper. He had a chunky plastic panic alarm clipped awkwardly to the collar of his red polo shirt. On the shop floor, an old man waited for the two o\u2019clock at Kempton. By the door were the four FOBTs, one taken up by a middle-aged man playing a puzzle game called The Sky\u2019s The Limit, another taken by a thirtysomething playing roulette. The other machines were idle, their high-definition screens programmed to flash through routine announcements: ads for the games that might be played on them, and bald warnings about the risks of playing these games incautiously. One machine flashed a message, black-on-red, that told customers not to gamble when upset. The other said in capital letters: \u201cSTAY IN CONTROL.\u201d After five hours\u2019 deliberation, the jury returned with a verdict. Singh was guilty. Judge Michael Chambers, presiding, described the crimes as \u201chorrendous\u201d and said that Singh could expect \u201csubstantial imprisonment\u201d. Preparing to dismiss the jury, Chambers thanked them for their time and said that, as he was sure they would agree, one aspect of the case had been especially troubling. How, Chambers wondered aloud, could Ladbrokes ever have allowed a young woman to be working on her own that night? The judge called it \u201cforeseeable\u201d that someone like Singh would take advantage of such a situation. \u201cIn my view,\u201d Chambers said, \u201cLadbrokes\u2019 actions in this case can be viewed as extremely negligent.\u201d The judge then turned from the jury to look at the public gallery, where the Ladbrokes representative sat behind a laptop. \u201cI hope,\u201d the judge said, slowly and clearly, \u201cyou will record that.\u201d The representative typed. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here.",
