A free market system relies on the incentive of reward earned through enterprise, but it must also contain risk. The theory holds that evolution is at work, as good business thrives by innovation and competition, while the weak fall away. Meanwhile, democratic governments provide social guarantees so that this natural selection does not inflict cruelty on the citizens who depend on the economy for their livelihoods. That is why the ruin of BHS is a story of political failure as well as a product of commercial mismanagement.</p> <p>The collapse of the famous high street chain, leaving 11,000 jobs in jeopardy and a staff pension fund with a \u00c2\u00a3571m deficit, has been widely reported as a case study of corporate greed. There have been calls for Sir Philip Green, who owned the company for 15 years, to be stripped of his knighthood. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/30/cooperative-chairman-bhs-rescue-bid\" title=\"\">Sir Philip, his wife</a> and Dominic Chappell, who heads Retail Acquisitions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the consortium that later bought BHS \u00e2\u20ac\u201c look set to be summoned by parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business and work and pensions committees, as part of twin inquiries into the affairs of what is now a hollowed-out shell of a company in administrators\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hands. If these probes go ahead, they might shed some light on the mechanisms by which the value that there once was in BHS was apparently turned to cash and siphoned off. That is if Sir Philip and others deign to attend the committees. They might, like Mike Ashley \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the founder of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay\" title=\"\">Sports Direct</a>, who now <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/05/01/mike-ashley-ill-save-bhs-and-all-its-staff/\" title=\"\">offers himself as an unlikely saviour of the BHS workforce</a> \u00e2\u20ac\u201c defy a summons to appear. MPs want to speak to Mr Ashley about low pay and alleged worker exploitation. He dismisses them as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a joke\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>That episode testifies to the weakness of political institutions as a check on business. Market fundamentalists used to argue that this is as it ought to be, that politicians should not be allowed to meddle in commerce other than to uphold the law \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and that there should be as few laws as possible. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Not just a light touch but a limited touch\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was <a href=\"https://next.ft.com/content/9073a120-600d-11da-a3a6-0000779e2340\" title=\"\">the mantra</a> at one time. But that doctrine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline really began with the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and all the bailouts, government guarantees and taxpayer buy-ups which became necessary in its wake. It was clear then, when the protagonists were bankers not retailers, that the role of the state in the private sector goes well beyond deciding how much or little to regulate. A systemic, perhaps inescapable, transfer of risk to the public realm was laid bare, and the Pension Protection Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prospective rescue&#xa0;of the BHS fund illustrates this once again. Meanwhile, the rewards for failure head offshore.</p> <p>What is acceptable and what is within the letter of the law are not the same thing. That is not to say that the capitalist ethos is inherently corrupt. There will always be a section of the revolutionary left that sees private enterprise as a quasi-criminal requisitioning of public goods. Most moderate left opinion just wants business to be run with more than a patina of social conscience. Ed Miliband made \u00e2\u20ac\u0153responsible capitalism\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the theme for his leadership of the Labour party. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t translate into an election-winning slogan, and maybe it was never going to. Yet his agenda has been vindicated.</p> <p>It is no longer radical to observe that the short-term sweating of assets for quick profits, over-gearing and underinvestment, avoidance of taxes, poverty wages and job insecurity are symptoms of a disease that limits the shrinks the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic potential. It is, for example, increasingly common for shareholders to complain, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/14/bp-pledge-shareholder-anger-ceo-bob-dudleypay-deal\" title=\"\">happened recently at BP</a>, about remuneration packages for senior executives unconnected to commercial reason \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or reality.</p> <p>Pay is just one example of a market that is not working as the theory says it should, neither maximising efficiency nor promoting best practice. British capitalism is riddled with failures of that kind. The social consequences, public anger among them, are impossible to ignore. That is not a reason to hate business. Market forces are something to be harnessed or resisted depending on what circumstance requires, not an evil to be despised or abolished.</p> <p>The challenge for politicians is striking a balance between what is permitted, what is encouraged, what is denounced and what is outlawed in markets. The case of BHS is just the latest to prove that the balance has not properly been struck. To leave it without redress will lead to more economic failures which, in time, will bring politics itself further into disrepute \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a most dangerous trajectory.</p>",

The collapse of the famous high street chain, leaving 11,000 jobs in jeopardy and a staff pension fund with a \u00c2\u00a3571m deficit, has been widely reported as a case study of corporate greed. There have been calls for Sir Philip Green, who owned the company for 15 years, to be stripped of his knighthood. Sir Philip, his wife and Dominic Chappell, who heads Retail Acquisitions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the consortium that later bought BHS \u00e2\u20ac\u201c look set to be summoned by parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business and work and pensions committees, as part of twin inquiries into the affairs of what is now a hollowed-out shell of a company in administrators\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hands. If these probes go ahead, they might shed some light on the mechanisms by which the value that there once was in BHS was apparently turned to cash and siphoned off. That is if Sir Philip and others deign to attend the committees. They might, like Mike Ashley \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the founder of Sports Direct, who now offers himself as an unlikely saviour of the BHS workforce \u00e2\u20ac\u201c defy a summons to appear. MPs want to speak to Mr Ashley about low pay and alleged worker exploitation. He dismisses them as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a joke\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That episode testifies to the weakness of political institutions as a check on business. Market fundamentalists used to argue that this is as it ought to be, that politicians should not be allowed to meddle in commerce other than to uphold the law \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and that there should be as few laws as possible. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Not just a light touch but a limited touch\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was the mantra at one time. But that doctrine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline really began with the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and all the bailouts, government guarantees and taxpayer buy-ups which became necessary in its wake. It was clear then, when the protagonists were bankers not retailers, that the role of the state in the private sector goes well beyond deciding how much or little to regulate. A systemic, perhaps inescapable, transfer of risk to the public realm was laid bare, and the Pension Protection Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prospective rescue of the BHS fund illustrates this once again. Meanwhile, the rewards for failure head offshore. What is acceptable and what is within the letter of the law are not the same thing. That is not to say that the capitalist ethos is inherently corrupt. There will always be a section of the revolutionary left that sees private enterprise as a quasi-criminal requisitioning of public goods. Most moderate left opinion just wants business to be run with more than a patina of social conscience. Ed Miliband made \u00e2\u20ac\u0153responsible capitalism\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the theme for his leadership of the Labour party. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t translate into an election-winning slogan, and maybe it was never going to. Yet his agenda has been vindicated. It is no longer radical to observe that the short-term sweating of assets for quick profits, over-gearing and underinvestment, avoidance of taxes, poverty wages and job insecurity are symptoms of a disease that limits the shrinks the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic potential. It is, for example, increasingly common for shareholders to complain, as happened recently at BP, about remuneration packages for senior executives unconnected to commercial reason \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or reality. Pay is just one example of a market that is not working as the theory says it should, neither maximising efficiency nor promoting best practice. British capitalism is riddled with failures of that kind. The social consequences, public anger among them, are impossible to ignore. That is not a reason to hate business. Market forces are something to be harnessed or resisted depending on what circumstance requires, not an evil to be despised or abolished. The challenge for politicians is striking a balance between what is permitted, what is encouraged, what is denounced and what is outlawed in markets. The case of BHS is just the latest to prove that the balance has not properly been struck. To leave it without redress will lead to more economic failures which, in time, will bring politics itself further into disrepute \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a most dangerous trajectory.",

The supreme court has ruled that contributing to the programs is mandatory, and that the programs themselves constitute government speech. That decision was controversial \u00e2\u20ac\u201c small producers have long argued that checkoffs exclusively serve the interests of the their largest competitors, and environmental and animal rights activists say checkoffs often obscure the cruelties of industrial farming.</p> <p>Last year <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/06/usda-american-egg-board-paid-bloggers-hampton-creek\">the Guardian learned through a Freedom of Information Act request</a> by attorney Jeffrey Light and Foia expert Ryan Shapiro that the USDA-backed American Egg Board (the egg industry checkoff) had advised Unilever on an ongoing lawsuit against Hampton Creek, a company that produces plant-based mayonnaise, and had agreed to attempt to use its influence to have Hampton Creek\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Just Mayo removed from Whole Foods.<br></p> <p>Shapiro said the attempt to cast a shroud over shady dealings among checkoff groups came far too late. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now that some of their blatantly improper dealings have been exposed via Foia, instead of cleaning up their acts, these boards are attempting to exempt themselves from Foia altogether,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shapiro told the Guardian. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But as the already released documents demonstrate, these boards are sorely in need of greater transparency and must not be allowed to shroud their already opaque dealings with even more secrecy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>The Foia expert also observed that no less a pro-business titan than the late Antonin Scalia would have disagreed with the producers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 assessment of their own accountability.

                "bodyText":"Some of the largest food producers in the US have successfully petitioned Congress to propose a change to the Freedom of Information Act that would shield their communications with boards overseen by the US Department of Agriculture from the scrutiny of the public, the Guardian has learned. The move follows a series of stories that showed the government-backed egg promoter, the American Egg Board, had attempted to stifle competition from Silicon Valley food startup Hampton Creek, in direct conflict with its mandate. Several agricultural lobbyists including United Egg Producers, the National Cattlemen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Beef Association and the National Pork Producers Council have now sent a letter to the congressional subcommittee overseeing appropriations for the Department of Agriculture (USDA) asking to be exempted from Foia requests to their own respective promotional boards. The letter to the subcommittee reads, in part: We support inclusion of language in the Committee report urging the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to recognize that the research and promotion programs are funded solely with producer dollars, and therefore are not agencies of the Federal government or subject to the Freedom of Information Act (Foia). The language added to the bill reads thusly: The Committee notes that the commodity Research and Promotion boards that the agency oversees are not agencies of the federal government, nor are Research and Promotion programs funded with federal funds. The funding used to operate and carry out the activities of the various Research and Promotion programs is provided by producers and industry stakeholders, and employees of the boards are not federal employees. Therefore, the Committee urges USDA to recognize that such boards are not subject to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. Section 552. The bill has not yet been passed. The government-backed food marketing groups are called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153checkoff\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdprograms, dedicated to promoting individual commodities and backed by a levy on farmers. Their most recognizable presence is in the form of marketing slogans such as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The incredible, edible egg\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Beef. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for dinner\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The administrators of checkoff programs are appointed by the USDA and the programs themselves are funded by a levy on goods sold. The supreme court has ruled that contributing to the programs is mandatory, and that the programs themselves constitute government speech. That decision was controversial \u00e2\u20ac\u201c small producers have long argued that checkoffs exclusively serve the interests of the their largest competitors, and environmental and animal rights activists say checkoffs often obscure the cruelties of industrial farming. Last year the Guardian learned through a Freedom of Information Act request by attorney Jeffrey Light and Foia expert Ryan Shapiro that the USDA-backed American Egg Board (the egg industry checkoff) had advised Unilever on an ongoing lawsuit against Hampton Creek, a company that produces plant-based mayonnaise, and had agreed to attempt to use its influence to have Hampton Creek\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Just Mayo removed from Whole Foods. Shapiro said the attempt to cast a shroud over shady dealings among checkoff groups came far too late. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now that some of their blatantly improper dealings have been exposed via Foia, instead of cleaning up their acts, these boards are attempting to exempt themselves from Foia altogether,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shapiro told the Guardian. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But as the already released documents demonstrate, these boards are sorely in need of greater transparency and must not be allowed to shroud their already opaque dealings with even more secrecy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Foia expert also observed that no less a pro-business titan than the late Antonin Scalia would have disagreed with the producers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 assessment of their own accountability. In a ruling slapping down a challenge to the checkoff programs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 authority by a group of small farmers, Scalia wrote of the beef checkoff: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The program is authorized and the basic message prescribed by federal statute, and specific requirements for the promotions\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 content are imposed by federal regulations promulgated after notice and comment. The Secretary of Agriculture, a politically accountable official, oversees the program, appoints and dismisses the key personnel, and retains absolute veto power over the advertisements\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 content, right down to the wording.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The proposed rule comes at an awkward time for its supporters: the US federal government is in the midst of a review across its entire breadth after a call for greater Foia responsiveness and accessibility. As recently as last week, a letter to US comptroller general Gene L Dodaro, signed by the leadership of both the house and senate judiciary committees, asked the Government Accountability Office to audit agencies for compliance. Josh Tetrick, CEO of Hampton Creek, said the proposed Foia exemption was an example of how far the food industry remains removed from everyday Americans. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just wake up one morning with a food system that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reflect our values,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tetrick said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It happens over decades.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Indeed, displeasure with the move appears to cross party lines. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is crony capitalism organized by Washington at its worst,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Republican senator Mike Lee in an emailed statement. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Not only is the federal government forcing market participants to collude, it is then actively engaging in a cover up of that collusion.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This article has been updated to clarify the nature of checkoff programs",

                "bodyText":"A combination of downbeat factors - the raft of disappointing data from around the world, the EU cutting its growth forecasts, falling commodity prices thanks to weak Chinese numbers, a cut in Australian interest rates to boost flagging growth and a volatile day for the dollar - all combined to revive worries about the state of the global economy and sent stock markets sharply lower. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 56.30 points or 0.9% to 6185.59 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.94% to 9926.77 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 1.59% at 4371.98 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 2.46% to 17,966.81 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 2.85% lower at 8764.9 In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.15% to 583.65 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 150 points or 0.8%. Elsewhere Brent crude is down 1.9% at $44.96 a barrel. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Commenting on the JP Morgan global survey, Capital Economics said: Manufacturing activity seems to have remained weak across the board at the start of the second quarter. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global manufacturing PMI, released today, slipped from 50.6 in March to 50.1 in April, extending a downward trend which began in 2013. On past form, it is now consistent with global growth of only around 2%. A number of factors have led to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market sell-off, including weak economic data and a volatile dollar. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: Woeful economic news and weak bank earnings put stock market bears in charge on Tuesday. Weak manufacturing data from China and the UK, downgraded forecasts for UK and Eurozone growth as well as the Reserve Bank of Australia cutting interest rates to ward off deflation all point to a weaker economic outlook. US stocks slumped on the open with the Dow Jones losing over 200 points after weak auto sales number added to a weak economic outlook in China, the UK and Europe. The day started with new multi-month lows for the dollar index and corresponding highs in the euro, British pound and the yen. But dollar losses were reversed after the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dennis Lockhart suggesting June was a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclive meeting\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 triggered short-covering at oversold levels. Global manufacturing growth slipped in April, according to the latest JPMorgan and Markit survey. The global manufacturing purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index came in at 50.1 in April, down from 50.6 in March and only just above the 50 level which separates growth from contraction. The reading is the second weakest in the past forty months. David Hensley, director of global economic coordination at J.P.Morgan, said: The latest PMI data indicate global manufacturing output is growing at an anemic pace, similar to the past year. What is notable is the sharp drop in the PMI finished goods inventory index. Once manufacturers have aligned inventories with sales, faster production gains should ensue. Markets continue to come under pressure. with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now down 178 points or just over 1%. Here are the biggest movers in the index: The latest New York manufacturing survey showed business activity growing at its fastest pace since December last year. But there was a drop in the six-month outlook in April to a seven year low. The Institute for Supply Management index rose from 50.4 in March to 57 but the six month outlook fell to 53.1. The ISM said the drop in outlook \u00e2\u20ac\u0153should raise a caution flag.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As expected, and in line with other global markets, Wall Street is on the slide. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 134 points or 0.75% in early trading, as fears about the global economy re-emerge. Poor manufacturing data from the US on Monday, and China and the UK today, have unsettled investors, along with the news that Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank cut interest rates to help support growth. The S&amp;P opened 0.4% lower while Nasdaq is down 0.7%. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 is currently 0.65% lower, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has dropped 1.68% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has fallen 1.2%. The US could raise interest rates twice this year, following December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increase, but there were a number of uncertainties including whether Britain votes to leave the European Union. That is the view of Atlanta Federal Reserve president Dennis Lockhart. Speaking to reporters in Florida he said two hikes were possible, but it depended on how the economy evolved. He said (quote from Reuters): It is the repercussions [of a Brexit vote] for the US economy that would concern me....it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really a question of indications in the financial markets of a reaction to rising uncertainty and the degree of volatility we are seeing again in financial markets. But he added that the markets should put more probability on June being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a real option\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for a rise. Indeed the dollar is currently weaker after Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing US manufacturing data suggested no imminent rate rise. Never let it be said that government ministers can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t learn from their mistakes. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business secretary, Sajid Javid, has postponed a trade delegation to Iran so he can focus on the UK steel crisis. The trip had been billed as Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest ever trade mission to Iran, giving UK companies a chance to cash in develop business opportunities following the lifting of sanctions. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been put on ice, until the future of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steel industry is resolved. A spokesman told Reuters: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Given the Business Secretary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focus on the steel industry,he has decided to postpone his trip to Iran. He remains committed to exploring the opportunities for trade and investment with this emerging market and an alternative date will be arranged in due course.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tata UK wants potential buyers to register their interest in its steel operations this week, so Javid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision may indicate that progress is being made. One company, Liberty House, has already thrown its hard hat into the ring: Alternatively, Javid may be desperate to avoid a repeat of his infamous Australia trip - which left him on the far side of the world when Tata announced it was selling up. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an old City motto, to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sell in May and go away\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The theory is to cash in your gains once the May Day morris dancers have done their thing. Then, sit tight until the horses competing at the St Leger Stakes in early September have been rubbed down and fed a few sugar lumps It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always pay off - although it worked rather well last year, when the FTSE 100 hit a record high in April, only to shed 12% by the end of August. So perhaps that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one reason that investors are reacting badly to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing economic data. The selloff in European markets has gathered pace, with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX now down around 1.7%. And the FTSE is still at a three-week low, currently down 75 points. Mining stocks are suffering from concerns over the global economy, with Anglo American shedding 10%. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says the decline in the US dollar is hitting European shares, as eurozone companies benefit from a weaker euro, not a stronger one. The foreign exchange markets are taking centre stage today, as incessant US dollar selling has brought about an 18-month low in the US dollar-Japanese yen rate, an eight month high in the euro-US dollar rate, and a four-month high for the pound against the US dollar. With IG clients currently seeing a 71% chance of the UK remaining in the EU, it is clear traders are heavily betting that the late February low of $1.3836 represents the bottom for GBP/USD. Banking shares are also suffering, after Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Commerzbank reported that its net profits had halved in the last quarter. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, has warned that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grim UK factory data could herald more bad new... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Manufacturing output in April recorded a shocking reading dropping to the lowest point since the throes of the euro-zone crisis in March 2013. The tailwinds afflicting the manufacturing sector \u00e2\u20ac\u201c concerns around the health of the global economy, uncertainty surrounding the result of June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum and evidence of a broad slowdown in activity in the UK \u00e2\u20ac\u201c means that the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmakers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 will struggle to avoid a repeat in Q2 of the decline in output seen in the first three months of the year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The detail of the survey offered further causes for pessimism. Both the consumer and investment goods sectors registered declines in output, while survey respondents highlighted a weakening in both domestic and overseas demand. In addition, export orders dropped for the fourth month in a row, while jobs in the sector fell at the fastest rates since February 2013.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on the downturn in UK manufacturing: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is expected to fall when it opens in three hours time, following today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing news from China and the UK. The EC has also predicted another year of recession in Greece, with its GDP shrinking by 0.3%. We all want Greece to find growth again, and create jobs particularly for its young people, says commissioner Mosocovici. In contrast, Ireland is expected to post the strongest growth this year: European commissioner Pierre Moscovici has challenged Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s politicians to do more to stimulate growth: He says: Growth in Europe is holding up despite a more difficult global environment. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The recovery in the euro area remains uneven, both between Member States and between the weakest and the strongest in society. That is unacceptable and requires determined action from governments, both individually and collectively. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts assume that the British public vote to remain in the EU, the Commisison says: In another blow, the European Commission has just cut its forecast for UK growth this year. The EC now expects Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy to expand by just 1.8% this year, down from a previous forecast of 2.1%, inching up to 1.9% in 2017. It blames the uncertainty created by June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum -- echoing the slump in UK factory output. The commission says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside, reflecting less favourable external demand and uncertainty in the lead-up to the June referendum. Net exports are forecast to continue to detract from growth although less markedly in 2017.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But Britain isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t alone. The EC has also cut its forecast for eurozone growth, despite the bloc posting better-than-expected GDP figures last Friday. It now expects eurozone growth of 1.6% this year (down from 1.7%) and 1.8% in 2017 (down from 1.9%). And it has also admitted that its previous inflation forecasts were too optimistic - predicting that prices will only rise by 0.2% this year. Ms Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 organisation, agrees that the Brexit referendum is partly to blame for the slump in UK manufacturing: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The sharp drop to a three year low and another month of reported job cuts could be the clearest sign yet that referendum uncertainty is starting to weigh on the real economy. However, this is just another straw on the back of a sector already grappling with the struggling oil and gas sector, softening domestic demand and weak order outlook from other parts of the world, all of which are failing to provide any counterbalance to the political uncertainty at home. These chart shows how UK factories have weakened in the last few months: The shock slump in UK factory activity last month is a serious sign, warns David Noble of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply. Noble says an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153atmosphere of deep unease\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is building throughout the manufacturing supply chain, as new orders and exports come under pressure. He also cites the recent collapse of high street chain BHS as proof that economic conditions are worsening. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A sense of apprehension across the sector is being caused by enduring volatility in the oil and gas industry, falling retailer confidence and the uncertainty created by the EU referendum. In a month that saw the collapse of BHS, the troubles in the British High Street are being felt just as keenly in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories. Manufacturers are compensating for stalling new order growth by depleting their stocks, and dramatically cutting the amount of raw materials they buy from suppliers. Noble is also concerned that large factories cut jobs last month: The sector is nervously waiting to see whether this is a temporary blip or the beginning of a more pervasive slow down. UK factories slashed jobs last month at the fastest rate since February 2013, led by major manufacturers. Markit explains: The downturn at manufacturers was reflected in the labour market at the start of the second quarter. Job cuts were reported for the fourth successive month, with the rate of decline the fastest since February 2013. Losses were mainly centred on large-sized companies, as SMEs recorded (on average) a further increase in workforce numbers. Breaking! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector has suffered its worst performance in three years. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK manufacturing PMI, which measures activity across the sector, has slumped to 49.2 in April, down from 50.7 in March It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the first time since March 2013 that the PMI has fallen below the 50-point mark, which separates expansion from contraction. British companies are suffering a double-whammy, with domestic demand softening and new orders from overseas falling too. Markit reports that new export orders fell for the fourth straight month in April, as global economic growth continued to slow. Rob Dobson, economist at Markit, says that June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum is partly to blame too: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Manufacturers are emphasising slower domestic demand growth and declining new export orders as the key weaknesses they are facing, amid rising uncertainty about the global economy, the oil &amp; gas industry, retail sector and the EU referendum. With this backdrop unlikely to change in the coming months, the second quarter is likely to remain a bleak landscape for industry.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More details and reaction to follow.... The British pound is on a tear this morning, hitting its highest level against the US dollar since last December. Sterling has gained almost one cent to $1.4758, a level last seen in mid-December before Brexit fears began to bite. It appears that the pound has been recovering because City traders expect Britain to vote to remain in the EU on June 23, even though recent polls have suggested a tight fight. But the pound isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t alone -- the dollar is weakening against all the major currencies this morning (apart from the Australia dollar, of course). The London stock market has now hit its lowest level since early April, as traders begin May with a bout of selling. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets have all fallen in the first hour of trading. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is down 35 points at 6208, dragged down by those falling mining stocks. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX has shed 1.5%, and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC is down 0.8%. Shares are being hit because the euro has strengthened against the US dollar this morning. Mining stocks are sliding this morning, pulling London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market into the red. The miners are suffering from falling commodity prices, after today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak Chinese factory data. Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct says: Once again commodity stocks are taking a toll with Anglo American leading the pack lower, with a slide in oil prices during yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session instrumental here. The Japanese yen has just hit an 18-month high against the US dollar, in another blow to the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exporters. Investors are piling into the yen after the Japanese central bank disappointed investors last week by not boosting its stimulus programme. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to worry policymakers in Toyko, who are gunning for a weaker currency to help get inflation moving. Over in the City, HSBC shares have jumped 3% in early trading as investors show relief that profits have \u00e2\u20ac\u02dconly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 fallen by 14%. Just Eat, the online takeaway ordering company, have soared by almost 7% after it reported a 41% surge in sales and hiked its profit forecasts. But Aberdeen Asset Management is still struggling from the slowdown in emerging markets. It reported a 40% slump in underlying pre-tax profits this morning, sending its shares down 6% in early trading. Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate cut will fuel fears of another round of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccurrency wars\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as nations fight for the competitive edge of a weaker currency, says Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets. Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has hit a six-month high following today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate cut. The S&amp;P/ASX jumped 2%, as investors welcomed the promise of cheaper money (even though it was driven by deflation fears). The Australian dollar suffered a predictable selloff, slumping by 1.5% against the US dollar to $0.756. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no let-up in the pain gripping China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories. The latest healthcheck of the sector shows that activity fell again last month. Total new orders stagnated and new export orders shrinking for the fifth month in a row. Data firm Caixin also reports that Chinese firms cut jobs, in the face of weakening demand for their products. Overall employment declined again, with the rate of job shedding nearly as sharp as in February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, when it hit a post-global financial crisis record. This drove Caixin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chinese manufacturing PMI down to 49.4, from 49.7, on an index where anything below 50 shows a contraction. Dr. He Fan, chief economist at Caixin Insight Group, fears that the Chinese economy could be heading into dangerous waters: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All of the index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s categories indicated conditions worsened month-on-month, with output slipping back below the 50-point neutral level. The fluctuations indicate the economy lacks a solid foundation for recovery and is still in the process of bottoming out. The government needs to keep a close watch on the risk of a further economic downturn.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Australia has fired another shot in the currency battles by unexpectedly cutting interest rates to fresh record lows. The Reserve Bank of Australia blamed lower inflation, a stronger Aussie dollar and signs of weakness in its jobs market, as it slashed borrowing costs to just 1.75%, down from 2%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the latest sign that economic conditions remain weak, forcing central bankers to ease policy in an attempt to spur demand and ward off another financial crisis. The move also sparked a political row, as my colleague Paul Karp explains: Shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said the interest rate decision reflected the Liberal government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s incredibly poor economic management. He said in August 2013 when interest rates were cut to 2.5% the Coalition seized on it as a sign of economic weakness. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This decision reflects a weaker economic outlook, with the RBA expecting growth to moderate this year,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In addition, incomes are falling, living standards are stagnating and home ownership is out of reach for so many Australians \u00e2\u20ac\u201c facts the government will be hiding from tonight.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In question time, Malcolm Turnbull responded to claims the rate cut demonstrated a softening economy by promising the budget would help manage a transition away from an economy reliant on the mining sector, and deliver jobs and growth. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Traders in London are struggling back to their desks after the long weekend, and wondering whether the advice to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sell in May and go away\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd holds firm this year. So they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be watching the latest UK manufacturing data, due at 9.30am, for signs that the British economy is slowing down in the run-up to June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum. Yesterday, Germany and Italy reported a pick-up in factory growth, but France bucked the trend with another contraction. HSBC, the global bank, has already given investors something to ponder. It has just reported a 14% slide in profits following the stock market turmoil at the start of 2016. Our City editor Jill Treanor has studied the numbers, and explains: Profits at HSBC fell in the first three months of the year after Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest bank was knocked by the volatility that gripped global markets in January and February. Statutory pre-tax profits in the three-months to the end of March fell 14% to $6.1bn, which the bank described as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a resilient performance despite challenging market conditions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. If currency movements and other one-off items were excluded profits fell 18% to $5.4bn. Stuart Gulliver, the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Market uncertainty led to extreme levels of volatility in January and February, which affected our ability to generate revenue in our markets and wealth management businesses. However, our diversified, universal-banking business model helped to cushion the impact through growth in other parts of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Time is running out for potential bidders to express interest in Tata Steel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK operations, including its famous blast furnace at Port Talbot in Wales. One firm, Liberty House, has already revealed it will bid.... At 10am UK time the European Commission releases its latest economic forecasts. Pierre Moscovici will be giving a press conference in Brussels. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also getting results from investment group Aberdeen Asset Management, and takeaway firm Just Eat.",

                "bodyText":"Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co, one of the largest gun manufacturers in the US, reported sales of $173.1m for the first quarter of 2016, up 26% from last year and some of the highest earnings in the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 67-year history. At a shareholding meeting, executives said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we are good citizens\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and predicted that demand for guns could continue to grow thanks to the increasingly heated political rhetoric of the 2016 election, and a long-term trend of Americans wanting guns for self-defense. At $1.21 a share, earnings per share increased 49% from the first quarter of 2015. Sturm Ruger\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first-quarter results included the second-highest revenue and third-highest earnings since it was founded in 1949. Sturm Ruger reported that firearm orders by gun shops increased in the past year, and listed sales to 18 federally licensed firearm wholesalers. In the first quarter, the unit sell-through of Sturm Ruger\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s products by its distributors to retailers increased 17% compared to 2015, and distributors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 inventories decreased by 54,300 units overall. More than 99% of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s net sales came from firearms. Just $1.5m came from sales of casting. During its annual meeting with shareholders, Sturm Ruger\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO, Michael Fifer, described the company as an American manufacturer and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good citizen\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We make products in American factories. We pour metal. We cut wood. We assemble guns,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said, noting that the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s three gun factories in New Hampshire, Arizona and North Carolina employ more than 2,000 people. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are basically an industrial manufacturer of great consumer products. We take pride in being an American manufacturer.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We pay our taxes and we keep our cash in the United States. There are no tax inversions or offshoring for us. We are good citizens,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he continued. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We understand that manufacturing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the conversion of raw materials into something useful \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is a core foundation of any successful economy, including ours.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd His comments coincide with increased pressure on the gun industry by the Democratic frontrunner for president, Hillary Clinton. Clinton has promised that if elected president she would attempt to close the loopholes that make gun manufacturers and gun sellers exempt from certain lawsuits related to gun deaths. A decade of growth Despite an increased demand for gun control, gun sales and gun production in the US have surged over the past decade. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our industry appears to have been growing overall during the past 10 years as the number of new shooters has steadily increased, as the demographics of new shooters have broadened and many states have embraced more favorable gun-rights laws,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fifer said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Particularly, concealed-carry laws.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In the presentation to shareholders, Sturm Ruger officials noted that the average age of gun-owning Americans has decreased in recent years. While the average gun owner may be getting younger, many are no longer coming from gun-owning families and so are discovering guns on their own at a later age than before. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We see a lot more women shooters. We see more folks from urban and suburban areas, and we see fewer folks who hunted prior to their first purchase,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd explained Chris Killoy, president of Sturm Ruger. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A lot of folks are getting started older. They weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily started in a shooting family or a hunting family. They got started a little later.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Although the demand for guns has increased, the number of US households with guns has declined. In 2010 and 2014, about 31% of US households reported having a firearm, the lowest level of gun ownership in about 40 years. Yet from 2010 to 2013, the number of guns manufactured in the US has almost doubled going from 5.5m to 10.9m, according to the Department of Justice. As Fifer pointed out, fear about gun rights can drive up demand, as gun owners stock up on firearms. According to the Washington Post, in 2013 there were on average eight guns in a gun-owning household; that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from four in 1994. Sales boost due to political rhetoric Fifer added that the American gun industry has experienced dramatic rises and falls, volatility that he attributed to political rhetoric and the press. Periods of demand are often followed by periods when buyers \u00e2\u20ac\u0153retreated as threats to gun rights failed to materialize\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Back in February, Fifer predicted that the demand for guns would go up if Democrats won the Senate and if a Democrat were elected the next president. The most recent spike in demand was attributed to an increased desire for self-defense. Fifer explained that terrorist attacks are a boon to the industry, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u01532015 was a recovery year in the cycle, until very late in the year when we observed very significant demand. The spike in demand was strongly correlated to the tragic terrorist activities in Paris and San Bernardino.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Demand for firearms for self-defense and concealed carry increased dramatically,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he added, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153and that demand continued to the first quarter of 2016.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Last year saw a record 23m background checks for gun purchases. Additionally, background checks for the first three months of 2016 have gone up 36% compared to last year. More than 7.6m background checks for gun purchases have been performed in January, February and March.

This is because the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s number tends to be considerably more volatile, and of course it is this volatility that traders look for and react to. So the fact that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s release was so far away from trend will have traders scratching their heads.

                "bodyText":"Continuing concerns about the state of the global economy after a series of disappointing data from around the world continued to send shares lower. Poor UK construction figures and lower than forecast US private sector job numbers from ADP were the latest repots to unsettle investors. Meanwhile oil slipped back from its early highs after a higher than expected increase in US crude stocks, while metal prices suffered on worries about China after its recent weak manufacturing figures. So commodity companies were among the biggest fallers. And there was always Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approaching victory in the Republican nominations to provide another reason for investors to tread carefully. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 73.57 or 1.19% to a four week low of 6112.02 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 0.99% to 9828.25 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 1.09% lower at 4324.23 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB dipped 0.17% to 17,935.67 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 1.26% at 8654.3 In Greece, the Athens market bucked the trend, adding 1.1% to 590.05 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 111 points or 0.6%, while Brent crude is down 0.49% at $44.75 a barrel. On that note, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. In its statement, the ECB said: It has decided to permanently stop producing the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac500 banknote and to exclude it from the Europa series, taking into account concerns that this banknote could facilitate illicit activities. The issuance of the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac500 will be stopped around the end of 2018, when the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac100 and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac200 banknotes of the Europa series are planned to be introduced. As expected, the European Central Bank has said it will no longer produce or issue \u00e2\u201a\u00ac500 notes. It added that existing notes will still remain legal tender and retain their value. UK prime minister David Cameron is giving evidence to a Commons committee on the EU referendum, and my colleague Andrew Sparrow is covering the meeting, beginning here. The mixed picture from the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US economic figures does not mean a June rate rise is completely off the table. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s abundance of US data has made for a difficult trading environment, with contrasting data points providing mixed expectations for monetary policy implications. The overwhelmingly positive release of services and composite PMI readings helped paint an encouraging picture for US business, with improved factory orders and trade balance helping raise rate hike expectations for the June meeting. However, the picture has been muddled by a shockingly poor April ADP non-farm payrolls number, which at 156,000 fell to the lowest level in over two years. The ADP reading is the only figure of the day that has a second bite at the cherry and if Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headline figure confounds today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ADP weakness, we are likely to see a significant rise in June rate hike expectations. The resurgence of the US dollar this week has sent shockwaves throughout the foreign exchange markets, as traders begin to realise that perhaps a 15-month low in the dollar index makes little sense just six weeks away from an increasingly \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 [Federal Reserve] meeting. While markets are currently pricing in just a 12% chance of a June hike, the reality is likely to be higher, given the hawkish tone of recent Fed member comments. US crude stocks rose by more than expected last week, according to the latest figures from the Energy Information Administration. Inventories climbed by 2.8m barrels compared to forecasts of a 750,000 increase. Crude prices have come off their best levels following the figures, but even so, Brent is still up 0.8% at $45.33 a barrel. Earlier in the day it had climbed as high as $46.01. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda for Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurogroup meeting, including talks on the Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt: The Eurogroup will hold an extraordinary meeting to discuss the state of play of the macroeconomic adjustment programme for Greece. Discussions will cover a comprehensive package of policy reforms as well as the sustainability of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public debt. Both elements need to be in place in order to finalise the programme\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first review and unlock further financial assistance to Greece. Over in Greece, and efforts are continuing to reach a deal between the country and its creditors ahead of a proposed Eurogroup meeting next week. Greek newspaper Kathimerini reports: Deputy eurozone finance ministers, known as the Euro Working Group (EWG), will hold a conference call on Wednesday aimed at bridging differences between the government in Athens and foreign creditors ahead of a crucial eurogroup meeting on Monday, May 9. The teleconference is expected to focus on an additional 3.6 billion euros\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 worth of contingency measures that Greece is being asked to implement should it miss budget targets in 2018. The extra measures have been demanded by the International Monetary Fund, which deems that the 5.4 billion euros\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 worth of measures set out in Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third international bailout are inadequate for it to achieve a budget surplus worth 3.5 percent of gross domestic product in 2018. Greek officials have instead proposed the activation of an automatic mechanism for cutting state spending in the event that the government misses budget targets. IMF officials are also expected to take part in Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s teleconference. Greece will be represented by Alternate Finance Minister Giorgos Houliarakis. And here are some of the comments made by the survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s respondents: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Severe non-skilled labor shortage is hurting the construction industry.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Construction) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Business is holding steady, revenue is almost as anticipated and costs are lower which is helping to maintain current profitability.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Finance &amp; Insurance) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We expect our business condition to improve in Q2 as compared to Q1.

Trucking has tightened due to produce hauling season.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Wholesale Trade) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Heading into a slower season, but cautious optimism of modest gains from same period last year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Retail Trade) Here are the details of the ISM survey: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is confirmation of a stronger US services sector. The ISM non-manufacturing purchasing managers index has climbed from 54.5 in March to 55.7 last month, better than the forecast level of 54.7. This is the highest level since December. The new orders index rose to 59.9 in April, up from 56.7 the previous month. But business activity slowed, with the index dipping from 59.8 in March to 58.8. The first set of US services data is out and is slightly better than expected. The Markit services final PMI has come in at 52.8 for April, up from the initial reading of 52.1 and March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s level of 51.3. The final composite reading - both services and manufacturing - was 52.4, up from an initial 51.7 and 51.3 in March. Still to come are the figures from ISM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services survey. Not surprisingly US markets are once more following their global counterparts lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 106 points or 0.6%, following the weaker than expected ADP jobs data. The disappointing figures added to the general unease about a whole spate of releases pointing to a slowdown in the global economy. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq both opened around 0.5% lower. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 has fallen 0.99% - albeit off its worst levels - while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is down 0.74% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac is off 0.77%. More from the US. The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit fell by more than expected in March, down 13.9% to $40.4bn, as imports fell to their lowest level since 2010. Meanwhile US productivity dropped at a 1% annual rate in the first quarter, the second quarterly decline. Labour costs rose by 4.1%, the quickest pace since the fourth quarter of 2014. Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Analytics which helps compile the ADP jobs data, said: The job market appears to have stumbled in April. Job growth noticeably slowed, with some weakness across most sectors. One month does not make a trend, but this bears close watching as the financial market turmoil earlier in the year may have done some damage to business hiring. The poor ADP jobs data adds to the feeling the US Federal Reserve may not be in a rush to raise interest rates but the report is worrying for the US economy, says David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco. He said: The US dollar fell sharply in the immediate aftermath of the release as poor jobs data reduces the likelihood of a rate hike next month from the US Fed. Investors see the ADP data as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153heads-up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ahead of the official Non-Farm Payroll report which is due out this Friday. It certainly is effective in measuring the overall trend in the data, but it can be patchy on a month-by-month basis. This is because the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s number tends to be considerably more volatile, and of course it is this volatility that traders look for and react to. So the fact that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s release was so far away from trend will have traders scratching their heads. It may be positive for risk assets for the Fed to hold off from hiking rates, but it sends a grim message about the US economy. Ahead of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US non-farm payroll numbers, the monthly survey of private sector jobs from ADP came in much lower than expected. ADP said US employment increased by 156,000 private sector jobs in April, compared to 194,000 last month and expectations of a rise of between 195,000 and 200,000 this time round. Last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure was revised down from the initial estimate of 200,000. London Stock Exchange shares have dropped more than 7% after Intercontinental Exchange ruled out a bid, leaving the way clear for LSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed merger with Deutsche B\u00c3\u00b6rse. New York stock exchange owner ICE said in March it was considering an offer for the LSE, but now says: Following due diligence on the information made available, ICE determined there was insufficient engagement to confirm the potential market and shareholder benefits of a strategic combination. So it has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no current intention\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to make a bid which rules it out for six months unless it receives the consent of the Takeover Panel. Greek manufacturing edged higher in April, but still showed a contraction for the third month in a row. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing purchasing managers index came in at 49.7, up from 49 in March but still below the 50 level which signals expansion. Markit said: The downturn in the manufacturing sector of Greece continued during April. Incoming new orders fell for a further month while outstanding business levels deteriorated. However, job creation was still evident in the sector and volumes of production stabilised after three months of contraction. But there were some encouraging signs, according to Markit economist Samuel Agass who said: April survey data was mixed for Greek goods producers. On the one hand, the headline PMI remains below the crucial 50.0 no-change mark, thus signalling a further downturn in the manufacturing sector of Greece. Incoming new orders are still on the decline and outstanding business levels again deteriorated at a substantial pace, with a downturn in the construction sector hampering economic growth according to panellists. However, production stabilised for the first time during 2016 and job creation was still evident, highlighting firms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 intentions to invigorate future output with increased manpower. Likewise, purchasing activity rose for the first time since August 2014, highlighting that there are some encouraging signs pointing to a revival in the manufacturing sector of Greece over the coming few months. China has been forced to dip into its emergency pork reserves after seeing prices hit record highs. With breeding sows in short supply, and domestic demand swelling, Beijing has decided to release 3.05 million kilograms of frozen pork reserves over the next month. The FT explains how pork prices have been sizzling recently: Policymakers have good reason to want to keep pork prices under control: China produces and consumes more pork than any other country on Earth, and the meat factors heavily into the CPI basket used to calculate overall consumer inflation. In March the official consumer price index rose 2.3 per cent year on year, with a rise of 28.4 per cent by pork prices during the period contributing 0.64 percentage points. The pork crisis could also be a consequence of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial revolution. There are now more wealthier middle-class consumers bringing home the bacon, and keen to eat expensive food, but fewer agricultural workers tending the piglets. European stock markets have suffered another morning of hefty losses, as economic worries ripple through trading floors again. The FTSE 100 has hit a new three-week low, down 76 points or 1.2% at 6109 points, while France and Germany are both down around 0.75% The slowdown in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction sector, following a shock contraction in manufacturing yesterday, hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helped the mood in the City. Disappointing Chinese and US factory data released this week has also dampened optimism. There may also be a Trump effect. Wall Street is being called down, after the Donald all-but wrapped up the Republican nomination overnight. Mihir Kapadia, CEO at Sun Global Investments, reckons investors are pretty uneasey today. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122A decline in US stocks last night has been followed by another weak day in Asian Indices today, as commodities and bonds are also selling off. Investors appear to remain generally uneasy about the state of the global economy, with the latest agitation coming from the Reserve Bank of Australia deciding on Tuesday to cut its benchmark rate to 1.75%, reflecting soft inflation and, like many others, general economic malaise. A contributing factor to Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic woes has been a drop in demand from a weary China, which has its own problems as its economy looks to be losing steam on the back of some weak manufacturing data. Another country with weak manufacturing data is the UK \u00e2\u20ac\u201c reports suggesting manufacturing activity contracted in April for the first time since March 2013. The slowdown in the oil industry is certainly hitting production, with firms also blaming soft domestic demand combined with a fall in foreign business. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on the construction slowdown: Last Friday, we got terribly excited by the news that the eurozone had grown by 0.6% in the first quarter of 2016, outpacing Britain and America. But perhaps this was premature... New data today shows that retail sales fell by 0.5% in March, which could suggest growth was less buoyant than hoped. Carsten Brzeski of ING fears the data could be revised down in a few weeks (when eurostat will have more data to play with) The BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kamal Ahmed and Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics are both concerned by the slowdown in UK construction growth. This drop in construction growth comes as Barclays unleashes a no-deposit mortgage on the market. Technically, a parent does need to provide a 10% deposit, but that will be returned - with interest - if their little darling manages to keep up the monthly payments. So for the first time since the collapse of Northern Rock, a major high-street lender is effectively offering to lend the full value of a property. This could be a worrying moment... However, before the credit crunch of 2007, some riskier UK banks would actually lend you 125% of a property\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not quite at panic levels yet... David Noble of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply also blames Brexit fears for the slump in construction sector growth. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fears over weaker UK and global economic growth dealt a blow to confidence in the construction sector, leading to delays in new spending commitments. The prospect of the EU referendum and its outcome in June are likely to add to uncertainty too, with many construction firms preferring to wait and see what happens before making any decisions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Construction companies adopted a more cautious approach to purchasing and hiring, leading to a rise in sub-contractor usage to tide them over until the outlook becomes clearer. The slowdown in new order growth in April suggests that though spring may be in the air, sunnier times may still be a way off for the construction sector, at least for the time being.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Breaking: Growth across Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction sector has slowed to a near three-year low. Fears over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum, and weakness in housebuilding are to blame -- as concerns about the strength of the UK recovery grow. Data firm Markit reports that its construction PMI, which measures activity across hundreds of building firms, has fallen from 54.2 in March to 52.0 in April. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the slowest since June 2013. Companies reported that new orders had stagnated, as the clients suspended spending. With \u00e2\u20ac\u0153heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, some customers aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t prepared to commit to new projects. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU vote, on June 23rd, is a key Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, warns that the UK construction sector appears to be struggling: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153UK construction firms reported their worst month for almost three years in April, meaning that the first quarter slowdown is unlikely to prove temporary. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Stalling new order volumes not only set the scene for further weakness ahead, but are already weighing on staff hiring and input buying across the construction sector. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Softer growth forecasts for the UK economy alongside uncertainty ahead of the EU referendum appear to have provided reasons for clients to delay major spending decisions until the fog has lifted. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153An additional factor dragging on construction sector performance is the lack of momentum in residential building. April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey highlighted one of the weakest rises in housing activity since early-2013, suggesting that greater caution in this sub-sector is adding to the sluggish growth conditions seen across the wider construction industry.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight agrees that the eurozone PMIs are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclacklustre\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, but remains hopeful that growth will pick up. While they have firmed recently, oil and commodity prices and the euro are still at levels that are supportive to Eurozone growth. Major ECB stimulus that was enhanced in March will increasingly kick in over the coming months, while the fiscal stance across the Eurozone is gradually becoming more growth orientated with increasing fiscal stimulative measures being introduced in a number of countries (along with increased public spending to deal with the influx of migrants). Meanwhile, generally improved job markets across the Eurozone are supportive to consumer spending along with the boost to purchasing power coming from negligible deflation/inflation. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector continued to recover in April, although the revival is less than spectacular. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to data firm Markit, whose composite PMI (which measures private sector growth) has come in at 53.0 in April. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a smidgen below March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 53.1, and means 34 months of unbroken growth. The eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Big Four economies all expanded, although Germany appears to be losing some momentum. Companies reported taking on more staff (although in France the increase was marginal). They were also forced to cut prices again to stimulate sales, suggesting the eurozone still face a deflation threat despite the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus measures. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris Williamson explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The final PMI data confirm the earlier flash estimate that the eurozone economy grew at a steady but unspectacular annual rate of 1.5% at the start of the second quarter. Prices charged also continued to fall, indicating that growth is being partly fuelled by price discounting. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, while still tepid, the sustained eurozone growth contrasts with slowdowns in the US and UK, suggesting the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more aggressive stimulus is helping to drive a steady recovery. The survey numbers also indicate that domestic demand within the eurozone is picking up which, alongside the weaker currency, is helping to offset sluggish external demand. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all bad. German service sector growth has slowed; its PMI has dipped to 54.5, from 55.1in March. That still shows expansion, but the slowest rate since last winter. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector has clawed its way back to growth, with the PMI rising to 50.6 from 49.9 in March. The first eurozone service sector data is out, and it shows that Spanish companies continued to grow last month. The Spanish Services PMI, which tracks activity across the sector, has dipped slightly to 55.1, from 55.3. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comfortably over the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction. It suggests the prospect of another election (called for late June) hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hit the economy. Mining shares are being hit this morning, pulling the London stock market into the red. Worries over the global economy are being blamed as BHP Billiton sheds 5% and Anglo American loses 3%. BHP is also being hit because Brazilian prosecutors have just filed a $58bn civil lawsuit over the Bento Rodrigues dam disaster which claimed 19 lives last year. Mining shares also fell sharply yesterday, after disappointing factory data from China and the UK suggested economy demand was slowing. FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga warns that: The elevated concerns over the health of the global economy complimented with the incessant declines in oil prices have soured investor risk appetite, consequently leaving the FTSE100 vulnerable to further losses. The ongoing supermarket price wars have hit profits at supermarket chain J Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. The company has posted a 14% drop in annual pretax profits, on the back of a 1.1% drop in sales. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better than some analysts had predicted. However, CEO Mike Coupe has warned that the market will remain competitive \u00e2\u20ac\u0153for the foreseeable future\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, sending shares down 1.5% in early trading. Next\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning on sales and profits could spell bad news for other retailers too. James McGregor, partner at Retail Remedy retail consultants, explains: It was inevitable that the weather would feature in some way in Next\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading update and we have not been disappointed. If Next have been challenged by the unseasonal weather this season, then we can assume that the majority of fashion retailers are really suffering..... To lower Next\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full price sales guidance range to -3.5%, indicates a sense of nervousness. Ever cautious, we are not surprised to hear Lord Wolfson warn of difficult trading ahead. His caution is understandable though, poor sell throughs are costly. The weather is finally going the right way but the customer might yet hold off buying her beachwear. Retail group Next has got the morning off to a bad start, by cutting its sales guidance for the second time in two months. Once again, bad weather get some of the blame; Next says that recent cold weather in March and April reduced demand for clothing. That follows the unusually mild winter, which hit sales of warm coats. But it also warned that demand for clothing may simply be weaker, as consumers cut back. My colleague Sean Farrell has the details: Though sales have improved in the past few days as weather has improved, the company said demand for clothes could stay weak. In the three months to 2 May Next\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total sales fell by 0.2% and full-price sales dropped 0.9%, at the low end of full-year sales guidance of -1% to 4%. As a result, Next cut its annual guidance for full-price sales to between -3.5% and +3.5%. It slashed its previous guidance in March when Lord Wolfson, the chief executive, predicted this year would be the most difficult since the financial crisis. Next also cut its guidance for annual profit. Pre-tax profit could fall as much as 8.9% to \u00c2\u00a3748m with a best estimate of profit rising 3.7% to \u00c2\u00a3852m. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jitteriness, traders in Europe are pretty cautious as they wait for a flurry of economic news. Today we find out how the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector performed last month. It may show that European consumers kept spending last month, despite signs of weakness in the global economy. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets has the predictions: The Spanish economy has been notable for its outperformance in recent months despite continuing high levels of unemployment and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest numbers are expected to come in at 55.1, while Germany is expected to remain unchanged at 54.6. On the downside the French numbers have consistently underperformed, though we are expecting to see a pick up to 50.8 as the French services sector strives to shake off the after effects of the November attacks in Paris. Those figures come between 8am and 9am BST. We then find out how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction industry fared last month; will builders feel any impact from Brexit uncertainty? And there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plenty of company results to wade through; brewing giant Anheuser-Busch InBev, high street retailer Next, supermarket chain J Sainsbury, oil group Shell and defence group BAE are all updating the City. In the meantime, European markets are likely to open sluggishly as investors worry about the global economic slowdown, yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall in the value of the US dollar, and political instability rising in Europe. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s before anyone mentions Donald Trump....",

Thirlwell said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have clear plans to invest further in our British chocolate manufacturing operations, in new stores and in our digital offering. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We welcome our new shareholders and look forward with confidence to the next phase of our growth and development as a listed company. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It does feel like British chocolate is making a renaissance after being in the doldrums for a few decades.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As well as its network of shops, Hotel Chocolat owns a cocoa plantation on St Lucia, which is home to a luxury hotel where a two-week stay costs up to \u00c2\u00a310,000. It also has two UK restaurants, one in London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Borough Market and the other in Leeds. Hotel Chocolat has three shops in Copenhagen, Denmark, but Thirlwell said that UK growth would take priority over international expansion. Nick Bubb, an independent retailing analyst and consultant, said investors seemed to have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lapped up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the placing, after the company announced the plans in March. Hotel Chocolat sales were \u00c2\u00a382.6m in the year to 28 June 2015, while underlying profits were \u00c2\u00a38.1m. The company said revenue increased 14% in the first half of the current financial year, while underlying profits were up 41%. The retailer said it intended to start paying dividends from its 2017 financial year onwards.",

If we can take the latest GDP data at face value, then the first quarter of 2016 saw US activity slide to an almost standstill. Yet, the labour market continues to fare well and was the one bright spot amid a general soft patch last month</p> <p>Over time, activity and labour data are likely to converge, but right now there is little evidence to untangle how this will play out. Were the April jobs figures to come in on a softer note, then this would endorse the weakness in activity and imply that lagging variables such as employment are also now turning lower. Conversely, if the labour data stays resilient then we will further linger in a state of limbo as either it is the activity data that is the aberration or the lags have yet to kick in. The April jobs report may in fact accentuate the stagflationary trends (soft activity, rising inflation) noted of late:</p> <p><strong>Payrolls to come in a tad softer than expectations</strong> (ING: +190,000; consensus: +200,000). While some indicators continue to signal a robust hiring backdrop, the softer ADP print suggests that there are some (albeit marginal) downside risks to jobs growth in April. </p> <p><strong>Upward bias in the unemployment rate still in place</strong> (ING: 5.0%; consensus: 4.9%). The discrepancy between payrolls and the household survey (from which the unemployment rate rate is derived) is still evident, while the very strong labour force growth is unlikely to endure. A slight correction in both components may put some upward pressure on the unemployment rate.</p> <p><strong>Robust underlying wage pressures should result in decent headline wage growth </strong>(ING: 2.4% year on year; consensus 2.4%). We note that the headline AHE measure has been hovering at the lower end of a range of US wage indicators, with the Atlanta Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wage growth tracker continuing to tick higher (on a moving average basis). Thus, we think the odds of a positive wage growth surprise are slightly higher this month.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-05-05T15:07:26.095Z\">at 4.07pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-572b53e7e4b0d509448a6423\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-05T14:13:07.499Z\">3.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US crude stocks rise by more than forecast</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US crude stocks increased by a higher than expected 2.8m barrels last week, according to the Energy Information Administration.</p> <p>Analysts had forecast a rise of 1.7m barrels.

                "bodyText":"Some reasonable results from the likes of BT helped stock markets recover some poise after the volatile start to trading in May. There were more signs of weakness in the global economy, including disappointing UK services data and US jobs figures. But oil moved higher as supply concerns outweighed news of higher than expected US crude inventories, giving some support to commodity stocks. But there was little to really enthuse investors ahead of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US non-farm payroll numbers, and the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up just 5.23 points or 0.09% at 6117.25 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax edged up 0.24% to 9851.86 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.11% at 4319.46 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.07% to 17,923.90 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.41% at 8689.4 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.94% to 601.48 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 41 points or 0.24%. On that note, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow for non-farm payroll day. More on Greece, where strikes are set for the weekend and a parliamentary vote on reforms is due on Sunday: Global economic pressures which have dissuaded the US Federal Reserve from raising interest rates again could be waning, according to one of the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policymakers. St Louis Fed president James Bullard said in a speech in California: International influences on the U.S. economy have been widely discussed in global financial markets during the last several years. Those factors appear to be waning during the first half of 2016. Financial stress has fallen according to recent readings. The effects of a stronger dollar appear to be waning. But he said there was evidence for both the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view of a gradual pace of rate increases and the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s belief in only a few increases: Evidence from labor markets, inflation readings and global influences suggests the [Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] median projection may be more nearly correct. Evidence from readings on GDP growth and market-based inflation expectations suggests the market view of the path of the policy rate may be more nearly correct. Which does not appear to shut the door to a June hike, following December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increase. Markets are struggling to make any headway ahead of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US non-farm payroll numbers. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, says: While markets have stabilised after days of losses, there seems little that can revive bullish sentiment as the day heads to its close. Despite an early attempt at a rally, indices remain under pressure, and it looks as if sellers will continue to dominate as the week enters its final session. ...Stocks remain under pressure, and with non-farm payrolls tomorrow the outlook remains resolutely grim. Further US dollar strength provides the reason for why there is little hope for indices at the present time. After weeks of weakness the impetus to buy the dollar appears too strong to hold back, which would provide a cogent reason for why indices have little ability to move higher. Ahead of non-farm payrolls, the market waits to see if the figure can best the number produced by ADP figures on Wednesday. Meanwhile Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unions have called a general strike for Friday and Saturday to protest against the tax and pension reforms due to be debated in parliament over the weekend, Reuters is reporting. Over in Greece, there has been talk of a possible weekend parliamentary vote on pension reforms, ahead of the Eurogroup meeting on Monday. The Syriza government is reportedly meeting on Friday: A solid US non-farms report on Friday could spark a near term revival in the US dollar, says Rob Carnell at ING Bank: April jobs report might uphold the stagflationary trend in US data. If we can take the latest GDP data at face value, then the first quarter of 2016 saw US activity slide to an almost standstill. Yet, the labour market continues to fare well and was the one bright spot amid a general soft patch last month Over time, activity and labour data are likely to converge, but right now there is little evidence to untangle how this will play out. Were the April jobs figures to come in on a softer note, then this would endorse the weakness in activity and imply that lagging variables such as employment are also now turning lower. Conversely, if the labour data stays resilient then we will further linger in a state of limbo as either it is the activity data that is the aberration or the lags have yet to kick in. The April jobs report may in fact accentuate the stagflationary trends (soft activity, rising inflation) noted of late: Payrolls to come in a tad softer than expectations (ING: +190,000; consensus: +200,000). While some indicators continue to signal a robust hiring backdrop, the softer ADP print suggests that there are some (albeit marginal) downside risks to jobs growth in April. Upward bias in the unemployment rate still in place (ING: 5.0%; consensus: 4.9%). The discrepancy between payrolls and the household survey (from which the unemployment rate rate is derived) is still evident, while the very strong labour force growth is unlikely to endure. A slight correction in both components may put some upward pressure on the unemployment rate. Robust underlying wage pressures should result in decent headline wage growth (ING: 2.4% year on year; consensus 2.4%). We note that the headline AHE measure has been hovering at the lower end of a range of US wage indicators, with the Atlanta Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wage growth tracker continuing to tick higher (on a moving average basis). Thus, we think the odds of a positive wage growth surprise are slightly higher this month. US crude stocks increased by a higher than expected 2.8m barrels last week, according to the Energy Information Administration. Analysts had forecast a rise of 1.7m barrels. Meanwhile gasoline stocks rose unexpectedly by 536,000 compared to expectations of a 144,000 barrel decline. But stockpiles of distillate, which includes diesel and heating oil, fell by 1.3m barrels, more than the 83,000 decline expected. Brent is currently up 3% at $46 a barrel despite the higher than expected inventory figures. The price is being supported by the wildfire threatening Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil sands region, as well as growing tensions in Libya. In the latest pay revolt nearly 24% of shareholders at Reckitt Benckiser voted against the remuneration policy and nearly 18% voted against the remuneration report. At Ladbrokes 42% voted against the remuneration report. The latest data on US jobs will not give much grounds for optimism for Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm numbers, says David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco. He said: [Weekly jobless claims] have generally been a bright spot over the past few years. They used to come in around the high 300,000s \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even topping 400,000 at the end of 2012. But now we are used to seeing claims coming in below 300,000 on a regular basis. But now traders will focus on the main event which is tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Non-Farm Payroll release. Early expectations were for an increase of just over 200,000. But the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153whisper number\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will probably be well below that following yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grim ADP number. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobless claims together with a worse than expected Challenger Job-cut number haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helped either. More US employment data ahead of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm numbers. After a jump in the number of US workers laid off last month it is probably no surprise that jobless claims rose last week. According to the Labor department the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose 17,000 to 274,000, the largest increase since February of last year. Analysts had expected a figure of around 260,000. Donald Trump also says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d scrap a swathe of federal regulations which are (he argues) holding back US firms. He told CNBC: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re lowering taxes very substantially and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to be getting rid of a tremendous amount of regulations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd With the Republican nomination in the bag, Donald Trump is now turning his attention to how he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d run the American economy if he makes it to the White House. And he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just declared that he would probably replace Janet Yellen as chair of the Federal Reserve when her current term expires. Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crime? Not being a Republican, apparently. Speaking to CNBC, Trump declared: I have nothing against Janet Yellen whatsoever. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been doing her job, and I have absolutely nothing against her. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know her, but she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very capable person and people that I know have a very high regard for her. But she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a Republican\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 When her time is up, I would most likely replace her because of the fact that it would be appropriate. But in a typical piece of Trump logic, the billionaire businessman also backed Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy stance: She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a low interest-rate person, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always been a low interest-rate person \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and I must be honest, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a low interest rate person. If we raise interest rates, and the dollar starts getting too strong, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to have some very major problems. Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current four-year term expires in February 2018, but she could potentially serve a second term (as did her predecessor, Ben Bernanke). Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jon Ferro questions Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s logic on this one: You can watch a clip of the interview here. We also have worrying news from America. The number of US workers laid off last month jumped, and hit the highest level for an April in seven years. It indicates American companies are feeling the pinch, after its economy slowed to virtual stagnation in the first quarter of 2016. Reuters has the details: Layoffs by U.S.-based companies accelerated in April, sending year-to-date job cuts to the highest level since 2009, a private study reported Thursday. Domestic companies announced plans to let go 65,141 workers last month, a 35 percent increase from March, according to the report by outplacement firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas . In the first four months of the year, employers said they would hand out 250,061 pink slips. That is the highest total for the January-to-April period since 2009. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We continue to see large scale layoffs in the energy sector, where low oil prices are driving down profits. However, we are also seeing heavy downsizing activity in other areas, such as computers and retail, where changing consumer trends are creating a lot of volatility,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Challenger CEO John A. Challenger said in a statement. Meanwhile in London, the boss of consumer goods group Reckitt Benckiser has apologised over a humidifier steriliser scandal that has claimed around 100 lives. Julia Kollewe reports: Rakesh Kapoor, chief executive of Reckitt Benckiser told shareholders at an AGM in central London: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m personally very sorry and very much regret that our Oxy product caused harm to people in Korea.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He said the company had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153made a mistake\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and vowed to ensure that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153something like this never happens again\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He will meet representatives from one patient group, who were demonstrating outside the AGM, in his office on Friday. The humidifier steriliser is believed to have killed nearly 100 people and injured others. It was invented in Korea and only sold there. Reckitt acquired the firm that made the steriliser in 2001. Some of these products were also manufactured by rival companies. Kapoor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments come three days after the head of Reckitt Benckiser Korea and Japan was struck while apologising for the scandal. James Sproule, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, fears the Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is suffering from more than the Brexit jitters. Sproule warns: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These figures will be put down to uncertainty over the EU referendum, but while this may explain part of the fall, we should also consider whether there are underlying factors feeding into a less rosy economic picture. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The question we must ask is whether growth is built on solid foundations. My concern is that the exceptional period we are living in of low rates and cheap money is not the basis of a sustainable economy. We do not know what the outcome of the referendum will be, or the exact effects on the economy in the short and longer term, but this uncertainty is not an excuse to take our eye off the ball on more fundamental issues of economic sustainability.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And this chart, from the Indie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ben Chu, underlines how worrying this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data is: With Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy seemingly slowing, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s even less chance of the Bank of England raising interest rates in the next few months. Some economists are even speculating that the BoE could cut rates this year. And Chris Williamson of data firm Markit has confirmed that the Bank has previously eased monetary policy when its PMI readings have been this week. This graph plots Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI (dark blue) against interest rate cuts (light blue) and bouts of quantitative easing (grey). Williamson says: The three Markit/CIPS PMI surveys collectively indicated the weakest rate of expansion since March 2013, with growth slowing across the board. The combined Output Index fell from 53.6 in March to 51.9 in April. The latest reading is consistent with a near-stalling of economic growth, down to just 0.1% in April. The deterioration in April pushes the surveys into territory which has in the past seen the Bank of England start to worry about the need to revive growth, either by cutting interest rates or non-standard measures such as quantitative easing. This chart shows why the weak service sector data probably show that UK growth has slowed sharply. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s from German bank Berenberg. Their economist Kallum Pickering, says there are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153substantial downside risks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to UK growth, but.. If, as we expect, the UK votes to remain in the EU, then the growth rate should recover to its trend rate of 0.5% qoq in the second half of the year. While there are some risks relating to the current account deficit and concerns that households are returning to pre-Lehman borrowing and saving habits, underlying fundamentals are sound. Anthony Cheung of City firm Amplify Trading agrees that the UK economic picture has deteriorated: Dean Turner, Economist at UBS Wealth Management, agrees that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy appears to have weakened in April. And that means growth in the current quarter will be lower than in January-March, when GDP expanded by only 0.4%. Turner says: Uncertainty over the EU Referendum is clearly taking its toll on activity and with this backdrop, we expect second quarter GDP growth to dip below the already disappointing first quarter print. With such subdued levels of growth, we expect the Bank of England will hold fire on interest rates in next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s MPC meeting, and for many months thereafter.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services sector makes up around three-quarters of the economy, so this slowdown is pretty worrying. David Noble, CEO of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, says June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum is partly to blame. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services sector is stuck between a rock and a hard place. Mounting global economic uncertainty at the top of the supply chain and the reality of the new National Living Wage at the bottom mean that firms are feeling the pinch from both ends. As a result, the sector credited with being the main driver of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic fortunes appears to be slowing down. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The looming EU referendum has had a profound effect on the sector, keeping prices relatively stagnant and delaying new orders. At the other end of the supply chain, the National Living Wage has compounded cost increases, resulting in the overall rate of input price inflation hitting a 27-month high. Together, these factors have squeezed margins while fewer than half of businesses expect to grow over the next twelve months. Breaking: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth has slumped to its lowest level in three years. Markit, the data firm, says its service sector PMI has fallen to 52.3 in April, down from 53.7 in March. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the weakest level since February 2013, and close to the 50-point mark that splits expansion from contraction. Firms reported that job creation slowed last month, while business optimism has fallen to a three year low too. This makes a hat-trick of bad UK economic news this week. Construction firms reported yesterday that growth has hit a three-year low, while the factory PMI showed that manufacturing is now contacting. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, fears that UK economic growth almost stalled last month: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The slowdown in the service sector follows similar weakness in manufacturing and construction to make a triple-whammy of disappointing news on the health of the economy at the start of the second quarter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The PMI surveys are collectively indicating a near- stalling of economic growth, down from 0.4% in the first quarter to just 0.1% in April. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some of the slowdown may be attributable to the early timing of Easter, though April also saw an increase in the number of companies reporting that uncertainty about the EU referendum caused customers to hold back on purchases, exacerbating already-weak demand linked to global growth jitters and ongoing government spending cuts. More to follow.... Here we go..... Lets see if those forecasts of a small slowdown are accurate. As well as posting stronger profits, BT has announced a \u00c2\u00a36bn investment in broadband and 4G coverage: You can now buy shares in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s luxury chocolate firm, Hotel Chocolat. The company floated on the stock market this morning, raising \u00c2\u00a320m each for its two founders. The IPO will also yield \u00c2\u00a312m to fund new store openings, as its expansion drive continues. Launching a new print newspaper, in this time of digital revolution, was always a risky move. So you can understand why Trinity Mirror is pulling its latest offering, The New Day, after seeing sales falling to 30,000. But the speed of the move is a shock \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the paper only launched 9 weeks ago. The news broke last night (here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mark Sweney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s piece), and Trinity has confirmed it to shareholders this morning, saying: Although The New Day has received many supportive reviews and built a strong following on Facebook, the circulation for the title is below our expectations. As a result, we have decided to close the title on 6 May 2016. Whilst disappointing, the launch and subsequent closure have provided new insights into enhancing our newspapers and a number of these opportunities will be considered over time. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the only bad news. Trinity has also revealed that revenues from print advertising has fall almost 20% - highlighting the tough conditions across media.... Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets have made a nervous start to trading, after two days of losses. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is up 15 points, or 0.2%, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX is up 0.3% and the French CAC is flat. BT is leading the London risers, up 3%, after reporting a 5% jump in underlying earnings this morning. Supermarket group Morrisons has gained 1.7%; after a troubled time, it posted a 0.7% rise in underlying sales this morning. It also reported that Amazon is about to start supplying its customers with Morrisons\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 products, though a deal announced recently. Energy firm Centrica, though, has slumped by 7% after it announced plans to sell around \u00c2\u00a3770m of new shares to cut its debt pile. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets has plunged by 2% at the start of trading, as investors react to the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest political crisis. Investors are alarmed by reports that prime minister Ahmet Davuto\u00c4\u0178lo is poised to resign, following a power struggle with president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an. The Turkish lira is also suffering, shedding 5% overnight. Davuto\u00c4\u0178lo and Erdo\u00c4\u0178an held crunch talks last night, but failed to mend their disagreements over key areas such as economic policy. Local reports suggest that elections for a new party leader to replace Davuto\u00c4\u0178lo could soon be called, causing fresh instability at a time when Turkey is already grappling with high inflation and the refugee crisis. Anxiety over a possible global downturn has hit stock markets in Asia again. The Hong Kong, South Korea and Philippines markets all shed around 0.5%. This send stocks across the region down for the seventh day running, its longest losing streak of the year Sharon Zollner of ANZ Bank New Zealand Ltd explains that signs of economic slowdown is hurting confidence again: Markets seem to be at something of a crossroads at present, waiting for clearer signals on whether U.S. activity will bounce back in the second quarter,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the global economy were to tip into recession at some point, what ammo, precisely, do central banks have left that won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do more harm than good?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. So far this week, the UK economic data has been quite disappointing. Construction firms are growing at the slowest rate in three years, and activity across Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturers is actually shrinking again. And investors are worried that the service sector, which makes up around 80% of the economy, may also be weakening. At 9.30am, the latest Service Sector PMI hits the wires, and it may show that growth slowed in April. A bad reading will surely reinforce concerns that the UK economy is running out of steam, with the Brexit referendum of 23 June casting a darker shadow over the country. CMC Markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Michael Hewson has the details: Both manufacturing and construction PMI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s came in short of expectations with manufacturing slipping into contraction territory for the first time since early 2013. Given how important the services sector is to the UK economy we really need to see a decent number here or run the risk that we see a growth downgrade next week from the latest Bank of England inflation report. Expectations are for a slight decline to 53.6 from 53.7. After two days of heavy falls, European stock markets are expected to inch higher this morning. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still plenty of angst about global growth prospects, and recent fluctuations in the foreign exchange markets. And on the corporate front, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting results from telecoms firms BT, supermarket chain Morrisons, and newspaper group Trinity Mirror.",

The rise means the UK car market is up 4.4% in the year to date compared to last year, largely thanks to a bumper March when more than 518,000 cars were registered, the second best performance on record. The ongoing increase, a trend the SMMT said was partly down to a plethora of car loan deals, puts the UK on course to beat the 2015 annual record of 2.63m car registrations. But the SMMT chief executive, Mike Hawes, said while the steady rise was a sign of consumer confidence, uncertainty over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future in the European Union was constraining demand. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Consumer confidence remains high as buyers continue to capitalise on attractive finance deals, although this could be affected by political and economic uncertainty in the coming months,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Hawes. His view was backed up by separate car sales figures that showed sales grew more substantially in the rest of western Europe, with an 8% rise to 1.2m in April according to data from the industry analysts LMC Automotive. Sales in Spain and Italy rose 21.2% and 11.5% respectively, while Germany recorded an 8.4% rise. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more modest rise was partly thanks to the increasing popularity of cars that run on alternative fuels, a category that grew by more than a quarter as buyers sought to reduce emissions and running costs. Petrol car registrations rose by 3.4%, while diesel vehicles saw a slight 0.6% decline in registrations. The strongest growth came in the fleet sector, which includes vehicles bought by firms such as taxi companies and delivery services, where new registrations rose by 6.1%. The rise, coupled with a 2.8% increase in the number of cars registered by other types of business, wiped out a 2.5% fall in cars registered by private individuals. The Ford Fiesta was the most popular car among Britons in April with 7,913 registrations, followed by the Volkswagen Golf on 5,645 and the Ford Focus with 5,562.",

The jobs creation numbers are significantly weaker than expected, but the results on pay growth suggest that the labour market has tightened somewhat. Clearly the pace of hiring has slowed, but this does not necessarily mean a marked cooling of growth in the US, as the details behind the headline number show a more nuanced picture.</p> <p>An economic downturn is typically followed by a long spell of rapid hiring as unemployment or spare capacity in the labour market disappears, a process that is now largely complete. The healthy gains recorded in weekly earnings attest to a market in which workers are beginning to have the upper hand. The participation rate, the unemployment rate, and the number of involuntary unemployed (which all measure spare capacity) have, following sustained improvements during the recovery, changed little since the year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s beginning. In summary, the labour market appears to have stabilised for the time being....</p> <p>Current indicators show that the services sector expanded in April thanks to a rise in new orders growth. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report demonstrates that the weakness largely pertains to sectors other than services: mining employment fell by 7,000; that in construction and manufacturing showed little change. The sectors making gains were professional and business services, healthcare and financial activities. While a broader sectoral mix would be welcome, this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance shows high-skill services expanding ahead of low-skill occupations such as retail, which made no gains. Consumer confidence, while sagging somewhat at present, should recover assuming wages continue to creep up.</p> <p>There is now little chance of an interest rate hike in June. As it would have been premature in any case, Cebr welcomes this.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-572c9e74e4b00455bdea4057\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-06T13:44:45.836Z\">2.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens sharply lower but quickly recovers</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The US market has unsurprisingly got off to a downbeat start after the worse than expected non-farm payroll numbers.

                "bodyText":"The number of oil rigs in use in the US has dropped for the seventh week in a row. The latest Baker Hughes survey showed the rig count fell by 5 to 415 last week, its lowest since October 2009. Brent crude is currently up 1.1% at $45.51, helped by the likely supply problems given the wild fires in Canada. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back on Monday. Worries about the Chinese economy have eased but political risks have increased over the past quarter, according to Oxford Economics: Back with BHS, and more on Dominic Chappell whose consortium owned the UK retailer before it collapsed last month. Simon Goodley reports: [Chappell] was forced out of a previous business venture after taking around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac400,000 (\u00c2\u00a3315,000) from the company for his personal use. The money, which appears to have been moved without the permission of other shareholders and has never been repaid, was transferred from a start-up company in Spain called Olivia Petroleum, which Chappell fronted and used to bolster his City credentials when he acquired BHS. It is understood that the funds were then diverted into other accounts, including one belonging to Chappell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wife, as well as being spent at a series of luxury restaurants, hotels and shopping trips, plus a chandlery business that fits out yachts. Chappell is a keen sailor. The allegation about Olivia Petroleum\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finances will raise further questions about the due diligence conducted by the billionaire Sir Philip Green, who sold BHS to Chappell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consortium Retail Acquisitions for \u00c2\u00a31 last year and is under mounting pressure to explain his actions. The Serious Fraud Office is also understood to be conducting preliminary inquiries into the activities of Chappell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Retail Acquisitions consortium leading up to the deal. The full story is here: After being in negative territory for much of the day and falling further after the disappointing US jobs figures, European markets came off their worst levels, inspired by a revival on Wall Street. The US market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s initial falls were reversed as investors ignored yet another sign that the global economy was not in a particularly good place, and instead concentrated on the prospect that the Federal Reserve was unlikely to raise interest rates in the near future. So after a volatile day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 8.45 points or 0.14% higher at 6125.70, but its 1.85% fall since Monday marks the worst week since mid-February Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has edged up 0.18% to 9869.95 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.42% lower at 4301.24 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB dipped 0.45% to 17,842.80 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.15% at 8702.1 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.69% to 605.61 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 20 points or 0.11%. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chart from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showing a breakdown of the US jobs: Markets are finding it difficult to untangle the details of the latest US data, says Marcus Bullus, trading director of MB Capital. He said: It has been a tale of two reports, as the markets have struggled to reconcile two conflicting indicators \u00e2\u20ac\u201c slowing rates of job creation and stronger levels of wage growth. The bears have focused on the disappointing headline number, seeing in it a worrying sign of the US economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s susceptibility to global headwinds. Yet for the bulls, such concerns are cancelled out by the unexpectedly solid rate of wage rises. Increasing average earnings are often viewed as a reliable barometer of corporate confidence, and the initial rush into fixed income that the report triggered has eased, helping US equities end the week on a more positive note. With the prospect of the Fed hiking rates in June now firmly off the table, the markets are being reassured that the benign interest rate environment won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be changing any time soon. Oil has edged higher ahead of the latest weekly US rig count, with Brent crude 0.8% higher at $45.37. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our report on the US jobs numbers: More pictures from Greece: Away from the US jobs, and ahead of Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote in the Greek parliament on pension and tax reforms, prime minister Alexis Tsipras has been defending the measures: Earlier came news that consumer confidence in Greece had fallen to a three and a half year low in April. Not exactly a surprise, given the renewed worries about the bailout programme and the contentious tax and pension reforms. The jobs data is lukewarm but not unduly concerning, according to analysts at the CEBR: While some will interpret it negatively, April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job report represents a lukewarm verdict on the US economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current performance. The jobs creation numbers are significantly weaker than expected, but the results on pay growth suggest that the labour market has tightened somewhat. Clearly the pace of hiring has slowed, but this does not necessarily mean a marked cooling of growth in the US, as the details behind the headline number show a more nuanced picture. An economic downturn is typically followed by a long spell of rapid hiring as unemployment or spare capacity in the labour market disappears, a process that is now largely complete. The healthy gains recorded in weekly earnings attest to a market in which workers are beginning to have the upper hand. The participation rate, the unemployment rate, and the number of involuntary unemployed (which all measure spare capacity) have, following sustained improvements during the recovery, changed little since the year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s beginning. In summary, the labour market appears to have stabilised for the time being.... Current indicators show that the services sector expanded in April thanks to a rise in new orders growth. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report demonstrates that the weakness largely pertains to sectors other than services: mining employment fell by 7,000; that in construction and manufacturing showed little change. The sectors making gains were professional and business services, healthcare and financial activities. While a broader sectoral mix would be welcome, this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance shows high-skill services expanding ahead of low-skill occupations such as retail, which made no gains. Consumer confidence, while sagging somewhat at present, should recover assuming wages continue to creep up. There is now little chance of an interest rate hike in June. As it would have been premature in any case, Cebr welcomes this. The US market has unsurprisingly got off to a downbeat start after the worse than expected non-farm payroll numbers. But more surprisingly, it is already off its worst levels, and this is helping to revive European markets. The data was well below forecast, adding to the recent reports from around the globe suggesting the world economy is slowing down. But at the same time it seems to have pushed out the expectations for the timing of the next US rate rise, which is providing some support for shares. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now virtually flat having initially fallen around 61 points. The FTSE 100 is now down just 14 points while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is down 31 points and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac 48 points, all well off their lows. Barclays is now expecting just one more US rate rise this year, rather than two, in the wake of the weak jobs data. It is forecasting three rises in 2017. Here are a couple of charts showing the jobs data: More reaction to the worse than expected US jobs figures. We could be in for a tricky few months, said David Morrison of Spread.co: European equities and US stock index futures were already softer ahead of the release but fell further in the immediate aftermath - while the dollar also lost ground. Of course, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth remembering that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have another set of updates on payrolls, manufacturing and services, plus a GDP revision, before the Federal Open Markets Committee meets next month. So we could have a tricky few weeks ahead of us which will be even trickier if Fed members sound off about keeping an open mind on a June hike. Dennis de Jong, managing director of UFX.com, believes a June hike is unlikely now: The labour market has been a shining beacon compared with other elements of the US economy for the past few months, but no longer. More than 200,000 jobs had been added in five of the previous six months, but today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure has come in disappointingly low. An interest rate hike next month is now looking unlikely as the general economic waters are far from calm. Weak growth at home and overseas is a major concern, as is poor manufacturing output, so Janet Yellen and the Fed are expected to keep the interest rate pause button pressed for a little longer. James Smith, economist at ING, says the payrolls report is unlikely to change many minds on the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate setting committee about the appropriate timing of the next rise: Although clearly disappointing, this may be more consistent with a gradual slowdown in employment growth as the economy gradually erodes the remaining slack in the labour market. As an aggregate, the labour report was probably best described as a fairly neutral and crucially, is unlikely to change too many minds on the FOMC about the timing of the next rate hike. That said, if we were to start seeing a more rapid, sustained downtrend in employment growth over the next few months, this may provide evidence that weakness emanating from the business investment side of the economy, which tends to lead the economic cycle, is starting to filter through to the more lagging labour market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at the moment though, it is hard for either the Fed or ourselves to make any conclusions based on one month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data. Back in the UK, Thomas Cook has responded to the threat of a half-term walkout by its cabin crew over plans to reduce break times. A spokesperson said: We would like to reassure our customers that nothing matters more to us than safety. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regrettable the union has chosen this path because the crew rest procedure, which includes monitoring all crew rest on all flights, was introduced with the agreement of the union. It also meets the regulations of industry experts the Civil Aviation Authority and does not compromise on safety. We have offered to meet union representatives and the message we hear directly from our crew is that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking forward to a great summer of flying customers on holiday. The 160,000 non-farm US jobs created in April was way below the average of 232,000 over the last 12 months. Professional and business services created 65,000 jobs in April, higher than the 12-month average. At the other end of the scale, jobs in the mining sector fell by 7,000. Not everyone was surprised by the non-farm payrolls number apparently: Attention will now turn to the Federal Reserve, casting doubt over the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s willingness to raise interests in the face of a softer jobs market. Details of the report from the US Labor Department showed a mixed picture for April. The headline figure of 160,000 was undoubtedly a shocker (202,000 expected), but other elements of the report were in line with expectations. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 5%, as expected, and average earnings grew by 0.3%, also as expected. US markets are expected to open lower. Opening call before the US jobs report was published: The 160,000 non-farm jobs created in April was the smallest in seven months. Falls in European markets have accelerated since the jobs report was published: FTSE 100: -1% at 6,055.97 German DAX: -1.1% at 9,741.37 French CAC: -1.4% at 4,258.29 Spanish IBEX: -1.2% at 8,588.5 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -1.8% at 17,601.82 Breaking: US non-farm payrolls dropped sharply in April, to 160,000 from 208,000 in March. This is a large downside shock. Economists were expecting 202,000. The March figure was revised down from an initial estimate of 215,000 jobs. Reaction to follow. Almost time for US payrolls. Economists polled by Reuters are expecting the report to show that non-farm payrolls increased by 202,000 in April, lower than March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 215,00. Just under 10 minutes to go. Thomas Cook cabin crew are voting on possible strike action during the half-term holiday in May. The dispute centres on proposed changes to the length of breaks staff will be allowed to take. Cabin crew will be allowed one 20-minute break over a 12-hour shift, according to Unite, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest union. More than 1,000 cabin crew have begun voting in a ballot for industrial action. The union said staff were previously entitled to a 20-minute break every six hours and that the proposed changes would put passenger safety at risk. Read our full story here. Leicester City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s incredible Premier League title win has already put the East Midlands city on the tourist map. Days after claiming the title for the first time in the club\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history, visitors are planning to descend on the city in droves this weekend according to Trivago, the hotel search website. Searches for a hotel stay in Leicester for the coming weekend jumped 277% since the win (compared with the week before). The average stay required was one night. Leicester will receive the trophy after their final home game of the season against Everton on Saturday. A hotel room in the city on Saturday night will cost you an average \u00c2\u00a3128, up 49% from the May monthly average of \u00c2\u00a386. Room availability for this Saturday is just 4%. In a sign that heightened interest is not limited to this weekend alone, hotel searches for all future travel to Leicester increased by 195%. Trivago\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Denise Bartlett: With much buzz surrounding Leicester\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inconceivable Premier League victory, it is unsurprising to see a last-minute surge in hotel searches to the city. The average stay duration of one night suggests that fans have either managed to obtain last-minute tickets, or simply want to soak up the atmosphere and celebrate. The increase in travel interest for a hotel stay in the future, however, suggests that Leicester\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tourism industry may be able to experience more long-term benefits from the media exposure.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tensions are already running high in Athens as Greeks take to the streets at the beginning of a three-day general strike. A strike was already planned for Sunday, to coincide with a parliamentary vote on tax and pension reforms, but unions called on Thursday for the strike to be extended to Friday and Saturday. The austerity measures are part of a package reforms that are being proposed in return for more bailout money from Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lenders. Workers from the Greek shipping industry, civil service, and public transport sector are among those taking part in the strike. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest labour union, the private sector GSEE, said the proposed reforms were the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153last nail in the coffin\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for workers and pensioners who have already suffered six years of austerity. A GSEE spokesperson said: They are trying to prove to the Eurogroup that they are good students but the y are destroying Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s social security system. Christine Lagarde is losing patience with eurozone finance ministers. The head of the International Monetary Fund has written to all 19 of them urging them to immediately start talks on providing debt relief for Greece, or risk losing the support of the IMF for a Greek package. In the letter - seen by the FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Peter Spiegel - Lagarde writes: We believe that specific [economic reform] measures, debt restructuring, and financing must now be discussed contemporaneously. For us to support Greece with a new IMF arrangement, it is essential that the financing and debt relief from Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European partners are based on fiscal targets that are realistic because they are supported by credible measures to reach them. Lagarde issued the warning as talks between Greece and its eurozone partners on a package of reforms appear to have stalled. Last month, finance ministers told Athens they wanted to see \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3bn (\u00c2\u00a32.4bn) of specific contingency reforms in place - as an insurance policy in the event that main reform measures did not go far enough to allow Greece to make its repayments - before releasing more funds. But no agreement has been reached on contingencies, and the IMF wants debt relief to be included in the talks immediately. European markets are still down ahead of the US payrolls... Some upbeat figures from Spain earlier. Industrial production rose 1.2% in March, rebounding from a 0.3% drop in February and the best performance since 2014. It was much better than expected - economists had forecast a smaller 0.3% increase. On an annual basis, industrial output increased 2.8% in March. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, says this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car figures show resilience but there are also signs that consumers are becoming concerned about the economic outlook: New car sales were pretty resilient in April, in contrast to the weakened performance seen in many other sectors of the economy. A modest dip in private sector car sales may well be the consequence of consumers becoming more wary about buying big ticket items due to increased concerns over the economic outlook and a recent dilution of purchasing power compared to the peak levels of 2015. Over the longer term, much will obviously depend on how earnings growth develops, given that employers have been using prolonged negligible inflation as a reason to award modest pay increases. Also important is whether the labour market can regain momentum after the EU referendum. The best-selling cars in the UK in April: New car sales rose again in April, up 2% compared with a year earlier. A total of 189,505 new cars were sold last month - the largest number for the month of April in 13 years according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. The increase was driven by fleet and business sales, up 6.1% and 2.8% respectively. Sales to individuals however fell 2.5%. It followed a very strong March, when 518,000 new cars were registered, making it the second-biggest month on record. April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s numbers take the total number of new cars sold in 2016 so far to 961,285, 4.4% ahead of this time last year. Mike Hawes, SMMT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, reiterated his point that greater-than-usual uncertainty lies ahead for the car market in the months ahead, as the UK goes to the polls on EU membership. After such a strong March, April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steadier performance was to be anticipated, and is in line with our expectations for the year. Consumer confidence remains high as buyers continue to capitalise on attractive finance deals, although this could be affected by political and economic uncertainty in the coming months. Sir Philip Green, the billionaire former owner of BHS, has called for the resignation of MP Frank Field as head of the parliamentary investigation into the retailer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demise. The entrepreneur has accused Field of being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153prejudiced\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd against him. Green sold BHS for \u00c2\u00a31 a year ago to a group of little-known investors. Last week the retail chain collapsed into administration putting 11,000 jobs at risk and leaving the company with a \u00c2\u00a3571m pensions black hole. As chairman of the work and pensions committee, Field is leading the parliamentary inquiry (due to begin on Monday) into what went wrong at BHS. Field told the Financial Times on Thursday that Green should \u00e2\u20ac\u0153make good\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the pension scheme by paying off the deficit, or lose his knighthood: I feel that Philip Green has a moral duty to make good the pension scheme and if he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, while I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speak for the committee as a whole, I personally would recommend he should lose his knighthood. Sir Philip is a master of bullying but he will find that parliament isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for being bullied. Green described the comments as an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153outrageous outburst\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and called for Field to step down: Clearly he has made his decision as to what he feels the punishment should be without even hearing any evidence from anybody about BHS or the circumstances of the last 15 years. I think Mr Field needs to stand down from the inquiry immediately as he is clearly prejudiced. Read our full story on the row here. Investors are particularly nervous about the US payrolls report today following other worrying signals that the labour market is weakening in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy. A study published on Thursday showed the number of US workers laid off last month jumped, hitting the highest level for an April in seven years. Meanwhile the US Labor Department said the number of Americans making new claims for unemployment benefits rose 17,000 to 274,000 last week - the largest increase since February last year. Economists had forecast a smaller number of around 260,000. Oil prices are also falling this morning. Brent crude oil is down 0.5% at $44.77 a barrel. The cautious sentiment has spread to Europe, with markets opening lower across the board this morning. The FTSE 100 is down 0.7% at 6,076. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX is down 0.5%, the French CAC is down 0.7%. In Spain the IBEX is down 0.4%, while Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB is down 0.2%. Shares in Asia have fallen, hitting one-month lows as fears over the US jobs recovery and the wider economy take their toll. Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Recent global economic data and some corporate earnings from major Western firms have been lackluster, leading to risk-off trading in markets. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei Index fell 0.25%. In China, the Shanghai Composite Index fell 2.2%, while Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng was down 1.2%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The big news item on the agenda today is the US payrolls report for April, published at 13.30 UK time. Economists and investors are nervous about this one. The headline non-farm payrolls figure is expected to show 202,000 jobs were created in April, fewer than the 215,000 created in March. A softer US jobs market would only add to fears of a wider slowdown, and investors are fearful that the number today could be even lower, as Michael Hewson from CMC Markets explains: Expectations around today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s number are for 200k new jobs to be added for April, down from 215k in March, which would be more in line with the better than expected ISM non-manufacturing report which came out on Wednesday. That saw a decent rise in the employment component, with the unemployment rate remaining steady at 5%, but there does appear to be an undercurrent of concern that suggests we could see a miss to the downside. European markets are on course to end the week down for a second week, as concerns persists over the state of the global economy. Markets are expected to open lower:",

It also called for further reforms, such as better childcare and after-school provision, to enable more women to work full-time. Pension changes to promote longer working lives would also help \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bring the double dividend of increasing employment while reducing old-age poverty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the IMF said. The IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call for more private and public investment in Germany chimes with its recent warnings that politicians cannot rely solely on low interest rates and money printing programmes from central banks to shore up growth. The IMF director, Christine Lagarde, warned last month that the global economy was more fragile and urged governments to pursue growth-friendly policies.",

At the same time, it delays this painful conversation in Berlin to 2018, a date after the next Bundestag elections in September 2017.

                "bodyText":"The positive mood which followed Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurogroup meeting on Greece has helped lift European markets, along with some upbeat company results and a strong start on Wall Street. Investors shrugged off renewed concerns about a slowdown in China, with commodity companies recovering from early losses, and Brent crude rising 3.8% to $45.29 as supply issues resurfaced. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 41.84 points or 0.68% higher at 6156.65 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax was up 0.65% at 10,045.44 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac climbed 0.36% to 4338.21 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB added 1.41% to 17,934.72 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 1.32% at 8775.2 In Greece, the Athens market ended up 3.15% at 629.29 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 189 points or just over 1%. On that note, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll close for the evening. Thanks for your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. The International Monetary Fund is reportedly doing a wait and see act after Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurogroup meeting: And the yield - or interest rate - on Greek bonds have fallen to their lowest level this year. The 10 year yield is down 66 basis points to 7.47% as investors hold out hope that the country has moved closer to a bailout agreement with its creditors. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is up by 3.15% at 629.29, helped by the optimism following Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurogroup meeting. Looks like the Greek government is getting on with things ahead of the new 24 May deadline of the next Eurogroup meeting. The US market has been supported by the latest jobs data. This showed job openings - a sign of confidence in the employment market - rising from 5.61m to 5.76m in March, and is a positive development after Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker than expected US non-farm payroll numbers. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Whilst the market enthusiasm for the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Greek good news began to wane this afternoon a strong US open helped secure a decent chunk of the morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European gains. Continuing to make do with a selection of B-tier data the Dow Jones was nevertheless lifted by Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s improved Jolts job openings figures, especially following last Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm disappointment. The number hit its best level since the financial crisis at 5.76 million, surpassing both expected 5.55 million and the last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upwards-revised 5.61 million. This helped push the Dow to a 160 point rise after the bell, the index crossing the 17850 mark for the first time in a week. The eurozone saw the biggest drop off this Tuesday, the Cac shedding two thirds of its morning growth whilst the Dax lost around half. Yet the indices remain up by 0.5% and 0.6% apiece, that jump crucially leaving the German bourse above the 10000 mark. US markets are sharply higher in early trading, helping give some support to flagging European shares. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 155 points or 0.8% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.5% ahead, as higher oil prices boosted energy shares. Optimism about Greece following Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurogroup meeting has also helped sentiment. The FTSE 100 is up 0.6% while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has added 0.46% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has edged up 0.09%. In Greece, the Athens market is up 2.76%. As for oil, Brent crude is 2.6% better at $44.8 a barrel following supply disruptions in Canada and Nigeria, which have knocked out 2.5m barrels of daily production. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is set to buy * take over the management of its first batch of bad loans from Greek banks in the coming weeks. In an interview with Reuters EBRD director Sabina Dziurman said the move should mean the bank would spend more in Greece this year than the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac320m last year. The EBRD has already invested \u00e2\u201a\u00ac250m in equity stakes in Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s four biggest banks. (* corrected to make clear EBRD would not directly buy bad loans but take over the management of them) And more: soaring car sales. Earlier there was a raft of Greek economic data. Industrial production fell 4% in March, compared to a 3% decline in February. There was a 23.8% drop in mining production and a 2.5% fall in manufacturing production. Meanwhile the economy remained in deflation for the 38th month in a row in April, with the consumer price index falling 1.3%. This was slighly higher than the 1.5% decline in March, and the 2.1% fall seen in April last year. Finally the trade deficit shrank by 23.7% in March, making a 6.9% decline for the first quarter. Imports fell 17% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3.6bn, while exports dropped 11.4% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.36bn. The main Greek stock index has hit its highest level of the year. The Athex general composite index is up almost 3%, driven by relief that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next bailout instalment could be signed off at the May 24 eurogroup meeting. Bank shares are among the top risers, as the threat of a default or Grexit eases. Some analysts are optimistic that the gap between Germany and the IMF over debt relief has narrowed (as UBS argued this morning). Other experts, though, fear that the Greek crisis could easily flare up soon. Reuters explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There continues to be disagreement, in the creditors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 camp in particular, about the way forward,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd DZ Bank strategist Hendrik Lodde said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Because of the diverging opinions...talks are presumably going to drag on even further.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Greek bonds are continuing to rally today, pushing down the interrst rate on the debt to the lowest level this year: Wisely, Alexis Tsipras also urged his cabinet to avoid sounding too upbeat: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greece is leaving behind six years of recession and darkness. I want to repeat, this is not the right time for celebrations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras just declared yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurogroup meeting a success. Tsipras has told his cabinet that the commitments to debt relief show that his country is not isolated within Europe. He also pledged that the current bailout review will be concluded without the need for extra austerity, on top of what was agreed in August. The PM says: Greece is not alone and isolated. It enjoys the support of political forces and governments which have finally realised that this country and its people have the right to turn a page. This TV shot, though, suggests cabinet ministers are less than euphoric: Greek MPs in Alexis Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Radical Left party have told us they are appalled that they will soon be forced to vote through yet more measures before their bailout review can be concluded in two weeks. From Athens, Helena Smith reports: The prospect of having to backing to a bevy of indirect taxes - as well as a mechanism that would automatically trigger across-the-board cuts in the event of finances veering off course \u00e2\u20ac\u201c before the next eurogroup on May 24, is being viewed with alarm. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The price of power is falling hard,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said one MP, who asked that I not mention his name at such a sensitive time. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How can we, in all honour and honesty, return to our constituencies and face voters? Even with our heads covered a lot of us now don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to confront them.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 embattled two-party coalition may have been given a breather but its popularity has been plummeting in the polls. The main opposition New Democracy has seen its ratings surge since the moderate Kyriakos Mitsotakis was elevated to the helm of the party in January with a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPulse\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 poll last month showing the centre right party leading by six points in vote intention if fresh elections were held. Mitsotakis, who has opposed the latest reform package on the basis that it is too tax heavy, lead Tsipras by 7 percentage points on the question of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwho is more suitable to be prime minister?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Tsipras, who got the backing of all 153 MPs in Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote, has says that once the heavily frontloaded programme passes parliament, the leftist-led coalition can get on with the real business of ruling. We mentioned earlier that eurozone officials are worried about Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt sustainability. Well, the Wall Street Journal has now produced an excellent chart showing the official forecasts for Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borrowings over the next few decades. It confirms that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debts (currently 180% of GDP) will remain alarmingly high in 45 years if it fails to meet targets for growth, spending and privatisations. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full piece: Eurozone Asked to Consider More Concessions on Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Debt People on the streets of Athens don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t share the optimistic mood in the financial markets today. Many Greeks are simply struggling to make ends meet after years of austerity cutbacks and tax rises, as our correspondent Helena Smith reports: In his tiny shop in downtown Athens, Kostis Nakos sits behind a wooden counter hunched over his German calculator. The 71-year-old might have retired had he been able to make ends meets but that is now simply impossible. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All day I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been sitting here doing the maths,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he sighs, surrounded by the undergarments and socks he has sold for the past four decades. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My income tax has just gone up to 29%, my social security payments have gone up 20%, my pension has been cut by 50 euros; they are taxing coffee, fuel, the internet, tavernas, ferries, everything they can, and then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Enfia [the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much-loathed property levy]. Now that makes me mad. They said they would take that away!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full piece: Wolfango Piccoli, analyst at Teneo Intelligence, reckons the new three-pillar approach to Greek debt solution should win the crucial backing of both Germany and the IMF. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because it effectively kicks the issue into the long grass until 2018, when the current bailout expires. Wolf explains: The idea is to address debt sustainability in the short term via strategies of debt management (including options such deferred interest rate payments, lock-in interest rates and adjusting the repayment schedule), in the medium term (post program conclusion in 2018 conditional upon the successful implementation of the ESM program) via interest rates, grace periods, and potentially by usage of SMP and ANFA profits, and in the undefined longer term by looking, if necessary, into undefined additional debt measures to ensure Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt sustainability. This three-segment structure achieves two things. It offers reassurance to the IMF that the question of debt sustainability will be addressed both immediately and then, in a more substantial manner, at the conclusion of the program. At the same time, it delays this painful conversation in Berlin to 2018, a date after the next Bundestag elections in September 2017. This structure should therefore allow the IMF to participate and the Bundestag \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which will decide in a full plenary session \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to greenlight the deal. French finance minister Michel Sapin has issued a statement applauding Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts. On the reform programme, Sapin says: The first aim of the French Government is to honor and support the considerable efforts that have been made by the Greek government and this majority. From the point of view of France, the Greeks proved that we could trust them. And on the sustainability of the Greek debt, Spain says that three essential elements are needed: structural reforms to support greater growth and competitiveness, fiscal measures that allow Greece to run a surplus creditors must produce a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvision\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of how Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt can be sustainable Swiss bank UBS believes yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurogroup meeting yielded several positive developments for Greece. For example: 1) Eurozone ministers endorsed Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest economic reforms, meaning \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn of bailout funds should be handed over soon. 2) A general framework for debt relief has finally been established (starting with some modest short-term moves) In a note to clients, UBS say: This is the first time there is clarity on debt relief as well as a clear signal that Eurozone member states are willing to act on Greek debt. Additionally, the allusion to lower long-term primary surpluses is arguably not only macroeconomically sensible but a way to satisfy the political desideratum of keeping the IMF involved in the Greek bailout. Finally, the above helps the Greek government build its success story via programme compliance, thereby incentivising it to persist on the conciliatory path with its creditors. UBS also point that Greece has several \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcloose ends\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to tie up, including getting parliamentary approval for the last few prior actions agreed with creditors. Greek government bonds are jumping in value this morning, as traders welcome the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commitment to granting Athens some debt relief. The yield, or interest rate, on Greek 10-year bonds has hit a six-month low as money pours back into Greek debt. Greek 10-year bonds are now yielding just 7.9%, the lowest since last November: 7% is usually seen as the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdanger zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 where a country cannot borrow on the markets, triggering a bailout. Investors are calculating that the risks of a Greek default have fallen, but haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t completely disappeared. Shares are rallying in Athens too, sending the main Greek stock index up over 2%. The City is relieved that Germany appears to have softened its opposition to Greek debt relief (see earlier post). Jeremy Cook of World First, the foreign exchange firm, explains: Yesterday saw the greatest opponents of debt relief, Germany, hint that they were open to the possibility of debt relief and an agreement will be sought. It will come as no surprise that the stick that accompanies this carrot is to enact long needed further pension and spending reforms. And we should also remember that full blown debt write-offs are not on the table. Instead, Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors could cap interest payments, extend maturities, or grant a delay on repayments. A couple of Greek front pages today: European stock markets are rallying in early trading, partly driven by hopes of a deal between Greece and creditors in two weeks time. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100, the German DAX and French CAC have all gained 0.8% this morning. Optimism over Greece is countering some alarmingly weak German and French industrial production figures this morning, which suggested eurozone factories struggled in March. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx says the markets look \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fairly bubble, even though Athens still has work to do: With the Eurogroup finally holding their first serious discussion about Greek debt relief there was a sense of tentative hope in the air after Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. Now all that has to be done is for the country to outline a post-fiscal target failure contingency plan AND implement some more unpopular reforms in the next fortnight, before the finance ministers meet once against on the 24th May. Easy! Eurozone ministers are desperate to avoid another Greek crisis this summer that might drive Britain into leaving the EU. So argue The Times today: Newsflash from Athens: prime minister Alexis Tsipras will brief cabinet ministers at 1pm local time, or 11am BST. Last night, Tsipras told the Greek president that things are moving in the right direction, with a positive result expected on May 24. Opposition MPs, though, are less impressed. They point out that Greece has to actually implement the unpopular income tax rises and pension reforms that were voted into law on Sunday, and still isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t getting significant debt relief until 2018. Greek pensions and wages would be cut again if the country is forced to implement the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccontingency measures\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 agreed with creditors at last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting in Brussels. Greek newspaper Kathimerini explains: The proposal for the automatic mechanism sent by Athens indicated that apart from some welfare spending, no form of expenditure would be protected from automatic reductions. This includes pensions and public sector wages, even though the coalition had repeatedly indicated that it would like to ringfence them. Those contingency measures would only kick in if Greece failed to hit its fiscal targets - something the IMF is particularly worried about. Analysts at Canadian bank RBC have a neat summary of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s developments in Brussels: As expected yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurogroup did not sign off on the first review of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third programme but there was progress on the so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccontingency measures\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that Greece has been asked to legislate for. Ministers agreed that they would allow Greece to legislate a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmechanism\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for additional measures if budget targets are off-track. Technical talks, including with the IMF, on the proposal will now take place before the Eurogroup now meets again on May 24th. Greek debt relief was also discussed with agreement on a road map for considering further debt measures including tasking the euro working group (EWG) with looking at debt sustainability in Greece. The Financial Times has given Germany the credit for helping to break the deadlock between Greece and its creditors, by easing its objections to debt relief talks. They explain: The political space for a deal was opened on Monday by the readiness of Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, to explore ways to ease Greek debt repayments. He had, until then, strongly resisted such talks as unnecessary, putting IMF participation in the programme in doubt. That could be a significant change of position for Germany, if a deal is reached by May 24. At the heart of the Greek crisis is the question of whether Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 borrowing can ever be tackled, or will spiral further out of control. And documents presented to eurozone ministers yesterday, and seen by Reuters, suggest serious concerns over this issue. Analysts at the European Stability Mechanism have predicted that Greece would manage to run a surplus of 3.5% from 2018 until 2025, dipping to 1.5 % from 2040-2060. Such a chunky surplus sounds challenging. And even if this \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmain scenario\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is correct, the document shows that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors would need to cut the interest rate on Greek bonds and extend their maturity, to make the burden sustainable. Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Jan Strupczewski explains: If the main ESM scenario were to prove accurate, the euro zone, Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main lender, could achieve Greek debt sustainability through three actions: the extension of the maximum weighted maturity by 5 years to 37.5 years a re-profiling of the amortization scheme by setting loan repayments as 1 percent of GDP until 2050 and linearly amortized after that a capping of interest charged to Greece at 2 percent, with any interest that would have been payable in excess of the 2 percent being deferred until 2050. The accumulated and capitalized deferred interest would then be repaid in equal instalments. And if the central scenario is too optimistic, of course, deeper debt relief would be needed. In the ESM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negative scenario, Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt spirals from 180% of GDP today to almost 260% of GDP by 2060.... More here: Euro zone Greek debt analysis shows serious concerns over its sustainability Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The clock is ticking for Greece again today, after eurozone finance ministers set a deadline of May 24 to reach a deal to unlock \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn of bailout cash. Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurogroup meeting appears to have made some progress, with ministers finally holding their first talks on debt relief. But before that can happen, Greece still needs to prepare a contingency mechanism that would automatically cut public spending if it fails to hit its fiscal targets (as the IMF fears). Athens also needs to push through a few more reforms, including creating a privatisation fund, before the next eurogroup meeting in two weeks time. So there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still opportunity for more drama. Also coming up today... New German industrial production figures are just being released. They look worse than expected; falling by 1.2% month-on-month, so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll keep an eye on that. The latest UK trade figures are due at 9.30am BST, and likely to show that Britain ran our traditional current account deficit in April. The commodity sector is coming under pressure too, with prices of key metals slumping sharply in recent days. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting financial results from, among others, Swiss bank Credit Suisse and airline easyJet.",

Half year revenues rose 5.8% to \u00c2\u00a39.7bn, slightly down on the 5.9% growth seen in the first quarter, while operating profits after restructuring costs rose 4.8% to \u00c2\u00a3724m. Chief executive Richard Cousins said: Savings from restructuring are starting to come through, and are offsetting the weakness in Offshore and Remote and some emerging markets. Therefore margins pre-restructuring were flat. Our pipeline of new contracts is encouraging and our focus on organic growth, efficiencies and cash gives us confidence in achieving another year of delivery. The company, which serves 5bn meals a year to schools, hospitals and entertainment sites, won contracts for the New Las Vegas Arena and basketball\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Oracle Arena in the US and Brighterkind in the UK. In a hold note, Numis said: We are encouraged by the strong start to the year and in our view, Compass is a very high quality business and we share management\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view that there are promising structural growth opportunities globally with potential for further revenue and margin growth. However, we believe that this promise is captured in the 2016 PE ratio of 21.3 times. Overall the FTSE 100 has fallen 19.06 points to 6137.59, with banks among the main fallers. Standard Chartered is down 12.85p at 483.10p while Royal Bank of Scotland has dropped 4.9p to 210.3p. But among the mining shares Randgold Resources has risen 150p to \u00c2\u00a360.40 while Glencore - up 2.65p at 136.55p - and Rio Tinto - up 4p at \u00c2\u00a320.05 - benefitted from positive recommendations from Canaccord Genuity. It said: We have revised forecasts following the recent first quarter production reports and changes to our commodity price assumptions. We have also factored in other recent news flow, in particular the planned disposal by Anglo American of its niobium and phosphates business for $1.5bn. We apply a higher commodity price deck for most commodities, and the net result is that we have raised our earnings forecasts and target prices. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something of a mixed start to trade this morning, with that strong finish on Wall Street evidently counting for little. Commodity prices remain generally upbeat and although crude oil is off a little on resurgent oversupply fears, that too is holding onto the vast majority of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains, so we do at least have the natural resources stocks scattered across the top of the board. Following their updates Tui has dropped 16p to \u00c2\u00a310.52 and William Hill has fallen 9.1p to 315.2p.",

Contrary to the API, the official data from the US Department of Energy, which has just been released, shows that crude stockpiles dropped by a surprisingly large 3.4 million barrels last week, not increase.</p> <p>The drawdown may well have been due to the wildfires in Canada as the latter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main export market is the US. Indeed, US crude oil imports were down by a good 5,000 barrels per day from the previous week, according to the DoE. Imports are likely to fall further this week because of the significant reduction of oil output in Canada. News that US oil production also fell, down 0.3% week-over-week, provided further support to prices.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-573344d9e4b08056de8fa338\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-11T14:44:01.896Z\">3.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Brent crude is now up 1.7% at $46.33 a barrel following the fall in US oil inventories. David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Crude oil flew higher following the release of the latest inventory data from the EIA. This showed a fall of 3.4 million barrels compared with an expected build of 100,000 barrels. </p> <p>Nevertheless, the charts suggest that crude is struggling to break above resistance which comes in around $46 for WTI and $48 for Brent. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s support for both contracts around the $42 per barrel level. Oil could be consolidating now ahead of another leg higher.

                "bodyText":"It was a down day for European stock markets as investors decided to cash in after Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains inspired by the signs of progress in the Greek financial crisis. Some disappointing results from the US - notable Disney and Macy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s - sent the US market lower and undermined sentiment elsewhere. Banking shares were also under pressure, especially in Italy after a couple of disappointing updates. But a rise in oil prices after a surprise drop in US crude inventories helped the commodity-heavy FTSE 100 outperform its peers, and even record a slight increase on the day. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 5.84 points or 0.09% at 6162.49 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 0.7% to 9975.32 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.5% at 4316.67 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 1.32% to 17,698.08 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 1.27% at 8663.9 In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.63% to 619.06 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 125 points or 0.7%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. More signs that Greece may be heading in the right direction. Bloomberg reports: The European Central Bank could discuss restoring Greek banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 access to its refinancing lines as soon as their June 2 policy meeting, people familiar with the matter said. A new waiver on Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s junk-rated debt will probably be proposed by the ECB board once a staff-level agreement between the government and auditors representing creditor institutions is reached, the people said, asking not to be named as the matter is confidential. A spokesman for the central bank declined to comment. The Governing Council doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to accept board proposals. Euro-area finance ministers meeting in Brussels on Monday signaled they could sign off on Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout review at their next meeting on May 24 once the country has legislated the final actions required for loan disbursements. Greek collateral has been without a waiver since February last year, forcing the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks onto Emergency Liquidity Assistance, when the new government said it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t complete its aid program at the time because of the austerity measures required. The full story is here. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the complete comment from Fawad Razaqzada, technical analyst at FOREX.com, on the US inventory numbers: The American Petroleum Institute got it completely wrong. Contrary to the API, the official data from the US Department of Energy, which has just been released, shows that crude stockpiles dropped by a surprisingly large 3.4 million barrels last week, not increase. The drawdown may well have been due to the wildfires in Canada as the latter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main export market is the US. Indeed, US crude oil imports were down by a good 5,000 barrels per day from the previous week, according to the DoE. Imports are likely to fall further this week because of the significant reduction of oil output in Canada. News that US oil production also fell, down 0.3% week-over-week, provided further support to prices. Brent crude is now up 1.7% at $46.33 a barrel following the fall in US oil inventories. David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco, said: Crude oil flew higher following the release of the latest inventory data from the EIA. This showed a fall of 3.4 million barrels compared with an expected build of 100,000 barrels. Nevertheless, the charts suggest that crude is struggling to break above resistance which comes in around $46 for WTI and $48 for Brent. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s support for both contracts around the $42 per barrel level. Oil could be consolidating now ahead of another leg higher. Crude has put in an impressive rally since the beginning of the year and needs to build a base before it can push up further. However, an alternative view is that crude is losing its upside momentum. Temporary supply disruptions won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t offset the likelihood of increased production the closer we get to $50 per barrel. Meanwhile, the outlook for demand growth is a bit foggier now as there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increasing evidence that global economic activity is slowing once again. These EIA figures do not match figures from the American Petroleum Institute, which on Tuesday reported a rise in inventories. Instead of an expected rise in weekly crude stocks, the latest report from the Energy Information Administration shows a surprise fall. Crude inventories dropped 3.41m barrels to 539.98m compared to the expected 0.71m barrel increase. Weekly gasoline stocks fell by 1.23m and distillate stocks by 1.65m, both bigger than expected declines. Over in Spain, the country has received more than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10.5bn of demand for a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3bn 50-year bond it plans to issue. Meanwhile Chancellor George Osborne has told a select committee that the Treasury and Bank of England are doing a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significant amount\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of Brexit contingency planning. A reminder you can follow the select committee on the EU referendum in the Politics live blog. UK economic growth slowed down in the three months to April, partly due to uncertainty over the EU referendum, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. It said UK GDP grew by 0.3% in the three months to April, compared to 0.4% in the first three months of the year and 0.6% late last year. Researcher Jack Meaning said: UK economic growth continues to be subdued compared with the rates we saw at the end of last year. Some of this slowdown is undoubtedly a result of heightened uncertainty around the impending EU referendum, and so is likely to be temporary should the UK decide to remain in the EU after June 23. US markets have fallen back in early trading, with poor results from Disney and department store group Macy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weighing on sentiment. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 84 points or 0.48% after a strong performance on Tuesday, while the S&amp;P 500 has opened down 0.2%. European markets have also edged lower, with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax down 0.65% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac 0.61% lower. The FTSE 100 is performing better, down just 0.12%. Just a reminder, Chancellor George Osborne is about to be questioned by the Treasury Select Committee on the European referendum. My colleague Andrew Sparrow is following the hearing over at the Politics live blog: Shares in European banks are on the slide today, with Italian institutions under particular pressure following losses or falling profits from Banco Popolare and Banco Popolare di Milano. The FTSE Italia banking index is currently down 3.68%. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jill Treanor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s piece on the problems at Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks: Back with UK interest rates, and a Reuters poll of economists shows they continue to expect the first hike - of 25 basis points - will not come until the first quarter of 2017. They forecast rates will be 1% at the end of 2017 and 1.5% at the end of the following year, lower than previous expectation. In the last survey in April the figures were 1.25% and 1.75% respectively. They cited the risk of Brexit and the fragile global economy as the biggest threats to UK growth this year, expecting it to increase by 0.4% to 0.6% a quarter to the third quarter of 2017. The oil price has recovered from its earlier falls, which were prompted by continuing concerns about oversupply as Canadian oil firms restarted production following the Fort McMurray wildfires. But, ahead of the US weekly inventory data, Brent is now up 0.8% at $45.89 a barrel as Shell announced the closure of a key Nigerian pipeline, which is likely to push the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s production to its lowest level for more than two decades. The poor UK data comes, of course, a day ahead of the latest Bank of England decision on interest rates. They are expected to be kept on hold but one former member of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee believes a cut would be in order: Hat-tip to the Independent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ben Chu for this chart, showing how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory output has gone into reverse in recent months: Kallum Pickering of Berenberg Bank confirms that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sector is in recession again: This is the third time the industrial sector has entered a technical recession since 2008. After sharp declines during the Lehman-recession, in 2011 the sector contracted again for six quarters in a row. He blames weak global demand, and the strength of the pound. Production industries are export oriented and are thus highly sensitive to changes in global demand and exchange rates. Since 2011, goods exports to the EU \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest export market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have fallen by 20%. As this chart shows, industrial export orders are also below long-term averages, and the recent turbulence in the markets won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have helped: David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector is in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclong-term decline\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. He blamed problems at home, and abroad: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite a modest recovery in March, longer-term trends show that both manufacturing and total industrial output remain in negative territory. While adverse global conditions remain a major challenge for manufacturing, this is now being exacerbated by a slowdown in the domestic economy Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news story on the O2 takeover being red-carded. Newsflash from Brussels: The EC has decide to block the \u00c2\u00a310.5bn takeover of mobile phone operator O2. Competition chief Margrethe Vestager has concluded that UK consumers would suffer if CK Hutchison, which already owns the Three network, also got hold of O2. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial sector is back in recession, for the third time in eight years. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial production report shows that production shrank by 0.4% in January-March quarter. That the second quarterly contraction in a row, following steep declines in autumn 2015. We flagged up earlier that Germany, France and the Netherlands had also reported rough industrial production data this week. So with Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing output falling 1.9% in the last year, there are concerns that the European recovery could be in trouble. Ms Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 organisation, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too much in the data to lift economic spirits as a small increase in manufacturing output in March doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t change the picture of an overall weak start to the year. As ever, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a mixed picture across different sectors with a bit more evidence that the sectors hardest hit by the oil price collapse are now bottoming out while construction related sectors seem to be holding up. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But, in line with the early warning signal from the PMI and the drop in consumer confidence, consumer facing sectors, including motor vehicles, are seeing weaker production trends at the start of the year. Whether this proves to be temporary is yet to be seen but UK manufacturers are far from alone in seeing this trend with other data from Europe suggesting that the industrial recovery is far from secure.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This handy chart shows how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial sector fared in the last three months -- not a pretty picture, alas: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report also shows that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing output has shrunk by 0.4% over the last quarter. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pretty rough start to 2016, suggesting that the slowdown in the global economy hurt factories. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight remarks: The march of the makers was a veritable crawl in March and they went backwards over the first quarter! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector has suffered its biggest annual fall in output in almost three years, in another signal that the economy is weakening. Manufacturing output in March this year was 1.9% lower than in March 2015, according to the Office for National Statistics new healthcheck on the sector. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the biggest year-on-year drop since May 2013. The fall was led by a 4% drop in the manufacture of basic metals &amp; metal products. The ONS says that iron and steel production has shrunk particularly sharply over the last year. The largest contribution to the fall within this sub-sector came from the manufacture of basic iron &amp; steel, which decreased by 37.3% compared with a year ago and contributed -0.3 percentage points to total production. Anecdotal evidence suggested shutdowns within the industry were contributing factors to the decrease. That could include the Redcar plant in the North East of England, which closed down last autumn. On a monthly basis, manufacturing output crept up by just 0.1% in March compared to April, weaker than the 0.3% which economists expected. The wider measure of industrial production, which includes mining, rose by 0.3% month-on-month but was only 0.1% higher than a year ago. Another blow to the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcMarch of the Makers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Although, as this chart shows, UK manufacturing has been pretty stagnant for almost 20 years: The boss of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest housebuilder has warned that it could struggle to find workers if the UK leaves the European Union. David Thomas, CEO of Barratt Developments, said this morning: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have a significant part of our labour force, particularly within the London market, coming from continental Europe \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the free movement of labour in the European market is a positive from our point of view.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd FastFT have more details: Oversupply fears are dragging the oil price down again this morning, and helping to push shares down too. Brent crude has shed 1%, to $45.07 per barrel, with traders citing fresh fears about oil gluts. A report from the US Energy Information Administration this afternoon is expected to show that oil stockpiles have risen again, due to weaker demand and persistent overproduction. That situation could worsen again soon as Canadian oil firms are restarting production following the Fort McMurray wildfires, which forced them to stop pumping. Over in Germany, opposition is mounting against the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to stop making \u00e2\u201a\u00ac500 notes. The ECB was already falling out of favour among many Germans, who are cross that record low interest rates are hurting savers. The decision to phase out the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest note has thrown fuel on the fire, with critics claiming there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a secret plan to abolish cash. A protest against the move has been called for this Saturday, as Bloomberg explains: A group called Stoppbargeldverbot -- Stop The Ban on Cash -- affiliated to the insurgent anti-euro Alternative for Germany party, has organized the Frankfurt demonstration for May 14. Its leaders see a creeping effort by the German government, commercial banks, the European Union and the ECB to eliminate cash and to subject citizens to the electronic surveillance of their financial affairs. The ECB says printing of 500-euro notes is being halted because of concerns it facilitates criminal activities. The note will stay legal tender, other denominations will remain and Draghi has said cash will continue to have a role in payments. Nevertheless, Clemens Fuest, president of the Munich-based Ifo institute, argued on May 4 that the decision \u00e2\u20ac\u0153undermines trust\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the central bank. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why should we not press for this decision with the 500-euro note to be revoked?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Max Otte, author of one of several books on the threat to cash published in German in the last 12 months, said in an interview. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The anti-cash lobby is very strong, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also an anti-citizen lobby, an anti-freedom lobby.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Draghi Cast as Cash Conspirator Foreshadows German Clash on Exit Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK industrial production report comes hot on the heels of some poor data from Europe. Yesterday Germany, France and the Netherlands all reported disappointing figures; French factory output fell 0.3%, it was down 1.3% in Germany and an alarming 2.4% in the Netherlands. The figures suggest that eurozone growth may be slipping, after starting the year relatively strongly. European markets are falling in early(ish) trading, as City investors brace for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK industrial production report in an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. Mining shares are up in London, led by Randgold (+2.3%), but banks and travel companies are falling. Conner Campbell of Spreadex reckons yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s burst of optimism over Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout has petered out: The Eurozone has had a pretty fantastic start to the week, the DAX crossing 10000 as investors displayed their relief at the signs of progress in regards to the Greek debt debate. Yet the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s indices have begun to tick back this Wednesday, the DAX and CAC slipping 0.4% and 0.6% respectively. With little on the agenda until Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP data dump, and the post-Eurogroup enthusiasm unable to sustain itself for a third day in arrow, the Eurozone indices may struggle build on their early in the week spurt as the day continues. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After two days of Greek debt drama, today looks rather quieter, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m afraid. Only two items on the agenda, which will show how well (or badly) Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is performing: At 9.30am we get the UK industrial production report for March. Economists are expecting a small rise in industrial output, perhaps 0.3%, after a weak February. A disappointing number, though, will reignite concerns that the UK manufacturers are suffering from weaker overseas demand. And as CMC Market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michael Hewson flags up, the steel industry has been finding life particularly tough, with thousands of jobs now on the line as Tata seeks a buyer for its British plants. We already know from the January and February data that manufacturing has come under pressure in recent months, with the Tata steel headlines keeping it in the forefront of the public\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thinking, while the most recent PMI data has also been weak. Then at 3pm, the NIESR thinktank publishes its estimate for UK growth over the last three months (February to April). That may show that concerns over June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit referendum have hurt the economy. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also be watching for Greek developments, and chewing through results from housebuilder Barratt, brewer Carlsberg, carmaker Toyota and bookmaker William Hill. Hopefully something else will come up too....",

He was also a huge inspiration to many. However, his greatest achievement in life, in fact, his pride and absolute joy, were his two beautiful children that he has left behind: Raphael and Isabella.

                "bodyText":"That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for tonight. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest news story on the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit intervention: Goodnight! GW Mark Carney dire warnings over Brexit didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help the mood in the stock markets today. The FTSE 100 has just closed for the night, down 58 points or almost 1% at 6104. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the lowest level in 5 weeks. Mining stocks are down, led by Anglo American (-6.8%), which usually shows worries about the global economy, along with tech firm ARM (-4%) and pharma group Shire (-3%). Chris Beauchamp, Senior Market Analyst at IG, says: The weakness in London has been broad-based, which should raise warning signs that this is not just a mining-related selloff. Instead, it seems investors are heading for the exits once again, threatening a further unwind of the gains made since mid-February. Over in New York, Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have slid below the $90 mark for the first time since 2014. That means it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth slightly less than Alphabet (parent company of Google). Dean Turner, Economist at UBS Wealth Management, predicts that UK interest rates could be raised before Christmas -- if the Remain campaign wins next month. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With inflation marginally above the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target two-years forward, our long-held belief that market expectations on interest rate hikes are far too pessimistic has been confirmed. Assuming the economy recovers in the second half, we expect to see a UK interest rate rise near the end of 2016 or soon after.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back to the Bank of England, and Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, has a good take on Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit dilemma: The central problem facing the Bank in the event of a Brexit is to balance rising inflation from a weak pound with the downward pressures from a slump in demand. The assumption is that rates will have to rise in the event of a Brexit to stem a run on the pound, but Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suggesting something rather different. His point is sensible \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we may not get the runaway inflation that many are expecting if the shock of Brexit means households stop spending. Moreover, a vote to leave would hit the euro hard, which would offset a decent amount of pound weakness. He also reckons correctly that the impact of lower rates on prices will not be felt instantly, meaning he has time on his hands to cut rates to temper the effects on aggregate demand that a Brexit shock would entail. Effectively he could cut rates immediately after the referendum to support demand, and then look to raise them afterwards if inflation does start to overshoot.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s JP Morgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Stephanie Flanders: This is from the BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business journalist Adam Parsons: We have some sad news to report. Danny Gabay, the respected City economist who founded Fathom Consulting, has passed away at the age of 47. Fathom have issued this statement: Danny, whose funeral took place yesterday, was diagnosed with a particularly aggressive form of brain cancer five and a half years ago. The diagnosis came just before his son Raphael\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second birthday and his wife was seven months pregnant with their daughter, Isabella. In true \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcDanny Gabay spirit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 he wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to take it lying down and fought it, tooth and nail, with dignity and incredible bravery. He defeated all the odds and had four and a half good years after his initial operation. Sadly the tumour returned last summer and appeared again in the last couple of months when he finally succumbed to it. Erik Britton, friend and Co-Director at Fathom Consulting commented: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153His passing is a great loss not only to his family, friends and colleagues, but also to the wider economics community. Fathom Consulting is committed to continuing Danny\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great work and to commemorate his passing will be making a donation to the Marie Curie Hospice in Hampstead where he spent his last few days.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd His sister Dalia added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Danny was a sharp, astutely intelligent, loving and caring individual with an outrageous sense of humour. He was also a huge inspiration to many. However, his greatest achievement in life, in fact, his pride and absolute joy, were his two beautiful children that he has left behind: Raphael and Isabella. My pledge to my brother was to always be there for his children and to never, ever let them forget what a wonderful father, husband, son, brother, uncle, nephew, cousin and friend he was to all who met him.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Danny had an impressive career, advising government ministers in his early 20s before moving to the Bank of England, and later JP Morgan, before founding Fathom. Simon Kennedy of Bloomberg tweets: City grandee Lord Paul Myners, who was a government minister during the 2008 financial crisis, has welcomed Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments: Myners (a Remain supporter), says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Governor of the Bank of England could not be clearer: leaving the EU would lead to lower growth and a plummeting pound. It is a risk we cannot afford to take. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The evidence is now overwhelming that staying in Europe will mean more jobs, lower prices and more financial security for British families.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lord Lamont, who was chancellor of the UK from 1990 to 1993, has blasted Mark Carney for his Brexit comments. In a statement just released, Lamont suggests Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remarks could spook the economy: The Governor should be careful that he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cause a crisis. If his unwise words become self-fulfilling, the responsibility will be the Governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and the Governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alone. A prudent Governor would simply have said that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we are prepared for all eventualities\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThere are huge opportunities for the UK outside the EU. We are a strong economy and can stand on our own two feet like all other modern, independent countries.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Lamont, who is campaigning for Britain to leave the EU, knows a thing or two about crises. He was running the Treasury during Black Wednesday in 1992, when Britain crashed out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. A young David Cameron was an advisor, as this famous photo shows: The Institute of Directors is urging businesses to listen to Mark Carney. James Sproule, the IoD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Bank of England has highlighted its concerns over the impact the referendum is having on business, and the even greater impact that it could still have on the economy. No matter what they eventually decide, every business in Britain should be giving very serious consideration to the concerns the Bank articulates.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The editor of the FT, Lionel Barber, tweets that the BoE governor has given up being impartial: Rain Newton-Smith, CBI Economics Director, has welcomed Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The evidence that a vote to leave the EU would make a serious dent in our economy, jobs and prosperity is overwhelming and still growing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The continued lack of a realistic argument on how the UK economy would be better off outside the EU is revealing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If a different conclusion could be credibly shown, leave campaigners would have done so by now with fewer than 50 days before the vote.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Iain Duncan Smith, the pro-Brexit former Work and Pensions secretary, has dismissed the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns: We had expected some comments on Brexit today, but the Bank of England has gone rather further than expected. By saying that voting to leaving the EU could prompt a recession, Mark Carney has handed the government another weapon against the Brexit campaign. He predicted a material slowdown in growth and a notable increase in inflation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Of course there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a range of possible scenarios around those directions, which could possibly include a technical recession.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carney also revealed that he gets buttonholed about Brexit, a lot. This issue is the number one issue that is raised with me and my colleagues every time we meet another central banker, a finance minister, the head of a major corporation, and most small business owners. Such comments are going to fuel criticism that the Bank of England is failing to be independent and impartial. Carney denied this, saying: It is a judgement not based on a whim... It is the judgement of the independent MPC and it is the judgement of all members of the MPC. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also reminded us that central bankers cannot be expected to solve every crisis -- monetary policy is not unlimited, and its effects are not instantaneous. As he put it: There are limits, however, to what monetary policy can deliver... monetary policy cannot immediately offset all the effects of a shock.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Final question. Q: Vote Leave\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official position is that Britain would leave the single market; is that a worry? Carney says there would be implications for the level of financial service activity in the UK if we had a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWTO relationship\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with the EU. [I think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpassporting\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 arrangements that currently allow banks to base in London and then offer financial services across the EU] Carney also admits that the Bank can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be sure how the underlying economy is performing, because of the uncertainty created by the Brexit vote. Q: Should the Bank of England really be changing its schedule to only hold eight meetings a year, not 12, given the threats to the economy? Carney says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a problem. We could meet anytime, if needed, he says, indeed the MPC could hold a meeting right now! Q: Will the Bank be announcing further measures to protect the economy around the referendum vote? Never say never, Carney replies. But we learned with Scotland that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best to release liquidity facilities well in advance, so people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re signalling potential threats. The bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PRA (Prudential Regulatory Authority) is also working with financial firms to ensure they are taking precautions. Q: How long would it take for the uncertainty over the EU referendum to fade? Deputy governor Ben Broadbent says that the Bank has done some work on this. It believes that the uncertainty should fade relatively quickly, as we know exactly when the vote takes place. But it still believes the effects could still be felt early into next year, even if Remain win. Carney pledges there will be no shortage of liquidity for banks if Britain votes to leave the EU. Q: Isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t this more Project Fear? Why has the Bank not considered the benefits from Brexit, such as a cheaper pound helping exports and less regulation? Carney reiterates that the Bank is just following its mandate by explaining its concerns about the EU referendum. Q: Are you saying that the Bank would be powerless to stop Britain falling into recession? Monetary policy has a lag, so if there is a sharp drop in activity from any event it takes time for stimulus to feed through and cushion that demand, Carney replies. (That sounds like a yes). He also points out that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not automatically clear whether the Bank would raise or lower interest rates in the event of a Brexit vote. Q: Did the MPC discuss the impact that a Leave vote would have on the international markets and the global economy? There is a risk of a spillover to the international markets from the uncertainty around the EU referendum, Carney responds. He then says that almost everyone he meets wants to talk about Brexit: This issue is the number 1 issue that is raised with me and my colleagues every time we meet another central banker, finance ministers, the head of a major corporation, and most small business owners. Q: What tools could the Bank use to stimulate the economy if it suffered a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsudden stop\u00e2\u20ac\u2122? Our judgement is that we can lower interest rates further, before turning to unconventional measures, says Mark Carney. Those unconventional measures include quantitative easing (buying government bonds from banks with newly created money), and credit easing. Deputy governor Minouche Shafit then explains that the Bank is holding three liquidity auctions around the referendum date, to ensure banks don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t run short of cash. There are also \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcswap lines\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with other central banks, which could be used to get more foreign currency into the system if needed. Q: Is George Osborne right to say that the Bank is warning that Brexit would be a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclose-lose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for Britain? Carney declines to comment on the chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweet (see earlier), saying Osborne answers for himself. The Bank is just trying to outline its views on the economy, and explain how it might react. Q: Can you give more detail about how the pound would fall after a Brexit vote, and would it bounce back? Deputy governor Ben Broadbent says the Bank hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t made any numerical forecasts about Brexit, including for the exchange rate. But the prospect of Britain leaving the EU has had a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdampening effect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on sterling already. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a wide range of factors, Broadbent says, making it very hard to make forecasts. If there were changes to tariffs, that could have a long-term impact on the pound. While if the risk-premium on UK assets rose, sterling could \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcovershoot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the short term. Q: Your comments on Brexit go much further than during the Scottish independence compaign - why, and why today? Carney defends his comments - the EU referendum is the biggest domestic risk to the UK, so the MPC has a duty to talk about how it would respond. We have to communicate those risks - it would be a political decision if our views were suppressed. During the Scottish referendum campaign, the Bank was mainly concerned with the impact of banks moving their headquarters from Scotland to London. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re talking about it today because the quarterly inflation report is being published. A technical recession means two quarters of negative growth, so Carney appears to be suggesting that the UK could contract through the second half of this year if the Leave campaign wins June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum. Onto questions, and the BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kamal Ahmed grabs the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcelephant in the room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by the ears: Q: Can you rule out Britain falling into recession if we vote to leave EU? Mark Carney says the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central forecast is based on the conclusion that Britain remains in the EU, and that the uncertainty over the vote dissipates fairly quickly If there were a vote to leave, there would be a material impact on growth and demand, and unemployment. We are trying to explain how we would react to that. Q: Does \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmaterially lower growth mean recession? Carney says there are a range of views contained within the forecasts, and then admits that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it could possibly include a technical recession\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Carney concludes his statement by saying that the people of Britain will make a significant decision on June 23, and they will consider a much wider range of issues than just monetary policy. Whatever the public decides, the MPC will address the consequences for growth and inflation. But there are limits to what monetary policy can do. The Bank cannot offset the full impact of a Brexit vote. The EU referendum is the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcelephant in the room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, says Mark Carney. He warns that it is making it hard for the Bank to read the current economic data . There is a risk that we could be over, or under-estimating the underlying momentum in the economy in the event that Britain remains in the EU says Carney. A vote for Brexit would have a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153material\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd impact on the economy, he says. Mark Carney begins the press conference with some history - reminding us that the UK recovery began three years ago, making Britain the fastest growing G7 country. But growth has slowed at the start of this year, and appears to be decelerating further This reflects the EU referendum, Carney declares, which has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pushed up uncertainty measures to levels not seen since the eurozone crisis.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He cites the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conclusion that Brexit fears are responsible for half of the fall in pound since November. The Bank of England is giving a press conference on the inflation report right now. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being streamed online here. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Katie Allen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news story on the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning: This chart, from the inflation report, shows how the pound has slumped by 9% in the last six months - partly due to the EU vote. The report is online here. This looks like the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most significant intervention yet in the EU referendum debate. As well as warning about the impact on unemployment and growth, the BoE has also admitted that it will face a tricky balancing act whether to cut or raise interest rates in the event of Brexit. From the Bank, my colleague Katie Allen reports: A vote to leave the EU risks sending the pound sharply lower, stoking inflation, raising unemployment and denting economic growth, the Bank as England warned as its policymakers voted unanimously to keep interest rates at their record low. Describing the 23 June referendum on EU membership as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the most immediate and significant risk\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic outlook, the central bank said it would face a difficult balancing act in deciding whether to cut, hold or raise interest rates in the aftermath of a vote to leave the bloc. Updating financial markets against the backdrop of tight opinion polls, the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policymakers warned that in the event of a so-called Brexit they would have to react to opposing forces of lower growth and higher inflation because a fall in sterling would raise import prices. Publishing a swathe of documents, including minutes to the latest rate-setting meeting and new quarterly forecasts, the Bank made its most forthright remarks yet on the possible impact of a leave vote. With the referendum clouding the economic outlook and weighing on business confidence, the Monetary Policy Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (MPC) nine members all voted to leave rates at 0.5%. The minutes revealed the MPC discussed the implications of both a vote to remain in the EU \u00e2\u20ac\u201c currently seen as the more likely outcome based on polls \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and a vote to leave. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A vote to leave the European Union could materially affect the outlook for output and inflation. In the face of greater uncertainty about the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading relationships, sterling was likely to depreciate further, perhaps sharply. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In addition, households could defer consumption and firms could delay investment decisions, lowering labour demand and increasing unemployment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Bank noted the pound had already depreciated 9% since a November peak and that half of that was down to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153risks associated with a vote to leave the European Union\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The prime minister is also tweeting: Chancellor George Osborne has swiftly responded to the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns about Brexit, arguing it bolsters the Remain campaign. The Bank of England has reiterated its worries about Britain leaving the European Union. In the minutes of this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, it says that the risk of Brexit is already hurting the economy: There are increasing signs that uncertainty associated with the EU referendum has begun to weigh on activity. And the BoE fears that the economy could suffer a stark shock if Britain votes to leave the European Union on June 23, which could drive unemployment up. A vote to leave the EU could materially alter the outlook for output and inflation, and therefore the appropriate setting of monetary policy. Households could defer consumption and firms delay investment, lowering labour demand and causing unemployment to rise. The minutes are online here. As feared, the Bank of England has also cut its growth forecasts. It now expects the UK to grow by 2.0% this year. That is a downgrade compared to February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts, when it expected growth of 2.2%. Here we go! The Bank of England has voted 9-0 to leave interest rates at their current record low of 0.5%. Just 10 minutes to go until the Bank of England announces its interest rate decision, and publishes the quarterly inflation report. Economist Mark Astley, who used to work at the BoE, reckons dovish MPC members are unlikely to actually vote to cut rates. Mark Carney won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to avoid talking about the EU referendum at his 12.30pm press conference, predicts Peter Rosenstreich, head of market strategy at Swissquote Bank. Concerning the press conference, questions will be geared towards the BoE view on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Carney will be undoubtedly prepared for this and will tread cautiously over every neutral, unbiased response. This minefield should generate pound volatility but nothing lasting, barring Carney going rogue. The focus of the inflation report will be the extent of the BoE adjustment of forecasts and contingency plans after the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd vote. We expect that any mention of the event will be limited due to the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s effort to appear neutral. Yet, it will be difficult for BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcs Carney to stay balanced as his prior views suggest that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd poses a massive economic risk to the UK. Rosenstreich also predicts that the MPC will vote 9-0 to leave interest rates unchanged. City AM have written a handy Super Thursday checklist, here. Basically, we should watch out for: A rate hike (Spoiler alert: this won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen) Whether the decision is unanimous -- some economists predict one, or even two, votes for a rate cut New forecasts - including a likely downgrade to 2016 growth from 2.2% to 2% Messages to the market: perhaps a hint that rates will rise faster than investors expect (a trick the Bank tried back in 2014) Any Brexit comments from Mark Carney - he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to say anything overtly political, but can hardly ignore June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote Mark Carney will probably also be quizzed about the UK housing market today. A new report shows that the average London house price has virtually doubled since 2009, to an eye-watering \u00c2\u00a3600,000. House prices in the capital are rising by 11%, outpacing the rest of the UK. And astonishingly, an old garage in Hammersmith was just auctioned for \u00c2\u00a3466,000 - possibly to someone planning to build the house of their dreams. Two years ago, Carney said rising house prices were the biggest risk to the recovery, and he recently hinted that the Bank could rein in buy-to-let lending. However, there are also signs that the market is cooling. LSL, which owns Your Move and Reeds Rains estate agents, says it handled 20,000 fewer sales in April, as demand dropped in the weeks after the introduction of higher stamp duty for buyers of second homes and investment properties. Every City economist polled in the run-up to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting expects the Bank of England to leave interest rates on hold. Borrowing costs have been pegged at 0.5% since March 2009, so the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrate hike\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 button is looking pretty dusty: European stock markets have fallen in early trading as economic growth fears swirl through the City. The FTSE 100 has dropped by 46 points, or 0.75%, to 6115 points, and there are heavier losses in Paris and Frankfurt. Traders are expecting a gloomy Super Thursday, once the Bank of England releases its quarterly inflation forecast and decision on interest rates. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explains why: Whilst rates will inevitably remain unchanged the focus will be on whether any of the 9 Monetary Policy Committee members vote for a cut this afternoon, with Andy Haldane and Gertjan Vlieghe the likeliest candidates for a walk on the dovish side. Beyond the headline rate vote the central bank will reveal its revised forecasts for the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth, and things don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look pretty. Following on from the weak Q1 GDP estimate [0.4%], the limp growth figures revealed by NIESR yesterday, and the sickly showing from the manufacturing and industrial sectors over the last few months, it is likely that the BoE will slash expectations for 2016 to 2% from 2.2%. The Brexit question will dominate the agenda at the Bank of England today, predict Bloomberg. They write: The pre-vote nerves are manifesting themselves in the pound. A gauge of hedging for sterling losses versus the dollar climbed to the highest since 2003. While sterling has recovered from the seven-year low against greenback that it reached in February, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still the worst-performing Group-of-10 currency in 2016. This chart shows that many investors have been buying protection against the pound tumbling against the US dollar: Governor Mark Carney will endure a tricky press conference today, predicts Sam Hill of RBC Capital Markets. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the looming Brexit vote will have a massive impact on interest rates. Hill explains: Essentially, neither Governor Carney, nor the MPC collectively, are likely to want to be drawn into issuing a significantly new or decisive message about the future path of monetary policy at this stage, if they believe the optimal path for rates (and asset purchases) is dependent on which way the vote goes Hill also predicts that the BoE will raise its inflation forecasts. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the oil price has recently recovered, the pound has weakened, and the markets expect interest rates to be lower for even longer (as this chart shows): City economists are adamant that the Bank of England will leave interest rates unchanged today: But there is chatter that at least one policymaker will vote for a cut. The most likely doves are chief economist Andy Haldane, and former hedge fund economist Gertjan Vlieghe. Good morning. All eyes are on the Bank of England this morning, as the UK central bank holds its latest Super Thursday. The BoE will publish its quarterly Inflation Report \u00e2\u20ac\u201c its assessment of the UK economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at noon, and City experts predict it will cut its growth forecasts quite sharply. With British industry falling back into recession yesterday, the Bank will likely conclude that its previous forecasts were too optimistic. Previously, it expected the economy to expand by 2.2% during 2016; that could be lowered to 2%. The big issue looming over the UK economy, of course, is June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum. The most recent economic data has shown that the possibility of Brexit has hurt confidence, and made firms put spending decisions on ice. So, the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economists will have tried to calculate the impact on growth and inflation. Governor Mark Carney faces a grilling from the press from 12.30pm BST. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll surely quiz him about the referendum, and what preparations being made in case the UK votes to leave the EU. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Monetary Policy Committee will also vote on whether to move interest rates today. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not impossible that some MPC members will push to CUT borrowing costs to fresh record lows. That would be a serious signal that all isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t well in the UK economy. Most, though, will surely want to leave rates at 0.5%, at least until the EU vote is out of the way. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll track all the action at the Bank, and other events through the day....",

                "bodyText":"A vote to leave the EU next month could precipitate a stock market crash and steep fall in house prices, the International Monetary Fund has warned. Christine Lagarde, the IMF managing director, also backed warnings from the Bank of England governor Mark Carney that Britain could fall into recession following a Brexit vote. Lagarde, who was in London on Friday to present the fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual health check on the UK economy, said it was possible the economy would shrink in two consecutive quarters, which is the definition of a recession. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have looked at all the scenarios. We have done our homework and we haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t found anything positive to say about a Brexit vote,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. The IMF said a panic among investors would trigger shockwaves throughout the economy following a vote to leave, sending shares and property prices into downward spiral. In a report that is clearly helpful to campaigners for Britain to remain in the EU, the it said that even over the longer term growth would be depressed. Vote Leave reacted angrily to the findings, which it said were part of a plan by the government \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to circumvent purdah rules by using the IMF, which is funded by the EU and the UK government\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The Brexit campaign accused the Washington-based organisation of being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153consistently wrong about its forecasts for the UK economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and said it was wrong again on Britain leaving the EU. It also attacked Lagarde\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation saying it was sullied by criminal allegations of negligence over \u00e2\u201a\u00ac400m (\u00c2\u00a3314m) of payments in the Bernard Tapie affair, dating back to when she was French finance minister. The Tory MP Priti Patel said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The IMF warned Britain it was playing with fire when it set out a plan to deal with the deficit. Now our economy is stronger than nearly every other major economy. Today, the IMF is talking down Britain because we want to take back control from Brussels. They were wrong then and they are wrong now. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The EU-funded IMF should not interfere in our democratic debate weeks before polling day. It appears the chancellor is cashing in favours to Ms Lagarde in order to encourage the IMF to bully the British people \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is a sign of the desperation in the in campaign.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning was coupled with a prediction that a vote to remain in the EU would spur a rebound in growth in the second half of the year, ending more than 12 months of stagnant output and falling business confidence. But it painted a gloomy picture of the potential fallout from a vote to leave. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Markets may anticipate such adverse economic effects. This could entail sharp drops in equity and house prices, increased borrowing costs for households and businesses, and even a sudden stop of investment inflows into key sectors such as commercial real estate and finance,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record-high current account deficit and attendant reliance on external financing exacerbates these risks. Such market reactions could sharply contract economic activity, further depressing asset prices in a self-reinforcing cycle.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lagarde said countries across the whole world were concerned about the impact of a UK vote to leave the EU on their own economies and the global situation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a country I have visited in the last six months that hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t asked me what we think the impact of Brexit will be,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. She said there was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153huge amount of anxiety\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that made it legitimate for the IMF to carry out an assessment of the risks. Lagarde added that the timing of the report was not significant and fitted with publishing a detailed analysis of the UK economy before the IMF board meeting in the autumn. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are not doing it out of politics,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That is not how the IMF works.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The IMF said there would only be a limited boost for net exports caused by an abrupt sterling depreciation and this would only partly offset the hit to GDP from reduced consumption and investment. The report added that inflation could also rise well above the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target at some point. Seema Malhotra MP, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said a series of economic reports showed it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vital for our security and prosperity that we vote to remain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a broad consensus that walking away from Europe will hit the British economy hard and that it will be costly for British families and businesses. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the message from international bodies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the IMF and the OECD and from the Treasury and the CBI. The employer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s organisation says there would be nearly a million lost jobs. The Treasury says that over 10 years the cost per family could be \u00c2\u00a34,300.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The IMF said a vote to stay would benefit the economy after a turbulent few months which have seen sterling fall by 8% and wages growth slow. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the event of a vote to remain in the EU, growth is expected to rebound during the second half of the year,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As anticipated, the slower first half, and some lingering referendum-related effects, mean that growth is likely to fall below 2% for the full year 2016, before returning to an average of around 2.25% over the medium term, roughly in line with potential. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Inflation, which is currently only 0.5%, is expected to revert to target gradually, as effects from commodity price falls dissipate and low unemployment helps push up wages.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd",

Athens says that if activated, the contingency measures will not hurt the poor. </p> <p>Passing the reforms before the Eurogroup meeting on May 24, is a demand of international lenders to wrap up the review which will unlock the next tranche of funds that Athens will use to pay IMF loans, state arrears and ECB bonds maturing in July.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5739da8ee4b0ac0aa28f50d6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-16T14:50:13.664Z\">3.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Wall Street is moving higher, helped by the Apple news, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average currently 101 points or 0.58% higher.</p> <p>Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There was one very clear source of growth for the Dow Jones this afternoon, and it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the latest US economic data. The Empire State manufacturing index, the only notable number on the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agenda, vastly underperformed expectations, plunging from a 14 month high of 9.6 to a 3 month nadir of -9.0.</p> <p>Yet news that Warren Buffett\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Berkshire Hathaway took a $1 billion stake in Apple during its (miserable) first quarter helped lift the tech company by over 2.5%. As is the weight of Apple this upwards shift more than compensated for the weak manufacturing figure and, alongside the oil-inspired gains for the likes of ExxonMobil and Chevron, ensured the Dow opened nearly 90 points higher after the bell.</p> <p>The FTSE couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get anywhere near that level of growth as the day went on.

A number of fund managers have been making positive noises on the iPhone maker:</p> <p>Thomas Fitzgerald at EdenTree Investment Management said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price has fallen about 28% from 2015\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s February peak on uncertainty over the future growth of iPhones, which accounts for 66% of sales. Beyond these near-term concerns, the anticipated launch of iPhone 7 will create fresh opportunity to take further market share. There is also still a large upgrade opportunity within its existing installed base \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with only 40% of iPhone users upgraded to the new generation 6 or 6S models. </p> <p>Continued strong cash generation and its balance sheet fortress will continue to support the Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s design and development over the long term. As a result, we believe shares are attractively valued at current levels. The company is also making significant progress towards a higher recurring, subscription-led revenue model through the launch of Internet and entertainment services, such as cloud storage, Apple Music and Apple TV. This could drive greater earnings visibility and potentially stronger profitability in future years.</p> </blockquote> <p>And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Geir Lode, Head of Hermes Global Equities and manager of the Hermes Global Equity Fund:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Apple share price has been undergoing some recent volatility, but we remain supporters of the stock. People tend to get hung up on things like new products and how many it is selling, and when it will disclose numbers, but we think you need to take a broader, longer-term view.</p> <p>There is work to be done in product transitioning in the US and Europe, but if you look at the quality of its product lines versus the competition and the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enormous cash pile, we believe Apple remains in a very strong market position.</p> </blockquote> <p>But Josh Spencer, manager of the T. Rowe Price Global Technology Equity Fund, is less convinced about the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth prospects:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We own a very small position in Apple, as like many others, we find the company and its products appealing. However, we are seeing signs the smartphone industry is starting to mature and Apple is trying to reinvent itself and come up with other ideas to generate revenue.</p> <p>Its recent share price fall has certainly made Apple appear more attractive, but also important to keep in mind the size of the company. At a market cap of more than $500bn, it is quite difficult to continue to compound from here. We are currently seeing more compelling opportunities to generate returns in the tech sector in areas such as cloud computing.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5739cfcde4b05be498d5f914\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-16T13:49:45.631Z\">2.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Apple shares jump after Buffett takes stake</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Apple has now reclaimed the title of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcworld\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most valuable company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from Alphabet, Reuters says.</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5739ce2fe4b0ac0aa28f50ad\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-16T13:45:12.897Z\">2.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Ding ding....

                "bodyText":"News that Warren Buffett had bought a stake in Apple has helped lift US markets, but Europe has turned in a more mixed performance. The FTSE 100 has edged higher as commodity companies benefited from a bounce in metal prices including copper, which followed some weakness in the dollar. Markets were also supported by a rise in the oil price, after an interruption to supplies from Nigeria and a Goldman Sachs forecast that crude would reach $50 for the rest of the year. But with the German market closed, there was little to enthuse investors elsewhere on the continent. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 added 12.90 points or 0.21% to 6151.40 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.18% at 4312.28 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB finished up 0.04% at 17,737.02 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 0.45% lower at 8682.1 In Greece, the Athens market was down 0.35% at 620.5 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 153 points or 0.88% higher. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Brent crude continues to hover close to the $50 a barrel market, currently up 2.55% at $49.05 having earlier climbed as high as $49.47. It is at its highest levels for around six months. More on the Greek vote this weekend, courtesy Reuters: Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parliament will vote on a new package of tax hikes and reforms demanded by its international lenders on Sunday, two days before euro zone finance ministers assess whether Athens qualifies for much-needed bailout loans. The bill would increase value added tax by 1 percentage point to 24 percent, raise tax on fuel, tobacco and alcohol, liberalise the sale of banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 non-performing loans and detail the set-up a new privatisation fund, government officials said. It will also include details on a contingency mechanism to impose tighter austerity measures, which will be activated only if Greece misses its fiscal targets, the officials said on Monday. The vote is expected to test Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 left-led government, which has a thin majority of 153 lawmakers in the 300-seat parliament. Athens says that if activated, the contingency measures will not hurt the poor. Passing the reforms before the Eurogroup meeting on May 24, is a demand of international lenders to wrap up the review which will unlock the next tranche of funds that Athens will use to pay IMF loans, state arrears and ECB bonds maturing in July. Wall Street is moving higher, helped by the Apple news, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average currently 101 points or 0.58% higher. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: There was one very clear source of growth for the Dow Jones this afternoon, and it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the latest US economic data. The Empire State manufacturing index, the only notable number on the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agenda, vastly underperformed expectations, plunging from a 14 month high of 9.6 to a 3 month nadir of -9.0. Yet news that Warren Buffett\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Berkshire Hathaway took a $1 billion stake in Apple during its (miserable) first quarter helped lift the tech company by over 2.5%. As is the weight of Apple this upwards shift more than compensated for the weak manufacturing figure and, alongside the oil-inspired gains for the likes of ExxonMobil and Chevron, ensured the Dow opened nearly 90 points higher after the bell. The FTSE couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get anywhere near that level of growth as the day went on. Yet with Brent Crude crossing $49 per barrel for the first time since in 6 months, and its miners led on a merry-romp by the jubilant Lonmin, the FTSE finally managed to eke out a 5 point rise as the afternoon wore on. Over in Greece, reports of new votes in parliament ahead of the next Eurogroup meeting: Warren Buffett is not the only one keen on Apple. A number of fund managers have been making positive noises on the iPhone maker: Thomas Fitzgerald at EdenTree Investment Management said: Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price has fallen about 28% from 2015\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s February peak on uncertainty over the future growth of iPhones, which accounts for 66% of sales. Beyond these near-term concerns, the anticipated launch of iPhone 7 will create fresh opportunity to take further market share. There is also still a large upgrade opportunity within its existing installed base \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with only 40% of iPhone users upgraded to the new generation 6 or 6S models. Continued strong cash generation and its balance sheet fortress will continue to support the Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s design and development over the long term. As a result, we believe shares are attractively valued at current levels. The company is also making significant progress towards a higher recurring, subscription-led revenue model through the launch of Internet and entertainment services, such as cloud storage, Apple Music and Apple TV. This could drive greater earnings visibility and potentially stronger profitability in future years. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Geir Lode, Head of Hermes Global Equities and manager of the Hermes Global Equity Fund: The Apple share price has been undergoing some recent volatility, but we remain supporters of the stock. People tend to get hung up on things like new products and how many it is selling, and when it will disclose numbers, but we think you need to take a broader, longer-term view. There is work to be done in product transitioning in the US and Europe, but if you look at the quality of its product lines versus the competition and the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enormous cash pile, we believe Apple remains in a very strong market position. But Josh Spencer, manager of the T. Rowe Price Global Technology Equity Fund, is less convinced about the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth prospects: We own a very small position in Apple, as like many others, we find the company and its products appealing. However, we are seeing signs the smartphone industry is starting to mature and Apple is trying to reinvent itself and come up with other ideas to generate revenue. Its recent share price fall has certainly made Apple appear more attractive, but also important to keep in mind the size of the company. At a market cap of more than $500bn, it is quite difficult to continue to compound from here. We are currently seeing more compelling opportunities to generate returns in the tech sector in areas such as cloud computing. Apple has now reclaimed the title of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcworld\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most valuable company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from Alphabet, Reuters says. Ding ding.... Wall Street is open. Apple has jumped to the top of the Dow Jones risers, following the news that Berkshire Hathaway has taken a $1bn stake. Another day, another warning against Brexit from the Bank of England. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s message comes from deputy governor Andrew Bailey, who has told City executives that Britain could lose its status as an international financial sector if the UK leaves the EU. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because banks from outside Europe can currently base themselves in the capital, and then offer financial services more easily across the bloc. He was speaking at a Financial Regulation Summit organised by Reuters, so over to them for the details: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need a banking system to support the domestic economy but I am afraid we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a God-given right to have anything in terms of international. That decision will be taken by many actors over time,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bailey said. The EU provides rules for banks, insurers and asset managers that provide a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153passport\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for them to operate freely across the bloc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s single market. This includes banks from outside Europe,such as the United States and Asia. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What matters to them a lot is having the passport. If you are a non-EU firm operating in London, then having the passport is important,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bailey said. New economic data out of America has reinforced concerns that economic growth is stumbling. The Empire State manufacturing index, which tracks factory output in the New York region, has lurched to -9.02 this month. Many firms reported a drop in new orders, pulling the index down. Economists expected a reading of +6.5%. Warren Buffett is probably nursing a chunky loss on the Apple shares, given he bought them between 1 January and 31 March. The FT points out: Shares in the technology giant have fallen by more than 19 per cent since mid-April after it disclosed its first quarterly revenue fall in 13 years and its first decline in iPhone sales. Bruce Kasman, chief economist at JPMorgan Chase, predicts that the oil price will be quite subdued over the next year. Up they go.... Billionaire investor Warren Buffett hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lost faith in Apple, despite the recent drop in its share price. Buffett\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Berkshire Hathaway group has just revealed it took a new stake in the tech firm in the first quarter of 2016, worth around $1bn. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a welcome boost to Apple CEO Tim Cook, after his company lost its title of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most valuable company to Alphabet (parent company of Google) last week. One for technical chartists in the audience: (basically, the oil price has surged to a point where you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect it to fall back. But if it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, then it might \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbreak out\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and continue to rise #chartism ) Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more detail from the Goldman Sach\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil report that has sent crude prices soaring to a six-month high today. This chart suggests that the oil market has dramatically rebalanced in recent weeks, due to declining production and a surge in demand: Goldman reckons that demand has picked up in Asia: Stronger vehicle sales, activity and a bigger harvest are leading us to raise our Indian and Russia demand forecasts for the year. And while we are reducing our US and EU forecasts on the combination of weaker activity and higher prices than previously assumed, we are raising our China demand forecasts to reflect the expected support from the recent transient stimulus. The headline news is that Goldman now believes the oil market has lurched back into deficit this quarter, earlier than expected. However, the firm also believes we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be facing a surplus again in 2017: And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because oil nations will probably keep boosting production: Goldman says: Low-cost producers will continue to drive production growth in the New Oil Order \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with growth driven by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iran, the UAE and Russia. Second, non-OPEC producers had mostly budgeted such price levels and there remains a pipeline of already sanctioned non-OPEC projects. In fact, we see risks to our production forecasts as skewed to the upside as we remain conservative on Saudi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ineluctable ramp up and Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery. Brexit could also send UK house prices tumbling, Fitch suggests today. Bad news for home owners, but possibly a boost to younger renters \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if they aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hit by other side-effects..... Fitch has also pointed out that some British firms might benefit if the UK quits the European Union, weakening the pound. The rating agency says: For the corporate sector, the leave scenarios could have mixed effects, depending on sector. UK exporters would benefit from improved price competitiveness, due to sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s depreciation. However... UK companies with significant foreign currency debt would face servicing issues. UK airlines could be significantly affected by sterling depreciation due to their foreign currency cost base. So perhaps it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no surprise that budget airline Ryanair opposes Brexit. It just wheeled out a Boeing 737 with a Remain campaign slogan painted on the fuselage, for a press conference with chancellor George Osborne today. Rating agency Fitch has just warned that European economies could be disrupted if Britain votes to leave the EU. In a new report, Fitch warns that the populist parties across the region would get a boost if the UK public decide to quit. And that could drive up the borrowing costs of weaker members - possibly sparking a repeat of the 2012 eurozone debt crisis \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if investors begin to fear that countries will quit the euro. They say: Brexit would create a precedent for countries leaving the EU. It could boost anti-EU or other populist political parties, and make EU leaders more reluctant to implement unpopular policies with long-term economic benefits. Negotiating the terms of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit could exhaust the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time and energy and open up new fronts of disagreement. Brexit could shift the centre of gravity of the EU, making it more dominated by the eurozone core, poorer, more protectionist and less economically liberal. If the UK were to thrive outside of the EU, it might encourage other countries to follow suit. Fitch points out that the banking sectors of Ireland, Malta, Luxembourg, Spain, France and Germany all have sizeable links to the UK. The EU could also be a poorer place without Britain: Brexit would reduce the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contribution to the EU budget (a net \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7.1bn in 2014 after rebates), potentially to zero. This would imply that other net contributors would have to increase payments, or net recipients accept lower EU expenditure. Fitch: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBrexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Would Increase Downside Risks to EU Sovereigns Morgan Stanley agrees with Goldman Sachs: This chart explains very clearly why Goldman has reversed its position on the oil market. It shows the various incidents that have disrupted oil supply recently, and their likely impact on supply during the rest of 2016. Reuters is reporting that the Nigerian authorities have apprehended members of a group behind recent attacks on its oil pipelines: The Nigerian army has arrested several people suspected of having been involved in a recent wave of attacks on pipelines in the restive Delta region, a military source said on Monday. Nigerian newspapers reported that the army had arrested several members of a militant group called Niger Delta Avengers which has claimed a string of attacks in the southern swamps. Those attacks have knocked Nigeria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil output down to its lowest level in decades; one reason that the oil market is now in deficit, according to Goldman. More UK business chiefs are cutting back on investment ahead of the EU referendum next month. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to a survey conducted by Credit Suisse that found little enthusiasm for Brexit: Although mining companies are rallying this morning, other sectors are in retreat. Big name companies like BT, Barclays, ITV and Unilever have all lost at least 1.3%. And traders are blaming persistent worries about the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum next month. Overnight, the CBI has cut its growth forecasts for the UK this year to 2%, down fdrom 2.3%, partly due to Brexit concerns. CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn warned that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A dark cloud of uncertainty is looming over global growth, particularly around weakening emerging markets and the outcome of the EU referendum, which is chilling some firms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 plans to invest.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Those disappointing Chinese retail sales, industrial production and investment figures released on Saturday aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helping the mood either. Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct says: Losses are broad based with some mixed economic data out of China over the weekend and ongoing fears over the risk of the UK voting to leave the EU at the end of next month both weighing. Shares in BP and Royal Dutch Shell have risen by around 0.8% this morning, following the jump in the oil price. Goldman is also predicting that the oil market will remain in deficit until the end of the year. However, it would then return to oversupply in 2017: If they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re right, that suggests prices may not rise too dramatically from current levels. Brent crude oil is bobbing around a six-month high, as traders digest Goldman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that the market is now in deficit: The oil price has jumped this morning after Goldman Sachs declared that the long run of oversupply was coming to an end. In a new report, the Wall Street firm argues that the oil market has actually flipped into deficit, due to various supply disruptions. That would end a two-year run of oversupply that pushed crude prices down to 13-year lows at the start of 2016. Goldman writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The oil market has gone from nearing storage saturation to being in deficit much earlier than we expected.... The market likely shifted into deficit in May ... driven by both sustained strong demand as well as sharply declining production.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Goldman has also hikes its US crude price forecast to $50 a barrel for the second half of 2016, from a $45 estimate in March. That has send US crude jumping by 1.5% in early trading, to $46.92 per barrel. Brent crude (sourced from the North Sea) is also up 1.5% to $48.55 per barrel. The wildfires that struck Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fort McMurray were the most newsworthy reason that production levels have fallen recently. Other factors include disruption in Nigeria, where pipelines have been sabotaged, and the swathe of US shale producers who have halted drilling since prices fell. Ands that means the market will stay in deficit through the second half of this year, according to Goldman anyway. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the global economy, the eurozone and business. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a definite Monday morning feeling in the City today. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main stock markets have opened in the red, following some disappointing Chinese economic data over the weekend. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory output missed forecasts in April, growing by 6% versus expectations of 6.5%. Investment and retail sales also grew more slowly than expected last month, which is giving investors another reason to worry about its economy. Commerzbank economist Zhou Hao summed up the mood: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing that growth engines are losing momentum, and the growth outlook has turned soft as well. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear the government wants to manage down or re-anchor market expectation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pushed markets down in early trading: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE: 6108, down 29 points French CAC: 4289, down 30 points (Germany is closed for Whit Monday or Pentecost Monday). We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day. That will include any developments around Greece \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with just seven days to go until finance ministers to (hopefully) conclude the Greek bailout review.",

We understand that one (or even two) swallow(s) don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make a summer. But the latest round of data was as good as it gets. Second quarter 2016 GDP growth is now tracking at close to 3%, and the first quarter 2016 figure is bound to be revised up to 1% from the initially reported 0.5%. With inflation moving higher and financial markets much calmer, we will soon find out whether the emphasis of the data-dependency is more than a lip service. We continue to expect two to three rate hikes for this year, and are thus at odds with financial markets, which have barely priced in a single hike in 2016. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-573b23f8e4b0ac0aa28f53da\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-17T14:08:58.308Z\">3.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with Greece, and ahead of the latest weekend vote in the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parliament on the latest reform proposals and next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurogroup meeting, the International Monetary Fund reportedly wants its debt to be suspended until 2040.</p> <p>Debt relief is one of the key issues the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors have to resolve, and there have been concerns that the IMF would withdraw from the process if there was no satisfactory agreement.

Ben Combes at independent economic group Llewellyn Consulting said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Weekly fluctuations in [US] stocks by 4 or 5 million barrels need to be viewed in perspective. A broader sweep of history reveals that US oil stocks have been rising since 2008, and sharply so over the past year or so. Stocks are at their highest since the 1980s. One week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data \u00e2\u20ac\u201c e.g. last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 3 mb draw, perhaps reflecting recent interruptions in Canada and Nigeria \u00e2\u20ac\u201c risks missing something of potential strategic significance: the supply glut seems persistent. </p> <p>There are many potential reasons why stocks are trending upwards: weak final demand; stronger than expected supply; companies building inventories at \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 prices in expectation of rising prices further out.

Such excess supply suggested that a rebalance, through the price mechanism, was inevitable. Many posit, not least given recent interruptions, that rebalancing has now run its course, and that prices stand to rise, perhaps markedly, hereafter. US stock levels, however, might well suggest otherwise. The process could be far from over. </p> <p>If the market is yet to rebalance fully, the implications for the price of oil seem clear: the market may not have yet reached its low. Moreover, any rise in price might encourage further stock building, delaying rebalancing, and resulting eventually in a larger price correction. </p> <p>To the extent that oil stocks continue to rise, the more the oil price stands eventually to fall. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-573b1a3fe4b06cd267863f8f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-17T13:24:55.389Z\">2.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More US data, showing better than expected industrial production in April.</p> <p>Industrial output rose by 0.7% compared to forecasts of a 0.3% rise, with output from utilities bouncing back after a warmer than expected March.</p> <p>US factory output climbed 0.3%, in line with expectations, with good gains in machinery and car manufacturing.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-573b15b8e4b06cd267863f7a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-17T13:15:40.092Z\">2.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Is June rate hike back on the agenda?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ea65c5fa59bd872d20cbb3bd5167e0701dc8336\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ea65c5fa59bd872d20cbb3bd5167e0701dc8336/0_0_3500_2255/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Federal Reserve building in Washington.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"644\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Federal Reserve building in Washington.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Could the US Federal Reserve take the plunge and raise interest rates at next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rob Carnell </strong>of Dutch bank <strong>ING</strong> reckons the odds of a June hike are growing, following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/may/17/oil-50-uk-us-inflation-report-business-live?page=with:block-573b0f1de4b06cd267863f6a#block-573b0f1de4b06cd267863f6a\">today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jump in inflation</a>.</p> <p>Such a hike would surprise the markets, though, as Carnell explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Comments from Fed speakers over recent months have reiterated that June is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153live\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd month, and that two rate hikes look a reasonable prospect for 2016. But financial markets have been pricing in a far flatter curve for the Fed over the coming year. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation data is a clarion call for a market rethink on the Fed.</p> <p>In our view, the Fed has been waiting for the perfect mix of benign financial conditions, inflation heading in the right direction, and some evidence that real activity is picking up after a very soft first quarter. And although the latter condition is still debatable, decent retail sales data released last week certainly puts 2Q16 on a firmer footing as far as activity is concerned. This better run of activity data now needs to be maintained through to the June FOMC meeting, which is not by any means a given, But a June rate hike cannot be ruled out, and we will be looking at our house forecast for a 3Q16 hike as data continues to come in, to see if we need to bring this forward to June.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>David Morrison of City firm SpreadCo reckons the Fed will sit tight while the battle for the White House rages:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>According to the Fed funds futures there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just around a 4 percent chance of an increase in June. Nevertheless, there remains a view that the Fed could still raise rates twice this year. However, that would suggest a move in September which is dangerously close to the Presidential Election.</p> <p>It seems reasonable to assume that the Fed wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to shift rates in either direction before the election.

                "bodyText":"Further rises in the oil price gave some support to stock markets in early trading, but with crude falling back during the course of the day, and renewed talk of US rate rises after stronger than expected data, the initial gains soon went into reverse. A late rally in oil - Brent crude is now up 0.98% at $49.45 a barrel having fallen as low as $48.57 - has seen shares come off their worst levels, but it was still another unpredictable day for investors.

On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Adding to the renewed expectation of a Federal Reserve interest rate hike next month with further rises to come: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jana Kasperkevic to sum up the comments: Speaking at a POLITICO event this afternoon, Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart and San Francisco Fed president John Williams would not rule out a June interest rate hike. June meeting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153certainly could be\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a meeting where action is taken, said Lockhart. He pointed out that every meeting is live. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take it off the table,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said of a June interest rate hike, adding that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153markets are more pessimistic than I am\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Williams echoed that all meetings are live, adding that more data will be released before the June meeting. Both Williams and Lockhart, who are not voting members of Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy-setting committee, said there is a possibility of two to three rate hikes this year. As for the Brexit vote, which takes place about a week after Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next meeting, the Fed will have to determine if it could have an impact on the US economy, said Lockhart. Williams pointed out that if there is too much uncertainty in mid-June, the Fed does meet again six weeks later and could delay raising interest rates until then. Dennis Lockhart and John C. Williams from the US Federal Reserve are currently discussing the US economy at a Politico event which you can watch here. Eurogroup head Jeroen Dijsselbloem has said the IMF needs a political deal on Greek debt. The latest US data suggests a rate rise is likely before long, according to Harm Bandholz, chief US economist at UniCredit Research. He said: The US economy is rebounding nicely in the second quarter. Most recent numbers for April have even exceeded our above-consensus expectations... Federal Reserve officials across the board \u00e2\u20ac\u201c i.e. hawks and doves \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have highlighted repeatedly that every FOMC meeting is a live meeting and that the policy decision is completely data dependent. We understand that one (or even two) swallow(s) don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make a summer. But the latest round of data was as good as it gets. Second quarter 2016 GDP growth is now tracking at close to 3%, and the first quarter 2016 figure is bound to be revised up to 1% from the initially reported 0.5%. With inflation moving higher and financial markets much calmer, we will soon find out whether the emphasis of the data-dependency is more than a lip service. We continue to expect two to three rate hikes for this year, and are thus at odds with financial markets, which have barely priced in a single hike in 2016. Back with Greece, and ahead of the latest weekend vote in the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parliament on the latest reform proposals and next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurogroup meeting, the International Monetary Fund reportedly wants its debt to be suspended until 2040. Debt relief is one of the key issues the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors have to resolve, and there have been concerns that the IMF would withdraw from the process if there was no satisfactory agreement. But the Wall Street Journal is now reporting: The International Monetary Fund is pressing the eurozone to let Greece skip paying interest or principal on bailout loans until 2040, say officials familiar with the talks. The IMF wants the loans to Greece to fall due gradually in the following decades, and as late as 2080, according to the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposal\u00e2\u20ac\u201da demand that goes far beyond what Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European creditors, particularly Germany, have said they are willing to do to help Greece regain its financial health. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate on eurozone loans would be fixed for 30 to 40 years at its current average level of 1.5%, with all interest payments postponed until loans start falling due, under the IMF proposal. Greece wants to settle the debt issue at Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurogroup gathering, according to Reuters, with a government spokeswoman quoted as saying the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s views on debt relief were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153always in the right direction.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Reuters also quotes a senior EU official expressing confidence the IMF will be part of the Greek reform review, adding that eurozone ministers are working on a debt deal that would satisfy both the eurozone and the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s requirements. But that will not be so easy. As the Wall Street Journal reports: The IMF is also at odds with eurozone authorities and Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government over how to ensure Athens hits its budget targets. But Greece is expected to pass the bulk of the fiscal measures creditors want from it by next week. The crucial fight is now among the creditors. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greece is basically out of the picture,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says another European official. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a dialogue between the IMF and the countries that really want the IMF.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The latest US data showing higher inflation and better than expected industrial production has added some impetus to the idea that the Federal Reserve may, after all, decide on a rate hike next month. And that has been enough to send US markets lower in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 74 points or 0.44% after Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are also lower. The weakness in the US has helped knock European markets lower, with the FTSE 100 now up just 8 points and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac both around 0.6% lower. The recent recovery in oil prices comes amid interruptions in supply from Canada, Nigeria and elsewhere, as analysts at Goldman Sachs pointed to a dramatic cut in stockpiles. But not everyone agrees. Ben Combes at independent economic group Llewellyn Consulting said: Weekly fluctuations in [US] stocks by 4 or 5 million barrels need to be viewed in perspective. A broader sweep of history reveals that US oil stocks have been rising since 2008, and sharply so over the past year or so. Stocks are at their highest since the 1980s. One week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data \u00e2\u20ac\u201c e.g. last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 3 mb draw, perhaps reflecting recent interruptions in Canada and Nigeria \u00e2\u20ac\u201c risks missing something of potential strategic significance: the supply glut seems persistent. There are many potential reasons why stocks are trending upwards: weak final demand; stronger than expected supply; companies building inventories at \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 prices in expectation of rising prices further out. But stocks seem unlikely to remain at such elevated levels indefinitely. The main reason for the oil price halving in 2014, and again in 2015, was the basic global imbalance of supply and final demand: supply was, in certain months, running as much as 2m barrels a day in excess of final demand (the gap being global stock building). Such excess supply suggested that a rebalance, through the price mechanism, was inevitable. Many posit, not least given recent interruptions, that rebalancing has now run its course, and that prices stand to rise, perhaps markedly, hereafter. US stock levels, however, might well suggest otherwise. The process could be far from over. If the market is yet to rebalance fully, the implications for the price of oil seem clear: the market may not have yet reached its low. Moreover, any rise in price might encourage further stock building, delaying rebalancing, and resulting eventually in a larger price correction. To the extent that oil stocks continue to rise, the more the oil price stands eventually to fall. More US data, showing better than expected industrial production in April. Industrial output rose by 0.7% compared to forecasts of a 0.3% rise, with output from utilities bouncing back after a warmer than expected March. US factory output climbed 0.3%, in line with expectations, with good gains in machinery and car manufacturing. Could the US Federal Reserve take the plunge and raise interest rates at next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting? Rob Carnell of Dutch bank ING reckons the odds of a June hike are growing, following today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jump in inflation. Such a hike would surprise the markets, though, as Carnell explains: Comments from Fed speakers over recent months have reiterated that June is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153live\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd month, and that two rate hikes look a reasonable prospect for 2016. But financial markets have been pricing in a far flatter curve for the Fed over the coming year. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation data is a clarion call for a market rethink on the Fed. In our view, the Fed has been waiting for the perfect mix of benign financial conditions, inflation heading in the right direction, and some evidence that real activity is picking up after a very soft first quarter. And although the latter condition is still debatable, decent retail sales data released last week certainly puts 2Q16 on a firmer footing as far as activity is concerned. This better run of activity data now needs to be maintained through to the June FOMC meeting, which is not by any means a given, But a June rate hike cannot be ruled out, and we will be looking at our house forecast for a 3Q16 hike as data continues to come in, to see if we need to bring this forward to June. David Morrison of City firm SpreadCo reckons the Fed will sit tight while the battle for the White House rages: According to the Fed funds futures there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just around a 4 percent chance of an increase in June. Nevertheless, there remains a view that the Fed could still raise rates twice this year. However, that would suggest a move in September which is dangerously close to the Presidential Election. It seems reasonable to assume that the Fed wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to shift rates in either direction before the election. If it did, then it runs the considerable danger of being labelled partisan \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly as this is shaping up to be a particularly vicious contest. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation figures also include bad news for American workers. Real average hourly earnings actually shrank by 0.1%, once you adjust for the rising cost of living. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because average earnings rose by 0.3% in April, which was more than wiped out by the 0.4% jump in the Consumer Price Index. Real weekly earnings rose by 0.2%, though -- because employees actually worked more hours than in March. This jump in US inflation is going to reignite talk about another hike in US interest rates.... Breaking: Prices in America have risen at their fastest rate in three years. The latest US inflation data, just released, show that consumer prices rose by 0.4% during April alone - the biggest one-month gain since February 2013. That pushed the annual inflation rate up to 1.1%, from 0.9% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c much faster than the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lacklustre 0.3%. Importantly, core inflation (excluding energy and food) rose by 0.2% month-on-month, and was 2.1% higher on an annual basis. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slightly higher than the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target for headline inflation. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, reckons the cost of living in the UK will remain subdued through this year: The assumption among many City economists is that inflation will rise steadily in the second half of the year, putting interest rate increases from the Bank of England back on the agenda. They expect an unwinding of the sharp fall in energy prices in late 2015 coupled with a rebound in activity once the threat of Brexit is out of the way to nudge the monetary policy committee into action. These forecasts should be taken with a pinch of salt. Inflation is low and the economy was weakening even before the government announced the date of the referendum in late February. There will probably be a bit of a bounce in the third quarter if, as seems likely, the decision on 23 June is to stay in the EU. But there is more chance of the economy stalling than there is of a boom. That will keep inflationary pressure in check and should make the Bank cautious about raising rates. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his analysis of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures: The pressure of smashing through the $50 per barrel mark for the first time this year has proved too much for the oil price. This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally has fizzled out, and Brent crude is now trading at just $48.74 per barrel. Carsten Fritsch, analyst at Commerzbank, reckons oil will have another charge higher soon, though: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I expect prices to take a shot at $50. The outages in Canada and Nigeria alone are probably enough to leave the global oil market undersupplied at present.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Nigeria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil production network has been hit by a series of militant attacks recently. Unions have called a general strike for Wednesday, in protest at gasoline price hikes, which could also hurt output. Falling inflation isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t good news for savers, who continue to press their noses against the windows of the Bank of England in the vain hope of seeing a rate rise. Calum Bennie, savings expert at Scottish Friendly, reckons there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little change of deposit rates rising anytime soon: With the run-up to the EU referendum contributing to increasing fears about the state of the global economy, the last thing we want is to be flirting with the term \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnoflation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 again. Indeed, this news reinforces the view that a rise in interest rates is not going to happen this year. Even though we have witnessed a rising oil price in recent months, the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% inflation target seems a long way off just now and this will only make Mark Carney sit tight and make us wait yet again on interest rates. For those who want to grow their money over the long-term they should be considering stocks and shares ISAs as an alternative to the derisory saving rates on offer from the banks, although risk is attached. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about the 9% jump in house prices in March: The pound has been hit by the news that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate had fallen from 0.5% to just 0.3%. After a strong start to the day, sterling fell back to $1.448 when the unexpectedly weak consumer price data arrived. Nawaz Ali, UK currency strategist at Western Union Business Solutions, says the pound is suffering because UK inflation is stagnating with a disappointingly low report causing an immediate drop in the value of the Pound. Forecasts ahead of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCPI Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ranged from about 0.7% down to 0.3%, so today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.3% UK inflation release is right at the bottom of this range. Whilst not a game-changer, this data will be a real blow for the hawkish members of the Bank of England favouring future interest rate hikes. That still leaves the pound up around one cent today, partly driven by a phone poll which showed the Remain campaign holding a 15 point lead. Core inflation, which strips out volatile measures such as energy and food, has also fallen - from 1.5% to 1.2%. That suggests that underlying price pressures are still subdued \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is frankly excellent news for consumers. This graph, from Berenberg bank, shows how the price of physical goods began falling back in 2014 (partly due to cheaper energy costs) Berenberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kallum Pickering explains: The large falls in the headline rate since 2014 are largely due to cheaper goods, which account for 52% of the weight in the headline index. Low inflation has helped boost real incomes during a time when nominal wage gains have been unusually soft relative to the level of unemployment in the economy. And given that household consumption has been growing faster than overall GDP, there is little evidence that low inflation has led households to postpone spending amid expectations of lower prices in the future. Whilst low inflation might give the inflation targeting Bank of England a headache, it is mostly a welcome boost for UK households and the economy overall. The Federation of Small Businesses and the British Chambers of Commerce have both issued statements urging the Bank of England to resist raising interest rates. BCC chief economist David Kern says: While the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current monetary policy is conducive to maintaining stability, boosting business confidence will require much greater efforts on the part of the government to support growth at a time when the economy faces many headwinds. The TUC, which represents Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unionised workers, doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t share the Treasury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happiness about the drop in inflation. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady argues: The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s continuing low inflation is a sign that the economy still lacks the demand needed to get back to full strength. Wage growth remains too weak and we do not have the level of public investment needed to secure stronger growth. With the UK economy slowing down, the government cannot continue to stand by. We need investment in skills, infrastructure and public services to promote growth for the long term. Figures released last month showed that wage growth, including bonuses, fell back to +1.8% in February, down from 2.1%. The Office for National Statistics doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t suggest that the drop in inflation is due to uncertainty over next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum. But that hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stopped the Treasury shoe-horning a Brexit warning into its official comment on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data, which reads: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation figure continues the trend we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen over the past year. Pay is growing faster than prices, boosting families\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 spending power. Last week the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Monetary Policy Committee warned that a vote to leave the EU would put this all at risk by hitting GDP and increasing inflation. As the Chancellor has said this would create a lose-lose situation for our economy. So it is clear Britain would be poorer outside the EU. To avoid putting our economic progress at risk we must continue with the plan that is building resilience and delivering rising living standards across Britain. Rob Weaver, director of investments at property crowdfunding platform Property Partner, blames George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax rises for the 9% surge in house prices in March. With prospective private landlords firmly in the Chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cross hairs, the rush by buy-to-let investors turned into an unavoidable stampede in the final month before the stamp duty increase. The hefty 3% hike in upfront tax bills from April this year ramped up activity to beat the deadline and in turn pushed house prices up, temporarily at least. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no sign of deflation in the UK housing sector, where new data shows prices surging again. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s house prices jumped by 9% annually in March, the ONS says, as buyers rushed to beat higher stamp duty rates on buy-to-let properties. London house prices leapt by 13%, helping to drive the English house price index to a new record high. However, house prices actually dropped by over 6% in Scotland: So, is Britain heading back to deflation? Nick Dixon, investment director at Aegon UK, argues not: While inflation was weak in April, we may be closer than forecasts indicate to the inflection point when inflation starts to accelerate. A combination of rising energy costs, higher US rates, and lower \u00c2\u00a3 sterling could bring inflation forward and trigger rising interest rates before the end of 2016. This chart confirms that transport costs and clothing pegged back the cost of living last month: The ONS says that air transport prices fell by 14.2% in April, having surged in March to take advantage of holidaymakers travelling for Easter. However, prices for both petrol and diesel did rise by more than they did a year ago. And clothing and footwear prices fell by 0.4% between March and April this year compared with a rise of 0.9% between the same 2 months a year ago. Much of the downward contribution came from women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outerwear, the ONS says. And that has pulled inflation back down, erasing recent gains: Falls in air fares and prices for clothing, vehicles and social housing rent were the main contributors to the drop in the inflation rate, the Office for National Statistics says. Air fares had risen sharply last month, because Easter was particularly early this year. The ONS adds: These downward pressures were partially offset by rising prices for motor fuels and for certain recreational goods and cultural services, and by food prices, which were unchanged between March and April 2016, having fallen between the same two months a year ago. Breaking: The UK inflation rate has fallen, for the first time since last September. Confounding our expectations, the Consumer Prices Index only rose by 0.3% year-on-year in April -- dashing expectations of a 0.5% reading. More to follow.... There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a significant development in the ongoing Greek drama. The IMF wants the eurozone to grant Athens almost 25 years of debt relief, in return for continuing to support the Greek bailout programme. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the Wall Street Journal, which writes: The International Monetary Fund is pressing the eurozone to let Greece skip paying interest or principal on bailout loans until 2040, say officials familiar with the talks. The IMF wants the loans to Greece to fall due gradually in the following decades, and as late as 2080, according to the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposal. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate on eurozone loans would be fixed for 30 to 40 years at its current average level of 1.5%, with all interest payments postponed until loans start falling due, under the IMF proposal. The IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposal, presented to eurozone governments late last week, would keep Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual debt-service needs below 15% of its gross domestic product, under the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relatively pessimistic forecast for Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term economic trajectory. More here: IMF Wants Eurozone Debt Relief for Greece Until 2040 Greek bonds are strengthening, following this news: This comes as Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime minister prepares to brief his cabinet about the package of austerity measures which MPs will consider on Sunday night. They include a new privatization fund, measures for tackling bad loans, and tax increases on alcohol, coffee and heating oil (among other items). As one Greek analyst pointed out, The only thing that is not being taxed is the air we breathe. (don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give them any ideas....) The Telegraph\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ashley Armstrong has a couple of corking stories this morning. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s learned that Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley, already reeling from Newcastle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relegation, has finally agreed to appear before a parliamentary committee to discuss working conditions at his company. However, he also wants MPs to visit his warehouse first! As a football chairman, Ashley (Mike, not Ms Armstrong) clearly fancies a battle on home territory before a daunting away trip to Westminster, surrounded by a hostile crowd. The Telegraph also has good news for workers at BHS; John Hargreaves, who founded the Matalan retail chain, has been working on a rescue bid for the company. Administrators at Duff &amp; Phelps are understood to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bullish\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about selling BHS as a going concern by the end of the week and have told suitors they must pump in cash, take on all the shops and also the chain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt liabilities. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s competition authority is under fire this morning, after announcing its new proposals to shake up the banking sector. Although the CMA is proposing overdraft caps, and new measures to help customers switch, campaigners are unhappy that it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t challenging the dominance of the big four banks. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the story. European stock markets are rising in early trading. The FTSE 100 has jumped by 46 points to 0.7% to 6198, the highest level since 3 May. Housebuilder Taylor Wimpey is leading the top risers, after announcing a new special dividend for investors. The rising oil price is also boosting confidence in the City, as it eases fears of an oversupply glut pushing advanced economies into deflation. The German stock market (the DAX) has jumped 1%, while the French exchange is 0.7% higher. Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct says: A positive finish both the US and Asia, plus the fact that oil prices continue to march higher, have combined to ensure London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE-100 kicks off Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session by extending yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s late gains Sam Hill of Royal Bank of Canada reckons the UK inflation rate will remain at 0.5% in April, matching the previous month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading. He points out that March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate was driven up by higher travel costs, as airlines hiked prices over Easter: Although we look for some reversal in airfares after the surge last month, offsetting this there is also the higher petrol price and a number of other duty and government policy changes taking effect at the start of the new financial year, such as higher dental and prescription charges. Hill also reckons UK inflation will still be below 1% at the end of 2016 ... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153but this is dependent on the outcome of the EU referendum.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Oil is continuing its charge towards the giddy heights of $50 per barrel this morning. Oil prices are now at their highest level in seven months, in a sign that inflationary pressures may be building. Brent crude, from the North Sea, has gained 1% to $49.44 per barrel, a level last seen in November 2015. And US crude has jumped by 1.4%, and now changing hands at $48.39 per barrel. Oil continues to be pushed higher by recent production cuts, and supply disruption from Canada to Nigeria. As we covered yesterday, Goldman Sachs has argued that the oil market is now in deficit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c meaning the world is consuming more crude than is currently being produced. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says oil is: ....benefitting from a bullish outlook upgrade from Goldman Sachs as well as more supply disruptions stemming from equipment failure and political squabbles in places like Nigeria and Venezuela - both major producing nations. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. A few months ago, many commentators were fretting about the threat of deflation. But with energy prices picking up, those fears look increasingly ill-founded. At 9.30am BST, we get the latest measure of UK inflation, for April. Having fallen to minus 0.1% last October, the consumer prices index scrambled back to +0.5% in March. Economists expect it remained at 0.5% in April, but aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ruling out a higher number. A high reading might reopen the debate about when the Bank of England could finally start raising interest rates - once the thorny issue of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum has been resolved, anyway. And then at 1.30pm BST, the American inflation report for April is released. Wall Street expects the annual CPI rate to rise to 1.1%, from 0.9%. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has already entered the rate-hike cycle, of course, following last December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quarter-point rise. So the Federal Reserve is now looking for signs that it made the right decision. Back on Friday, the latest US retail sales and consumer confidence reports smashed expectations, but analysts still expect the Fed to remain cautious: Alastair Winter, Daniel Stewart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, explains: Many investors seem to hope this \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcGoldilocks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 economy will persist, whereby there is enough growth and inflation to keep things moving but not enough to persuade the FOMC to hike interest rates. But as CMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michael Hewson points out, some Fed policy makers are making rumbling noises.... Yesterday we heard from the Richmond Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jeffrey Lacker who stated that there remained a strong case for a June rate rise, however he is not on the voting committee this year, unlike the Boston Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eric Rosengren who is, and who has a history of leaning to the dovish side. His comments last week about the markets potentially mispricing the timing of a Fed move on rates appear to suggest he is leaning towards a rate rise in the next few months. Also coming up today: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s competition authorities are announcing the results of a review of British banking. The top news is that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re proposing a cap on unauthorised mortgage charges: Vodafone, Premier Foods, Land Securities and Enterprise Inns are reporting financial results, so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pick over the bones at some point. And in Greece, the government is trying to rally support for another dose of austerity measures and reforms which will go to the vote on Sunday night. More on that shortly too. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll track all the main events through the day...",

                "bodyText":"Leading shares are falling back as the strong dollar, lifted by renewed talk of a US rate rise in June, hits the mining sector. But among the risers is Arm, up 6p at 934p as the chip designer announced the $350m purchase of imaging specialist Apical. Arm said Apical\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technology is used in more than 1.5bn smartphones and 300m other devices including cameras and tablets. Arm said the move supported its long term growth strategy by giving it access to imaging products for driverless cars, security systems, robotics, mobile and other applications. Arm chief executive Simon Segars said: Computer vision is in the early stages of development and the world of devices powered by this exciting technology can only grow from here. Apical is at the forefront of embedded computer vision technology, building on its leadership in imaging products that already enable intelligent devices to deliver amazing new user experiences. But long term seller Liberum questioned the price paid: Apical is a UK-based business, founded in 2002 and has 100 employees.

Computer vision is a very hot space at present and Arm appears to have paid a high price to get into the market.

                "bodyText":"Burberry is to cut jobs and reduce its product range by up to one-fifth in an attempt to save at least \u00c2\u00a3100m a year, following a 10% fall in profit. Christopher Bailey, the chief creative officer of the British clothing brand, who also became its chief executive in 2014, said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153change is not a choice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as the market for luxury goods faces challenging trading conditions. The company, famous for trench coats, said it expected profit to come in towards the bottom of market forecasts in the year to March 2017 amid investment in staff training and IT, and a sharp slowdown in China, the retailer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest market. Burberry has been affected by a decline in the number of Chinese tourists visiting its stores in Europe and weak demand in Hong Kong after a change to visa rules. Pre-tax profits fell by 10% to \u00c2\u00a3421m in the year to 31 March, after underlying revenue for the year declined by 1% to \u00c2\u00a32.5bn. Bailey, who was previously the label\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creative director, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u01532015/16 was a challenging year for our industry shaped by macro trends including volatile financial markets and geopolitical tensions, as well as changes to dynamics of luxury consumption, not least in Hong Kong.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, in a show of confidence about the future, the company revealed a 5% increase to its full-year dividend and a \u00c2\u00a3150m share buyback starting next year. Burberry is aiming to cut annual costs by \u00c2\u00a3100m by 2019, about 10% of its non-fixed expenses, by simplifying the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s operational processes, cutting jobs and slimming down the range of products. Burberry would not say where job reductions would come or how many people would be affected, but Bailey said he wanted to eliminate duplication between central, regional and local operations. The company will also bring down the number of products it sells as he puts the entire range under the single Burberry brand this autumn.

Along with stronger than expected US data, this seemed to put a June rise firmly on the table. Not everyone agrees, however, with Joseph Lake, US analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, suggesting there will be no move until at least September:</p> <blockquote> <p>All eyes today are on the release of the minutes of the April FOMC meeting, which will give markets an indication of the future direction of interest rates, and the likelihood of a Fed rate rise in June. This will influence the future direction of the US dollar, and have a large bearing on whether commodity prices can sustain their recent rally. </p> <p>Politics will play a key role in when the Fed decides to increase the policy rate. The next FOMC meeting is on June 14-15, just one week before the UK votes on whether it will leave or remain in the European Union. Although the EIU expects the UK to vote to remain in the EU, polls are close and the vote will be tight. This will weigh on financial markets and factor in to the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision. It would be risky to lift US interest rates just one week before a UK poll which could have wide ranging consequences for the global economy.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ea65c5fa59bd872d20cbb3bd5167e0701dc8336\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ea65c5fa59bd872d20cbb3bd5167e0701dc8336/0_78_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US Federal Reserve building in Washington.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US Federal Reserve building in Washington.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>Had the domestic economic data been overwhelmingly positive in the past two months, the Fed would probably have moved in June. However, while economic data has been positive, it has not been overwhelmingly so and, combined with the Brexit vote, this will be enough to persuade the Fed to delay the next rate increase. It is unlikely to move at the following FOMC meeting, in July, as it is not accompanied by a press conference. Although the Fed insists that all meetings are live, given the very gradual nature of this tightening cycle, and the importance of clear communication, the Fed will probably skip July, leaving the following FOMC meeting in September as the most likely date of the next policy rate increase.</p> <p>Thereafter, politics will once again enter the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s calculations, but this time it will be domestic matters. The lead up to the November presidential and congressional elections will increase investor uncertainty, and raise volatility in financial markets. Although we think the domestic economic prospects for the second half of 2016 are bright, the uncertainty generated by politics will deter the FOMC from tightening policy at the November meeting, leaving the FOMC gathering in mid-December as the last chance to increase the policy rate for a second time in 2016.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-573c91eae4b0451a6f482647\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-18T16:05:21.819Z\">5.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A quick look at what is expected at this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s G7 finance ministers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 meeting in Japan, from Capital Economics. In sum, not much:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s G7 finance ministers meeting in Sendai, Japan, is likely to focus on exchange rate and fiscal policy and to end with another warning about the dangers of Brexit. However, no major policy announcements are on the cards. </p> </blockquote> <p>In more detail:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The hosts, Japan, will be looking for support for the view that currency intervention can be a legitimate policy option in some circumstances. After all, the appreciation of the yen, of 10% so far this year, has been much bigger than that of the euro (and has had a major impact on corporate earnings. And Japanese officials have hinted recently that they may intervene to push the yen down...US officials are not likely to criticise the euro-zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s or Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exchange rate policy too heavily at this weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting because neither the ECB nor the Bank of Japan has been intervening to weaken their currencies.</p> <p>Indeed, the US is more concerned about China, which is of course not a G7 member, though the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank has been selling foreign currency over the past year in order to prop the renminbi up, rather than trying to gain competitive advantage.</p> <p>All in all, it seems highly likely that the G7 will stick to its established formula on exchange rate policy. The key elements are a commitment to market-determined exchange rates and to using fiscal and monetary policies to achieve domestic objectives.</p> <p>Finance ministers will also discuss fiscal policy, with Germany likely to be singled out for criticism once again. But the Japanese government is unlikely to push for a coordinated statement in favour of fiscal stimulus given implacable opposition from Germany itself. Moreover, Japan is not in a good position to argue for a coordinated fiscal stimulus: under current plans, its fiscal policy will be tightened more than that of any other G7 economy apart from the UK during 2016-2020.</p> <p>Finally, the G7 will surely issue yet another warning about the dangers posed by Brexit. With only five weeks to go until the referendum, getting this in any formal communique\u00cc\ufffd will be the only significant objective of the UK government. But this would surely do little to change anybody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view on the merits of Brexit. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-573c876ae4b0451a6f482617\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-18T15:22:04.877Z\">4.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Oil is still in negative territory following the US inventory figures, but it is not seeing a major slide, with Brent crude down just 0.2% at $49.17 a barrel.</strong> Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Crude oil dropped in the immediate aftermath of the latest official US oil inventories report from the EIA as traders responded to the headline build of 1.3m barrels.

                "bodyText":"And finally..... here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my colleage Jana Kasperkevic on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed minutes: The US Federal Reserve could rase interest rates as early as June, according to minutes from its April meeting, with Fed members arguing the risks of a slowdown in the global economy have receded. Yet even as the members have become more bullish about US economic resilience, they remained cautious about raising rates. They voted 11-1 to keep interest rates unchanged for a third time this year at the April meeting. The minutes released on Wednesday listed concerns about the slowing growth ofUS economy in the first quarter, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s potential exit from the EU and lingering uncertainty over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Since the March FOMC [Federal Open Markets Committee] meeting, foreign financial market conditions eased, on net, and overall risk sentiment appeared to have improved,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the Fed noted in its minutes. Yet concerns about potential risks of a slowing US economy and global markets remain. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: And with that, goodnight and thanks for reading... GW The New York stock market has closed for the night, pretty much where they started it: The Dow Jones index has only shed 5 points, or 0.03%, at 17,524. The broader S&amp;P 500 index closed flat, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq index finished 0.5% higher. Basically, the selloff sparked by the Fed minutes did wipe out early gains, but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t prompt a rout. Tariq Zahir, crude oil trader and managing partner at Tyche Capital Advisors, reckons the US dollar could continue to strengthen. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We think people really had a June rate hike off the table. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But with the Fed disputing that, we could have a much stronger dollar from here, which is typically bearish for oil and other commodities.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dollar rally has already driven down commodity prices, and sunk oil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest attempt to hit the $50/barrel mark for the first time this year. Brent crude is ending the day down 1.5% at $48.55. Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago, has got the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s message, telling Reuters that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They are ready to pull the trigger on a rate increase in June.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Poor Janet Yellen.... As Fed chair, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to have to keep a close eye on the nitty-gritty of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum battle, points out the FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mehreen Khan. Wall Street now reckons there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 25% chance of a June rate hike - up from below 5% last week: The Federal Reserve is pretty clear that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum is a potential shock to the world economy, as is China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowdown. The minutes state that: [Many policymakers] indicated that they continued to see downside risks to the outlook either because of concerns that the recent slowdown in domestic spending might persist or because of remaining concerns about the global economic and financial outlook. Some participants noted that global financial markets could be sensitive to the upcoming British referendum on membership in the European Union or to unanticipated developments associated with China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s management of its exchange rate.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The next Fed meeting takes place just a week before Britain goes to the polls in a vote that will determine its place in, or our, of the European Union. So the Fed might well judge it too risky to raise borrowing costs after all (as Joseph Lake, US analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, suggested earlier today) The yield, or interest rates, on US government bonds has spiked sharply since the minutes were released. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another sign that investors are now expecting American interest rates to rise earlier than before. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at foreign exchange firm World First, reckons the Federal Reserve are trying to signal to the market.... Ironically, by pushing up the dollar, markets create the kind of tighter monetary conditions that allow the Fed to hold off actually raising rates at all..... Investors are rapidly repricing their expectations for US interest rate moves this year. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now a greater expectation that borrowing costs could rise during 2016, based on market moves in the last 20 minutes. However, they still don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that a June hike is terribly likely, despite the Fed saying that many policymakers think it could be justified if the data improves. CNBC has the details: June rate hike: 26 percent chance, up from 19 percent prior to the minutes being released July: 46 percent chance, up from 38 percent September: 62 percent, up from 57 percent November: 64 percent, up from 60 percent December: 78 percent, up from 74 percent February 2017: 80 percent, up from 76 percent More here: Rate hike odds spike across the board after Fed minutes Shares on Wall Street have erased all their gains after the Fed minutes revealed that a June rate hike is certainly possible. And the dollar is soaring... hitting a nine-week high against the Swiss franc and a three-week high against the yen. Breaking: Policymakers on the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy-setting committee are leaning towards raising interest rates at their next meeting in June. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the top line from the minutes of last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, which just hit the wires. They show that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153most\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd policymakers judge that a June rate hike would be appropriate, if data suggest that the US economy is recovering this quarter after its winter slowdown. And some Fed officials are concerned that the markets aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready for a June hike -- that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true, given many investors only expect one hike in 2016. This is the key quote from the minutes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Most participants judged that if incoming data were consistent with economic growth picking up in the second quarter, labor markets continued to strengthen, and inflation making progress toward the committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2 percent objective, then it likely would be appropriate for the committee to increase the target range for the federal funds rate in June.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, the minutes also show that the Fed is concerned that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum could spook the financial markets next month. Nearly time for the final event of the day....the minutes of the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s April monetary policy meeting. Paul La Monica of CNN hopes we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get too carried away... Another mixed day for stock markets, with the FTSE 100 hit by falling commodity stocks in the wake of the strong dollar but a rebound in banks providing support elsewhere. And even the FTSE 100 managed to end virtually unchanged on the day. Tony Cross, markets analyst at Trustnet Direct said: It seems fair to say that today could have been a whole lot worse for equity markets and by all accounts that shock IPSOS/MORI poll on the referendum does seem to have played at least some part in helping ensure the FTSE-100 rounds the day out broadly unchanged. It paints a picture that the remain campaign is quite literally a country mile ahead and whilst the stronger pound has done little to help commodity stocks, many other sectors seem to be finding some solid support off the back of this shift in sentiment. So the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished virtually flat, down 1.97 points or 0.03% at 6165.80 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax added 0.54% to 9943.23 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac climbed 0.51% to 4319.30 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB rose 1.23% to 17,713.62 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.88% at 8775.1 In Greece, the Athen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market added 0.31% to 628.29 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currentlyi up 33 points or 0.19%. Meanwhile oil prices have shaken off their earlier dip following a surprise rise in US crude stocks. Brent is now up 0.65% at $49.60 a barrel. More on the Fed: There has been much talk about when the US Federal Reserve would raise interest rates again after December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hike, and the minutes of last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed meeting which will be released later could give further clues. On Tuesday two - albeit non-voting - members said the June meeting was a live one, and two to three rate increases could be expected this year. Along with stronger than expected US data, this seemed to put a June rise firmly on the table. Not everyone agrees, however, with Joseph Lake, US analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, suggesting there will be no move until at least September: All eyes today are on the release of the minutes of the April FOMC meeting, which will give markets an indication of the future direction of interest rates, and the likelihood of a Fed rate rise in June. This will influence the future direction of the US dollar, and have a large bearing on whether commodity prices can sustain their recent rally. Politics will play a key role in when the Fed decides to increase the policy rate. The next FOMC meeting is on June 14-15, just one week before the UK votes on whether it will leave or remain in the European Union. Although the EIU expects the UK to vote to remain in the EU, polls are close and the vote will be tight. This will weigh on financial markets and factor in to the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision. It would be risky to lift US interest rates just one week before a UK poll which could have wide ranging consequences for the global economy. Had the domestic economic data been overwhelmingly positive in the past two months, the Fed would probably have moved in June. However, while economic data has been positive, it has not been overwhelmingly so and, combined with the Brexit vote, this will be enough to persuade the Fed to delay the next rate increase. It is unlikely to move at the following FOMC meeting, in July, as it is not accompanied by a press conference. Although the Fed insists that all meetings are live, given the very gradual nature of this tightening cycle, and the importance of clear communication, the Fed will probably skip July, leaving the following FOMC meeting in September as the most likely date of the next policy rate increase. Thereafter, politics will once again enter the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s calculations, but this time it will be domestic matters. The lead up to the November presidential and congressional elections will increase investor uncertainty, and raise volatility in financial markets. Although we think the domestic economic prospects for the second half of 2016 are bright, the uncertainty generated by politics will deter the FOMC from tightening policy at the November meeting, leaving the FOMC gathering in mid-December as the last chance to increase the policy rate for a second time in 2016. A quick look at what is expected at this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s G7 finance ministers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 meeting in Japan, from Capital Economics. In sum, not much: This weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s G7 finance ministers meeting in Sendai, Japan, is likely to focus on exchange rate and fiscal policy and to end with another warning about the dangers of Brexit. However, no major policy announcements are on the cards. In more detail: The hosts, Japan, will be looking for support for the view that currency intervention can be a legitimate policy option in some circumstances. After all, the appreciation of the yen, of 10% so far this year, has been much bigger than that of the euro (and has had a major impact on corporate earnings. And Japanese officials have hinted recently that they may intervene to push the yen down...US officials are not likely to criticise the euro-zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s or Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exchange rate policy too heavily at this weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting because neither the ECB nor the Bank of Japan has been intervening to weaken their currencies. Indeed, the US is more concerned about China, which is of course not a G7 member, though the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank has been selling foreign currency over the past year in order to prop the renminbi up, rather than trying to gain competitive advantage. All in all, it seems highly likely that the G7 will stick to its established formula on exchange rate policy. The key elements are a commitment to market-determined exchange rates and to using fiscal and monetary policies to achieve domestic objectives. Finance ministers will also discuss fiscal policy, with Germany likely to be singled out for criticism once again. But the Japanese government is unlikely to push for a coordinated statement in favour of fiscal stimulus given implacable opposition from Germany itself. Moreover, Japan is not in a good position to argue for a coordinated fiscal stimulus: under current plans, its fiscal policy will be tightened more than that of any other G7 economy apart from the UK during 2016-2020. Finally, the G7 will surely issue yet another warning about the dangers posed by Brexit. With only five weeks to go until the referendum, getting this in any formal communique\u00cc\ufffd will be the only significant objective of the UK government. But this would surely do little to change anybody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view on the merits of Brexit. Oil is still in negative territory following the US inventory figures, but it is not seeing a major slide, with Brent crude down just 0.2% at $49.17 a barrel. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index, said: Crude oil dropped in the immediate aftermath of the latest official US oil inventories report from the EIA as traders responded to the headline build of 1.3m barrels. Clearly this wrong-footed many speculators who had expected to see another drawdown following last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 3.41m barrel decrease in US oil stocks. This is the second time in as many weeks that the API has got it completely wrong. [The American Petroleum Institute earlier this week reported a 1.1m barrel drop in US crude oil supplies.] But the other aspects of the oil report were not too bad at all. For a start, oil production fell once again. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, there were larger-than-expected draws in distillates and \u00e2\u20ac\u201c more importantly for this time of the year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c gasoline stocks as refineries processed more crude now that the driving season is underway. Hence, [US benchmark] oil has not exactly fallen off a cliff (yet). Back with the latest shareholder spring, and nearly 32% of the votes cast at Paddy Power Betfair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual meeting were against the approval of the remuneration report. Unsurprisingly, oil prices have fallen on the US inventory news. Brent crude, having touched $49.54 a barrel earlier, is now down 0.3% at $49.13. Reuters has the report on the US data: U.S. crude stocks rose unexpectedly last week even as gasoline and distillate inventories fell more than expected, data from the Energy Information Administration showed on Wednesday. Crude inventories rose by 1.3 million barrels in the week to May 13, compared with analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations for an decrease of 2.8 million barrels. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub rose by 461,000 barrels, hitting a fresh record high, the data showed. Refinery crude runs rose by 192,000 barrels per day, EIA data showed. Refinery utilization rates rose by 1.4 percentage points. Gasoline stocks fell by 2.5 million barrels, compared with analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations in a Reuters poll for a 150,000-barrel drop. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, fell by 3.2 million barrels, versus expectations for a 642,000-barrel drop, the EIA data showed. U.S. crude imports rose last week by 22,000 barrels per day. US crude stocks have unexpectedly risen compared to expectations of a weekly decline. According to the Energy Information Administration, crude stocks rose by 1.3m barrels to 541.29m compared to forecasts of a 2.8m draw. US oil inventory data is due shortly and the crude price is steadying ahead of the news, given the recent supply problems including the Canadian wildfires. Brent is currently up 0.3% at $49.45 a barrel having earlier fallen as low as $48.88. The US stock market has opened in the red, as Wall Street continues to ponder the possibility of a hike in interest rates. Hawkish comments from some Federal Reserve policymakers yesterday, plus strong inflation data, have reignited talk about higher borrowing costs. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get a better clue at 7pm tonight (2pm Washington time), when the minutes of last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed meeting are released. In the meantime, the Dow has lost 30 points or 0.2% to 17,499, extending yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Lucy Meakin has shown how the pound has jumped against all major currencies today, as Brexit fears suddenly ease..... Money is continuing to pour into sterling, after the latest EU referendum poll gave the Remain side a shock 18 point lead. Investors are reacting to the news that 55% of those polled want to stay in the EU, while 37% want so leave, according to IPSOS MORI. The pound has now surged by 1.2 cents against the US dollar to $1.459, up from $1.446 overnight. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a two-week high. Sterling has also jumped by 1.5 eurocents against the single currency, to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.2935 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a 10-week high. And the pound is also surging against the Japanese yen and the Australian dollar, sending it to a three-month high against a basket of currencies. Investors are clearly calculating that this poll is a turning point in the EU campaign, and suggests Britain will decide against Brexiting the EU. However, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only one poll \u00e2\u20ac\u201c others have suggested that the race is tighter, especially as Leave voters are more likely to actually vote.... Indeed, Gideon Skinner, head of political research at Ipsos MORI, told the Evening Standard that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Remain has been boosted by a Conservative swing, but they are also more likely to change their mind, so in this volatile election, with voters divided over the short and long-term impacts of their decision, nothing can be taken for granted.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The test manipulation scandal that is gripping the automobile industry has claimed another casualty. The president of Mitsubishi Motors, Tetsuro Aikawa, has resigned today, four weeks after the company admitted it had falsified fuel efficiency reports for decades. Mitsubishi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mistake was not to adjust its testing to reflect new rules introduced in 1991 to better reflect stop-start urban driving. Aikawa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure \u00e2\u20ac\u201c marked with a traditional Japanese bow \u00e2\u20ac\u201c came hours after rival carmaker Suzuki revealed that it had also used improper methods to test the fuel economy of its vehicles. Shares in Suzuki plunged by 10%. By delaying sanctions against Spain today, the EC could be preparing the ground to rebuke the next Spanish government (if they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comply with Brussels\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 demands)... Speaking of Europe...Spain and Portugal have just been given more time to get their finances into order. The European Commission had been expected to get tough with both countries for running deficits over the 3% target mandated by Brussels. It could even have imposed its first ever fines against a member state. But with political tensions high in both countries, and the Brexit vote threatening to destabilise Europe, eurocrats have taken a softly-softly approach. Spain, which is holding a general election in June, has now been given until the end of the year to cut its deficit. Portugal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deadline for fixing its public finances will be extended to 2017 - a boost for its new socialist government. Commissioner Pierre Moscovici has admitted that political concerns played a factor: The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mehreen Khan explains why: The delay will be a source of relief for Madrid, where voters will be heading to the polls in a second general election in just seven months. Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s incumbent prime minister Mariano Rajoy was defiant ahead of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s showdown with Brussels, promising to implement a fresh round of tax cuts should he be re-elected in the summer.... More here: Breaking away from the jobs report, the pound has jumped after a new opinion poll showed a big lead for the campaign to Remain in the EU. IPSOS MORI reports that 55% of the public are planning to vote to stay in Europe in June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum, with just 37% backing Brexit. The poll also found that the public haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t swallowed some of the more alarmist claims from the two sides. That includes the prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that Brexit would raise the risk of another World War..... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the story. Josh Hardie, CBI Deputy Director-General, reckons that George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnational living wage\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is starting to hit the labour market: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s encouraging that employment has risen there are some signs of a softening in the labour market, particularly with job vacancies falling back. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, continued uncertainty could be weighing on hiring intentions. In addition we are seeing evidence that employers are considering the impact of the National Living Wage, introduced last month.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The NLW means that all workers aged 25 and over are now legally entitled to at least \u00c2\u00a37.20 per hour, which will rise to \u00c2\u00a39 per hour by 2020. The Department for Work and Pensions have riffled through their old collection of vinyl to give today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report some musical context: (Disappointing lack of Stone Roses, but otherwise pretty neat) John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, has sent over a handy summary of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data confirms that the great UK job creating machine slowed somewhat in the first quarter of this year, with unemployment flattening off at pre-crisis levels and average earnings growth remaining relatively muted at around 2%. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The employment rate is still rising, however, reaching record levels of 74.2% in the first quarter, fuelled in part by more women in the 60-64 age group working as the state pension age rises. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Continued strong inflows of workers from other EU countries has also been important, accounting for over half of the net rise in UK employment over the past year. This has helped the economy to grow steadily over this period without sparking inflationary wage pressures. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The relative cooling of the jobs market in the first quarter may in part reflect worries about the global economy, which reached a peak in January and early February, and in part uncertainty related to the EU referendum outcome, particularly from mid-February onwards once the timetable for this became clear. If these uncertainties abate after the vote on 23rd June, we may see both jobs and earnings growth pick up in the second half of the year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound has dipped a little this morning, despite Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment rate hitting a record high. Andy Scott, economist at HiFX, says traders are concerned that March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claimant count was revised high this morning, to show the biggest jump since autumn 2011. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures continue to show that the UK economy has lost momentum with the claimant count rising by almost 15,000 in March \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the biggest increase for over four years. There was some positive news on average earnings including bonuses which rose unexpectedly, but even if you strip out some potential impact from Brexit concerns, underlying growth has weakened. Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, is concerned that wage growth has dipped. It could be a worrying signal.... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The jobs market has been a standout success for the UK economy in recent years, delivering record levels of employment and one of the lowest jobless rates in Europe. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But the momentum of job creation has eased in recent months and we still haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen lift-off for wages. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Indeed, real wage growth has slowed in the last year, a development that represents a real risk to the consumer-led recovery.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ian Brinkley, chief economic advisor at Lancaster University\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Work Foundation, flags up that young people are continuing to get a rough deal: For the first time in many quarters, there was no rise in permanent jobs. All of the increase was for the self-employed and temporary employee workers. With weak hiring it is the young, as usual, who lose out. Overall unemployment remained unchanged at 5.1% but unemployment among 18 to 24 year olds went up from 12% to 12.2%. Brinkley also thinks it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unlikely\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that the EU referendum is hurting the labour market. Worsening world trade conditions pushing some export based sectors such as manufacturing into recession and increased costs from the introduction of the National Living Wage are more immediate explanations for employers being more cautious about new hires.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd If you adjust for inflation, then average earnings have fallen from their recent peak: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the main charts points from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour force report: Some fascinating historical context from Royal Bank of Scotland: Digging into today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report, its clear that the employment rate has hit a record high partly because more women are working longer. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because of changes to the retirement age, pushing it up to 65 for men and women by November 2018, and then 66 by October 2020 (more details here) The ONS explains: 79.3% of men and 69.2% of women aged from 16 to 64 were in work the employment rate for men (79.3%) was the highest since January to March 2005 the employment rate for women (69.2%) was the highest since comparable records began in 1971, partly due to ongoing changes to the state pension age for women resulting in fewer women retiring between the ages of 60 and 65 It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also possible that more older people of both gender are having to work longer, of course, for economic reasons, but that isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spelled out in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report. Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb has welcomed this latest rise in the employment total, and the small drop in unemployment: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These are another record-breaking set of figures, with more people in work than ever before and the unemployment rate is the lowest in a decade at 5.1%. More people in work means that more families across the UK are benefiting from the security of a regular wage and the fulfilment that employment brings. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But the job is not done, which is why our welfare reforms, such as Universal Credit, are making sure that it always pays to be in work.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Real wages continues to grow in the last quarter, the Office for National Statistics reports. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a mixed picture. Average weekly earnings for employees in Great Britain increased by 2.0% in January-March, up from 1.9% in October-December. But if you strip out bonuses, pay rose by 2.1%, down from 2.2% the previous quarter. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report also shows that the number of people out of work dipped by 2,000 in the last quarter, to around 1.69m. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 139,000 fewer than for a year earlier. Breaking: The proportion of people in work across the UK has hit a new record high. The latest labour market report, just released, shows that the employment rate has hit 74.2%, the highest since comparable records began in 1971. The total number of people in work has risen again, by 44,000 in the last three months, to 31.567 million. Here are other key points from the report, just released: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate remains unchanged at 5.1% in the January-March quarter. Surprisingly, the claimant count (the number of people receiving unemployment benefit) has fallen in April, to 738,000. But March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claimant count has been revised up, to show a gain of 14,700 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the biggest monthly rise since September 2011. More to follow.... A new report has warned that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153years behind schedule\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in its bid to halve the employment gap between disabled and non-disabled people. According to the TUC union, the target may not be hit until 2030 - a whole decade later than planned. The Daily Mirror explains: Tory promises to halve the unemployment gap of disabled workers will be missed by a shameful 10 years, research shows. The election manfesto pledge is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153years behind schedule\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at current rates of progress, according to a TUC study. Ministers had promised to reach the milestone of halving the employment gap between disabled and other workers by 2020. That would see nearly two-thirds (63%) of disabled people in work by the end of the decade, but the government is on target to miss the target by 11% with just over half (52%) in work. More here: The US dollar has hit a three-week high against the euro, on that renewed talk of an American interest rate hike. This has pushed the euro down to $1.1265, from $1.1311 last night. A weaker euro will be welcomed by the European Central Bank, as it should help exporters and raise inflation. Fashion chain Burberry is under pressure again this morning after it issued yet another downbeat report to the City. Burberry posted a 10% drop in profits for the last financial year, and warned that earnings in the current financial year will be at the bottom of analyst expectations. Shares have slumped by 4%, making it the worst performer on the FTSE 100. The company has been hit by slowing demand in key markets such as China and Hong Kong, where consumer have been cutting back. It tells shareholders that: Burberry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance [last year] reflected a difficult period for the luxury sector as a whole as demand slowed in many markets for both cyclical and structural reasons. Burberry is now launching a three year plan aimed at raising revenues, improving productivity and deliver at least \u00c2\u00a3100m of cost savings. And CEO Chris Bailey warns that he expects \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the challenging environment for the luxury sector to continue in the near term\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. More here: World stock markets are sliding this morning as investors begin to worry that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank might raise interest rates again soon. The FTSE 100 has shed 40 points, down 0.7%, to 6125, which erases all yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains. Other European markets are down too, following a selloff on Wall Street last night. The selloff is being driven by speculation that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank could be closer than thought to raising borrowing costs again, possibly in June. Yesterday Dennis Lockhart, the head of the Atlanta Fed, told reporters he still expects two or three rate hikes before the end of the year. Investors had expected fewer \u00e2\u20ac\u201c quite possibly none \u00e2\u20ac\u201c due to signs of economic slowdown, particularly in an election year. But yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprisingly strong US inflation data, which showed core inflation above 2.1%, is causing some rethinking.... Overnight, Japan made a rather spectacular escape from recession. New growth figures showed that the Japanese economy expanded at an annual rate of 1.7% in the last three months (meaning it grew by over 0.4% during the quarter). Economists had only expected growth of 0.3% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but Japan surprised them with unexpectedly strong consumer spending. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story: Now the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, must decide whether to press on with a sales tax that could hurt growth but improve the battered Japanese public finances.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The resilience of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market has been one of the more remarkable aspects of the aftermath of the financial crisis. Despite the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s austerity crackdown, the jobless rate has fallen steadily from 8.4% in autumn 2011 to just 5.1% at the start of 2016. But last month, the unemployment total jumped by a worrying 21,000 while wage growth stalled. And new figures released at 9.30am will show whether this trend is continuing. Economists expect earnings growth (including bonuses) to have slipped again, from 1.8% to 1.7%. The employment total, which has regularly hit record highs, could possibly have bottomed out. And the number of people signing on for unemployment benefit is tipped to have risen by 4,500, on top of a 6,700 jump last month. That might show that jitters over the EU referendum are hitting the labour market, but may also reflect the fact that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth appears to be slowing. If the numbers are bad, we can probably expect the government to warn about the dangers of Brexit. And if the numbers are good, we can also probably expect the government to warn about the dangers of Brexit. Also coming up today.... The European Commission is announcing its latest review of national budget policies around 11am BST (I think). This may include penalties against countries who have failed to hit fiscal targets, such as Spain and Portugal.... We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also getting results from luxury fashion chain Burberry, beermaker SAB Miller and energy firm SSE. And late tonight (7pm BST), the minutes of the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most recent meeting are released. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite timely, after US inflation jumped yesterday - putting talk of another rate hike back on the agenda....",

Following Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more hawkish than expected Fed minutes, a number of the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key figures have lined up to suggest the June meeting is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153live\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in terms of a possible rate hike.</p> <p>Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Anxiety is setting in for financial markets, as the proposition of another rate hike from the Fed draws the bears out once more. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US open has seen the Dow crash to a two month low, bringing the FTSE down with it as rate sensitive banks benefit at the expense of the wider market. The US dollar strength continues to be a running theme, as energy, metal and materials producers suffer at the hands of a yet another sea of red for the sector.</p> <p>Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed minutes provided the latest clue that perhaps a June rate hike may not be such a crazy idea, with the markets now factoring in a 32% chance of action. This shift from 4% on Monday to 32% today goes a long way to explain the substantial rise in the US dollar this week. With a hawkish Fed and a three year high in US CPI, the potential implications of a strong jobs report in June is starting to click in the minds of investors.</p> </blockquote> <p>With the dollar rising on the interest rate outlook, commodity prices fell back, including copper hitting a three month low and Brent crude losing 1% to $48.33. So mining companies were among the leading fallers, as were travel companies in the wake of a disappointing update from Thomas Cook and the disappearance of a flight from Paris to Cairo. But banks benefited from hopes that any US rate rise would support their balance sheets. The final scores showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 fell 112.45 points or 1.82% to 6053.35, its biggest one day percentage fall since early February</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.48% to 9795.89</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.85% at 4282.54</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.95% to 17,545.56</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 1.14% lower at 8674.7</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market fell 0.96% to 622.28</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 140 points or 0.8%.</p> <p><em>On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening.

                "bodyText":"The increasing fear that the US Federal Reserve could raise interest rates next month, earlier than expected, has sent global markets tumbling. Following Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more hawkish than expected Fed minutes, a number of the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key figures have lined up to suggest the June meeting is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153live\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in terms of a possible rate hike. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Anxiety is setting in for financial markets, as the proposition of another rate hike from the Fed draws the bears out once more. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US open has seen the Dow crash to a two month low, bringing the FTSE down with it as rate sensitive banks benefit at the expense of the wider market. The US dollar strength continues to be a running theme, as energy, metal and materials producers suffer at the hands of a yet another sea of red for the sector. Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed minutes provided the latest clue that perhaps a June rate hike may not be such a crazy idea, with the markets now factoring in a 32% chance of action. This shift from 4% on Monday to 32% today goes a long way to explain the substantial rise in the US dollar this week. With a hawkish Fed and a three year high in US CPI, the potential implications of a strong jobs report in June is starting to click in the minds of investors. With the dollar rising on the interest rate outlook, commodity prices fell back, including copper hitting a three month low and Brent crude losing 1% to $48.33. So mining companies were among the leading fallers, as were travel companies in the wake of a disappointing update from Thomas Cook and the disappearance of a flight from Paris to Cairo. But banks benefited from hopes that any US rate rise would support their balance sheets. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 112.45 points or 1.82% to 6053.35, its biggest one day percentage fall since early February Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.48% to 9795.89 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.85% at 4282.54 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.95% to 17,545.56 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 1.14% lower at 8674.7 In Greece, the Athens market fell 0.96% to 622.28 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 140 points or 0.8%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. If the US Federal Reserve is considering raising interest rates, then the Bank of England may be heading in the opposite direction. Katie Allen reports: A top Bank of England policymaker has warned that even if Britain votes to stay in the EU, underlying weakness in the economy could require more support from the central bank. Jan Vlieghe, one of the nine policymakers who vote on interest rates, has previously floated the idea of them being cut below zero. Speaking on Thursday, he again raised the prospect of rates coming down further from their record low of 0.5%, when he said the economy could require \u00e2\u20ac\u0153additional monetary stimulus\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if it does not rebound after a remain vote in the EU referendum on 23 June. Helena also reports that Handelsblatt, the German financial daily, says lenders may agree to give Greece a much large tranche of bailout aid once the reform package is passed than earlier thought. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Instead of the scheduled \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5.7bn, the ailing country could receive \u00e2\u201a\u00ac9bn to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac11bn.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That would be enough to keep it solvent until the end of the year - both delaying another potentially explosive financial review and allowing lenders to sort out their own differences over how to deal with Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staggering \u00e2\u201a\u00ac321bn debt load But while politically expedient, senior Athens-based EU diplomats also admit that it does not resolve the underlying problem of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic fundamentals simply not adding up. More from Athens where a war of words has broken out on the first day of debate over the controversial omnibus bill the government has brought to parliament outlining the latest reforms the country must take. Helena Smith reports: At 7,500 pages the omnibus bill was never going to be passed lightly. And MPs, faced with the daunting task of reading it, have ensured that debate has got off to a tumultuous start. Highlighting the explosive mood, the former prime minister Antonis Samaras accused the leftist-led government of legislating practically everything it had ever denounced. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is increasing Enfia [property tax] that it said it would abolish \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and heating oil which we reduced,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said the ex-conservative leader listing the various levies his successor Alexis Tsipras has agreed to raise in return for further bailout funds. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And the worst thing: we brought results. Now they [creditors] don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe [Athens] will bring results. And that is why they are imposing an automatic fiscal brake,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he added referring to the mechanism that will trigger automatic across-the-board cuts in the event of Greek finances veering off course. Since being replaced by Tsipras in January 2015, Samaras has made few public interventions. In a caustic statement released in the last ten minutes, Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 office said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Samaras should speak publicly more often so that citizens can remember his time in power when the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP was destroyed [fell] by 25 %.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Opposition parties are describing the fiscal break as amounting to the enforcement of a fourth bailout for a populace already hit by runaway unemployment and poverty. On the eve of the debate beginning, the finance ministry announced that the mechanism would not be included in the omnibus bill but would be tabled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as an amendment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at a later date. Insiders admit they cannot agree with lenders over the cuts that will be made should it be activated next year. And, given the falls seen in stock markets since Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more hawkish than expected Federal Reserve minutes: Back with the Fed, and New York Fed president William Dudley has added more comments about possible rate rises. He has echoed the comments elsewhere that June is a live meeting, and that the Fed believes markets were underestimating the probability of a rate rise. He said a June or July move was a reasonable expectation, if his forecasts for the way the US economy is going appear on track. But again, he added that the risk of the UK leaving the EU was one that needed to be considered, and the probability of Brexit will influence the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision. Over to Greece, and the International Monetary Fund has said debt relief negotiations for the country need to focus on extended maturity periods and very low interest rates. The IMF reportedly wanted a halt to Greek debt repayments until 2040, but spokesman Gerry Rice would not confirm this in his regular news briefing. But he said (quote from Reuters): We have exchanged preliminary views with our partners on general principles regarding debt relief. We believe that it is possible to restore debt sustainability without upfront haircuts, although this would involve providing very concessional loan terms, including long grace and maturity periods and very low interest rates. The Greek parliament is due to vote on the latest series of reform measures over the weekend, ahead of the latest Eurogroup meeting next Tuesday. New York Federal Reserve president William Dudley has repeated that interest rate changes are very much dependent on the economic data at the time. In a speech confirming the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s desire to help households and businesses understand how the economy is progressing and how that helps determine the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisions, he said: When asked about the trajectory for the monetary policy stance, I always point out that it is data dependent. The Federal Open Market Committee calibrates the stance of monetary policy to best achieve our twin objectives of price stability and maximum sustainable employment, taking into account our forecast for how the economy is evolving. This forecast reflects the ongoing flow of the data. Data releases that are close to our expectations have little additional impact on the forecast, while data releases that deviate significantly from our expectations can lead to more significant revisions of the forecast. It is, therefore, important for market participants and households to be able to follow the data along with the FOMC and to understand how we are likely to interpret and react to incoming data. The market fall is accelerating as Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses increase, following the suggestion from the US Federal Reserve minutes that a June rate rise could be on the cards. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down 159 points or 0.9%, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has dropped 1.2% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has fallen 0.58%. In the UK the FTSE 100 is 110 points lower at 6055, a fall of 1.7%. The prospect of a US rate hike as early as June has helped push American markets lower at the start of trading. With the oil price also falling - West Texas Intermediate is down around 2% at $47.15 a barrel - the Dow Jones Industrial Average has slipped 51 points or 0.32%. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq both opened around 0.4% lower. Another Fed speaker, in the form of vice chairman Stanley Fischer, but there appear to be few clues to the next rate hike in his comments. In a speech - entitled (Money), Interest and Prices: Patinkin and Woodford - at an economics conference in New York, he said: Faster trend growth would increase the long-run equilibrium interest rate, and what we need most, now that we are near full employment and approaching our target inflation rate, is faster potential growth. [The equilibrium rate is the level of borrowing costs associated with stable inflation and full employment, according to Reuters]. New York Federal Reserve president William Dudley is due to speak in an hour or so. There is a strong case for the US to raise interest rates in June, but there might be grounds to wait until July after the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum, according to Richmond Federal Reserve president Jeffery Lacker. Lacker, a notable hawk but non-voting member at the moment, told Bloomberg Radio that a vote for the UK to leave the EU posed risks to the UK and Europe and could spill over to the US. He said the markets took the wrong signal from the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to leave rates on hold at its last two meetings, overestimating how likely it was to leave rates unchanged in future. Lacker said he was comfortable with four rate rises this year, and had supported an increase at April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. Meanwhile, there are only tenuous signs of growth according to the latest Philadephia Federal Reserve survey. The current business conditions index came in at -1.8 in May compared to -1.6 in the previous month, and the consensus of +3.5. The Fed said: Firms responding to the Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey continued to report tenuous growth this month. The indicator for general activity was essentially unchanged in May and remained slightly negative. Other broad indicators also reflected general weakness in business conditions. The indicator for employment improved but remained negative. Manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 forecasts of future activity tempered slightly from last month, overall, but continue to suggest confidence in future growth. It concluded: The survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s indicators for general activity, new orders, shipments, and employment all remained negative. Though indicators for future conditions fell from last month, expectations for future growth continue to be positive. Here are the weekly jobless claims: Another sign of the strength of the US economy - and therefore another sign that the Federal Reserve may want to raise interest rates next month - has come from the weekly jobless claims. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefit fell by 16,000 to 278,000 last week, although analysts had been expecting a decline to 275,000. Still, the weekly rate has been below 300,000 for 63 weeks in a row, a sign of the strong jobs market. The previous week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claims had been at a 14 month high. Commenting on the minutes, economist Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight said: The account of the 20-21 April policy meeting reinforces belief that the ECB is firmly in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wait and see mode\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd following March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s delivery of a major package of stimulative measures. However, the minutes do indicate that the ECB is prepared to eventually act again if deemed necessary. The account also brings out the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s determination to strongly defend itself from recent intensified German criticism over its highly expansionary policy. The European Central Bank has followed the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead, and just released the minutes of its own April meeting. But rather than hint at rate hikes, the ECB is firing a warning shot at some of its critics, particularly in Germany. The minutes state: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There was general agreement that there was a need to counter the perception that monetary policy could no longer contribute to a return of inflation (to the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target).\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In light of recent public criticism...in a Member State, it was viewed as important to reaffirm collectively the independence of the ECB in the pursuit of its mandate.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That independence looked under threat last month, when German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble blamed the ECB for fuelling the popularity of the anti-immigrant, eurosceptic Alternative for Deutschland party. ECB chief Mario Draghi, though, slapped down such criticism at his April press conference -- pointing out that undermining the ECB simply hampered its ability to drag Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy forwards. The minutes also show that the ECB is in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwait and see\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 mode, having announced new stimulus measures in March. It cautions that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153patience was needed for the measures to fully unfold over time in terms of output and inflation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. And the governing council also urged Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s politicians to do more, saying they: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strongly reiterated the need for other policy areas to contribute much more decisively.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The minutes are online here. The old advice to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsell in May and go away\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 worked quite well in 2015 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if you timed your entry back into the market right. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exactly a year since the Dow Jones hits its record high - closing at 18,312 points. It then suffered quite a dive in August, due to worries over China. And although it then recovered, it then suffered another selloff around new year before reviving again.... Last night it closed at 17,526, 4% lower than a year ago: Over in Frankfurt, ECB chief Mario Draghi will be breaking out the best Prosecco. The euro has just hit a seven week low against the US dollar, as the greenback continues to benefit from the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hawkishness. A weaker euro should help to drag Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate away from zero, and help exporters too.... Oh dear.... Asda, Wal-Mart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK operation, has endured another shocking few months. Like-for-like sales across Asda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stores slumped by 5.7% in the first quarter of 2016. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only slightly better than the 5.8% drop in the final quarter of 2015. Clearly the price-wars and heavy competition in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supermarkets isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t letting up... Shares in supermarket giant Wal-Mart just jumped by 5% in pre-market trading, after it released better-than-expected results. Wal-Mart posted earnings of $0.98 per share, compared to estimate of $0.88 per share. Revenues also beat forecasts: Wall Street is expected to join the selloff when it opens at 2.30pm BST (9.30am East Coast time) The Dow Jones is currently being called down 71 points, or around 0.4%, at 17454. But there is some US data due in the next coouple of hours to maybe shift the mood. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explains: Whilst Europe has seen a nasty US rate-hike chatter-inspired decline this morning (the DAX and CAC joining the FTSE with 1.5% and 0.9% plunges respectively), the Dow futures aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite as calamitous just yet. It looks like the US index will open just shy of half a percent lower after the bell, but with Philly Fed manufacturing index and jobless claims figures to come before the session begins. There are also speeches this afternoon from Fed vice-chair William Dudley and FOMC member Stanley Fischer, with investors likely keen to hear their take on the chances of a June rate-hike. Despite the hawkish tone of last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minutes, most economists don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next month. Derivatives traders are now pricing in a 32% probability that the Fed hikes rates at its June 14-15 meeting. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from 4% last week. Some analysts believe the Fed will be reluctant to move, just a week before the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum. Policymakers may also want to hold off until they receive growth figures for the second quarter of 2016, in July. The team at RBC Capital Markets believe the Fed is signalling its ability to hike, rather than actually setting the scene for action in June. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some more views: After three hours of trading, the FTSE 100 is in full-blown retreat - down almost 90 points or 1.4% at 6079. Mining stocks continue to lead the fallers, with Fresnillo, Anglo American and BHP Billiton all down around 5%. Royal Dutch Shell has shed 4.5%, due to the oil price dropping back to $47.70 per barrel today. And Royal Mail have dropped 4%, after reporting a 33% drop in pre-tax profits in a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcchallenging\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 market. Chris Beauchamp, Senior Market Analyst at IG, blames \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a hawkish set of Fed minutes and poor results from a number of firms\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. The Fed has put the market on notice for June, and for the moment the market doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like it. Equities have sold off heavily this morning as investors scramble to reallocate funds towards those areas likely to benefit from rising rates in the US \u00e2\u20ac\u201c namely the US dollar, Treasuries and also US bank stocks. As a result, the rug has been pulled from underneath European markets, with the news of the EgyptAir tragedy having an impact on airline and travel names. The battle over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum has switched to that dinner party favourite - house prices. Moodys, the rating agency, has predicted this morning that first-time homebuyers in the UK would benefit from a vote to leave the EU. They argue that prices would fall following a Brexit vote, and there could also be less competition for housing. Buy-to-let landlords could also suffer from lower demand, particularly in London if the capital became less attractive to citizens from overseas. The National Association of Estate Agents also believes that house prices would be hit by a Brexit vote. It reckons homeowners in London could lose as much as \u00c2\u00a37,500, while homes elsewhere in the UK could lose \u00c2\u00a32,300. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, says the rise in UK consumer spending last month is reassuring: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe UK economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s glass was beginning to look decidedly half-empty, so today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales figures are a welcome tonic to the gloomy economic mood. Diminishing confidence ahead of the EU referendum and weak pay growth were expected to take a toll on retail sales. Indeed market researcher GfK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer sentiment indicator hit a 15-month low in April, which looked ominous for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures, but in the event fears that the referendum would have a negative impact on consumer spending proved unfounded. The pound has hit a three and a half-month high against the euro. Sterling has hit \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.305, up from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.301 last night, thanks to those strong retail sales figures. Here come the latest UK retail sales figures....and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve smashed forecasts! The amount of stuff bought in the shops last month jumped by 4.3% compared with a year earlier, the Office for National Statistics reports. Sales volumes were also 1.3% higher than a month earlier. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no sign of pre-Brexit jitters here. Instead, shoppers may have been spurred into action by the fact that average shop prices have fallen by 2.8% over the last year. Sales of most items jumped, but there was a 6.3% drop in clothing turnover. That may be due to cold weather in April, which put people off from buying summer garments. Melanie Richard, ONS Head of Retail Sales, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Clothing stores remain the main drag on growth in the retail sector, with sales hampered by unseasonal weather. However, both the volume and value of sales increased in April compared with March as lower prices boosted sales. The selloff is gathering pace across Europe, with the main indices all losing ground this morning: Tom Floyd, Senior Sales Trader at Foenix Partner, says investors are taking last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed minute seriously: With multiple Fed speakers in recent days failing to convince markets of the possibility of June hikes, yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Minutes seem to have finally done the trick. The Minutes showed Fed members would deem a June hike as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153appropriate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd so long as economic data continued to improve. With inflation data trending towards target and improving labour market conditions, the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remaining issue was convincing markets a rise was a likely scenario. The first Harry Potter readers have long since left the classroom for the world of adult mugglehood. But Hogwart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finest continues to work his charms for UK publishers, Bloomsbury. They have reported a 5% jump in revenues for the last year, thanks to a 133% surge in sales of Harry Potter books. That includes a new illustrated version of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Stone\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which apparently went down terribly well. Bloomsbury say: Reviews were consistently good with the Telegraph saying the book was: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a triumph - a book so alive it seems to jump, explode and slither out of your hands as you read.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We sold rights in Jim Kay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s illustrations in 28 languages. Our re-jacketed Jonny Duddle editions of the seven Harry Potter novels continued to perform strongly in all territories. An illustrated version of the Chamber of Secrets is coming soon, along with new content from J. K. Rowling for the new edition of Fantastic Beasts &amp; Where to Find Them. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a case of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Revenues leviosa!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, say those wizards at fastFT.... Peter Fankhauser, chief executive of Thomas Cook, is also calling for a shake-up in the school holiday system to help parents get cheaper holidays. He tells reporters that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153UK authorities should look across the pond to Germany and Switzerland where they agree a staggered start of school holiday dates. That relieves some of the pressure. If you had an agreement from local authorities in the UK to spread the dates... that would help us as well, it would help everybody.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fankhauser said Thomas Cook was doing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153everything we can\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to make holidays more affordable for families who face huge hikes in prices during the school holidays. To get the best deal: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153you have to start early in the cycle\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he said. Last week, a UK parent won a landmark case in the High Court against his local authority, after he took his daughter away on holiday during term time. The ruling appeared to give the green light for parents to take their children out of state schools without permission so long as they have a good record of attendance. The government, though, quickly vowed to close this new loophole.... Shares in Thomas Cook have fallen by 15% to a three-year low, after it reported a 5% drop in summer bookings. The holiday company warned this morning that underlying profits will hit the bottom of analyst expectations. It reported that tourists are shunning Turkey, where a suicide bomber killed 10 Germans in an Istanbul square in January. Turkey had been Thomas Cook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second most popular destination last year; in 2016, though, more tourists are choosing the Balearics (up 14%), Canaries (up 23%) and and USA (up 29%). Thomas Cook says: Demand for Turkey - our second largest market last year - remains significantly below last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s levels. This has impacted our German Airlines business in particular. Demand for holidays to Belgium is also down, following the Brussels terrorist attacks in March. And that sent shares down to 75p, the lowest since March 2013. The London stock market has shed 50 points, or 0.8%, at the start of trading. Mining shares are leading the selloff, with silver miner Fresnillo sliding by 5%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the prospect of higher US interest rates is pushing up the US dollar, and driving down commodity prices. Other European markets are also dropping, with the German DAX shedding 1% and the French CAC down 0.5%. Most Asian stock markets are in the red today after the Federal Reserve put a June interest rate rise on the table. The Singapore and Hong Kong indices are leading the selloff Investors are baulked at the prospect of tightening of monetary policy, as Andrew Sullivan, sales trader at Haitong Securities explains (via Associated Press) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Markets have looked for government stimulus as a reason for investing rather than good company economics or fundamentals. Obviously therefore if there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s less chance of stimulus people are left wondering what to do. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yes it will be a shock to people, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure there will be a knee jerk reaction but the reality is we are nowhere near normal rates.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Only Japan has avoided any damage -- because Tokyo traders are pleased to see the yen weakening against the US dollar. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. Coming up today... We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking the reaction to last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve minutes, which showed that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank could be ready to raise interest rates next month. The Fed surprised investors by revealing that many policymakers believe a June rate hike is appropriate, if economic data over the next few weeks justifies it. As we covered in last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liveblog, the minutes of April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting showed that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Most participants judged that if incoming data were consistent with economic growth picking up in the second quarter, labor market conditions continuing to strengthen and inflation making progress toward the [Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] 2% objective, then it likely would be appropriate for the [Fed] to increase the target range for the federal funds rate in June.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And that has sent investors scrambling to adjust their expectations - as many had only expected one rate rise in 2016, or even none at all. The minutes also sent the dollar spiking last night, and is likely to weigh on European markets today. Also coming up today \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 9.30am: UK retail sales figures for April. Economists are expecting a rise of 0.7%, following a shock 1.6% tumble in March 12.30pm: The European Central Bank releases the minutes of its last meeting. Analysts will look for details of its new stimulus programme, and signs of dissent among the governing council. 1.30pm: The latest weekly US jobless report, showing how many people filed new unemployment claims last week Top Federal Reserve policymakers Stanley Fischer and William Dudley are speaking later today. 6pm: Gertjan Vlieghe, member of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee, is delivering a speech in London There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite a flurry of financial results this morning, including: Thomas Cook, Mothercare, Bloomsbury Publishing, Royal Mail, drinks firm Britvic, construction firm Balfour Beatty, financial services group Hargreaves Lansdown and asset manager 3i. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pick the most interesting bits out... There could be fireworks in Germany today, where Deutsche Bank is holding its AGM: And leading finance minister are heading to Japan, for a G7 meeting, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s any action today.",

                "bodyText":"The number of oil rigs in use in the US was unchanged last week after eight weeks of falls. Total rig numbers dropped by 2 to 404, according to the weekly Baker Hughes rig count. The two rigs cut were for gas. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the week. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back next week. After Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market falls on fears of a US interest rate rise in June, investors ended the week in a more positive mood as they decided those fears may have been overdone. Much of the previous day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s declines were regained, with banks and mining shares among the main risers. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: After charging higher at the open, London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE-100 has done a sterling effort of holding onto those gains through the session despite the abject lack of fresh fundamental data to work on. The concerns of a US rate hike that were largely responsible for driving yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off have been side lined, although the market still seems to be thinking that the chance of monetary policy tightening in June remains well below 50%. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 102.97 points or 1.7% at 6156.32, its best one day performance since the middle of April Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax jumped 1.23% to 9916.02 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac climbed 1.67% to 4353.90 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB put on 1.52% to 17,812.35 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 1.11% at 8771.2 In Greece, the Athens market added 2.76% to 639.48 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 98 points or 0.56%. As for oil, Brent crude is unchanged at the moment at $48.81 a barrel. Speaking of next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agenda: Wall Street continues to recover, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now up 104 points or 0.6%. Connor Campbell, financial analysts at Spreadex, said: A strong open from the Dow Jones ensured Europe brought its gains into the afternoon, though there was little actual reason for Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chunky growth beyond cooler heads prevailing after two days of rate-hike fearing losses. [But] the Dow Jones is still on track for one of its worst weeks (and months) in a while. Monday and Tuesday saw the index pushing 17800 thanks to the Goldman Sachs-inspired surge from Brent Crude. Yet since then the Dow has suffered, with first the best US inflation figure since February 2013, and then that surprisingly hawkish set of Fed meeting minutes from April, spooking the index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate-hike adverse investors. It will be interesting to see where the Dow is this time next week. By then the second estimate first quarter GDP reading will have been released, and without any upwards revisions to that woeful 0.5% (at the annualised rate) the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hawks may find their cause undermined by the seriously weak US growth, something that could work in the Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favour. More signs of a strong US housing market. Existing home sales rose by 1.7% in April to an annual rate of 5.45m, better than the 5.4m expected by economists. March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure was revised up from 5.33m to 5.36m. Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, said the increase signalled slowly building momentum for the housing market this spring: Primarily driven by a convincing jump in the Midwest, where home prices are most affordable, sales activity overall was at a healthy pace last month as very low mortgage rates and modest seasonal inventory gains encouraged more households to search for and close on a home. Except for in the West \u00e2\u20ac\u201d where supply shortages and stark price growth are hampering buyers the most \u00e2\u20ac\u201d sales are meaningfully higher than a year ago in much of the country. Now here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something. Tesco Bank boss Benny Higgins spent more than \u00c2\u00a318,000 on taxis in eight months despite a clampdown in costs at all the supermarket\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s operations. Sarah Butler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full story is here: The rebound in global markets continues as Wall Street opens. As investors came to terms with all the talk of a US rate rise next month, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has recovered 78 points or 0.45% in early trading. The S&amp;P 500 opened 0.25% higher and Nasdaq climbed 0.39%. A number of members of the US Federal Reserve have spent the week suggesting a rate rise in June was not off the table, which the minutes of the last meeting released on Wednesday were more hawkish than expected. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets said: William Dudley of the New York Fed [gave] the game away somewhat...when he said that market pricing of Fed hike odds was way too low prior to the minutes, which would suggest that the events of the past week or so have been predominantly a process of expectations realignment. He also suggested that a move in July was probably more likely given the proximity of the UK vote. Consumer confidence in Belgium stabilised in May after falling for four consecutive months, according to the latest survey from the National Bank of Belgium. The index stood at -8, the same as April and the Bank said: On the one hand, consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 forecasts for macroeconomic developments in Belgium have got gloomier. Fears of a rise in the unemployment rate over the next twelve months have grown considerably, while expectations about the general economic situation have been revised downwards slightly. On the other hand, households have become more optimistic about their own personal situation. They are now expecting their finances to improve a little over the coming year, and, notably, to save more money. Back with Brexit and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker has said the UK will not get friendly treatment from the EU if it votes to leave. He told Le Monde that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Deserters will not be welcomed with open arms.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd My colleague Andrew Sparrow has the details in the politics live blog: European Union commissioner Pierre Moscovici - who warned there was no Plan B in the event of Brexit - has also been talking about Greece, ahead of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote on reforms this weekend and Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurogroup meeting. He said the EU was making good progress on Greece and said he hoped to reach a global deal on Greek debt soon. Ensuring the sustainability of Greek debt was fundamental, he added. But Finnish finance minister Alexander Stubb has said the eurozone and International Monetary Fund are still far apart on Greek debt relief, and a decision on the issue on Tuesday is in doubt, Reuters is reporting. Meanwhile a Greek parliamentary committee has approved the reform measures which will be voted on on Sunday. Kathimerini reports: A multi-bill bundling together a series of reforms that Greece must legislate to unlock further rescue loans was approved by a parliamentary committee on Friday ahead of a plenary session vote on Sunday. The bill, which details a slew of new tax increases, a new privatization fund, and a contingency mechanism that would automatically cut state spending if Greece misses budget targets, was backed by leftist SYRIZA and rightwing Independent Greeks who form the governing coalition. It was opposed by opposition New Democracy as well as PASOK, the Communist Party, Potami, Union of Centrists and Golden Dawn. On Saturday the bill is to go to Parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plenary session ahead of a vote scheduled for Sunday. But four Greek unions have issued a statement criticising the tax measures in the bill, according to the Athens Macedonian news agency. Meanwhile, in China health authorities have slashed the prices of three expensive drugs made by Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca, and China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Betta Pharmaceuticals. Reuters reports: The National Health and Family Planning Commission said the cost of GSK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hepatitis B drug Viread would fall to 490 yuan ($75) a month from 1,500, while AstraZeneca\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lung cancer pill Iressa drops to 7,000 yuan from 15,000. Icotinib, another lung cancer drug made by Betta Pharmaceuticals, will come down to 5,500 from 12,000 yuan a month. The Commission said in March it would cut prices of some medicines used to treat serious diseases, including cancer, but had not named the drugs involved. GSK, which has struggled to rebuild sales in China following a damaging bribery scandal that landed it with a record fine in 2014, said it expected the lower price to stimulate increased volume sales. At the reduced price, its hepatitis drug will now be covered by Chinese reimbursement policies, which means patients will no longer have to pay the entire price out of pocket. The high cost of healthcare is a major point of contention in China, where low levels of state health insurance coverage means patients and their families often burn through savings to buy drugs to treat chronic disease. At the G7 summit in Japan, US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said the G7 finance leaders need to find ways to use all the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153policy levers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd they have to ward off a global economic slowdown. Finance ministers and heads of central banks spent Friday discussing ways to use monetary policy, government spending and longer-term reforms to help support growth. The common view among the G7 industrialised financial leaders was that while there is no one-size-fits-all approach, all economies are facing a stifling lack of demand, and the private sector must play a key role in kickstarting growth. Lew told reporters: The G-7 is meeting at a significant time not because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a time of crisis, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a time when there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of uncertainty in the global economy and there a need for us to talk to each other about what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing and what tools we have to use to promote the most balanced use of all the policy levers that we have. The Group of 20 meeting in Shanghai in February was successful because there was a renewed commitment to refrain from competitive currency devaluation to communicate closely with each other other \u00e2\u20ac\u0153so we won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t surprise each other,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said, expressing hope that the current G7 summit would be equally effective. It carries on tomorrow. The Brexit impact is still tough to quantify, says Allan Monks at JPMorgan Chase, following comments by Bank of England policy maker Kristin Forbes this morning. While signs of an EU referendum-related impact on the UK growth data have become clearer in recent weeks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a story that so many had been waiting to tell \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we have argued that there could still be other factors at work too, including a fragile global backdrop. These sentiments were echoed in comments by MPC member Kristin Forbes in an interview with the Belfast Telegraph today. Another member, Jan Vlieghe, yesterday also highlighted that policy easing cannot be dismissed even under a vote to remain \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if, for example, growth failed to recover from its current soft patch. While the relative influence of Brexit on UK growth cannot be known for sure, the extent to which the activity data are weakening ahead of the referendum will be an important factor for BoE policy decisions, whatever the outcome of the vote. European Union commissioner Pierre Moscovici has said that policymakers \u00e2\u20ac\u0153have no plan B\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if Britain voted to leave the EU in June. He told reporters on the sidelines of the G7 finance ministers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 summit in Sendai in northern Japan: We have no plan B for Brexit. Our only plan is for Britain to remain in a united Europe. Looks like something was lost in translation. A Japanese finance ministry official has clarified, again according to Reuters, that As\u00c5\ufffd meant to say that some European ministers thought it would be good for the UK to stay in the EU. Some snaps from the G7 meeting in Japan on Reuters. The EU commissioner Pierre Moscovici said the general mood among G7 countries suggested that they wanted Britain to stay in the EU. But according to the Japanese finance minister Tar\u00c5\ufffd As\u00c5\ufffd, some European countries thought Brexit would be good in the long run. We will report more details as soon as we get them. British factory output is rising at the strongest pace since August, according to a survey from the Confederation of British Industry. Order books also improved, although they continued to decline. The survey of 489 manufacturers found that a rebound in the food and drink sector, following flooding in parts of the country earlier this year, drove an increase in overall output in the three months to May. Excluding food and drink, the output balance was stable, with the other 17 manufacturing sectors showing minimal movement. Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s director of economics, said: Conditions in the manufacturing sector seem to be a little better overall, with improving order books compared with a couple of months ago. But domestic and global uncertainty remains high, alongside lacklustre export demand. Despite recent choppiness in emerging markets, China and India remain significant sources of potential demand. An exports commission would enable exporters to better exploit the growth opportunities provided by these and other growth markets. Manufacturers need to work in partnership with the Government to embrace long-term opportunities and trends, particularly in digital. A greater focus is also required on developing the right skills in the sector, managing energy costs, and encouraging further R&amp;D investment. Several European Central Bank policymakers have backed president Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wait-and-see stance today. The ECB unveiled a big stimulus package in March but several key elements, such as like corporate debt purchases and new ultra-cheap loans to banks, have yet to be implemented. Draghi called for patience last month, dampening market expectations for more stimulus. Estonian central bank chief Ardo Hansson told a conference this morning, according to Reuters: The monetary policy stance should remain broadly accommodative at this point ... [and we need] to maintain a degree of patience. A lot of accommodation that has been decided already is still in the pipeline and it will work its way through. Slovak central bank chief Jozef Makuch also saw no need for further measures. Interest rates can still be lower still and we are now testing how low they can go. But if this tool must continue to be used, then I must urge caution so [we do not] bring about a totally counterproductive threat to financial stability. The scope for deploying standard instruments is almost exhausted. As reported earlier, Benoit Coeur\u00c3\u00a9, a member of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s executive board, told a Japanese newspaper that there were no plans to further reduce the deposit rate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is in negative territory, at -0.4% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for the time being. Eurostar has said that passenger numbers have fallen in the wake of the Paris and Brussels terror attacks, as people from the US and Asia have been afraid to travel to Europe. You can read more here. And here is our full story about France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fears over the planned \u00c2\u00a321bn merger between the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche B\u00c3\u00b6rse. Oil prices are pushing higher today, getting close to six-month highs, as the global oil glut eased due to a series of production outages in Nigeria, Canada and Libya. Brent crude, the global benchmark, is now trading at $48.86 after rising to $49.26 earlier, close to the six-month high of $49.85 reached a couple of days ago. In Japan, finance ministers and central bankers from the G7 industrialised nations are gathering to discuss what to do about flagging global growth. George Osborne is there \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The pound is having a good week. It has retreated somewhat after hitting a 3 1/2 month high against a trade-weighted basket of currencies yesterday, but remains on track for its best weekly performance in nearly 10 months \u00e2\u20ac\u201c up 2% this week. Sterling has been boosted by strong retail sales numbers for April and an opinion poll suggesting that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd camp had extended its lead ahead of the 23 June referendum on EU membership. An Ipsos-Mori poll found 55% of those surveyed supported staying in the EU, while just 37% wanted to leave. An open letter by 250 British celebrities including Benedict Cumberbatch and Helena Bonham Carter appears to have had little impact on markets. The actors, musicians, writers and artists warned that if Britain were to leave the European Union it would become \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an outsider shouting from the wings\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The planned \u00c2\u00a321bn merger between the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche B\u00c3\u00b6rse raises competition concerns, the French finance minister, Michel Sapin, has said. His comments echoed those made by economy minister Emmanuel Macron in February, but Sapin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments carry more weight as he is in charge of banking and financial industry issues in France. The proposed merger would create a group similar in scale to ICE, which owns the New York stock exchange and has taken a big slice of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s derivatives markets, and would leave smaller European rivals such as Euronext Paris far behind. ICE, which initially said it was considering a bid for the LSE, ruled itself out earlier this month. Sapin told Reuters: I want to express the concern of the French government on this tie-up. We have doubts about the consequences this could have for the financing of the real economy in France and Europe.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The merger of these two entities will result in a large group which could hold within it a majority of the tools that make our markets function efficiently. That poses a competition problem, and we want to make sure the European Commission gets involved to avoid a situation where a dominant position arises. European stock markets have opened higher, as expected. FTSE 100 index in London up 85 points, or 1.4%, at 6138.36 CAC 40 in Paris up 56 points, or 1.4%, at 4343.15 Dax in Frankfurt up nearly 118 points, or 1.2%, at 9913.57 Here in Britain, Ladbrokes and Coral could be forced to sell up to 400 betting shops if the \u00c2\u00a32.3bn merger of the two bookmakers is to go ahead, the competition regulator has said. The Competition and Markets Authority said the proposed merger between Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second and third largest betting shop chains would reduce choice for customers in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a large number of local areas\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. You can read the full story here. Turning to corporate news... Deutsche Bank suffered a damaging investor revolt over executive pay last night. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest lender held its annual meeting in Frankfurt yesterday, where more than half of shareholders (51.9%) voted against a new pay scheme for its top executives, and just 48.1% backed it. The vote was non-binding, however. Under the pay plan, in addition to bonuses linked to the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and their own performance, divisional heads will also get a bonus linked to their division\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance. Chairman Paul Achleitner suggested that the bank would take the vote into account when implementing the pay plan. A shareholder proposal for a special audit of whether top managers breached their obligations in how they handled the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s litigation issues was narrowly rejected \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 46.4% of investors voted in favour, and 53.6% against. You can view the voting results here, and listen to the speeches made at the AGM. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive John Cryan said the bank expected further big legal costs this year related to a series of scandals (such as Libor) that have damaged its reputation and hurt profits \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but is getting closer to the end of its litigation nightmare. I am cautiously confident that we are gradually approaching the home straight as far as our litigation is concerned. The bank has set aside \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5.4bn to settle pending litigation this year. Cryan, a Brit, spoke in German \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which went down well with shareholders, according to Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. A Bank of England policymaker, Kristin Forbes, has said that the central bank had no concrete evidence that recent weaker UK economic data was all related to uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the 23 June referendum on EU membership. She told the Belfast Telegraph during a visit to Northern Ireland that she believed the uncertainty was weighing on businesses and their investment plans, and that any doubts could be lifted quite quickly if there is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd vote. But she added: We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have concrete evidence that some of the softening we are seeing now is all referendum-related and uncertainty related, and there is a chance other things are going on. Meanwhile, a senior International Monetary Fund official said last night that negotiations on a new bailout programme for Greece should focus on a long grace period and maturity extensions along with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very low interest rates\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. IMF chief spokesman Gerry Rice also said that the fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t approve a new bailout unless it contains debt relief measures from European lenders along with policies to boost Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal savings. He declined for confirm reports that the IMF is pushing for a pause in Greek debt repayments until 2020. He said at a regular weekly briefing: We have exchanged preliminary views with our partners on general principles regarding debt relief. We believe that it is possible to restore debt sustainability without upfront haircuts, although this would involve providing very concessional loan terms, including long grace and maturity periods and very low interest rates. Eurozone finance ministers are due to meet next Tuesday to try to hammer out a deal with Greece on a package of steps to ensure Athens meets future fiscal targets, with hopes for a political agreement on future debt relief for Greece. A European Central Bank policymaker has poured cold water on hopes that the central bank could cut interest rates further. Benoit Coeur\u00c3\u00a9, member of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s executive board, said there are no plans to reduce the deposit rate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is in negative territory, at -0.4% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for the time being. The negative deposit rate, effectively a charge on banks for hoarding cash, has been criticised by banks and investors for squeezing their profits and distorting financial markets. Coeur\u00c3\u00a9 said that banks had largely benefited from the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s loose monetary policy and that markets continued to work smoothly. He told Japanese newspaper The Yomiuri Shimbun: It is in principle possible to cut this rate further, but there is currently no plan to do so. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. Signs of hawkishness among US Federal Reserve members sent global markets tumbling yesterday, marking another disappointing week for stocks. US markets finished lower but recovered from the lows hit earlier in the day. Asian stock markets rose overnight, with Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng up 1.2% and Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei closing 0.5% higher. European markets are expected to take their cue from Asia and open higher. The meeting of G7 finance ministers and central bankers kicks off in Sendai in Japan today, where will be discussing ways of breathing life into the sluggish global economy as well as risks from a potential \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.",

On Wednesday morning, Perez boarded Air Force Two and with Vice-President Joe Biden and flew to Columbus, Ohio, where they made the official public announcement inside <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://jenis.com/\">Jeni\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Splendid Ice Creams</a>.</p> <p>The new rule has been described by some as second only to the Affordable Care Act in its ability to affect the wellbeing of working- and middle-class Americans. Perez, who has been at the head of the US Department of Labor for nearly three years, has made the overtime rule a priority even as he has toured the country speaking to workers and advocating for other worker-friendly policies such as higher minimum wages at the local, state and federal level. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/17/obama-overtime-pay-new-rule\">Millions could get a raise under Obama administration's new overtime rules</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With two-thirds of a year left until the new president is sworn in, Perez still has an intimidating list of unfinished business \u00e2\u20ac\u201c paid leave, auto-enrolling US workers into 401K or other pension programs and a higher minimum wage among others\u00e2\u20ac\u201c that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to accomplish. As the election nears, he may have even more on his plate: Perez is said to be a potential vice-presidential pick.</p> <p>He is clearly unafraid of a challenge. Big business has come out swinging against his changes to paid leave. Perez is unfazed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are the only industrialized nation on the planet that does not have some form of paid leave. We are the only industrialized nation where paid leave is a partisan issue,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Perez said. </p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I got in trouble recently because I said: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe United States and Papua New Guinea are the only nations on the planet that do not have some form of paid leave.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Someone approached me after and said: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHey, I am from Papua New Guinea and we have been taking an initiative.

                "bodyText":"It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a busy week for the US labor secretary, Tom Perez. On Tuesday night, the White House announced that the Obama administration had finalized a new rule that could potentially expand overtime benefits to 4.2 million more Americans. On Wednesday morning, Perez boarded Air Force Two and with Vice-President Joe Biden and flew to Columbus, Ohio, where they made the official public announcement inside Jeni\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Splendid Ice Creams. The new rule has been described by some as second only to the Affordable Care Act in its ability to affect the wellbeing of working- and middle-class Americans. Perez, who has been at the head of the US Department of Labor for nearly three years, has made the overtime rule a priority even as he has toured the country speaking to workers and advocating for other worker-friendly policies such as higher minimum wages at the local, state and federal level. With two-thirds of a year left until the new president is sworn in, Perez still has an intimidating list of unfinished business \u00e2\u20ac\u201c paid leave, auto-enrolling US workers into 401K or other pension programs and a higher minimum wage among others\u00e2\u20ac\u201c that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to accomplish. As the election nears, he may have even more on his plate: Perez is said to be a potential vice-presidential pick. He is clearly unafraid of a challenge. Big business has come out swinging against his changes to paid leave. Perez is unfazed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are the only industrialized nation on the planet that does not have some form of paid leave. We are the only industrialized nation where paid leave is a partisan issue,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Perez said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I got in trouble recently because I said: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe United States and Papua New Guinea are the only nations on the planet that do not have some form of paid leave.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Someone approached me after and said: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHey, I am from Papua New Guinea and we have been taking an initiative. Stop dissing New Guinea.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 So I want to note my own error and apologize for dissing New Guinea. We are alone as a nation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A good listener \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tom Perez has guts,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Michael Subin, executive director of the Montgomery County\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criminal justice coordinating commission. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When he sees injustice, he is not afraid to take on those committing the injustice.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Subin and Perez worked together in the early 2000s when Perez served as a member and then a president of the Montgomery County council. Together they proposed the Perez-Subin bill that sought to limit predatory lending. According to Subin, Perez knows how to get things done. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Lot of legislators don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand what they have to do and how the system works best. He was able to get things done because he was able to work with people,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He understood what they were looking for, what their issues might have been regarding specific pieces of legislation. And he listened.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mary Kay Henry, president of the SEIU \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one of the largest labor unions in the US \u00e2\u20ac\u201c enjoys working with Perez because \u00e2\u20ac\u0153he gets us\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to explain struggles that people have. He is often telling me stories of people he has just met \u00e2\u20ac\u201c about how they are stitching together two or three jobs to make ends meet and that we have to stop it. What are we going to do together to get things right? He has really been a privilege to work with.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd One morning early in May, Perez made his way to Brooklyn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sunset Park neighborhood to visit UnCommonGoods, an online and catalogue retailer. In a small conference room, six workers sat awaiting his arrival. Most of them had started at UnCommonGoods as seasonal workers and have then transitioned into permanent positions, quickly climbing the ladder within the company.

Spotting one of the workers with a staff-designed handheld scanner, he said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Can I see your gun for a minute?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As the employee handed it over, Perez looked it over and posed for photos. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so elegant,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said handing it back. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Show me what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing here?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Later that day, Perez would go on to visit the kitchen of The Modern \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one of Danny Meyer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurants with a no-tipping policy. He is as comfortable in a kitchen as he is in a warehouse, in a hard hat on a construction site or bending pipes in a garage.

Perez \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who has at times joined Clinton on the campaign trail \u00e2\u20ac\u201c insists he is focused on his day job. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Every engagement that I have had with him, he knows the number of days left in the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s term,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Henry. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The thing I admire in him is that even though speculation is happening, he remains laser-focused on trying to implement the fair pay and safe workplaces executive orders that we worked for six years to come to light. He is completely indefatigable on making sure that anything on his plate gets his full attention before he ends the term.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd On Friday, while speaking to a room of journalists, Perez once again dodged a question about his possible vice-presidency. The comments came after he said mass deportation proposals floated by some Republicans \u00e2\u20ac\u0153won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and added that he was confident the US government was going to pass comprehensive immigration reform in the next year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keep demonizing the largest growing population in America and think that that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good strategy for growth,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said, pointing to the naturalization movement in immigrant communities. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Immigration reformation is long overdue.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Spoken like a vice-presidential nominee,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd quipped Bernie Kohn of Bloomberg News. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have not been approached,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Perez, dodging the question. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I like my day job. Actually, I love my day job, what I am doing every day. I have 245 days until the weekend. I have a little sign on my desk, not because I want to count the days but because I want to make all the days count.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd",

Larry Elliott writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>The International Monetary Fund called for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153upfront\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unconditional\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd debt relief for Greece as it warned that without immediate action the financial plight of the recession-ravaged country would deteriorate dramatically over the coming decades.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=43915.0\">In a strongly-worded assessment</a>, the Fund said that there was no prospect of Greece meeting the draconian terms of its current bail-out plan and that debt interest payments on the soaring national debt would eat up 60% of the budget by 2060 in the absence of debt forgiveness.</p> <p>The debt sustainability analysis by the Washington-based IMF said Greece should have longer to pay, have the interest rate on its loans fixed at 1.5%, and that its creditors should make debt relief automatic once the bail out programme ends in 2018.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The implementation of debt relief should be completed by the end of the program period\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the IMF said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Providing an upfront unconditional component to debt relief is critical to provide a strong and credible signal to markets about the commitment of official creditors to ensuring debt sustainability, which in itself could contribute to lowering market financing costs. An upfront component can also help garner more ownership for reforms.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>The hard-hitting nature of the report makes it clear to the EU that the IMF will not be prepared to put its own money into the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac86bn bail out unless Germany and other eurozone countries ease their hardline stance towards Greece.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening.

                "bodyText":"Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our report on the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Greek comments ahead of Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurogroup meeting. Larry Elliott writes: The International Monetary Fund called for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153upfront\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unconditional\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd debt relief for Greece as it warned that without immediate action the financial plight of the recession-ravaged country would deteriorate dramatically over the coming decades. In a strongly-worded assessment, the Fund said that there was no prospect of Greece meeting the draconian terms of its current bail-out plan and that debt interest payments on the soaring national debt would eat up 60% of the budget by 2060 in the absence of debt forgiveness. The debt sustainability analysis by the Washington-based IMF said Greece should have longer to pay, have the interest rate on its loans fixed at 1.5%, and that its creditors should make debt relief automatic once the bail out programme ends in 2018. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The implementation of debt relief should be completed by the end of the program period\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the IMF said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Providing an upfront unconditional component to debt relief is critical to provide a strong and credible signal to markets about the commitment of official creditors to ensuring debt sustainability, which in itself could contribute to lowering market financing costs. An upfront component can also help garner more ownership for reforms.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The hard-hitting nature of the report makes it clear to the EU that the IMF will not be prepared to put its own money into the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac86bn bail out unless Germany and other eurozone countries ease their hardline stance towards Greece. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a link to the IMF report: Despite the prospect of Greece finally receiving much needed bailout cash, most European markets have ended the day lower, with commodity stocks on the slide again. An imminent rise in US interest rates was one of the factors, helping lift the dollar and hitting metal and oil prices. But Greece was an exception, with the Athens market up 1.5% and ten year bond yields falling to six month low. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 19.89 points or 0.32% to 6136.43 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 0.74% to 9842.29 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.66% at 4325.10 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 2.74% to 17,325.08 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 0.65% lower at 8714.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.5% to 649.10 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently virtually unchanged, up just 6 points. More from the IMF staff report on Greece: In all key policy areas\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfiscal, financial sector stability, labor, product and service markets\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe authorities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 current policy plans fall well short of what would be required to achieve their ambitious fiscal and growth targets. Consequently, staff believes that a realignment of assumptions with the evident political and social constraints on the pace and scope of adjustment is needed, and it has revised the DSA assumptions for the primary balance and growth. It has cut its primary surplus estimate from 3.5% of GDP to 1.5% and its long term growth assumption to 1.25%: [The primary surplus] target would in staff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view be within the realm of what is plausible, although it remains ambitious in as much as it requires the fiscal adjustment to be underpinned by much stronger support for reforms and much stronger resolve by policy making institutions, in Greece and at the European level, than currently evident. Two more US Federal Reserve members have added to the recent chorus suggesting a possible rate rise in June or July. San Francisco Fed president John Williams indicated a rise would not be delayed much longer, despite risks such as the possibility of the UK voting to leave the European Union. Williams told reporters (quotes from Reuters): [Brexit is] a factor in the decision for June obviously because you have an event right after, and we can obviously hold off until July if we wanted. But of course we could also make a decision to raise rates at a meeting and if later on economic conditions for the US change, we can always move interest rates back down. Earlier St Louis Fed president James Bullard said keeping rates too low for too long could cause financial instability in future. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: The Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bullard and Williams reiterated the new more hawkish stance of the Fed, though data showing a bigger than expected fall in manufacturing activity didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t support their calls. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current policy plans fall well short of what is needed to achieve fiscal and growth targets, according to the International Monetary Fund. In a staff report ahead of Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurogroup meeting, the IMF said Greece needs a substantial reprofiling of the terms of its European loans, and debt relief must be unconditional. But revised targets for economic growth and its primary budget surplus could meet the criteria for receiving IMF support, it said. Even before the growing signs that Greece may finally receive its long awaited bailout funds, eurozone consumer confidence improved for the second month in a row. The May figure came in at -7.0 compared to -9.3 the previous month and better than the -9.0 which had been expected, according to the European Commission. In the European Union as a whole, consumer sentiment rose by 1.1 points to -5.7. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something for the Fed to ponder as it wonders when to raise rates. The Markit provisional manufacturing PMI for May has fallen from a final 50.8 in April to 50.5. Analysts had been expecting a figure of 51. This is the worst level for more than six years. Stock markets continue to drift, with Wall Street opening marginally higher while European shares slip back. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up just 10 points as investors hold fire ahead of further clues as to whether the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 has dipped 0.27% while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is down 0.6% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac is 0.8% lower. But in Greece, the Athens market continues to benefit from hopes that Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurogroup meeting will release much needed bailout funds, following the weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parliamentary vote approving the latest package of austerity measures. It is currently up 1.76% while bond yields continue to fall. Ten year Greek bond yields have dropped around 28 basis points to 7.34%, a six month low. Two year yields are down 100 basis points to 8.51%. The cost of insuring Greek debt against default in terms of five year credit default swaps has fallen to a six month low. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reminder of the breakdown of Greek debt, from the Financial Times: Last summer, European officials worried that Greece might break off ties with Europe in favour of a new arrangement with Russia. So they might be interested to hear that Russian President Vladimir Putin is paying a visit to the Hellenic Republic on May 27-28. (Friday and Saturday). The Kremlin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press service reports that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[Putin] will meet Prokopis Pavlopoulos, the president of the Hellenic Republic, andPrime Minister Alexis Tsipras. The summit talks are expected to dwell on key issues of bilateral trade, economic and investment interaction, including the implementation of joint energy and transport projects.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Those joint energy projects could includes a landmark \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2bn gas deal which the two countries outlined last July \u00e2\u20ac\u201c days before the third Greek bailout was agreed. Tass, the Russian newswire, says the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upcoming visit will also pay \u00e2\u20ac\u0153special attention\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to cultural and humanitarian cooperation, while Putin and the Greek leaders will exchange views on urgent international and regional problems. AFP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Danny Kemp reckons eurozone finance ministers may take notice.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the mood on the streets of Athens today after MPs approved the latest package of austerity measures: And they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a point. Last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153omnibus bill\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd includes: Raising VAT to 24%, from 23% Increasing fuel consumption tax A special tax on cigarettes, tobacco and electronic cigarettes A new levy on craft beer A new tax on imported coffee Consumption taxes on fuel and natural gas use A new overnight accommodation tax for hotels. Some measures are implemented in July; others don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t kick in until 2017. Campaigners are concerned that the plans for Greek debt relief are far too modest. Eurozone finance ministers are due to discuss the issue tomorrow, and consider whether to extend the grace period on Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bonds and give Athens more time to repay. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s part of the pledge made when the current bailout was agreed last summer. There are also reports that the eurozone could buy up \u00e2\u201a\u00ac14bn of Greek bonds held by the IMF, to get around the Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns over Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt sustainability (the FT has a good take) But the Jubilee Debt Campaign argues that much more dramatic action is needed. Otherwise, according to the eurogroup\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own forecasts, Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt repayments will hit 30% of government revenue in 2019, fall to 20% in the early 2020s, then rising back over 30% after 2040. Instead, they believe Greece should get the same kind of deal that Germany got in the 1950s, which pegged its debt servicing costs at less than 4% of government income. Sarah-Jayne Clifton, Director of the Jubilee Debt Campaign said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greece needs a reduction in debt payments now to help tackle the humanitarian crisis in the country. A significant amount of debt needs to be cancelled, not just rescheduled, if the Greek economy is going to have the breathing space it needs to recover. And the costs of cancelling the debt should be recovered from the real beneficiaries of bailout loans, including the German, French and British banks that lent recklessly to Greece in the first place.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Despite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally, Greek debt is still pretty risky: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some other developments across business this morning: Angela Merkel and Alexis Tsipras have held their meeting in Istanbul: Back in the markets, money is pouring into short-dated Greek bonds. The yield on Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two-year debt has fallen to 8.5%, down from 9.5% on Friday night. Such a big drop in borrowing costs shows that traders are expecting Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout tranche to be signed off in Brussels tomorrow. Greek media are reporting that prime minister Tsipras will meet with German chancellor Angela Merkel shortly, in Istanbul. Both leaders are in the Turkish capital for a major international summit on the refugee crisis, that will consider how to improve the international humanitarian aid system. Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is hosting the summit, is calling on European countries to take more Syrian refugees. Writing in the Guardian today, Erdogan argues Turkey is doing more than its fair share: Having adopted an open-door policy towards Syrian refugees in 2011, we now host nearly 3 million Syrian nationals from diverse ethnic, religious and sectarian backgrounds. In the past five years Turkey has allocated $10bn to provide Syrian refugees with free healthcare, education and housing. At a time when the international community failed the Syrian people \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 600,000 of whom have lost their lives in the civil war, with 13 million forced from their homes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Turkey, along with the rest of Syria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s neighbours, was left to deal with the conflict\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consequences. As the Syrian civil war enters its sixth year, we are calling on the world to create a fair mechanism for sharing the burden. But some aid agencies doubt whether the summit will yield any real progress; with M\u00c3\u00a9decins Sans Fronti\u00c3\u00a8res calling it a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fig-leaf\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for international failures. More here. EU Economic Affairs commissioner Pierre Moscovici has welcomed Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to approve further austerity measures last night, despite public opposition. The AFP newswire has the details: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A key step has been taken... towards the conclusion of the first stage of the Greek programme,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Moscovici said in Paris, a day after Greek lawmakers voted in favour of spending cuts and tax hikes. Eurozone finance ministers are set to discuss easing Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt burden and disbursing the next round of funds at a closely-watched Eurogroup meeting in Brussels on Tuesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I hope and wish for an agreement at the Eurogroup meeting,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told a news conference. Bloomberg are reporting that eurozone finance ministers are planning to hand Greece \u00e2\u201a\u00ac11bn of bailout funds tomorrow. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to a draft version of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurogroup statement, seen by the newswire: Greek banks are among the best-performing shares in Athens this morning: Greek government bonds have hit their highest level in six months, after MPs approved last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s austerity package. The yield, or interest rate, on Greek 10-year debt has fallen to 7.4%, from 7.2% on Friday night. As this chart shows, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the lowest since last November: Yields fall when bond prices rises, so traders are prepared to pay a higher price for Greek debt today. And the cost of insuring those bonds against default has also dropped this morning, following the news that the package of tax rises and economic reforms has been agreed. That suggests investors are confident that eurozone finance ministers will sign off on its bailout review on Tuesday, unlocking fresh bailout loans for Greece. The Greek stock market is also rallying. The main ASE index has jumped 1% in early trading, defying the selloff in other markets. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets expect the Eurogroup to agree to release bailout funds tomorrow, allowing Greece to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153meet forthcoming debt repayments and clear arrears which have built up as the review has dragged on.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This slowdown in Eurozone growth rather undermines critics of the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus measures. So suggests Carsten Brzeski of Dutch bank ING: Ouch. Growth across Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector has slowed to a sixteen-month low. The eurozone composite PMI calculated by Markit, just released, has inched down to 52.9 from 53.0 in April. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprising, given the decent numbers from France and Germany this morning. But it appears that other areas of the eurozone struggled: Eurozone firms reported the smallest rise in new business since January 2015, even though many cut prices to encourage sales. Happily, though, employment levels did rise. But Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, warns that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery appears to be slowing: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are signs of improving life in the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 countries of France and Germany, led mainly by their service sectors, as manufacturing continued to struggle. However, elsewhere the rate of expansion slowed to its weakest for almost one-and-a-half years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The survey therefore paints a picture of a region stuck in a low-growth phase, managing to eke out frustratingly modest output and employment gains despite various ECB stimulus \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbazookas\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, a competitive exchange rate and households benefitting from falling prices.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets are suffering a dose of Monday morning blues. The main indices are all down, amid disappointment that global finance ministers didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take any decisive action at their G7 meeting over the weekend. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE has shed 23 points, or 0.4%, while there are bigger losses in France and Germany. And in Italy, the stock market has shed 2.8%, led by banking stocks. Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct explains: The weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s G7 meeting wrapped up with a lack of consensus and this appears to be very much setting the pace right now. Finance ministers did debate the risks facing the global economy, but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree any new stimulus packages. Perhaps they were too busy wondering why Japanese central bank chief Haruhiko Kurodo decided to pat George Osborne on the bottom.... May is also looking like a good month for German companies. Markit reports that growth across Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector has hit a three-month high. Its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccomposite PMI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, which tracks output across the German economy, has jumped to 54.7, up from 53.6 in April (any reading over 50 shows expansion). Good news from France....its private sector is growing at the fastest rate in seven months. Markit, the data firm, reports that new business has picked up, encouraging French firms to take on more staff. This pushed up the French composite index up to 51.1 for May, from 50.2 in April. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the highest level since last October - shortly before the Paris terrorism attacks. The service sector led the way, with companies reporting faster growth. The factory sector lagged behind, but at least it contracted at a slower rate: Flash France Services Activity Index climbs to 51.8 (50.6 in April), 7-month Flash France Manufacturing PMI rises to 48.3 (48.0 in April), 2-month high Fred Ducrozet, economist at Swiss bank Pictet, says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good performance: Last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t without incident. One government MP, Vassiliki Katrivanou, refused to back parts of the package, saying Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lenders were taking too much control. Katrivanou has now resigned, meaning she can be replaced as an MP - leaving Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s narrow majority of 155 MPs, out of 300, intact. Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras cut a defiant figure at last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote. He told MPs that this latest package of austerity is the last one: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greeks have already paid a lot, but this is probably the first time that the possibility of these sacrifices being the last is so evident.... Tsipras also gave eurozone finance ministers a dig in the ribs to sign off Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout funds at Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153European leaders will receive a message tonight, that Greece fulfils its obligations. Tomorrow, the other side must also take responsibility.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But outside the parliament, protesters demonstrated against the package of tax rises and reforms: One demonstrator, 60-year old businessman Panayiotis Kehris, told Reuters: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a disaster! We will cut down on everything, from food to driving.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. Greece is on the brink of receiving a much-needed dose of bailout, after its parliament agreed to the latest batch of austerity measure to be piled on its already weakened economy. Last night MPs in Athens approved the package, which includes \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.8bn in tax increases, VAT hiked from 23% to 24%, and a new privatization fund. That should be enough to allow eurozone finance ministers to sign off much-needed bailout payment to Greece when they meet in Brussels tomorrow. That would ease fears of another summer of Greek drama, with Athens struggling to meet debt repayments. It should also trigger more detailed discussions about debt relief. But as our correspondent Helena Smith reports, these latest restrictions on Greece are the toughest yet: The belt-tightening legislation, outlined in a 7,500-page omnibus bill, includes measures that range from the taxation of coffee and luxury goods to the creation of a new privatisation fund in charge of real estate assets for the next 99 years. Under the stewardship of EU officials, the body will oversee the sale of about 71,500 pieces of prime public property in what will amount to collateral for the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac250bn in bailout loans Greece has received since 2010. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They are with the exception of the Acropolis selling everything under the sun,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Anna Asimakopoulou, the shadow minister for development and competitiveness. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are giving up everything.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But some big problems remain, including whether the International Monetary Fund will take the plunge and support Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current bailout. Germany demands the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s involvement, but balks at the Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key demand \u00e2\u20ac\u201c substantial debt relief for Athens. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the reaction to last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote, and the build-up to tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurogroup meeting. Also coming up today... On the economic front, data firm Markit is releasing its latest PMI reports, showing how the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sectors are faring this month. We also get the latest measure of consumer morale across the euroarea. 8am: Flash French manufacturing PMI for May 8.30am: Flash German manufacturing PMI for May 9am: Flash eurozone manufacturing PMI for May 3pm: Eurozone consumer confidence for May. The markets? They look rather quiet this morning, with IG calling the FTSE 100 index up just 4 points. And on the corporate front, budget airline Ryanair is reporting results. It has just posted profits to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.242bn for the last financial year -- a 43% jump, but not enough",

ANA says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On the issue of the country\u2019s debt, the distance between the IMF and Germany is still great and the aim is to achieve greater convergence today. The Commission source said that after pressure by the IMF, the weight has shifted towards measures that will be taken in the short term.

IMF policy is determined by its shareholders (represented by the board), rather than its staff. Politics matter much more to the former. And there is little enthusiasm in Germany for debt relief which would be hard to sell to the country\u2019s voters.</p> <p>On the other hand the Eurogroup will be unwilling to risk a crisis that could break up the Euro in the run-up to the UK Brexit vote on 23 June and the Spanish elections on 26 June, so arguably today\u2019s meeting is the IMF\u2019s best chance to use its negotiating power to force the concessions it believes are necessary.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Cebr sees two ways the situation could develop:</p> <blockquote> <p>1. The IMF backs off and avoids confrontation with the Europeans. This would continue the \u201cextend and pretend\u201d strategy that has governed the Greek crisis since it started. This would most certainly be bad for the Greek economy, as the IMF staff\u2019s projections show. And, it could prove very damaging to Europe as it raises the likelihood of a default and Grexit further down the line \u2013 meaning that debt owed to European taxpayers (including in the UK) would never be repaid.</p> <p>2. The IMF plays hardball and poses a painful dilemma to the Europeans. This would certainly be risky. A failure to agree could lead to another Eurozone crisis, possibly a Grexit. But it is in everyone\u2019s interest that this is avoided. The debt relief itself need not take the form of an outright haircut. Some form of reprofiling, as outlined in the IMF\u2019s DSA could do the trick.

                "bodyText":"Eurozone ministers are finally heading to their beds, and the frazzled Brussels press pack are heroically filing copy. So let\u2019s have a brief recap. Greece has finally received the green light to receive more than \u20ac10bn in bailout funds, easing concerns that it could face financial peril this summer. After a marathon meeting in the Belgian capital, creditors agreed that Greece has done pretty-much everything required under its bailout A few prior actions do remain, concerning pensions and privatisations, but once that is resolved, the money will flow -- starting with \u20ac7.5bn in June. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem told reporters that Greece\u2019s programme was back on track. \u201cWe achieved a major breakthrough on Greece which enables us to enter a new phase in the Greek financial assistance programme,....This is stretching what I thought would have been possible not so long ago.\u201d In an important development, the International Monetary Fund has signalled that it could join the bailout. That could happen by the end fo 2016. However, European chief Poul Thomsen insisted that the Fund must check that the eurozone is offering substantial debt relief. Thomsen said: We welcome that all stakeholders recognise that Greek debt is unsustainable. We welcome that it is understood that Greece needs debt relief to make it sustainable. Crucially, Eurozone ministers have agreed to \u201ca package of debt measures\u201d to make Greece\u2019s debts sustainable. That will start with short-term tweaks to Greece\u2019s debts, to smooth out its obligations. Medium-term measures are also promised, although not until 2018, which looks like a concession from the IMF. There is also a commitment to consider whether further restructuring will be needed once the bailout ends, assuming Athens sticks to the programme and everything works out. The deal has been welcomed by Greece\u2019s finance minister. Euclid Tsakalotos said it would help end the country\u2019s vicious circle of austerity and recession. Donald Tusk, the head of the European Council, said the Greek deal was good for the global economy. Slovakia\u2019s finance minister Peter Kazimir also sounded satisfied, comparing the negotiations to \u201ca complicated birth\u201d. And France\u2019s Michel Sapin was positively upbeat, saying the deal was \u201cfirst and foremost a declaration of confidence in today\u2019s Greece.\u201d Some questions remain, over the details of the debt relief, whether it will satisfy the IMF, and whether Greece can ever exit its financial crisis while sticking to the tough terms of its bailout. We\u2019ll consider them tomorrow later today. Until then, goodnight! GW It\u2019s late, but Bruno\u2019s brain is still whirring. Greek finance chief Tsakalotos added: \u201cI think there is some ground for optimism that this can be the beginning of turning Greece\u2019s vicious circle of recession-measures-recession into one where investors have a clear runway to invest in Greece. (via Reuters) Down the corridor, Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has told reporters that today\u2019s deal is an \u2018important moment\u2019 (echoing Dijsselbloem, Thomsen and Moscovici) Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, has hailed the agreement - which comes as world leaders head to Japan for a G7 meeting. And finally.... Jeroen Dijsselbloem insists that the eurozone would not \u2018go it alone\u2019 without the International Monetary Fund. If, hypothetically speaking, the Fund found it couldn\u2019t back the package then the two sides would work together to find a solution, he says, promising that: We will stay in close co-operation with the IMF. And that, blessedly, is the end of the press conference, at almost 3am in Brussels. Ah.... Bruno Waterfield of the Times is concerned that the measures agreed tonight aren\u2019t actually quantified. Why not? Poul Thomsen says Europe can deliver the measures which the IMF has been calling for. He agreed that they need to be quantified, before the Fund can come on board. The key is that Greece must be able to stand on its own at the end of the programme period (in 2018) And Thomsen warns that he will not ask the Fund\u2019s board to join the bailout programme otherwise. Q: When will the eurozone decide the details of medium-term debt relief? Not until after the German elections? Dijsselbloem claims he doesn\u2019t know when those elections are! (I think they could be in August 2017, or later). He then explains that the Greek deal expires in 2018 - so if the programme is completed, we will draw up a new debt sustainability analysis. He also insists that the package hammered out for Greece is truly ambitious, Ministers have \u201cstretched their political capital\u201d to get this deal on the table, Dijsselbloem adds. Q: Today\u2019s debt relief measures seem weaker than what the IMF has been proposing, so is there a danger that it fails your debt sustainability test? Poul Thomsen says the IMF will assess the latest proposals (online here) and see if they go far enough. [On Monday, the IMF argued that the eurozone should grant Greece debt relied until 2040 -- today\u2019s measures don\u2019t go that far] Onto questions. Q: What has to happen before Greece receives its bailout funds? ESM chief Klaus Regling says some additional steps are needed on privatisations, pensions and non-performing loans. Now the IMF\u2019s European chief, Poul Thomsen, speaks! He says the Fund welcomes the \u201cimportant package of measures\u201d which Greece has adopted. All sides have had to compromise. And Thomsen then turns to the big issue - debt relief. We welcome that all stakeholders recognise that Greek debt is unsustainable. We welcome that it is understood that Greece needs debt relief to make it sustainable. And we welcome that there is agreement on the methodology and the objectives of what debt relief will achieve. The IMF will now spend some time analysing the short-term debt relief measures being taken. And crucially he confirms that IMF staff will recommend joining the bailout by the end of 2016, as long as the debt sustainability analysis shows that the measures on the table will work. Ultimately, though, it\u2019s a decision for the Fund\u2019s board. Onto the details.... The boss of the ESM bailout fund, Klaus Regling, says Greece needs to complete the outstanding \u2018prior actions\u2019 previously agreed with its lenders. Then national governments must give their approval, before the first portion of the bailout funds - worth 7.5 billion euros -- can be handed over in June. European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici says the eurogroup has reached a good agreement. It opens the way to rebuild confidence and create a \u201clasting economic recovery in Greece\u201d. Moscovici adds: It is a very important moment in this long and sometimes difficult journey\u201d Sometimes?! Curious metaphor alert, from the Slovakian finance minister: The Eurogroup\u2019s statement is online here: Eurogroup statement on Greece It confirms that Greece will receive its bailout loans, that the eurozone will offer debt relief, and that IMF officials are planning to recommend that they join the Greek bailout programme. The key points: Dijsselbloem sounds quite cheerful, telling reporters that this is an important moment in the long Greek saga. Confidence has begun to recover since the drama of last summer, and he extends his thanks to Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos and his staff. We have entered a new phase, and I welcome that very much, Dijsselbloem concludes. In another important development, Dijsselbloem says that that IMF is on board with the Greek bailout. He explains that the Fund\u2019s management have agreed to recommend a new financial arrangement for Athens before the end of this year. Eurogroup president Dijsselbloem says ministers have agreed a range of debt relief measures for Greece. In the short term, these relate to \u2018debt management\u2019 - smoothing Greece\u2019s repayments to avoid any shocks. Medium-term measures will kick in from mid-2018, when Greece\u2019s bailout expires (assuming Athens complies with its demands). He also explains that profits which the European Central Bank has made on Greek bonds will be returned to Athens, to help with debt sustainability. This decision eases concerns that Greece could default over the summer. However, most of this new loan will be returned to Greece\u2019s creditors, of course, or used to cover outstanding government bills. It\u2019s official! Jeroen Dijsselbloem confirms that the eurozone\u2019s bailout vehicle has agreed to extend \u20ac10.3bn of bailout loans to Greece. But as rumoured earlier, the aid will be handed over in several instalments, not in one lump. Dijsselbloem says: This is very good news... the programme is fully back on track. Greece is delivering a lot, and we are making good progress. Jeroen Dijsselboem has arrived at the press conference, rubbing his hands. And excitingly, IMF chief Poul Thomsen is there too. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem is about to hold a press conference about the meeting. It\u2019s being streamed live, here (right-click to open in a new tab) AFP are now reporting that the eurogroup has done enough to unlock its long-awaited bailout funds: Michel Sapin has also declared that the IMF is part of this deal with Greece, which covers short, medium and long-term debt relief (Reuters reports) French finance minister Michel Sapin says a deal has been struck with Greece, according to a newsflash on Reuters. It\u2019s official, the eurogroup meeting had concluded! And there are reports that an agreement has been reached between the eurozone and the IMF on Greek debt relief, and reforms. Remember that Zorba the Greek tune we mentioned earlier? Apparently it was played to the eurogroup! Hang in there.... the latest word is that the meeting might *finally* be over. Current state of play: The clocks have now chimed 1am in Brussels, and the eurogroup meeting still grinds on. We\u2019re expecting a press conference at some stage, meaning ministers won\u2019t get much sleep before they return for fresh meetings on Wednesday morning.... The IMF\u2019s top man in Europe, Poul Thomsen, is reportedly consulting with Christine Lagarde over the Greek issue.... Sounds like Greece\u2019s creditors are still divided... Oh goodness me.... AFP\u2019s Alex Pigman has heard the eurogroup ministers haven\u2019t reached an agreement after all.... That\u2019s bad news all round, as ministers are due back for an ECOFIN meeting (including non-euro countries) tomorrow morning..... Euronews have produced a handy explanation to the Greek debt crisis - which you can see here. It includes clips of the anti-austerity protests which gripped Brussels today (as covered earlier today), and saw riot police use water cannons on demonstrators. It\u2019s now Wednesday in Brussels, and 1am over in Greece, and still the eurogroup meeting continues. More seriously, my local pub just rang \u2018time at the bar\u2019 :( Excellent news.... That could mean that ministers are ready to sign off an agreement.... Heads-up! Eric Maurice of EUobserver reckons eurozone finance ministers might wrap things up in 20 minutes.... Bong! It\u2019s now eight hours since eurozone finance ministers began today\u2019s meeting, and just 30 minutes until the Brussels bells chime midnight. So far, it sounds like they may agree to hand Greece its \u20ac11bn aid tranche, but in two installments. But there\u2019s no sign of a breakthrough over how to give Greece debt relief. At least they\u2019re still talking, though.... Alex White of the Economist Intelligence Unit suspects tough decisions on Greek debt relief could be delayed until after the next German general elections, in autumn 2017. That may not be acceptable to the IMF, though.... Cross everything.... OK, I have no idea what this means....but EC spokesman Simon O\u2019Connor just tweeted this catchy tune from Zorba the Greek. Might it be a sign that talks are speeding up?... Finland\u2019s finance minister has just tweeted that the eurogroup has taken a break, and that these long days require \u2018endurance\u2019: What would we do without online translation sites, eh? The Wall Street Journal have a great timeline showing Greece\u2019s debt repayments: Greece\u2019s Debt Due: What Greece Owes When This chart shows its obligations this year: Don\u2019t worry too much about the grey lines - they show short-term debt held by Greek banks which can be \u2018rolled over\u2019 at regular auctions. The red and blue lines are important, though - they show money owed to the IMF and the ECB. Defaulting on either creditor would have serious consequences. Splitting Greece\u2019s bailout funds into two tranches would leave Athens\u2019 a little more exposed over the summer. It has to repay around \u20ac3bn of long-term debt to its creditors in July, which should be manageable if it receives \u20ac7.5bn in loans next month (as is rumoured). Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 latest report from Brussels, confirming what we\u2019ve been hearing: Euro zone finance ministers are likely to approve new loans to Greece of 10.3 billion euros, according to a draft statement seen by euro zone officials. The 10.3 billion euros in new loans is likely to be paid out in two tranches, officials said, with the first one in June worth 7.8 billion euros. The amount and timing are not final yet, officials said. The disbursement was conditional on Greece delivering on reform promises. Our own Jennifer Rankin confirms that Greece may get its aid loans in two portions, not all in one lump as expected: She\u2019s also hearing that negotiations over debt relief for Athens are continuing... A Slovak government advisor tweets that eurogroup ministers are taking a break. I hate to rush you, guys, but it\u2019s 11pm in Greece and our dear readers may need their sleep..... A few journalists in Brussels are reporting that Greece\u2019s bailout payment is going to be split into two instalments. Efi Koutsokosta of Euronews has the details: If so, that could mean that creditors aren\u2019t totally happy with the measures approved by Athens last weekend. Or it could mean something else.... Over in New York, Wall Street has just closed for the night with gains across the board. Banks and tech stocks led the rally, as investors appeared to stop worrying about the prospect of a US rate rise. The Dow Jones index finished 211 points higher at 17,704 points, a jump of 1.2%, following a strong day in Europe. Today\u2019s problem in a nutshell: Rumblings of discontent in Brussels.... Greek government bonds traded at a six-month high today. That\u2019s thanks to hopes that Athens would receive the bailout funds needed to avoid another financial crisis. Bond yields (the interest rate on the debt) fell sharply on Monday after MPs approved the austerity measures sought by creditors. They fell a little further today, as traders waited for developments in Brussels. Ciaran O\u2019Hagan, a strategist at Societe Generale, says investors are now looking for concrete moves on debt relief: \u201cThe fall in Greek bond yields reflects optimism that the reforms passed by the Greek parliament pave the way for support from the Eurogroup later today.... If there is debt relief, you will see further outperformance.\u201d (thanks to Reuters for the quote) The Eurogroup meeting is now entering its seventh hour. Greek journalist Yannis Karagiorgas sums up the mood: Here\u2019s our latest news story from Brussels: It begins thus: European officials have voiced optimism that Greece could unlock the next tranche of bailout money even as an ongoing row between the country\u2019s creditors threatens to plunge the eurozone back into crisis. Greece\u2019s international creditors remain deadlocked over how to reduce the recession-hit country\u2019s \u20ac321bn (\u00a3245bn) debt mountain, worth 180% of annual economic output. The International Monetary Fund has threatened to walk away from the Greek bailout unless substantial debt relief is agreed, but Germany maintains there can be no changes before 2018. Going into the talks between 19 eurozone finance ministers in Brussels, Valdis Dombrovskis, the European commissioner in charge of the euro, said he hoped to see \u201can agreement in principle\u201d, including on disbursement of bailout funds..... (click here for more) The Greek delegation are briefing reporters in Brussels now, and confirming that talks are continuing. They\u2019re also suggesting that Germany is pushing for changes to the austerity measures passed last Sunday. Eleni Varvitsiotis, EU correspondent at Greek newspaper Kathimerini, says three outstanding issues must be resolved before Greece gets its aid tranche: EKAS is Greece\u2019s Pensioners\u2019 Social Solidarity Benefit, which is being cut back under the bailout programme (some wealthier pensioners are reportedly being told to hand back some recent payments). NPL means non-performing loans - the bad debts held by Greece\u2019s banks , which are to be sold off. Matthew Klein, one of FT\u2019s Alphaville\u2019s many blindingly-bright sparks, has been digging through Greece\u2019s finances, and spotted something rather interesting. It\u2019s all to do with Greece\u2019s net debt (basically its gross debt minus the financial assets the country holds). The International Monetary Fund reckons those financial assets are worth just \u00a33bn, a drop in the ocean compared to its debt mountain. But Matt has discovered that the Bank of Greece has calculated it as \u00a330bn - using the methodology recommended by the IMF itself. It\u2019s not really obvious why such a difference should occur - but it\u2019s obviously important when assessing Greece\u2019s financial health. If you have any ideas why, please tell Matt here: Is the IMF under-counting the Greek government\u2019s financial assets? Greece\u2019s ANA newswire are reporting that eurozone finance ministers are likely to approve Greece\u2019s \u20ac11bn bailout tranche tonight. Here\u2019s the story, hot off the Reuters terminal: Negotiations at Tuesday\u2019s Eurogroup meeting are focusing on Greece\u2019s debt, a source from the European Commission said, adding that Eurozone\u2019s finance ministers are expected to approve the disbursement of the loan installment totaling 10.3 billion euros. The same source said there are still some pending issues which will be included in the final statement. Commenting on these issues, a government source said they are not decisive and will be resolved summarily. But what about the showdown between Greece\u2019s creditors? As we\u2019ve reported earlier, the two sides are someway apart. ANA says: On the issue of the country\u2019s debt, the distance between the IMF and Germany is still great and the aim is to achieve greater convergence today. The Commission source said that after pressure by the IMF, the weight has shifted towards measures that will be taken in the short term. However, Eurozone officials hope some deal will eventually be achieved with the IMF tonight, as there\u2019s political pressure to avoid reviving the crisis. Let\u2019s fill the time with some dispiriting Greek charts, via Open Europe analyst Raoul Ruparel: Brussels correspondent Jennifer Rankin says there\u2019s no sign when the talks about Greece\u2019s bailout, and other eurozone economic issues, will end. Last time, the eurogroup were done and dusted by around 7pm local time (6pm BST). But regular crisis watchers will know that these meetings have a nasty habit of running on towards midnight.... Greece\u2019s former top central banker fears that the country is ill-prepared to exit its economic crisis. Our Athens correspondent, Helena Smith, explains: While we wait for progress at the Eurogroup, here are some more photos from today\u2019s meeting. But... More optimism the Eurogroup\u2019s talks will be constructive: The story is here (in Greek). Stock markets appear to have come to terms with the prospect of a US interest rate rise, perhaps as early as next month. Indeed, the idea of the Federal Reserve hiking rates put financial shares in the spotlight, on the basis that dearer borrowing costs could boost their balance sheets. Meanwhile there was also optimism that a deal between Greece and its creditors could finally be reached at the Eurogroup meeting, despite tensions with the IMF over the country\u2019s debt situation, thus releasing much needed bailout funds. Another EU referendum survey showing the remain camp in the lead also helped support markets, as did another rise in the oil price. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: It\u2019s been nothing short of a stellar day for the FTSE-100 as the market has shaken off earlier woes to forge a path higher, despite what could be construed as a raft of adversity. Public sector borrowing was higher than expected and Bank of England officials painted another gloomy picture over the economic outlook in their parliamentary appearance. The saving grace however appears to have been a combination of that latest Brexit survey data showing the Remain camp forging its way ahead, plus the fact that oil prices are evidently ascending, too. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 82.83 points or 1.35% at 6219.26 Germany\u2019s Dax added 2.18% to 10,057.31 France\u2019s Cac climbed 2.46% to 4431.52 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB jumped 3.34% to 17,903.97 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 2.34% higher at 8918.1 But in Greece, there was some profit taking after recent rises, and the Athens market fell 1.08% to 642.08 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 215 points or 1.23%. As for oil, Brent crude has climbed 0.54% to $48.61 a barrel. Here\u2019s AP\u2019s summary of the comments ahead of the Eurogroup meeting on Greece: The eurozone\u2019s top official expressed optimism Tuesday that Greece\u2019s creditors will approve its reform efforts, paving the way for the payout of a new batch of rescue loans that would keep Athens from defaulting on its massive debts this summer. \u201cI hope that there is full agreement between the institutions, that we can move on in the program,\u201d said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the eurogroup of finance ministers, as he arrived for the talks in Brussels. Greece\u2019s parliament passed a bill over the weekend on a series of measures that creditors had demanded. They included tax hikes, more budget-cutting reforms and a new privatization superfund, which will manage almost all state property. The next step for creditors would be to find a way to lighten the country\u2019s debt load, which mainly consists of past rescue loans from eurozone states. Greece\u2019s debt is predicted to reach more than \u20ac333bn this year, around 180% of its annual economic output. \u201cGreece needs room to breathe, it needs certainty. It\u2019s made considerable efforts, and again this weekend,\u201d said French Finance Minister Michel Sapin, referring to the reforms Greece passed. On the question of debt relief, Dijsselbloem said there was no appetite for any outright cut to the value of the money Greece owes. Rather, the creditors are likely to examine a possible lowering in the interest rates and possibly an extension of the rescue loans\u2019 maturity dates, as called for by the International Monetary Fund. There are fears the IMF may even pull out of the bailout program if Greece\u2019s debt burden is not lightened. \u201cAn actual haircut of the loans will not happen,\u201d Dijsselboem said. \u201cWhat we can look at is the annual debt burden, so Greece can on an annual basis pay its debts. If not, we are ready to help them in the coming years.\u201d Senior EU officials believe the plans being drawn up by experts to address Greece\u2019s short, mid- and longer-term debt needs will be enough to keep the IMF on board. \u201cThere is a real added value to have the IMF on board, so it is not an option to go on without the IMF,\u201d Dijsselbloem said. US investors have followed their European counterparts and moved back into the stock market, with continuing talk about an imminent Federal Reserve rate rise helping to lift financial stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 187 points or just over 1%, while the S&amp;P 500 has added 0.7% and Nasdaq is 0.85% better. In Europe, Germany\u2019s Dax is 1.8% higher while France\u2019s Cac has climbed 2%. The FTSE 100 is up 70 points or 1.1%. But as the Eurogroup meets to try and resolve the Greek debt situation, the Athens market has slipped 1.27%. Back with Mark Carney, and here\u2019s our report on the Bank of England governor\u2019s appearance at the Treasury select committee: More comments made ahead of the Eurogroup meeting which should now be well underway: And Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem: The International Monetary Fund is using its negotiating position to try and persuade the Eurogroup to make concessions in the Greek debt crisis, says the Centre for Economics and Business Research, and this may be its best chance to push its point of view. But Cebr economist Danae Kyriakopoulou said: Cebr warns against premature optimism that today\u2019s meeting will mark \u2018the end of the Eurozone crisis\u2019. IMF policy is determined by its shareholders (represented by the board), rather than its staff. Politics matter much more to the former. And there is little enthusiasm in Germany for debt relief which would be hard to sell to the country\u2019s voters. On the other hand the Eurogroup will be unwilling to risk a crisis that could break up the Euro in the run-up to the UK Brexit vote on 23 June and the Spanish elections on 26 June, so arguably today\u2019s meeting is the IMF\u2019s best chance to use its negotiating power to force the concessions it believes are necessary. The Cebr sees two ways the situation could develop: 1. The IMF backs off and avoids confrontation with the Europeans. This would continue the \u201cextend and pretend\u201d strategy that has governed the Greek crisis since it started. This would most certainly be bad for the Greek economy, as the IMF staff\u2019s projections show. And, it could prove very damaging to Europe as it raises the likelihood of a default and Grexit further down the line \u2013 meaning that debt owed to European taxpayers (including in the UK) would never be repaid. 2. The IMF plays hardball and poses a painful dilemma to the Europeans. This would certainly be risky. A failure to agree could lead to another Eurozone crisis, possibly a Grexit. But it is in everyone\u2019s interest that this is avoided. The debt relief itself need not take the form of an outright haircut. Some form of reprofiling, as outlined in the IMF\u2019s DSA could do the trick. This would put the Greek economy on a more sustainable trajectory but would be costly politically to Eurozone leaders and may lead to political instability in the already-troubled union. Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, has just put his finger on the problems over the Greek bailout. Arriving for today\u2019s meeting, Sch\u00e4uble told reporters that there can be \u201cno programme\u201d for Greece without the IMF. However, he then declared that a decision on Greece\u2019s debt relief can only come in 2018, at the end of the bailout. That\u2019s later than the IMF is demanding. However, Sch\u00e4uble says he\u2019s \u201coptimistic\u201d that these issues can be resolved. Back at the eurogroup, European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker has revealed that all isn\u2019t well: I suspect he\u2019s worried about the tensions between Greece\u2019s creditors, after the International Monetary Fund urged the eurozone to give Athens deeper debt relief. Today\u2019s meeting could become a serious showdown between the two sides, over the issue of Greece\u2019s debt sustainability. Belgium\u2019s finance chief, Johan Van Overtveldt, told reporters outside today\u2019s meeting that he wasn\u2019t impressed by the IMF\u2019s new call for \u2018unconditional\u2019 debt relief. Such relief must always have conditions attached, he argues. Here\u2019s why Belgium\u2019s workers took to the streets today, from AFP: \u201cI am here to protest against all the measures that this right-wing government is taking. They are attacking workers, pensioners and the unemployed,\u201d Michel Beis, a trade union member taking part in the peaceful rally told AFP before the violence broke out. \u201cWe are going backwards,\u201d added Jacques Warnier, a protester from the town of Liege. The AFP newswire are tweeting photos from today\u2019s clashes in Brussels: They report: Belgian police fired water-cannon during clashes with protesters at a huge demonstration in Brussels on Tuesday against the centre-right government\u2019s austerity measures, AFP journalists said. A group of around 100 masked protesters broke away from the peaceful main rally of around 60,000 people in the Belgian capital and started hurling objects and firecrackers at riot police, they said. Officers then drove them back with jets of water from three cannon. Tuesday\u2019s protest is supposed to kick off months of planned demonstrations and national strikes led by trade unions against the policies of Prime Minister Charles Michel\u2019s government. Clashes are breaking out in the Belgium capital, as an anti-austerity demonstration turns violent. Local media are reporting that riot police are using water cannon on protesters; just as eurozone finance ministers meet to discuss Greece\u2019s bailout. Today\u2019s protests are organised by Belgium\u2019s unions, to oppose the government\u2019s cost-cutting measures and employment reforms. The demonstrations had started peacefully: But some protesters then began throwing rocks at the police.... ....prompting the water cannons to be deployed. Meanwhile in Brussels, eurozone finance ministers have been gathering for today\u2019s Eurogroup meeting. As explained back in the introduction, we had expected ministers to sign off on a \u20ac11bn bailout payment for Greece. But, in a worrying sign, Slovakia\u2019s finance minister has warned that the meeting will be difficult - and could last all night! Peter Ka\u017eimer appears to be pushing for a deal on Greece\u2019s loans today, but not on the sticky issue of debt relief which is dividing the country\u2019s creditors. Cambridge lecturer Finbarr Livesey has helpfully tweeted the timings of the best moments of today\u2019s hearing: Here\u2019s some reaction to Mark Carney\u2019s appearance at parliament today, from Calum Bennie, savings expert at Scottish Friendly: \u201cToday\u2019s grilling of Mark Carney by the Treasury Select Committee has only helped fuel the speculation on the impact a Brexit would have on the UK economy. \u201cThe build-up to the EU referendum appears to be having a significant impact on the economy as sterling has been incredibly volatile, while GDP and inflation have slowed are slowing. \u201cMr Carney didn\u2019t exactly offer savers much ground for optimism today as he merely said the next move in interest rates would \u2018probably\u2019 be up if there is a vote to remain, while a Brexit would mean there is less chance of a rate rise. Once again savers are left wondering how long rates will continue at rock bottom, potentially eroding the value of their cash. \u201cSavers should heed this warning from the Governor and look to the long term returns stocks and shares ISAs can offer, though risk is attached.\u201d That was a livelier morning than expected. Here\u2019s a quick recap. The governor of the Bank of England has fought off criticism following his warning that Britain\u2019s economy would suffer if the public vote to leave the EU. Mark Carney insisted that the Bank was right to outline its concerns, saying: By our actions, and comments, we have made it more likely that we\u2019ll bring inflation back to target, whatever the outcome of the referendum, sooner and more sustainably. Carney also warned that the financial markets could have a \u201cPavlovian\u201d reaction to the EU referendum vote. If Britain chooses to Brexit on June 23, then it would have a negative impact on growth and the pound, and push inflation up, he argued. It\u2019s important not just for those in financial markets to understand that, but it\u2019s important also to (be) straight with the British people about that. But Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg accused the governor of peddling government propaganda. In one of the more ill-tempered exchanges seen recently, Rees-Mogg argued that the Bank had broken its own rules on independence, and damaged its reputation. And fellow Tory Steve Baker appeared to shock Carney, by asking him to deny that he was secretly working for Goldman Sachs. Carney said he was shocked that such a thing could even be suggested. Carney was supported by three other top officials. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent, and external MPC members Martin Weale and Gertjan Vleighe, said they shared the governor\u2019s concerns. And the governor also revealed that he had an early peek at the Brexit paper produced by the Treasury yesterday, over breakfast with the chancellor. Before the session began, we learned that Britain\u2019s financial position was worse than thought. The UK was forced to borrow \u00a34bn more than forecast in the 2015-16 financial year, in a blow to George Osborne. But every challenge is also an opportunity -- in this case, an opportunity to warn about Brexit fears.... Andrew Tyrie has returned from his little chin-wag with Jacob Rees-Mogg, to wrap up the session. He thanks Martin Weale for his work at the Bank of England, as this could be his final appearance before the committee. Tyrie cites Weale\u2019s \u201cindependence of mind\u201d (which included several lonely, hawkish votes to raise interest rates). Tyrie then hints that Weale might have another job lined up.... We\u2019re very grateful for your public service, and we hope it\u2019s not the last. Weale keeps a straight face. And committee chairman Tyrie can\u2019t resist causing some mischief. He then picks up a copy of the Financial Times, which reports that governor Carney is the most trusted foreigner, ahead of German chancellor Angela Merkel or the US president. Q: What did Carney make of this, as he enjoyed his porridge, or \u2018whatever you have in the morning, when you\u2019re not having breakfast with the chancellor\u2019? Carney says that the committee had to consider the impact of the EU referendum, because of the Bank\u2019s mandate. And he jokes that he assumes Tyrie won\u2019t be questioning everyone else on that list. Tyrie then suggests that IMF Christine Lagarde could \u201cdrift by\u201d the committee in a few weeks time, \u201cif she does decide to put both feet in it\u201d. Get the popcorn ready.... Back in the committee room, Scottish Nationalist MP George Kerevan asks about the Banks medium-term view of the UK economy. Mark Carney says that growth has slowed from the high days of 2013, when GDP was expanding by around 3% per year. Now, though, it has dropped to around 1%. Stripping out the referendum effect.... the bigger picture is that growth will move in line with supply growth, which is weaker than it was. So once the uncertainty effect of the Brexit vote fades, the Bank expects growth to return to around 2.25%, Mark Carney concludes. Get a sponge and a towel, folks -- here\u2019s the moment when the gloves came off between Mark Carney and Jacob Rees-Mogg. Bloomberg\u2019s Jill Ward sums it up: Mark Carney displayed flashes of anger at his chief pro-Brexit tormentor on Parliament\u2019s Treasury Committee in his most robust defense yet of the Bank of England\u2019s comments on the European Union vote. It \u201cmay be inconvenient, but by our actions, and comments, we have made it more likely that we\u2019ll bring inflation back to target, whatever the outcome of the referendum, sooner and more sustainably,\u201d the governor told Jacob Rees-Mogg, the lawmaker who called this month for him to be fired. \u201cThat\u2019s our contribution to a better economic outcome for the British people, and for you to suggest otherwise is to try and undermine that.\u201d More highlights earlier in this blog.... The committee turns to the issue of Britain\u2019s current account deficit. Mark Carney says there would be a \u2018necessary\u2019 rebalancing of sterling (a fall, basically), if Britain chose to leave the EU. And that would have an import on exporters, meaning the domestic sector would increase relative to the export sector (ie, Britain would sell less overseas, at least for a while). However, Carney insists that talk of a \u201csterling crisis\u201d is overdone. Today\u2019s Telegraph cartoon will amuse those who take government Brexit warnings with lashings of salt. The committee then turn to the weapons available to the Bank to stimulate the economy. MPC member Gertjan Vleighe says he believes another round of quantitative easing (buying bonds from banks with newly created money) would still be effective. And there is still room to cut bank rate. Jacob Rees-Mogg then gets up and leaves the room, with a polite nod to the witnesses. Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie then hops up and follows him...... #curious.... Steve Baker MP then leaves Mark Carney briefly speechless, by asking him to refute the suggestion that Goldman Sachs have pushed him into the Brexit debate. Baker tells the Bank governor that he is asking \u2018in the spirit of goodwill\u2019 (!!).... We know that Goldman Sachs has been a donor to the Remain campaign, you are a former managing director of Goldman Sachs. Can I just give you the opportunity to refute any suggestion that Goldman Sachs may have put pressure on you to take a view? \u201cWow....\u201d, replies Carney, seemingly at a loss for words. Baker: It\u2019s not an allegation - it\u2019s an opportunity to refute it. Carney refutes it with gusto: Yes, I refute it categorically... and am stunned to ever have it raised. That\u2019s a pretty remarkable jibe at the credibility of one of the world\u2019s top central bankers -- but one which conspiracy theorists will like to hear aired.... Q: Why do the Bank\u2019s latest graphs show uncertainty over UK assets falling, just as the EU referendum reaches its height, asks Steve Baker. Policymaker Martin Weale suggests that it is tracking the support for the Remain campaign. Steve Baker then turns to the Bank\u2019s [not unblemished] track record on forecasting You said that interest rates might rise when unemployment fell to 7%, but they didn\u2019t. Then you said they might rise once real wages went up, but they didn\u2019t. Then you suggested rate could go up at the turn of 2016. They didn\u2019t. So.... Q: If the bank can\u2019t forecast its own actions, why should we trust your forecasts? You didn\u2019t even predict the halving of the oil price. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent says no-one predicted that oil would fall so sharply. Financial markets make their best guess about these moves. Q: Well, you\u2019ve just proved the impossibility of making major economic predictions (such as the impact of Brexit) That\u2019s a false dichotomy, Broadbent replies. You can\u2019t say that forecasting is impossible, just because you can\u2019t predict everything. Just because the future is uncertain doesn\u2019t mean that forecasting is useless, he adds. [This is an example of what Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam yesterday called the \u2018pizza analogy\u2019:] Steve Baker MP goes next, and reduces Mark Carney to giggles. Baker, another pro-Brexit MP, tells the Bank of England\u2019s top brass that he positively rejects the idea that they are wicked conspirators. Instead.... I choose to believe your wholesale innocence, completely unsullied by the grubby politics of this referendum matter. As it happens I think you\u2019re just wrong.... Baker also invites Carney to the Annual Hayek Memorial Lecture held by the IEA thinktank on 8 June, to learn the error of his ways. You can sign up here: George Selgin on stability without Central Banks During a long discussion on sterling, Ben Broadbent suggests that the pound could fall by 5% if Britain votes to leave the EU. Ben Chu of the Independent says that Mark Carney has \u201cdoubled down\u201d on his concerns over the EU referendum this morning. And that could be significant, as opinion polls have found that the public trust the Bank of England governor more than Westminster\u2019s best and brightest. Ben writes: The Governor of the Bank of England, one of the most trusted public figures in the UK, has sounded another warning about the instant economic shock Brexit would inflict on Britain. Speaking in front of MPs on the Treasury Select Committee, Mark Carney, who recent polling suggested is more trusted among the public than senior politicians, said: \u201cBrexit to my mind would have a material impact on growth and inflation. It would be likely to have a negative impact in the short term.\u201d Following up on his words earlier this month, Mr Carney added: \u201cI certainly think that would increase the risk of recession.\u201d Mr Carney\u2019s warning follows a stark warning from the Chancellor yesterday, citing Treasury economic analysis, that Brexit would lead to an immediate year-long recession for the UK. More here: Asked about recent movements in the pound, Mark Carney says sterling has been tracking the probability of Britain leaving the EU (rising when Brexit looks less likely). This may not reassure critics of the Bank\u2019s independence.... Carney says he saw the draft version, because it included economic forecasts, but he didn\u2019t give any feedback. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent, though, says he\u2019s hardly looked at the Treasury\u2019s analysis at all (which warns that Brexit would cause a DIY recession) John Mann MP now takes up the issue of the Bank\u2019s independence (or lack of) over Brexit. He says the external members of the Monetary Policy Committee \u2013 Martin Weale and Gertjan Vlieghe \u2013 are being accused of simply \u201cdoing whatever the governor tells you to do\u201d. Weale points out that he\u2019s often disagreed with the rest of the committee, by voting to raise interest rates in recent years (before changing his mind). Q: But why aren\u2019t the external members at the Bank speaking up against these slurs on your integrity? Vlieghe says he does resent the implication that the committee are under the control of Mark Carney, or George Osborne. He insists that there\u2019s no secretive control of the Bank. No-one has told me, or asked me, about which way these discussions should go. Mann suggests that if the MPC\u2019s external members are truly independent, they should speak up a bit. Perhaps sensibly, Mark Carney declines to comment on the Brexit analysis issued by the Treasury yesterday, which predicted four quarters of recession. Mark Carney then warns that a vote to leave the EU could prompt a \u2018Pavolvian\u2019 reaction in the City, pushing up the risk premium on UK assets. But it would also be hard to the Bank to stimulate the economy, if a weaker pound drove up inflation. Rachel Reeves then questions Mark Carney about the implications of Britain leaving the EU. Mark Carney agrees that Brexit could cause the pound to weaken, creating an upside shock to inflation that would make it harder to keep interest rates low. If Britain stays in the EU, the next move in interest rates is probably up. If the public vote to leave, there\u2019s less chance of a rate rise. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent then points out that the UK economy appears to have slowed quite sharply this year - it\u2019s unclear how much of this is due to Brexit fears. Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie steps in -- perhaps worried that Mark Carney and Jacob Rees-Mogg might take their argument outside. He tells the BoE governor that many members of the commitee would have been concerned if the Bank had NOT discussed the EU referendum. Labour MP Rachel Reeves than puts the boot into Rees-Mogg, saying: If anyone\u2019s reputation has been damaged by today\u2019s performance, it\u2019s not the Bank of England. Jacob Rees-Mogg MP now accuses Carney of being influenced by chancellor George Osborne. As the gloves come off, Carney insists that he\u2019s not being played by government. There\u2019s \u201cno possibility of undue influence from the Treasury\u201d, Carney insists. It wouldn\u2019t work anyway, even if they tried Q: So it\u2019s very convenient that you\u2019re putting out the same propaganda as the Chancellor? I don\u2019t accept that at all, Carney replies. Q: But you have a duty to remain apolitical. How can anyone trust you on interest rates now? Our comments might not please you, Carney shoots back, but it has improved the chances of the economy recovering from the Brexit undertainty. To suggest otherwise is to try to undermine it. Rees Mogg insists that Carney has become politically involved... I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth replying to, says Carney, trying to swat the pro-Brexit MP aside. Q: What contact have you had with George Osborne about the referendum? Mark Carney says he has had a series of conversations around how membership of the EU allows the bank to achieve its monetary targets. Ultimately we can achieve the inflation target whether we\u2019re in the EU or not. And there have also been conversations about the impact of Brexit on financial stability, and on the mechanics of potentially exiting the EU, Carney says. Q: How would any directions from the government come? I\u2019d expect it in writing, and in public, Carney says - he wouldn\u2019t accept \u2018informal direction\u2019. Mark Carney warns that sterling has been hit since November by the single issue of whether Britain stays in the EU, or leaves. That\u2019s why the Bank was right to flag up that the referendum could change monetary policy, he argues. Rees-Mogg isn\u2019t impressed: pointing out that a Labour government in his lifetime proposed re-introducing capital controls. Yet the Bank wouldn\u2019t give a view on a general election - but here it is, wading into the referendum issue. Your comparison is essentially false, he tells Carney. Now Jacob Rees-Mogg MP, a pro-Brexit MP, takes the microphone. Q: In general elections, you don\u2019t give a view on opposition policies, so why is the Bank giving its view on Brexit? Carney explains that the EU referendum is a single event that creates a \u2018discrete risk\u2019 to monetary policy, while a general election does not, as policies are implemented over time. Q: But a change of government is a discrete event, Rees-Mogg gently insists. You get a new economic policy and a new chancellor. Carney argue that it\u2019s still not a single event whose impact can be clearly identified. The Treasury committee now turns to other top officials from the Bank of England. First Martin Weale, who sits on the monetary policy committee which sets interest rates. He says Brexit would probably have a materially negative impact on growth and inflation, in the short term. And that would increase the risk of recession, Weale adds. Dr Gertjan Vleighe, another independent MPC member agrees. It is likely that there would be a material slowing in growth, inflation would rise, the exchange rate would fall, if Britain votes to leave the EU, Vleighe explains. Ben Broadband, deputy governor, says he agrees too. Q: So is there anyone on the MPC who disagrees? Governor Mark Carney says there isn\u2019t - the Committee is united on this one. Q: How about the Financial Policy Committee? (responsible for financial stability). Carney says they are also concerned about the referendum: It is the consensus view of the FPC that Brexit represents the biggest domestic risk to financial stability. Q: And there are no dissenters on the FPC either? No, Carney replies. The key points so far: Next question for Mr Carney.... Q: Is it acceptable for the International Monetary Fund to turn up a week before the EU referendum and give its views? [explainer: the Fund is due to publish its full health check on the UK, including in-depth calculations on the \u2018Brexit\u2019 effect, next month] Quite frankly, I have no influence over the IMF, says Carney. Q: But is it acceptable? The thrust of the IMF\u2019s views on this issues is well known, Carney argues Q: But is it a good idea for the IMF to \u2018jump in\u2019 with both feet, at such a crucial political time? Carney says he\u2019s only expecting to get \u201cdetail\u201d from the IMF about the UK economy next month.... Mark Carney begins his hearing by defending the Bank of England\u2019s warning that Britain could plunge into recession if it leaves the EU. Asked what principles and guidelines are being used for such forecasts, the governor says the Bank has adopted \u201csubstantially the same rules as the UK civil service\u201d. But there\u2019s one big difference - civil servants support a minister, while the Bank is independent and doesn\u2019t support government policy. And the Bank will soon go into purdah, to prevent any officials saying anything controversial in the run-up to the June 23 referendum. However, the Bank will be setting UK interest rates on 16 June, and will release the minutes of its meeting on that day Q: So we can\u2019t exclude the possibility of anoher intervention in the Brexit debate, asks chairman Andrew Tyrie.... It can\u2019t be excluded, Carney agrees. But in his judgement, the Bank has already highlighted the main issues. So he doesn\u2019t expect to say anything new on the 16th. There is a lot of uncertainty in the economy at the moment, so the Bank could be over-or-under-estimating the strength of the economy, Carney concludes. Bank of England governor Mark Carney is appearing before parliament\u2019s Treasury committee to answer questions about the UK economy, and his warnings against Brexit. Here\u2019s a livefeed. Britain\u2019s failure to hit its borrowing targets last year are a blow to chancellor George Osboene, as he tries to rally the country to remain in the EU. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says: The upwardly revised shortfall for 2015/16 leaves the Chancellor open to criticism that he clearly missed the 2015/16 public finances targets that were set out as recently as March\u2019s budget \u2013 and could well be used by supporters of the UK leaving the EU as evidence that the Treasury\u2019s forecasts are unreliable (although the public finance forecasts are actually done by the Office for Budget Responsibility). Breaking: Britain missed its borrowing target last year by more than previously expected. The UK borrowed almost \u00a376bn in the 2015-16 financial year to cover the deficit, according to new figures just released by the Office for National Statistics. That\u2019s almost \u00a34bn more than the \u00a372bn estimate set by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility. It\u2019s also \u00a32bn more than the ONS initially estimated last month. On the upside, it\u2019s \u00a315.7bn less than Britain had to borrow in the previous 12 months -- but still a long way from George Osborne\u2019s target of a surplus. The ONS also reports that the UK borrowed \u00a37.2bn in April (the first month of the new financial year). That\u2019s \u00a30.3bn lower than in April 2015, and the lowest for any April since 2008. But it\u2019s also more than expected, with corporation tax receipts weaker than expected. The pound has jumped this morning, after a new opinion poll gave the Remain campaign a big lead. Sterling has gained half a cent against the US dollar, to $1.4538. This comes after the Daily Telegraph reported that the campaign to stay in Europe holds a 13-point lead over the Brexit camp. And crucially, the poll showed more support for Remain from older voters and Conservative supporters (there is some overlap, of course...). Cue a monstrous jump in the pound.... Elsewhere in the eurozone, Germany\u2019s largest bank has just had its credit rating slashed. Deutsche Bank has been downgraded by one notch by Moody\u2019s to Baa2, which is just two notches above Junk. Moody\u2019s warned that Deutche\u2019s recent performance has been weak, after seeing profits halve in the last quarter. And it also faces \u201csubstantial operating headwinds\u201d, including the record low interest rates in the eurozone, and uncertainty over the global economy. CEO John Cryan, who has been pushing a turnaround plan and cutting bonuses, says he\u2019s \u2018very disappointed\u2019 by the news. In an encouraging sign for Athens, the yield on Greek debt has hit the lowest level since last November. Investors are buying into Greece\u2019s government bonds, in the hope that the country is less likely to default on its bonds. That shows they are expecting Greece to receive its much needed \u20ac11bn of bailout funds from the eurogroup today. This has driven down the yield on 10-year Greek debt down to 7.35%, from 7.37% yesterday. A small move, but in the right direction. Yields move inversely to bond prices, and this chart shows how they soared last summer as Greece flirted with crashing out of the eurozone. The FT\u2019s Mehreen Kahn explains why this eurogroup meeting is a little different: She\u2019s also produced this graph, showing why the IMF is demanding deeper Greek debt relief (as explained earlier). European stock markets have opened in the red, as investors watch to see how today\u2019s eurogroup meeting proceeds. Germany\u2019s DAX led the declines, down 0.5% . The City is watching to see whether Greece receives funds to help it cover this summer\u2019s debt repayments, and for clashes between the eurozone and the International Monetary Fund. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx explains: Whilst it seems almost guaranteed that Greece will receive this monetary boost, things aren\u2019t so cut and dry. The IMF is reportedly refusing to participate in this latest bailout without Greece being granted \u2018upfront and unconditional\u2019 debt relief. The issue continues to be the one major division over the treatment of Greece, and could cause a few heated debates among the Eurozone\u2019s finance ministers as they try and bridge the schism between those fiercely opposed to the idea and those willing to cut the country some debt-slack. A surge in investment helped Germany\u2019s economy to grow at the fastest pace in two years. The Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden has reported that capital investment jumped by 1.8% in January-March, with building activity surging by 2.3%. Consumers, though, were more restrained, as private consumption rose by 0.4%. And that meant Germany\u2019s GDP jumped by a punchy 0.7% in the last quarter, confirming the initial estimate two weeks ago. Economists, though, reckon growth is now slowing.... Today\u2019s eurogroup meeting begins at 3pm Brussels time, or 2pm in the UK. And the AFP newswire explains why it matters: Greece urgently needs the next tranche of bailout money to repay big loans to the European Central Bank (ECB) and IMF in July, and has already fallen behind in paying for everyday government duties and public sector wages. The outcome of the meeting remains highly uncertain, due to a row between Greece\u2019s creditors, the eurozone governments and the International Monetary Fund, over the state of the Greek economy and debt relief. Royal Bank of Canada\u2019s economics team are quite confident that Greece\u2019s creditors will agree to hand over \u20ac11bn of bailout loans today. They told clients: Today\u2019s meeting of euro area finance ministers will be focused on Greece. On Sunday, the Greek parliament passed a package of tax increases and reforms along with the contentious contingency to be deployed in the event of the 2018 budget going off track. Assuming it finds the measures acceptable, Eurogroup is expected to disperse the next tranche of programme funds (c.\u20ac11bn) which would allow Greece to meet forthcoming debt repayments and clear arrears which have built up as the review has dragged on. The focus then moves on to debt relief with the ministers set to discuss options for debt relief that have been drawn up by officials as the euro area looks to bridge the gap between it and the IMF on the sustainability of Greece\u2019s debt and allow the IMF participate in the latest Greek programme. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s nine months since Greece signed up to its third bailout, after months of torturous negotiations and deadlock climaxed in an all-night summit meeting. And today, Athens could finally pass the first review of that programme, unlocking \u20ac11bn in loans to help ward off another financial crisis. Eurozone finance ministers will gather in Brussels this lunchtime for a Eurogroup meeting. They are likely to agree that the austerity package of tax rises and reforms passed by Greek MPs on Sunday go far enough. But the relief could be short-lived. Although Greece will get a pat on the head for doing its best, there are still serious tensions between its creditors. Last night, the International Monetary Fund made a significant intervention, warning that the Eurozone\u2019s plans to give Greece some debt relief simply don\u2019t go far enough. It also insisted that Greece\u2019s fiscal targets are simply unachievable. The Fund is pushing European creditors to forgo any Greek debt payments until 2040 and to also peg the borrowing costs at 1.5%. That would be politically awkward for some eurozone members, such as Germany, as it could expose them to further Greek bills. The Fund also wants Greece\u2019s debt relief wrapped up in two years, undermining the eurozone\u2019s goal of delaying some debt relief until after the current bailout expires in 2018 (after the next German federal elections). In a clear challenge to the eurozone, the IMF declares: \u201cThe implementation of debt relief should be completed by the end of the programme period. \u201cProviding an upfront, unconditional component to debt relief is critical to provide a strong and credible signal to markets about the commitment of official creditors to ensuring debt sustainability, which in itself could contribute to lowering market financing costs. An upfront component can also help garner more ownership for reforms.\u201d So it could be a difficult meeting.... Also coming up today... Bank of England governor Mark Carney will be in the spotlight this morning, when he testifies to parliament about the latest Quarterly Inflation Report. He\u2019ll surely face criticism from pro-Brexit MPs, over his prediction that Britain could fall into recession if it leaves the EU. The punch-up hearing starts at 10am, and City experts are predicting a lively one.... Before that, the latest UK public finance figures are released, at 9.30am, showing how much Britain had to borrow in April. DIY chain Kingfisher and building society Nationwide are both reporting result this morning. Oil giant Shell is holding its AGM. And we\u2019re also getting two pieces of German data. The second estimate of GDP in the last quarter is just being released, confirming that the economy grew by 0.7%. The ZEW institute is publishing its estimate of investor confidence at 10am.",

The ratings agency said:</p> <blockquote> <p>The agreement reached between Greece and its eurozone creditors reduces the risk of another Greek liquidity crisis this summer, and incentivises the country to complete its third bail-out programme. However, with little debt relief offered upfront, the Greek government may find it progressively more difficult to continue with politically controversial measures required to meet ambitious programme commitments. Implementation risk therefore remains high.</p> <p>The agreement highlights the improved relations between Greece and its official creditors since last summer\u2019s often confrontational negotiations leading up to the current ESM programme. The Greek government has implemented prior actions, including pension reform and a contentious requirement for additional fiscal contingency measures to safeguard the 2018 budget target.</p> <p>For their part, Greece\u2019s official creditors have agreed to possible debt relief (nominal haircuts are still excluded)...</p> <p> Delivering debt relief in stages and contingent on programme performance could incentivise the Greek authorities to meet programme targets. However, given the track record of slippage under previous programmes in the past five years, we think there is still a high risk that the 2018 surplus target will be missed despite the agreement on a contingency fiscal mechanism. This risk could increase if the conditionality in Wednesday\u2019s agreement meant that sizeable debt relief came to be seen by Greek politicians or the public as a distant or unattainable prospect.</p> <p>A question mark is therefore likely to remain over the sustainability of Greek debt in the medium term. While gross financing needs are modest over the next few years, substantial increases in gross financing requirements would follow in the long term without further debt re-profiling.</p> <p>Our \u2018CCC\u2019 sovereign rating, which we affirmed in March, reflects risks to programme implementation and debt sustainability. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5745c9b8e4b00a2e2e3a0720\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-25T16:07:31.676Z\">5.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The Eurogroup \u201cbreakthrough\u201d on debt relief was no such thing, </strong>says Joan Hoey, Greek analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit:</p> <blockquote> <p>The coveted debt relief upon which the [Greek] prime minister has been banking, to provide a political fig leaf for his acceptance of another bailout, remains out of reach, contingent and unquantified.</p> <p>The Eurogroup did not finalise the long-delayed first review of the bailout programme.

This would, however, require the approval of some national parliaments.</p> <p>According to Eurozone officials, the chances that Greece can return to borrowing from the markets at reasonable interest rates at the end of the programme are much higher following the agreement at Tuesday\u2019s Eurogroup. They said that Greece\u2019s access to the markets can begin to be restored gradually, in the second half of 2017, and that the aim is to restore full market access by the end of 2018.</p> <p>The more credible Greece\u2019s economic policy, including its success in delivering primary surplus targets, the smaller the spreads on Greek bonds will be, though borrowing from the Eurozone will always be cheaper, the same sources said. The second review of the Greek programme would begin at the end of October, they added, noting that the measures that remained to be taken will not be as difficult as those required by the first review.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5745bb87e4b04536c2a43e9b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/helenasmith\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-25T14:54:51.460Z\">3.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In Greece trade unionists are already flexing their muscles and planning mass industrial action, <em>reports Helena Smith.</em></p> <blockquote> <p>Strikes are expected to start tomorrow when workers at the Piraeus Port Organisation and Thessaloniki Port Organisation begin a 48-hour walk-out in opposition to the controversial privatisation programme the government has signed up to.</p> <p>Adedy, which represents employees in the public sector, has also decided to hold a Pan-Hellenic work stoppage on June 8. \u201cWe decided, today, after meeting health and education federations that we would take this action to protest all the things that these new measures mean: lack of staff, underfunding, appointments that should, but will never happen,\u201d Adedy\u2019s chief policy maker, Grigoris Kalomoiris told the Guardian. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06f2aa662403b6244ef873a4097ee819107b44dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06f2aa662403b6244ef873a4097ee819107b44dc/0_118_3543_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrations earlier this month against the pension and tax reforms.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrations earlier this month against the pension and tax reforms.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Orestis Panagiotou/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>\u201cThe Eurogroup was a fiasco for Greece.

                "bodyText":"News of the Greek debt deal has seen stock markets record some good gains - apart ironically from in Athens - while Greek bond yields have fallen sharply. Germany\u2019s Dax added 1.47%, France\u2019s Cac closed 1.13% higher, while Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 1.66% and Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 2.32% higher. But after an early 1.5% rise, the Athens market ended virtually unchanged, slipping back 0.04% amid the threat of further strikes in protest against the proposed pension and tax reforms. Greek two year bond yields are currently down 80 basis points at 7.4% as investors welcomed the progress in the bailout talks. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. After Moody\u2019s saying the Greek deal was credit positive, Fitch has also welcomed the late night agreement but warned of possible problems implementing reform measures. The ratings agency said: The agreement reached between Greece and its eurozone creditors reduces the risk of another Greek liquidity crisis this summer, and incentivises the country to complete its third bail-out programme. However, with little debt relief offered upfront, the Greek government may find it progressively more difficult to continue with politically controversial measures required to meet ambitious programme commitments. Implementation risk therefore remains high. The agreement highlights the improved relations between Greece and its official creditors since last summer\u2019s often confrontational negotiations leading up to the current ESM programme. The Greek government has implemented prior actions, including pension reform and a contentious requirement for additional fiscal contingency measures to safeguard the 2018 budget target. For their part, Greece\u2019s official creditors have agreed to possible debt relief (nominal haircuts are still excluded)... Delivering debt relief in stages and contingent on programme performance could incentivise the Greek authorities to meet programme targets. However, given the track record of slippage under previous programmes in the past five years, we think there is still a high risk that the 2018 surplus target will be missed despite the agreement on a contingency fiscal mechanism. This risk could increase if the conditionality in Wednesday\u2019s agreement meant that sizeable debt relief came to be seen by Greek politicians or the public as a distant or unattainable prospect. A question mark is therefore likely to remain over the sustainability of Greek debt in the medium term. While gross financing needs are modest over the next few years, substantial increases in gross financing requirements would follow in the long term without further debt re-profiling. Our \u2018CCC\u2019 sovereign rating, which we affirmed in March, reflects risks to programme implementation and debt sustainability. The Eurogroup \u201cbreakthrough\u201d on debt relief was no such thing, says Joan Hoey, Greek analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit: The coveted debt relief upon which the [Greek] prime minister has been banking, to provide a political fig leaf for his acceptance of another bailout, remains out of reach, contingent and unquantified. The Eurogroup did not finalise the long-delayed first review of the bailout programme. It looked at the reforms passed so far and found them wanting. It concluded that several conditions \u201cprior reforms\u201d will have to be met before any money can be handed over. The release of funds would then follow in two sub-tranches, the first amount of \u20ac7.5bn in June, depending on successful completion of \u201cprior actions\u201d. The balance of \u20ac2.8bn will be released only after the clearance of government arrears and after the government has met milestones related to the privatisation fund, bank governance, the revenue collection agency and the energy sector. This disbursement is scheduled for the end of the third quarter. The Eurogroup won a commitment from the IMF, with which it has been at loggerheads over debt relief, to participate in the bailout, pending approval from the Fund\u2019s executive board. We retain our view that disaffection in the party and among the electorate will grow, posing risks to political stability and Greece\u2019s membership of the eurozone. And now some comments emerging from the IMF: Here\u2019s a timeline of Greece\u2019s incoming bailout funds and outgoing payments in the next few months: European markets are holding onto their gains as they head to the close. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: Stocks extended gains on Wednesday as a tentative agreement on Greek debt relief and a fresh seven-month high in the price of US oil offered more cause for optimism. Banks were top risers for a second day as markets price-in the earnings benefit of a possible US rate rise in the summer. Banks in the peripheral of Europe most exposed to Greek debt, including Spain\u2019s Banco Santander, were top performers. Less exposure to Greece and weak earnings from M&amp;S weighed on the FTSE 100, which rose less than its European counterparts. Greek shares rose and the yield on Greek Debt fell after the IMF and Germany deferred a quarrel on Greek debt relief until 2018... Greece avoiding another cliff-edge moment is undoubtedly positive for markets, which already face the uncertainty of the Brexit referendum and Spanish elections in June. The funds to be released following the late night Eurogroup agreement should last Greece until the end of October when the second review of the bailout programme is due start, according to the Athens-Macedonian News Agency. It says: The \u20ac10.3bn tranche that the Eurogroup decided to disburse to Greece will fully meet the country\u2019s financing needs until the end of October, when the second review of the Greek programme is set to start, Eurozone officials said on Wednesday. Describing the events behind the scenes at Tuesday\u2019s Eurogroup, the sources said that the IMF and Europeans had reached a compromise in spite of their different initial positions, while confirming that the IMF will participate. According to one EU official, this was not so much a \u201cpower play\u201d but more that all sides moved from their initial position, with the IMF fully understanding that the Eurozone operates in a different way from the fund. Regarding the measures for the debt, the European sources said that there were no \u201cimmediate decisions\u201d but this was not a surprise, since there were no debts maturing in the short term. In the medium-term, the Eurozone countries said they will examine the possibility of buying up debt to the IMF early, or the bilateral loans with Eurozone countries, using the unspent funds (approximately 20 billion euros) originally destined for the recapitalisation of the banks. This would, however, require the approval of some national parliaments. According to Eurozone officials, the chances that Greece can return to borrowing from the markets at reasonable interest rates at the end of the programme are much higher following the agreement at Tuesday\u2019s Eurogroup. They said that Greece\u2019s access to the markets can begin to be restored gradually, in the second half of 2017, and that the aim is to restore full market access by the end of 2018. The more credible Greece\u2019s economic policy, including its success in delivering primary surplus targets, the smaller the spreads on Greek bonds will be, though borrowing from the Eurozone will always be cheaper, the same sources said. The second review of the Greek programme would begin at the end of October, they added, noting that the measures that remained to be taken will not be as difficult as those required by the first review. In Greece trade unionists are already flexing their muscles and planning mass industrial action, reports Helena Smith. Strikes are expected to start tomorrow when workers at the Piraeus Port Organisation and Thessaloniki Port Organisation begin a 48-hour walk-out in opposition to the controversial privatisation programme the government has signed up to. Adedy, which represents employees in the public sector, has also decided to hold a Pan-Hellenic work stoppage on June 8. \u201cWe decided, today, after meeting health and education federations that we would take this action to protest all the things that these new measures mean: lack of staff, underfunding, appointments that should, but will never happen,\u201d Adedy\u2019s chief policy maker, Grigoris Kalomoiris told the Guardian. \u201cThe Eurogroup was a fiasco for Greece. The government was just a spectator while Germany rode roughshod over everyone else and made all the decisions. To conclude the review we agreed to sell off all our public wealth and impose more of the same counter-productive measures. It makes no sense. Come September/October we foresee mass and dynamic reaction because it is then that the measures will start to kick in.\u201d Kalomoiros said the trade union now firmly believed the only way out for the debt-stricken country was to leave the eurozone. Back with German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble. According to Bloomberg he has said a fourth Greek bailout programme is not needed as of now. As expected, US markets have followed their counterparts elsewhere and moved higher in early trading, partly buoyed by the Greek agreement overnight and continuing strength in the oil price. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 124 points or 0.7% while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.28% and Nasdaq 0.34% better. The moves came despite some weaker than expected US services and composite PMI data. Sch\u00e4uble also said there were no major changes to the Greek bailout programme, according to Reuters, so there was no need for German parliamentary approval. German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has said last night\u2019s result on Greece was a good one, and the next tranche of aid can now be paid out. But it looks like it\u2019s not all sweetness and light with the IMF: Here\u2019s a link to the transcript of the comments by Klaus Regling, head of the European Stability Mechanism, after last night\u2019s Eurogroup meeting: Markets continue to be buoyed by the early morning Greek deal, although are now off their best levels. Banks are among the main movers, both on the Eurogroup agreement and because a rise in US interest rates, which could come as early as June or July, is likely to bolster their balance sheets. In Greece, the Athens market is currently up 0.45%, while the country\u2019s 10 year bond yields are down 8 basis points at 7.3%. Two year bond yields are currently down 87 basis points at 7.37%. Elsewhere in Europe, Germany\u2019s Dax is up 1.4%, France\u2019s Cac has climbed 1.1%, Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is up 1.3% and Spain\u2019s Ibex has added 2.1%. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 is up 0.6% and on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is forecast to open around 73 points higher. The European Central Bank holds its regular meeting next week and some are hoping that it will discuss reintroducing a waiver to allow the central bank to accept Greek bonds (as UniCredit suggested below). FastFT reports (\u00a3): Greek officials are optimistic that the eurozone\u2019s top monetary policymakers will take a big step towards rehabilitating the country\u2019s banking system next week, by deciding to accept Greek bonds as collateral for the European Central Bank\u2019s loans for the first time in more than a year. The ECB\u2019s governing council...will meet next Thursday in Vienna. Officials are likely to use the Vienna meeting to discuss whether to reintroduce a waiver that allows the eurozone\u2019s central bank to accept Greek debt in its regular auctions of central bank cash. Athens is confident that the council will support the reintroduction of the waiver. The waiver was scrapped in February 2015 as the crisis escalated. Someone else who thinks Germany gave the least ground at the marathon Eurogroup meeting, given the delay on any major decisions on debt. Economist Tullia Bucco at UniCredit Research said: In our view, there are two important features in this framework that are intended to provide reassurance to the European creditors for which Greece poses a thorny political issue: 1. The bulk of the debt-relief measures will only be granted at the end of the program in 2018, if necessary, and 2. Long-term relief measures remain very vague. All in all, Germany can be considered to be the winner of the negotiations, given that any major decision on debt relief will only be taken after next year\u2019s general elections, whereas the IMF committed to participate financially to the program already before the end of 2016. The agreement could also pave the way to returning Greek banks to some kind of normality: Last but not least, we think that the deal would soon allow the ECB to reinstate the waiver for Greek bonds posted as collateral at its refinancing operations. This is good news for Greek banks. There were some tired faces at today\u2019s ECOFIN meeting, among ministers who worked late into the night on the Greek agreement. Greece\u2019s finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, looked positively pensive at one point: Tsakalotos also had an expressive chat with Pierre Moscovici, EU Commissioner for Economic Affairs... All sides made some concessions at last night\u2019s Eurogroup meeting, but it does seem that Germany gave the least ground. Writing for Macropolis, the Greek analysis site, Yiannis Mouzakis explains: German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble is probably the one participant in the Eurogroup that completely achieved his objective. His only concession is that he had to compromise on his initial stance that Greece\u2019s debt does not need to be discussed before 2023. There is nothing in this agreement to make him uncomfortable beyond that. It does not require any major changes to the programme\u2019s modalities, the targets remain, large-scale debt measures are not due to happen until after the German elections in autumn next year and the IMF has committed that it will go to its board with a recommendation to participate in the Greek programme with financing and a new programme that will ensure policing of compliance and reform implementation. Yiannis also cautions that today\u2019s deal could turn sour in a few months, particularly if the IMF concludes that Greece\u2019s debt relief doesn\u2019t go far enough. Here\u2019s the piece: A Eurogroup deal that might be hard to stomach Over in Greece, the government\u2019s supporters have hailed the eurogroup deal. Opponents, though, have dismissed it - and argued that Greece must leave the euro. Our Athens correspondent, Helena Smith, reports The sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu \u2013 the underlying current of this six-year crisis \u2013 was in full play this morning, in the media, on the streets and in the commentary of politicians, trade unionists and businessmen, the actors in the drama. While pro-government newspapers lauded the \u201cwhite smoke\u201d that had finally appeared at the end of a gruelling 11-hour euro group, opposition newspapers slammed it as a sham. Avgi, mouthpiece of prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 leftist Syriza party, enthused: \u201cThe review has been concluded, roadmap [agreed] for the debt.\u201d The paper quoted Syriza\u2019s prominent MEP Dimitris Papadimoulis as saying Athens had finally moved on from vagaries to concrete plans regarding the country\u2019s staggering debt pile. \u201cWe are no longer speaking about the debt in general, vague terms but have a framework of an agreement, a concrete roadmap,\u201d he said of the decision to deal with debt load in three stages, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s a good decision that allows us to turn the page.\u201d On the streets, however, enthusiasm was remarkably muted. Shopkeepers shrugged off any suggestion that Greece was about to turn the corner. \u201cIt might bring some stability,\u201d said Panos Tsekouras who runs a textile store in the heart of downtown Athens. \u201cWe won\u2019t see the drama of last year but once the summer is over and the taxes have piled up who is going to pay the bill? There\u2019ll be mayhem.\u201d Opposition politicians from the left and right described the deal as a fiasco. Speaking to the Guardian, Panaghiotis Lafazanis, the former energy minister who broke ranks with Syriza to set up the breakaway anti-austerity Popular Unity party, predicted it would be only a matter of time before there was widespread reaction when the government tried to enforce new taxes and cuts. Lafazanis told me: \u201cIt won\u2019t be able to enforce the measures it has agreed to. This is an agreement that solves no problems and on the contrary creates new ones. Greece, simply, cannot survive in this currency. There will be a disorderly default and ultimate exit from the euro that will be all the worse for not being planned.\u201d Austria\u2019s finance minister, Hans J\u00f6rg Schelling, hopes that the eurozone will avoid a summer of Greek debt drama. Analyst Wolfango Piccoli of Teneo Intelligence is concerned that Greece hasn\u2019t won the solid commitments which prime minister Alexis Tsipras has promised. That may make it harder for Tsipras to hold his small parliamentary majority together, and implement the unpopular austerity measures it has agreed to. Here\u2019s Wolf\u2019s key points: After prolonged talks, Greece and its international lenders achieved a deal about the conclusion of the on-going review in the early hours of 25 May. The standoff between Germany and the IMF has \u2013 for now \u2013 been settled by careful reference to the possibility of limited debt relief measures. While this is a move in the right direction from the Greek perspective, the roadmap remains vague and the eventual meaningful debt relief measures distant. Athens remains stuck with harsh fiscal targets and reform commitments but only vague promises of debt relief, leaving Tsipras badly exposed domestically. The Greek agreement is part of a broader strategy to avoid rocking the boat until Britain\u2019s EU referendum is over, argues my colleague Jonathan Freedland. He writes: Whatever the rights and wrongs of the [Greek] austerity argument, Cameron has wanted the issue to go away \u2013 at least for another month. Today\u2019s bailout loan has achieved that. Rating agency Moody\u2019s has just announced that the Greek deal is \u201ccredit-positive\u201d. Moody\u2019s says the promise of \u20ac10.3bn of bailout loans alleviates the danger that the country defaults this summer. It also welcomes the \u201croad map\u201d on debt relief agreed by creditors, although it is light on details. Although the announcement doesn\u2019t provide specifics on the type of relief, it is clear that material relief will be considered only after the program expires in 2018 and remains contingent on the Greek governments\u2019 ability to implement successfully the conditions associated with the program. However, the agency is also concerned that Athens will struggle to implement the measures agreed with creditors. We consider implementation risks in Greece to remain high, given the small governing majority, weak institutions, and the backdrop of political and social discontent.\u201d Mihir Kapadia, CEO at Sun Global Investments, is relatively upbeat about the deal: The Eurozone provided Greece with a firm offer of debt relief yesterday at a meeting of finance ministers in Brussels, a decision which could see the Euro provide \u20ac10bn in new funds for the country. The IMF seems to have softened its stance significantly from its hard line position as it had previously insisted that Greece\u2019s proposed programme did not offer a path to fiscal sustainability. The positive conclusions to these talks are a good sign on a number of fronts \u2013 showing flexibility by the IMF and European ministers, and some early signs of improving confidence in Greece. Greek 10-year bond yields fell below 7% this morning for the first time since November 2015.\u201d We\u2019re going to need a new metaphor.... Yanis Varoufakis, Greece\u2019s former finance minister, has given the deal the thumbs-down: A year ago, Varoufakis was doing battle with the eurogroup on a weekly basis (at least, that\u2019s how it felt), trying to persuade fellow ministers to abandon their push for austerity packages laden with tax rises. That approach died after the Greek people voted to reject creditors demands\u2019, only for prime minister Tsipras to sign up to the third bailout. If you missed the Greek agreement, it\u2019s online here: The Financial Times has a good word to describe the Greek deal - \u201cmessy\u201d. And that\u2019s because the really sticky issue, of how to make Athens\u2019 debts sustainable, has been kicked down the road. Although the creditors have made commitments, the agreement released in the early hours of this morning is light on detail. Mehreen Khan and Alex Barker sum it up: The ambiguities are legion. A target was set to maintain Greece\u2019s gross financing needs at no more than 15 per cent of national income until 2030. And measures were outlined to do that, including maturity extensions and a possible buyout of IMF loans in 2018. The caveat: no numbers were agreed on what relief the measures would actually deliver. And while the IMF dropped its most ambitious debt relief demands \u2014 including the need for them to be automatic when Greece exits its programme in 2018 \u2014 there was a big caveat. To participate financially in the programme before the end of the year, the IMF would need to approve a new debt sustainability analysis (DSA) on Greece that would meet its normal lending standards. For Germany too, the deal amounted to a trade-off. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, German finance minister, met his two main red lines: no haircuts and no Bundestag votes before the German federal elections in 2018. But to secure the IMF\u2019s political participation, he made a concession: an implicit commitment to meeting a DSA that will be hard to retreat from. And language was softened on the requirement for Greece to meet a 3.5 per cent budget surplus target for at least the next 10 years; this would now be reviewed in 2018. More here: Messy Greek debt deal leaves key questions unanswered In another reassuring signal from the markets, the yield on 2-year Greek bonds has tumbled below the 10-year bond yield. Why does that matter? Because it means investors are now rating Greece\u2019s short-term debt as less risky than its longer-term borrowings. That\u2019s how markets usually operate -- but for months Greece\u2019s two-year yields (which rise when prices fall) have soared over the 10-year yield. Why? Because if Greece can\u2019t repay its debts, it will default on shorter-dated bonds first. This chart, from Reuters\u2019 John Geddie, explains all: Although the London market is at a three-week high, City investors do recognise that the details of Greece\u2019s debt relief are still up in the air. Joshua Mahony of IG explains: Eurozone discussions finally reached a conclusion regarding the restructuring of Greek debt, yet the outcome was far from constructive as ministers decided to kick the can by simply resume talks after the French and German elections. This issue will drag on for years and there is a feeling that the Greeks will say whatever they need to in order to get a good deal. With austerity crippling the Greek economy, the hopes of it standing on its own two feet and paying back its debts anytime soon seem negligible. Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit is also concerned about Greece\u2019s debt mountain, which is currently 180% of GDP. The International Monetary Fund is coming under fire from debt campaigners this morning. They\u2019re disappointed that the Fund has abandoned its commitment to \u201cupfront\u201d Greek debt relief as part of last night\u2019s deal. Instead, medium-term debt relief will only kick in around 2018 - and the details are still Sarah-Jayne Clifton, Director of the Jubilee Debt Campaign, says this isn\u2019t acceptable: \u201cIMF staff are proposing to lend more money to Greece without the upfront and unconditional debt relief they called for. This is a major climb down, which once again breaks the IMF\u2019s own rules not to lend when they know a debt cannot be paid. Last night, the IMF\u2019s Poul Thomsen agreed that the Fund had made a \u2018major concession\u2019, in order to reach a deal. In return, all creditors agreed that Greece\u2019s debts are unsustainable, paving the way to debt relief over time. Clifton though, insists that action is needed now. \u201cEurozone finance ministers cannot keep repeating this pattern of sticking plaster measures followed by near defaults and all night crisis meetings for the next 40 years. Only significant cancellation of Greece\u2019s debt now, including payments coming due now such as to the IMF and ECB, will help tackle the humanitarian crisis in the country and restore the lack of confidence which is holding back Greece and the wider European economy.\u201d Economist Megan Greene, of asset management firm Manulife, says Berlin appears to have won last night\u2019s Tussle in Brussels: Greece\u2019s stock market has jumped by 1.4% in early trading, led by bank stocks. Greek government bonds are on an absolute tear this morning, as fears of a disorderly default fade away. The country\u2019s 10-year bonds are rallying hard, driving down the interest rate (or yield) on the debt below 7% for the first time since last November. That\u2019s an important sign \u2013 7% is traditionally the level where a country\u2019s debts are unaffordable. So investors are calculating that this agreement is significant, despite the doubts and question marks. Henrik Enderlein, director of the Jacques Delors Institute, sums up the deal: After a few hours sleep, Eurozone ministers are returning to the Justis Lipsius building for a full Ecofin meeting with EU ministers. They won\u2019t be discussing Greece - instead, they\u2019ll be debating an anti tax avoidance Directive. Commissioner Pierre Moscovici just shared a touching embrace with Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem. A cheerful-sounding Dijsselbloem then says that last night\u2019s agreement with Greece is a \u201creally important step\u201d. All sides realised we had to get a deal, he says, even though we all realised it would be difficult. The IMF was asking a lot, and we were asking a lot of Greece. But the deal brings the IMF on board, strengthens confidence between all sides, and thus should improve confidence within the eurozone. Q: So are we 100% sure that the IMF will be on board? No, Dijsselbloem says. The Fund must conduct its own debt sustainability analysis, and the final decision is up to its board. Marc Ostwald of City firm ADM Investor Services is also underwhelmed by the deal: This is another to be sorted under \u2018can kicking\u2019, leaving any decision on genuine debt relief until 2018, after the French and German elections, but also not creating any precedents or short-term crises which might influence the Italian municipal elections on June 5, the UK Brexit referendum on June 23 or the Spanish election on June 26. It also continues to impose austerity measures which will continue to strangle the Greek economy, per se ensuring that the next crisis moment in the Greek saga will not be far away. European stock markets have jumped in early trading. The news that Greece will finally receive the \u20ac10bn bailout tranche is easing concerns of another eurozone financial crisis over the summer, on top of Britain\u2019s EU referendum. In London, the FTSE 100 has swiftly gained 40 points, or 0.6%, to 6255. That\u2019s its highest level since May 3rd. Germany\u2019s DAX has gained 0.8%. Peter Spiegel, the FT\u2019s former Brussels bureau chief, isn\u2019t completely convinced by the agreement. Last night\u2019s deal may not be perfect, but it appears to \u2018kick the can\u2019 down the road until after France and Germany have gone to the polls in 2017. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets explain: \u20ac7.5bn will be released in June that will allow Greece cover maturing IMF and ECB loans in June and July and begin to clear arrears which have built up as the review process has stalled. The outstanding portion of the payment will then be made after the summer. There was also agreement on a roadmap for Greek debt relief. In the short term this is mainly through managing the interest rate and repayment profile of euro area loans. Further out, there was commitment on further measures once the programme is completed in 2018. While not quite the unconditional debt relief the IMF had called for in its assessment of Greece\u2019s debt sustainability, the measures are sufficient for the Fund to stay involved in the programme although that will still have to be formally approved by the IMF board. The deal means that Greece should now be \u2018parked\u2019 until after next year\u2019s German general and French presidential elections but, equally important, any decision on Greek debt relief won\u2019t have to be taken in the German parliament until after the next autumn\u2019s vote. Money is pouring into government debt issued by the eurozone\u2019s weaker members this morning, as investors react to Greece\u2019s debt real. This has driven down the yield (or interest rate) on peripheral government bonds -- a sign that traders are happy to buy these riskier assets. Reuters has the details: Portugal\u2019s 10-bond yield fell 4.8 basis points to a three-week low at 3.02%, while Spanish and Italian 10-year bond yields fell to one-month lows at around 1.51% and 1.40% respectively. \u201cThe agreement between Greece and its creditors is positive for risk sentiment and in turn peripheral bond markets,\u201d said Rene Arecht, a derivatives market analyst at DZ Bank. I imagine we\u2019ll also see a rally when the Greek stock and bond markets open shortly.... Our Brussels correspondent, Jennifer Rankin, explains how the IMF has backed down over its demands for immediate Greek debt relief: European officials have agreed to unlock \u20ac10.3bn in bailout money for Greece as the International Monetary Fund made a significant climbdown in its demand for upfront debt relief for the recession-hit country. Greece\u2019s international creditors emerged from an 11-hour meeting in Brussels at 2am on Wednesday having agreed on steps to ease the burden of Greece\u2019s \u20ac321bn (\u00a3245bn) debt mountain, worth 180% of annual economic output. But the debt relief plan was a far cry from the \u201cupfront\u201d and \u201cunconditional\u201d debt relief the IMF had demanded on Monday, when it warned that Greece would face an ever-growing bill to service its loans. Poul Thomsen, director of the IMF\u2019s European programme, said the IMF had made \u201ca major concession\u201d. \u201cWe had argued that [debt relief measures] should be approved up front and [now] we have agreed that they should be made at the end of the programme period. Here\u2019s her full dispatch from Brussels, a few hours ago: Good morning. There\u2019s a sense of relief in the eurozone this morning after Greece and its creditors finally hammered out a deal to unlock \u20ac10bn in bailout funds, and trigger work on debt relief. After a lengthy meeting, which we liveblogged through the night, ministers emerged to report that a breakthrough had been reached. Both sides appear to have given some ground to get the deal onto the table. One the one hand, all creditors have agreed that Greece\u2019s debt mountain is unsustainable \u2013 suggesting Germany has given up some ground. On the other, debt relief isn\u2019t as immediate or concrete as the International Monetary Fund has been demanded, meaning the Fund has made concessions too. If you were snoozing during the action, here\u2019s the key points: 1) Greece has finally received the green light to receive more than \u20ac10bn in bailout funds, easing concerns that it could face financial peril this summer. A few prior actions do remain, concerning pensions and privatisations, but once that is resolved, the money will flow -- starting with \u20ac7.5bn in June. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem told reporters that Greece\u2019s programme was back on track. \u201cWe achieved a major breakthrough on Greece which enables us to enter a new phase in the Greek financial assistance programme.... This is stretching what I thought would have been possible not so long ago.\u201d 2) In an important development, the International Monetary Fund has signalled that it could join the bailout. That could happen by the end of 2016. However, the IMF\u2019s European chief Poul Thomsen insisted that the Fund must check that the eurozone is offering substantial debt relief. In a rare public appearance, Thomsen said: We welcome that all stakeholders recognise that Greek debt is unsustainable. We welcome that it is understood that Greece needs debt relief to make it sustainable. 3) Eurozone ministers have agreed to \u201ca package of debt measures\u201d to make Greece\u2019s debts sustainable. That will start with short-term tweaks to Greece\u2019s debts, to smooth out its obligations. Medium-term measures are also promised, although not until 2018, which looks like a concession from the IMF. There is also a commitment to consider whether further restructuring will be needed once the bailout ends, assuming Athens sticks to the programme and everything works out. However, this doesn\u2019t appear to be as comprehensive, wide-ranging and unconditional as the IMF has been demanding. 4) The deal has been generally welcomed by Greece\u2019s finance minister. Euclid Tsakalotos said it would help end the country\u2019s vicious circle of austerity and recession. Donald Tusk, the head of the European Council, said the Greek deal was good for the global economy. Slovakia\u2019s finance minister Peter Kazimir also sounded satisfied, comparing the negotiations to \u201ca complicated birth\u201d. And France\u2019s Michel Sapin was positively upbeat, saying the deal was \u201cfirst and foremost a declaration of confidence in today\u2019s Greece.\u201d But that was last night. Now that people have slept on it (however briefly), we should get some proper reaction.",

If CPI is used, pension entitlements increase by around 1% less per annum than under CPI. Over a 15-20 year period, that\u2019s a 15-20% reduction on the size of an individual\u2019s pension.</p> <p>\u201cWhether or not a scheme has the flexibility to adopt CPI comes down to how the lawyer wrote scheme rules before 2011. Some schemes, such as British Airways, allow the flexibility to adopt CPI. Others, such as British Steel, clearly don\u2019t. There\u2019s a \u2018scheme rules lottery\u2019 in respect of RPI and CPI.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>And what would it mean for an individual? Fortes has the answer:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cFor a British Steel pensioner with a \u00a35,000 per annum pension, a move to CPI will see them \u00a350 worse in year one, \u00a3100 in year two and so in. Over a typical pensioners\u2019 lifetime this is a loss of \u00a315,000 of lifetime savings.

A number of bidders have made it clear that the British Steel Pension Scheme (BSPS) presents a major challenge to any sale. We also fully understand the great importance of this pension scheme to both current and former steelworkers and steel communities across the UK.</p> <p>There has been a lot of speculation that any sale of Tata\u2019s assets would involve the BSPS going into the Pension Protection Fund (PPF). The trade unions believe that such a move would be an unmitigated disaster. The PPF is a financial safety net but it would see every member of the scheme take an unnecessary cut in pension benefits. The financial health of the BSPS is such that going into the PPF can certainly be avoided.</p> <p>We welcome the announcement of a government consultation on the future of the BSPS and the trade unions will of course make a full submission in due course. It is important that all stakeholders continue to explore all available options that avoid the need for the scheme to go into the PPF, which would be the worst deal for scheme members. We will seek to work constructively with the UK Government and the scheme trustees to deliver the best possible deal for our members. We need to ensure that there are cast iron safeguards in place so this unique situation does not result in employers dodging their pensions responsibilities.</p> <p>It is important to remember that Tata Steel remains the employer and sponsor of the BSPS. They have significant legal, social and moral responsibilities with regards to the British steel industry and those men and women who have worked and continue to work within it.</p> <p>As we have done so throughout this process, we will continue to be led by our members in the steel industry. In the midst of this crisis and great uncertainty, they continue to produce world class steel that supports the UK\u2019s entire industrial base. The steel industry\u2019s highly skilled and dedicated workforce will surely be the foundation on which a sustainable, profitable future for the industry will be built.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CommunityUnion/status/735800469847715840\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BREAKING: Joint statement on British Steel Pension Scheme from the steel trade unions <a href=\"https://t.co/SCuYDL9lIA\">https://t.co/SCuYDL9lIA</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SaveOurSteel?src=hash\">#SaveOurSteel</a></p>&mdash; Community union (@CommunityUnion) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CommunityUnion/status/735800469847715840\">May 26, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-05-26T14:22:51.633Z\">at 3.22pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57470033e4b006af16bc0aa1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-26T14:01:12.848Z\">3.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The proposed pension changes are controversial for another reason.</strong></p> <p>The prospect of workers\u2019 pension rights being cut has prompted Tata to reconsider selling its UK assets at all!

                "bodyText":"Time to wrap up. A quick recap: MPs have urged Sajid Javid to treat cautiously, after the business secretary confirmed that the government is considering cutting the pension entitlements of British Steel workers. During an urgent statement in parliament, MPs from across the House warned of the risk that other organisations try to follow suit, potentially hitting millions of workers in the pocket. During the session, Javid explained that the scheme\u2019s Trustees had proposed shifting the scheme to a lower inflation rate [from RPI to CPI], to cover its \u00a3700m deficit. He also promised not to be hasty, despite giving just four weeks to consult on the proposal. Jo Stevens, Labour MP for Cardiff Central, said it was a \u201cpotentially very risky and precedent-setting proposal\u201d. Neil Gray, the SNP\u2019s employment spokesman, said the \u201cincredibly sensitive\u201d pensions issue must be \u201chandled with extreme care\u201d by the Government. Otherwise, he fears it could create: \u201ca very dangerous precedent that undermines workplace pensions and incentives to save to secure dignity in retirement\u201d. And Frank Field, who chairs parliament\u2019s pensions committee, warned that \u201cthousands of other schemes\u201d are in a similar predicament. Javid had just returned from meeting with Indian conglomerate Tata. He told MPs that there are seven credible bidders interested in buying Tata\u2019s assets. But he refused to comment on rumours that Tata is now considering keeping its plants, if the proposal for pension cuts is accepted. Full coverage of the session, complete with questions from a stream of MPs, starts here. Unions representing Britain\u2019s workers have welcomed the government\u2019s decision to launch a consultation today. They said it would be an \u201cunmitigated disaster\u201d if the scheme had to be rescued by the Pensions Protection Fund. One expert has predicted that the proposed change to inflation indexing would save the scheme \u00a32.5bn, and steadily eat into a pensioners\u2019 income. Here\u2019s our latest story on the Steel crisis, which will be updated later: And in other news.... Economists are worried that Britain\u2019s economy suffered a drop in business spending in the last quarter, dragging growth down to 0.4%. Britain\u2019s EU referendum appears to be partly to blame, along with the financial market turmoil in January and the slowing global economy. In another worrying sign, the proportion of young people not in education, employment or training has jumped. The oil price has fallen back below $50 per barrel, after setting a new 2016 high this morning. And in the eurozone, French protesters have scuffled with police, as dock workers set off smoke bombs and union activists disrupted fuel supplies and nuclear plants. It\u2019s all part of a new protest against labour market reforms, giving Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s government another headache. Shifting the British Steel pension scheme from the Retail Prices Index to the Consumer Prices index, as the Trustees have proposed, would wipe \u00a32.5bn of its liabilities. So says Clive Fortes, Partner at Hymans Robertson, a pensions consultancy firm. Fortes explains: \u201cIn 2011 the Government changed statutory pension increases from RPI to CPI. If CPI is used, pension entitlements increase by around 1% less per annum than under CPI. Over a 15-20 year period, that\u2019s a 15-20% reduction on the size of an individual\u2019s pension. \u201cWhether or not a scheme has the flexibility to adopt CPI comes down to how the lawyer wrote scheme rules before 2011. Some schemes, such as British Airways, allow the flexibility to adopt CPI. Others, such as British Steel, clearly don\u2019t. There\u2019s a \u2018scheme rules lottery\u2019 in respect of RPI and CPI. And what would it mean for an individual? Fortes has the answer: \u201cFor a British Steel pensioner with a \u00a35,000 per annum pension, a move to CPI will see them \u00a350 worse in year one, \u00a3100 in year two and so in. Over a typical pensioners\u2019 lifetime this is a loss of \u00a315,000 of lifetime savings. On the plus side, this only one third of the average loss on falling in to the Pension Protection Fund. The government\u2019s proposed changes to the British Steel pension scheme could prompt a row with the European Union, according to the Financial Times. It says: If the government legislates to amend the rules governing one pension fund \u2014 for a struggling industry \u2014 it could raise alarm bells in Brussels: it is likely to be seen as state aid by EU officials. This won\u2019t be a problem, though, if Britain votes to leave the EU next month (on the day the consultation closes). The FT also flags up the winners and losers from the plan: In the 40-page consultation document it emerged that not all members of the scheme would be better off under the proposals. Some 5,800 would be worse off, 70,000 would be in the same situation and 40,000 would be in a better situation. (that\u2019s compared to entering the Payment Protection Fund, which would also prompt a cut to benefits) Parliament\u2019s Business, Innovation and Skills committee has just moved a step closer to getting Mike Ashley, boss of Sports Direct, to testify before them. The committee has written to Askley, declining his invitation to visit his Shirebrook warehouse. Instead, they expected to see the retail titan in their committee room on June 7 to face questions about working conditions at Sports Direct. Committee chairman Iain Wright also warns Ashley that they may also hear some critical comments about working practices (something the Guardian exposed last year). Here\u2019s the full letter: Britain\u2019s steel union have welcomed the government\u2019s decision to open a consultation on making changes to the British Steel pension scheme. They confirm that the deficit - now \u00a3700m, it appears \u2013 is a serious hurdle to finding a buyer for Tata\u2019s operations in the UK. Crucially, they warn that it would be a disaster if the scheme fell into the Pension Protection Scheme \u2013 the lifeboat for failed pension scheme. Here\u2019s the full statement: The steel trade unions \u2013 Community, Unite and GMB \u2013 have been in dialogue with the UK Government and Tata Steel for a number of weeks to secure a sustainable future for our industry. A number of bidders have made it clear that the British Steel Pension Scheme (BSPS) presents a major challenge to any sale. We also fully understand the great importance of this pension scheme to both current and former steelworkers and steel communities across the UK. There has been a lot of speculation that any sale of Tata\u2019s assets would involve the BSPS going into the Pension Protection Fund (PPF). The trade unions believe that such a move would be an unmitigated disaster. The PPF is a financial safety net but it would see every member of the scheme take an unnecessary cut in pension benefits. The financial health of the BSPS is such that going into the PPF can certainly be avoided. We welcome the announcement of a government consultation on the future of the BSPS and the trade unions will of course make a full submission in due course. It is important that all stakeholders continue to explore all available options that avoid the need for the scheme to go into the PPF, which would be the worst deal for scheme members. We will seek to work constructively with the UK Government and the scheme trustees to deliver the best possible deal for our members. We need to ensure that there are cast iron safeguards in place so this unique situation does not result in employers dodging their pensions responsibilities. It is important to remember that Tata Steel remains the employer and sponsor of the BSPS. They have significant legal, social and moral responsibilities with regards to the British steel industry and those men and women who have worked and continue to work within it. As we have done so throughout this process, we will continue to be led by our members in the steel industry. In the midst of this crisis and great uncertainty, they continue to produce world class steel that supports the UK\u2019s entire industrial base. The steel industry\u2019s highly skilled and dedicated workforce will surely be the foundation on which a sustainable, profitable future for the industry will be built. The proposed pension changes are controversial for another reason. The prospect of workers\u2019 pension rights being cut has prompted Tata to reconsider selling its UK assets at all! That\u2019s according to The Times, which reported today that: The sale of Tata Steel\u2019s UK assets has been thrown into confusion after speculation that the business secretary has offered Tata a deal so attractive that it may yet keep Port Talbot and a dozen other facilities around the country. One of those sweeteners is said to include an accommodation to downgrade the retirement benefits of members in the British Steel Pensions Scheme to try to keep a lid on the \u00a315 billion fund\u2019s \u00a3485 million deficit. But some ministers are apparently fighting the proposal, fearing that it would open a \u201cPandora\u2019s Box\u201d and prompt other companies to cut entitlements too. My colleague Graham Ruddick sums up the key exchange from the steel session (which starts back at noon BST) Sajid Javid, the business secretary, said the trustees had asked the government to make the scheme exempt from legislation in the 1995 Pensions Act. \u201cThe scheme\u2019s trustees have come forward and asked us to look at current legislation,\u201d Javid told MPs. \u201cThe scheme trustees have put forward this proposal and it is only right that we consider it.\u201d However, Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, said the plans \u201crisk setting a very worrying precedent\u201d and questioned whether the government can ensure that any changes to pension laws are \u201csafely ring-fenced\u201d. Here\u2019s our latest story on the issue: In Yes Minister, Jim Hacker defined a dangerous precedent thus: \u201cIf we do the right thing this time, we might have to do the right thing again next time.\u201d But several MPs who spoke in parliament this lunchtime are worried that the government\u2019s plans for British Steel could create the wrong sort of precedent, and hurt millions of workers in the pocket. And I think they\u2019re right to be concerned. As Sajid Javid pointed out, the suggestion to switch inflation linking from RPI to the (lower) CPI rate came from the British Steel trustees themselves. Other trustees wrestling with similar pension deficits are likely to be pondering whether a similar shift could work for them. Javid pointed out that the only thing preventing the British Steel trustees is current legislation (pesky laws, eh?). And we must assume that this legislation could be changed, if the consultation backs the plan. I say if, but the Trustees have already concluded that the change would mean workers are either better off, or no worse off, than other options. Labour\u2019s Angela Eagle didn\u2019t let Javid off lightly, though \u2013 reminding the House of the minister\u2019s failure to fly to Mumbai in March, when Tata decided to pull out of the UK. Eagle also put her finger on a serious concern -- the government\u2019s consultation closes in four weeks time. Is that really enough time to consider such a serious issue? And how much time will be spent deliberating? Tata are clearly determined to get a sale quickly, so there\u2019s a lot of pressure on the government. On a brighter note, Javid had just returned to the UK from Mumbai, where he met with Tata\u2019s top brass. He still seems optimistic that a deal will be found, with seven credible bidders showing serious interest. But still..... the precedent of changing pensions rules to that workers get less than they were promised has clearly worried MPs on both sides of the house. Several members pushed Javid to confirm that any changes would just be ringfenced to British Steel, not used as a template for other companies. The business secretary did indeed give that assurance, but some MPs looked pretty concerned. Not just Labour -- Conservative Julian Knight pointed out that there is a fundamental principle here. Pensioners are entitled to receive what they were promised when they paid into a scheme. Javid also appeared to indicate that steel workers wouldn\u2019t get a ballot on the changes. And finally, Labour MP Madeleine Moon of Bridgend says that other companies are already poaching skilled steel workers. Q: Shouldn\u2019t the government give an assurance that public sector contracts will always demand a high percentage of British steel, to underpin confidence? Javid says that the government has already allowed economic and social factors to be taken into account. And he repeats that the government\u2019s promise of financial help has also provided confidence. And that is the end of the session Geriant Davies, Labour Co-operative MP for Swansea West, tells the house that he warned the government that minimum carbon pricing would hurt the steel industry. Javid agrees that energy costs are important, but not the only factor facing steel plants. Q: Does the government still want to grant China \u2018market economy status\u2019 (which the European Parliament voted against this month) Javid says the European Commission is considering the issue, but it wouldn\u2019t prevent tariffs being imposed on Chinese steel. Clive Betts MP asks the government to act on energy costs, which mean steel works pay 85% more than German rivals. Javid repeats that the government has already acted on this issue, and is prepared to do more. Sue Hayman MP asks the business secretary to reassure steel workers that they will get their full pensions. Sajid Javid agrees that steel workers have worked hard for their pensions, so the government must do everything possible to find the best outcome. The SNP\u2019s Margaret Ferrier asks about proposals to change the \u2018lesser duty rule\u2019, which allows Chinese steel firms to sell their products in the UK without a hefty tariff. Javid says there are ways to improve the lesser duty rule, but doesn\u2019t believe it should be scrapped. Labour\u2019s Paul Flynn says he\u2019ll soon qualify for a pension after 30 years in the steel industry, but it will be dwarfed by House of Commons pension. Isn\u2019t it repugnant that workers in such a dangerous, skilled, industry are being asked to pay to cover their pension deficit? Javid says the government will leave no stone unturned to find a buyer for Tata\u2019s UK assets. Richard Fuller, Conservative MP, makes an important point -- could any future surplus be transferred out of the pension fund? Javid agrees that pension benefits should always go to those who have paid in. Labour\u2019s David Anderson raises the issue of miners\u2019 pensions, saying retired workers are suffering from government decisions in the past. Javid says that the proposals on the table today are different to what happened in the 1990s. [some background: in 1994, the government took half of the surplus in the miners\u2019 pension scheme, but some workers then missed out on their half due to pension rules] Kevin Foster, Conservative MP, urges the government to ringfence any pension changes Javid repeats that this is a one-off situation. Javid then warns that unless changes are made, it\u2019s very likely that the British Steel pension scheme would have to be rescued by the Pension Protection Fund (which would also result in a cut to benefits). Q: Will any changes to the British Steel pension scheme be put to a ballot of members? Javid says that the Trustees already have the right to change the indexing, but they are prevented by legislation. It\u2019s important that full information is provided to members, he adds. So, no ballot? Asked again about steel-dumping, Sajid Javid says that British steel is the best in the world - and some companies have come to regret buying inferior foreign alternatives. Labour\u2019s Jessica Morden asks what the government is doing to reassure companies who buy British steel, such as Nissan (who have a plant in her constituency, Newport East). Sajid Javid says the government has been speaking to customers and telling them that British steel has a long-term future. Conservative MP Steve Double asks what impact the climate change levy introduced by Gordon Brown has had on the steel industry. Sajid Javid says the government is providing support and exemptions to help companies with energy costs. Kevan Jones MP raises the importance of Britain\u2019s steel industry to the defence sector. Javid says 95,000 tonnes of British steel will be used in the new Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier. Q: Could potential bidders work in partnership to help the steel industry? Javid says that the field of seven bidders will be narrowed, and he\u2019s confident that Tata would be amenable if bidders wanted to work together. Asked about timings, Savid Javid says there is no deadline to find a buyer - but Tata want to move quickly. Redcar MP Anna Turley, says the government has acted disgracefully over the steel crisis and urges Javid not to inflict more pain on workers. (a steel plant in Redcar closed last autumn with the loss of 1,700 jobs). Sajid Javid says that more details about the proposed pension plans will be released soon, which should provide reassurance to workers. Conservative MP Mark Spencer wants reassurances that any deal will work, and that MPs won\u2019t be back discussing this issue in two years. Javid repeates that there is no deal yet, and any deal depends on the approval of the Pension Regulator. Dennis Skinner MP raises the issue of the miners\u2019 pension scheme, saying the \u201clousy rotten Tory government\u201d refused to provide any help. Javid says this doesn\u2019t have anything to do today\u2019s issue. Conservative MP Julian Knight says the government must retain the crucial principles that members always have the final say, and that pension promises are delivered. Javid agrees that the integrity of the pension system must be retained. He repeats that the pension scheme trustees believe that changing the inflation indexing is in the best interests of its members. Seema Kennedy, Conservative MP for South Ribble, asks what support is being given to steel workers and their communities. Javid says that the best support is the confidence that there is a long-term future for the UK steel industry. That includes the offer of hundreds of millions of pounds of investment, that could see the government buying a 25% stake. Labour\u2019s Jo Stevens asks what discussions have taken place with the pensions regulator about this \u201cpotentially risky and precedent-setting proposal\u201d. Javid says discussions have taken place, and confirmed that they would need to have the regulator\u2019s full support. Labour\u2019s Tom Blenkinsop says his father in law is a British steel pensioner. Q: What would happen if the scheme were taken into the Pension Protection Fund? Sajiv Javid says that if this happened, workers would still get 100% of their pension but the indexing would probably move to the CPI inflation rate. Conservative MP Peter Bone says the government needs to get to the \u201croot of the problem\u201d, the dumping of Chinese steel. Q: Why can\u2019t the government impose higher tariffs, as the US just did? Javid says the government has acted when there is evidence of steel dumping. Labour\u2019s Stephen Kinnock, who represents Port Talbot, raises media reports that Tata could actually retain its UK assets. Javid declines to comment on these rumours, saying the government wants to work constructively with all potential bidders. Conservative David Mowat asks whether changing the benchmarking from RPI to CPI inflation will bring the British Steel pension scheme into surplus. Q: If not, could workers face a \u201cdouble-whammy\u201d if the scheme later moves into the Pension Protection Fund? The trustees believe it would bring the scheme into surplus, and make it stable, Javid replies. But the pension regulator would have to be satisfied first. Frank Field, who chairs the work and pension committee, points out that many other pension schemes are in deficit. It will be hard to \u2018gate\u2019 these plans just to the steel industry. He asks for a discussion after the recess, to consider the full impact of the proposed changes. Javid says he\u2019s happy to meet with Field to discuss the issue, and repeats that the government\u2019s plans are restricted to the steel sector. Tom Pursglove MP asks if the government knows whether more investment could come to steel works in his constituency, Corby. Javid says commercial details are sensitive, but there are seven serious bids on the table. Iain Wright MP, who chairs the business, innovation and skills committee,is also worried about the precedent issue. Q: Is this deal purely for steel, or is it being extended to other strategically important industries? And is the government\u2019s preferred option the 2012 deal for Royal Mail, which distinguished between past and future contributions? Javid says there is no deal yet, and no preferred option and no decision has been made. He repeats that the government is keen not to create a dangerous precedent. This is a unique case. Conservative MP David Davies, of Monmouth, commends Sajid Javid for his efforts to save the UK steel industry. But he urges the business secretary to proceed carefully Javid agrees that the government shouldn\u2019t be reckless, but points out that the trustee of the Pension Scheme has announced his support. SNP MP Neil Gray is disappointed by the lack of detail in the government\u2019s plans. Q: How would it affect current workers, and could it be a dangerous precedent? Javid says the government must tread carefully, and avoid creating any precedents that the House would regretted later. But it\u2019s right to listen to the Trustees\u2019 concerns. Onto questions. Pauline Latham, Conservative MP, asks about another crisis - the future of BHS. A company in her constituency, Courtaulds, which supplies the stricken retailer has gone into administration. Can the government help? Sajid Javid agrees to meet Latham to discuss Courtaulds. Sajid Javid defends the short length of the consultation - time is of the essence in the search for a buyer. He says the trustees of the British Steel pension fund approached the government, asking for changes to be made. Javid confirms that legislation in the 1995 pension act prevents the trustees from benchmarking pensions against the consumer price index (CPI) rather than the retail price index (RPI). They want the government to allow a change. The trustees believe that, in almost every case, members would be better off, or no worse off, he says. But the government must assess whether it is the right thing to do - thus the consultation. Labour\u2019s shadow business secretary, Angela Eagle, responds. She reminds the house that steel workers protested outside parliament yesterday. She\u2019s disappointed that Sajid Javid didn\u2019t give any more details about the pensions consultation in his statement. And is worried that the consultation will only run for four weeks. She says the business secretary was right to visit Mumbai this week -- a case of \u201cbetter late than never\u201d (a reference to his notorious trip to Australia when the steel crisis blew up) Eagle is worried that moving from the RPI inflation rate to the CPI version \u201crisks creating a very dangerous precedent\u201d. And it is currently illegal. She asks if the government can ring-fence any such move, to protect other workers. And finally, has the secretary of state considered the impact on the incentive to save, if pensions rights can be arbitrarily cut. The steel crisis is ultimately about the workers who make Britain\u2019s steel industry the best in the world, Javid continues. We will continue to fight for British steel for a long as it takes, he adds. Sajid Javid begins by telling MPs that he just returned from Mumbai a few hours ago. During his trip, he stressed the importance of Tata running a \u201cresponsible\u201d sales process for its UK steel operations. There are several credible bids on the table, which Tata is now considering closely. The government will continue its dialogue with Tata, and those bidders. Javid says it\u2019s not the government\u2019s job to pick a winner, but to help with the sales process and remove potential obstacles. That\u2019s why they have launched a consultation into the pension scheme today. Javid: Several credible bids for Tata\u2019s UK steel works Business secretary Sajid Javid is on his feet, updating the House of Commons on the British Steel pensions consulation. It\u2019s being streamed on the BBC\u2019s Parliament site. I\u2019ll cover the main points in this liveblog. One of the City of London\u2019s top experts on pensions is worried about the government\u2019s plan. Tom McPhail, head of retirement policy at financial service group Hargreaves Lansdown, says: In this case, a change of escalation rates could be the least worse solution. But the potential deal on British Steel could rip a hole in one of the most fundamental principles of pension provision. It is well-established that pension benefits, once granted cannot be taken away. The government should be very cautious about sacrificing such a principle in pursuit of short term interests, even if there are tens of thousands of jobs at stake. McPhail adds that a proper review of final salary guarantees is needed. The situation in the British steel pension fund is worse than first thought.... Opposition MPs have already criticised the government for suddenly launching this consultation, just before the House of Commons breaks for a recess. This one-month consultation is due to end on the same day as the EU referendum.... The trustee of the British Steel pension fund is backing the government over its plans to potentially cut pension payments to workers. Allan Johnston believes this would be a better outcome for members than entering the Pension Protection Fund (when there is an automatic 10% reduction to benefits) My colleague Graham Ruddick explains: The government believes if it can significantly restructure the pension scheme then Tata Steel can be persuaded to keep the business. Sajid Javid, the business secretary, has said the government is willing to offer hundreds of millions of pounds to a buyer and is looking at ways to restructure the pension scheme by reducing its liabilities by billions of pounds. However, there is a row within the government about Javid\u2019s plan to cut the scheme\u2019s liabilities by benchmarking it against the consumer price index (CPI) rather than the retail price index (RPI) and spinning it off into a new financial vehicle. The Department for Work and Pensions is concerned that this could set a dangerous precedent for defined benefit pension schemes, also known as a final salary scheme. Here\u2019s the full story: There are important developments in the crisis gripping Britain\u2019s steel industry, which could hit pensioners in the pocket. The government has announced a new consultation into overhauling the British Steel Pension Scheme. That scheme, currently in deficit, is a stumbling-block to finding a buyer for several steel plants including the Port Talbot blast furnace. Pensions minister Stephen Crabb has told parliament in a written statement that: \u201cThe consultation includes a full range of options that consider whether and how the scheme could be separated from the existing sponsoring employer and whether it will be necessary to reduce the benefits within the scheme.\u201d The Scheme has liabilities of around \u00a315bn, and a deficit of around \u00a3700m \u00a3485m . Crabb\u2019s announcement is fuelling concerns that pensioners across the country could suffer, if benefits due to steel workers are cut. A former pensions minister, Steve Webb, has warned that the government was \u201cgoing down a very dangerous path\u201d in seeking to change the law. \u201cEveryone has huge sympathy for steel workers and for efforts to protect jobs, but rushed changes to pension rules risk driving a coach and horses through the pension security of hundreds of thousands of workers, well beyond the steel industry.\u201d Business secretary Sajid Javid is expected to update the House of Commons shortly... We should remember that Britain\u2019s service sector has been becoming increasingly dominant for decades, partly due to the sweeping changes during the Thatcher government: Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, fears that the UK economy has continued to slow in the current quarter. \u201cLooking ahead to Q2, the latest Services Index release showed services output falling in March providing a weak starting point for expansion. While early days, a run of weak activity surveys in April also casts a gloomy note, suggesting that the economy will see a further deceleration in growth. A cloudy international outlook and the prospect of rising inflation at home will present ongoing headwinds.\u201d John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, says the 0.5% fall in business investment last quarter is a clear sign that Brexit fears are hurting the Britain\u2019s economy. He warns: \u201cGlobal concerns have eased more recently, but uncertainty related to the EU referendum could lead to a further moderation in growth in the second quarter as some businesses continue to defer investment and hiring decisions. But the economy should rebound in the second half of the year in the event of a vote to Remain. City traders agree. Joshua Mahony of IG says: The downward revision of GDP to 2% suggests that perhaps the recovery we have been looking for after 18 months of slowing growth just isn\u2019t there. Perhaps the most telling figure today was the Q1 business investment reading, which contracted for the second consecutive quarter. This is a clear indication of the fear that firms are experiencing regarding the effects of a Brexit and makes you wonder what this number would look like in the event the UK left the EU. Tom Floyd of Foenix Partners concurs: The weaker annual growth rate (2%) is further confirmation of the Brexit related negativity already embedded in the wider economy and aside from recent retail sales, continues a poor run of UK economic indicators. Anyone remember George Osbornes\u2019 \u201cMarch of the Makers\u201d? It seems to have taken a wrong-turning. Ms Lee Hopley, Chief Economist at EEF, says Britain\u2019s economy is suffering from problems overseas, and the EU referendum: \u201cThe data confirms a softer start to the year as households continue in the driving seat with their foot on the gas Business investment, however, slipped further and net trade again failed to support GDP growth. It\u2019s far from a surprising picture given the wobbly world economy at the start of the year is providing little impetus to export growth or, confidence amongst business to press ahead with big expansion plans. \u201cWhile the referendum is just another dampening factor in the mix, on the other side of it we\u2019ll need to see a more supportive external environment and a lot more certainty about the domestic industrial policy agenda to see a return of better balanced growth this year.\u201d Today\u2019s growth figures also confirm that Britain\u2019s service sector is outperforming everything else. Services output jumped by 0.6% during the last quarter, but construction shrank by 1.0% and manufacturing declined by 0.4%. The pound has fallen by half a cent against the US dollar, following the news that business investment fell by 0.5% in the last quarter. Breaking: UK growth slowed to 0.4% in the first quarter of 2016, down from 0.6%, the Office for National Statistics reports. That\u2019s in line with the first estimate, released last month. But the annual growth rate has been revised down to 2%, from 2.1% initially. And business investment has fallen, for the first time in three years. Business investment fell by 0.5% during the quarter, driven by \u201cfalls in non-residential building\u201d, the ONS says. That may show that companies are more cautious about economic prospects and have been cutting back. That could be due to the recent turmoil in the financial markets, or the EU referendum. However, gross fixed capital formation growth (another measure of corporate investment) did rise by 0.5% in January-March after shrinking in the previous three months. The figures also show another deterioration in Britain\u2019s trade with the rest of the world. Exports declined in the last quarter, while imports rose. The trade balance deficit widened from \u00a316.4bn in Quarter 4 2015 to \u00a318.0 billion in Quarter 1 2016 . Following a 0.1% increase in Quarter 4 2015, exports decreased by 0.3% in the latest quarter, while imports increased by 0.8% in Quarter 1 2016 following a 0.9% increase in Quarter 4 2015. Nearly time for those UK growth figures.... Tomas Casasi-Klett, Professor at the University of St Gallen, says the world leaders gatherer in Tokyo have a lot to worry about. He argues that Shinzo Abe was right to warn of a potential Lehman Brothers moment today: The G7 will be about keeping all black swans at bay, starting with the Brexit one, we are at a point where the world is evermore fearful of a black swan, a Minsky moment*. A number of events could mirror the Lehmann trigger we saw in 2008, these include a Trump victory in November or unexpected economic volatility in China\u2019s markets. However, a Brexit is now the most immediate and plausible candidate for such a trigger - it would activate other triggers across the globe, a chain-reaction of sorts originating with British voters. [* - That\u2019s Hyman Minsky, the economist who showed that financial crises are caused after over-confident investors drive asset prices too high, using cheap credit to fuel speculative trading] Britain\u2019s EU referendum is just four weeks away, and City traders are getting nervous. The cost of hedging against wild swings in the value of the pound over the next month has jumped this morning. It hit its highest level since March 2009, in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Those contracts now cover the referendum day, and the day after, when the pound is likely to be volatile \u2013\u2013 whichever side wins. Shares in miners and oil producers are rallying this morning, following the jump in the oil price. The sight of Brent crude nudging over $50 per barrel is boosting confidence in the City, while a weakening US dollar is pushing up other commodity prices too. Mike van Dulken, Head of Research at Accendo Markets, explains: Energy and Mining stocks are topping the FTSE this morning with gains of 2-3% after Brent Crude broke back above the symbolic $50/barrel 6-month highs overnight and an easing in US Dollar strength benefits the greenback-denominated raw materials space as a whole. But he also points out that a high oil price could encourage firms to boost oil production: Sceptics will point to the breakout by oil \u2013 inspired by a drop in US oil stockpiles on top of falling US output and global supply problems \u2013 as likely attracting shale/frackers back to idle rigs. Japan\u2019s PM, Shinzo Abe, has apparently warned G7 world leaders that we could suffer a crisis on the scale of Lehman Brothers in 2008. That\u2019s according to the Nikkei news agency The world economy is high on the agenda for the G7 meeting, with Abe pushing fellow leaders for \u2018flexible fiscal spending\u2019 (ie, higher government investment) and structural reforms. My colleague Claire Phipps is live-blogging the whole G7, here: Leaders have taken time out to plant a few trees. Maybe they wanted to show the \u2018green shoots of recovery\u2019, but frankly it looks more like a productivity problem -- nine world leaders to plant three trees?! Here\u2019s an example of the supply disruptions that has pushed the oil price up, from Reuters: A Nigerian youth group leader confirmed on Thursday that militants had attacked a Chevron oil facility in the Niger Delta. \u201cThe attack truly happened,\u201d Eric Omare, spokesman for the Ijaw Youth Council, said. A group called Niger Delta Avengers had claimed the attack late on Wednesday. Oil prices have hit their highest level of the year, after figures showed that the long-running glut in crude prices could finally be eroding. Brent crude, sourced from the North Sea, has jumped over the $50 per barrel mark. This is the highest level since last November, and could herald higher energy costs and petrol prices. The move comes after data, released yesterday, which showed that US crude inventories fell last week. It appears that the industry\u2019s supply problems, particularly wildfires in Canada and outages in Nigeria, are now hitting home. And analysts are predicting that this means oil reserves will start to be eroded, if demand remains above supply. Citi explains: \u201cUS oil inventories have largely topped out and should decline through the summer.\u201d And if they\u2019re right, it will have implications for global inflation rates, and possibly nudge central bankers closer to raising borrowing costs (as cheap energy has been keeping the cost of living down). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We get a proper insight into the state of Britain\u2019s economy this morning, when the second estimate of GDP for the first quarter of 2016 is released, at 9.30am. The figures should confirm that growth slowed to just 0.4% in January-March, meaning Britain lagged behind the eurozone. But we\u2019ll also get much more detail, on how trade, investment and consumption changed during the quarter. Economists will be looking for signs that the slowdown in overseas markets, such as China, hurt the UK. We could also see some early impact from June\u2019s EU referendum. The figures are likely to show that, once again, Britain relied on domestic spending rather than exports to keep the economy moving. RBC Capital Markets explain: Private consumption growth is once again expected to make the main contribution to total growth with net trade likely being a drag. Expectations for business investment will also be muted given that the approaching EU referendum became a more high profile source of uncertainty during the period. Also coming up.... World leaders are gathered in Tokyo for the G7 meeting, so we\u2019ll see what Angela Merkel, David Cameron and the gang say about the global economy: And investors will also be watching Greece, following the agreement hammered out with euro ministers. Yesterday, the IMF cautioned that it still isn\u2019t yet ready to join the bailout; meaning more uncertainty for Athens over the next few months.",

It said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We still expect the remaining three quarters of 2016 to make up for the first quarter slowdown. Despite the seasonal adjustment process, first quarter GDP data are often unreliable and overly gloomy due to seasonal factors such as winter weather. Our view is also supported by consistently strong job creation figures and a rebound in consumer confidence. Consumer sentiment saw an uptick in May due to a strong labour market showing and expectations that both inflation and interest rates would remain low. </p> <p>However, the chances that interest rates will remain lower for longer are slimmer now than they were earlier this month...The minutes from the [latest Federal Open Markets Committee] meeting, and statements made by Federal Reserve officials since, indicate that some FOMC members believe that the US labour market is at full employment and that this may start putting upward pressure on inflation. </p> <p>Another, less official, consideration may be the US presidential election taking place in November. In the past the Fed has been reluctant to indirectly weigh into political debates and raising interest rates too close to the election would be interpreted as a signal regarding the institution\u2019s opinion of economic prospects. Therefore, while the FOMC\u2019s interest rate decision in June will be data-dependant, it may also be impacted by the realisation that if interest rates do not rise in June or July, they are very likely to remain at 0.5% until at least December. </p> <p>Cebr believes that raising rates in June or July is premature and unnecessary. The inflationary environment remains benign and the US economy still faces numerous risks on the global front. Lacklustre growth in export markets is already creating problems for the country\u2019s exporters. Further strengthening the US dollar via monetary policy tightening would make US-made products relatively more expensive and therefore less desirable for foreign buyers. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57484008e4b006af16bc10ed\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-27T12:48:04.142Z\">1.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The question is how this affects the odds on a Fed rate hike this summer?

Such costs epitomize the trade-off between the growth and equity effects of some aspects of the neoliberal agenda.\u00ad<br></strong></li> <li><strong>Increased inequality in turn hurts the level and sustainability of growth. Even if growth is the sole or main purpose of the neoliberal agenda, advocates of that agenda still need to pay attention to the distributional effects.\u00ad</strong></li> </ul> <p>This won\u2019t surprise those who have lived through the eurozone debt crisis, or previous economic perils.

                "bodyText":"So there you have it and the traders from New York can now go off to the Hamptons. While not specifically mentioning a June rise, she did say it would probably be appropriate for the Federal Reserve to gradually raise rates in the coming months. But she urged caution and warned of hiking rates too steeply. As a consequence the dollar has moved higher. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. And now the key question. She is told that a New York money brokers are delaying their weekend trip to the Hamptons to see if she says anything market moving. So here is her chance to move markets (laughter) so can she say anything about the path of monetary policy? Yellen: The economy is continuing to improve, we saw weak growth in first quarter of year. It looks to be picking up from data we monitor... We will monitor incoming data and risks. It\u2019s appropriate for the Fed to gradually and cautiously increase our overnight interest rate over time. In coming months such a move would be appropriate. On negative interest rates, we considered it briefly. There could be a number of negative repercussions so we didn\u2019t pursue it and it\u2019s not something we are thinking about now. But other countries are using it. So we have to be cautious. If we were to raise interest rates too quickly and we trigger a downturn we have limited scope to respond. We should be cautious about raising rates too steeply. On the economy, she says it has been a slow recovery but we have made a great deal of progress. We have created 14m new jobs since lowest point for employment. We\u2019ve made a lot of progress. That said, further gains are possible, we\u2019ve not seen much improvement in wage growth. But the growth of output has been remarkably slow. We have a lot of jobs being created in the face of not much output, so that means productivity growth is quite slow. With respect to inflation, it has been running below the Fed\u2019s 2% objective for a number of years. There are a number of reasons, the plunge in oil price, a marked depreciation of the dollar pushing down import prices. These seem to have stablised, and if we continue to see stability, inflationwill move over next couple of years to near target. Yellen says they are trying to be better at spotting financial instabilities, and they have a better process for doing that. Yellen is praising her predecessor Ben Bernanke for being brave during the financial crisis, but she admits they did not see the crisis coming. Bloomberg has a better feed here. Janet Yellen is now on stage at the Radcliffe Institute where the chair of the Federal Reserve is being given the Radcliffe Medal, \u201cpresented annually to an individual who has had a transformative impact on society.\u201d Of course the big interest is what - if anything -she might say about a June rate hike, given the suggestions from a number of Fed members in recent days that such a move may be on the cards. At the moment she is being asked about her background and general comments about economics. A link to the discussion (albeit a bit sporadic) is here. The Russian president Vladimir Putin was quick to stamp the tone on his two-day visit as he begun talks with the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras, reports Helena Smith: \u201cIn Moscow and St Petersburg we have discussed our prospects of economic collaboration in detail. Of course there are many problems and times are difficult but for sure there are good prospects,\u201d said Putin. \u201cWe have to transform the good relations of [our] two peoples into tangible economic results.\u201d Greece and Russia, fellow Orthodox states, with a common heritage that goes back to Byzantium have hailed 2016 to be a \u201cyear of Greek-Russian friendship.\u201d Putin, who is travelling with nine ministers, is expected to sign an array of agreements with Athens\u2019 leftist-led government. Energy and tourism are expected to be high on the agenda. Tourist-dependent Greece is hungry for Russian holiday makers and industry figures have complained bitterly about the slow pace with which visas have been made available to them by the Greek state machinery - not least diplomatic services in Russia itself. Athens\u2019 governing left wing Syriza party has spoken stridently about the need to create a \u201cmulti-faceted\u201d foreign policy - one which will see the country furthering relations with China, Russia, Iran and Latin America. \u201cWe are trying to open up what used to be a very narrow western looking diplomatic attidude,\u201d the country\u2019s culture minister Aristides Baltas, a leading Syriza ideologue, told me. \u201cWe want to remain in Europe but not in the sense of being the obedient servants of the west,\u201d he said, adding that Greece, as an EU member state, had been obliged to follow the embargo against Russia even if didn\u2019t agree with it. Back in Greece and words of welcome for president Putin from the country\u2019s prime minister: As for Putin himself: There\u2019s no disguising the fact it was a pretty quiet day all round on European stock markets as the week drifted to a close. With investors unwilling to commit themselves ahead of comments from US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen later - albeit there is little expectation of any real hints on interest rates - there was little to disturb the horses. Even the upward revision to US first quarter GDP passed without much impact. So the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up just 5.14 points or 0.08% at 6270.79 Germany\u2019s Dax was virtually unchanged, edging up 0.13% to 10,286.31 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.05% ahead at 4514.74 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB dipped 0.17% to 18,186.14 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.31% at 9107.3 In Greece, the Athens market fell 1.33% to 636.83 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 34 points or 0.19%. In the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority said it was investigating the \u00a31.4bn takeover of Argos owner Home Retail by supermarket group Sainsbury. It said it would be looking at whether the deal would hurt competition in the UK, and it would announce its decision by 25 July. Back with the US GDP figures, and we could be looking at a weak figure for the second quarter according to Markit: And here\u2019s Russian president Putin arriving in Greece: American consumers are more confident in May than they were in April, but the latest survey has still come in lower than analysts had been forecasting. The University of Michigan\u2019s final index of consumer sentiment for May was up from 89 in April to 94.7. But this was lower that the preliminary estimate of 95.8 and below the consensus of 95.4. Meanwhile in Greece: (See our preview earlier) Investors are keeping their powder dry ahead of the remarks later from US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, with the latest GDP revisions doing little to lift the mood. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 28 points or 0.16% while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.12% and Nasdaq just 0.09%. And here\u2019s how the US slowdown looks: A US interest rate rise in the next two months is unnecessary, given the uncertainty over the country\u2019s economy evidenced by the revised first quarter GDP figures, suggest the CEBR. It said: We still expect the remaining three quarters of 2016 to make up for the first quarter slowdown. Despite the seasonal adjustment process, first quarter GDP data are often unreliable and overly gloomy due to seasonal factors such as winter weather. Our view is also supported by consistently strong job creation figures and a rebound in consumer confidence. Consumer sentiment saw an uptick in May due to a strong labour market showing and expectations that both inflation and interest rates would remain low. However, the chances that interest rates will remain lower for longer are slimmer now than they were earlier this month...The minutes from the [latest Federal Open Markets Committee] meeting, and statements made by Federal Reserve officials since, indicate that some FOMC members believe that the US labour market is at full employment and that this may start putting upward pressure on inflation. Another, less official, consideration may be the US presidential election taking place in November. In the past the Fed has been reluctant to indirectly weigh into political debates and raising interest rates too close to the election would be interpreted as a signal regarding the institution\u2019s opinion of economic prospects. Therefore, while the FOMC\u2019s interest rate decision in June will be data-dependant, it may also be impacted by the realisation that if interest rates do not rise in June or July, they are very likely to remain at 0.5% until at least December. Cebr believes that raising rates in June or July is premature and unnecessary. The inflationary environment remains benign and the US economy still faces numerous risks on the global front. Lacklustre growth in export markets is already creating problems for the country\u2019s exporters. Further strengthening the US dollar via monetary policy tightening would make US-made products relatively more expensive and therefore less desirable for foreign buyers. David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco said: The question is how this affects the odds on a Fed rate hike this summer? As far as the markets are concerned, not very much so far although it certainly keeps the prospect alive. However, it\u2019s unlikely investors will want to take on additional exposure ahead of Janet Yellen\u2019s public appearance this evening and the long holiday weekend. Whether the Fed Chair says anything related to monetary policy is another matter altogether. What should prove far more significant is next week\u2019s raft of manufacturing PMIs along with the latest US Non-Farm Payroll release. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: Yesterday\u2019s durable goods orders and home sales data would have put a smile on the face of Fed Chair Janet Yellen, but today\u2019s underwhelming first quarter GDP report is unlikely to be as well-received. It\u2019s not the most positive start to the financial year for the US and observers will now be keen to see if momentum can pick up in the next quarter. There\u2019s plenty of talk about an interest rate rise, but Yellen and Co. are likely to wait for the data to support it before pushing the button. Despite the revision, the figures show a slowdown in GDP compared to the fourth quarter which saw a 1.4% increase. The overall figure was lifted by spending on home building and an increase in inventory investment by businesses. The US economy grew more than originally thought in the first quarter, but less than some economists had been expecting. As various members of the Federal Reserve suggested that a rate hike in June was not off the table, official figures showed an annualised 0.8% rise in GDP in the three months to March. This was higher than the first estimate of 0.5% but below estimates of a rise of 0.9%. This really has been dullest morning in the City for a while. Our old friend, the FTSE 100, is refusing to show any enthusiasm and is currently down a meagre 4 points. Investors are hoping that the US growth figures, in around 40 minutes, might cause a stir. Remember, economists expect the annualised growth rate in the last quarter to be revised up to 0.9%, from 0.4% before. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx (who gets a bonus mark for keeping awake, frankly), says: Friday continued at an alarmingly dull pace this morning, though there is the chance for a bit of excitement from the US open later this afternoon. The FTSE plodded along flat on the day, with the DAX and CAC effectively following the UK index\u2019s lead. Both regions had nothing in the way of data to offer this Friday, and with Brent Crude threatening to fall below $49 per barrel were lacking the recent commodity-buzz that has helped push the indices to 3 week highs. Greece is prepares to welcome Russian president Vladimir Putin, amid tight security and fears that the visit will cause ructions within the EU. Putin\u2019s visit is billed as a way of deepening economic and diplomatic ties between the two countries. He\u2019ll be discussing trade, energy and transport issues, and meeting with President Prokopis Pavlopoulos and Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras. Putin has already signalled that Moscow wants closer links with Athens, as the Greek newspaper Kathimerini explains: Moscow is primarily interested in buying state-run railway operator Trainose and a stake in Thessaloniki port, the country\u2019s second largest, as Putin reiterated in a commentary for Kathimerini published on Thursday ahead of the visit. He also said that Russia \u2013 Greece\u2019s main gas supplier \u2013 is still very much interested in reviving the South Stream gas pipeline project. \u201cThe issue of our energy resources being carried through southern corridors to the countries of the European Union is still on the agenda,\u201d Putin said But the sight of Russia\u2019s president landing in Athens at a time when the EU is imposing sanctions is causing some concern. Daragh McDowell, a principal analyst for Europe and Central Asia at Verisk Maplecroft, told CNBC that Putin hopes to take advantage of anger within Greece about its years of austerity. \u201cThe extreme political and economic disruption Greece has experienced, in combination with existing cultural ties, make it a particularly attractive target for these kind of initiatives. \u201cFundamentally these overtures are about sowing division and discord among the EU states in order to undermine the sanctions regime and, over the longer term, the EU as a whole.\u201d Resolution\u2019s Duncan Weldon has now blogged about the IMF paper on the problems with neoliberal economics. He explains that it\u2019s part of a wider change of thinking at the Fund, away from the \u201cWashington consensus\u201d that dominated thinking before the wheels came off the global economy in 2008. But the IMF is also pointing out the flaws in the policies implemented over the last eight years. Duncan argues that the criticism against austerity is understandable : Excessive fiscal tightening in countries that still have fiscal space simply hasn\u2019t worked as promised. There are plenty of countries with ample fiscal space that haven\u2019t used it and the world economy has suffered as a result. And the Fund\u2019s comments on capital controls reflect its concerns that ultra-loose monetary policy in the US and Europe has a severe impact on emerging markets. If The Fed won\u2019t care about spillover effects, developing countries must take more precautions. In this respect the Fund; move towards backing capital controls is a consequences of the failure of Western fiscal policy makers to do enough to support growth and the unwillingness of Western monetary policy makers to take into account the global consequences of their actions. Jonathan Ostry, the IMF economist who co-wrote its critique of neoliberalism, is hoping to trigger a new debate about economic orthodoxy. The Financial Times has the details: In an interview, Jonathan Ostry, deputy director of the IMF\u2019s research department and the article\u2019s lead author, said the new piece was not meant as an attack on \u201cthe entire neoliberal agenda or the Washington consensus\u201d. But he hoped it would set the stage for a broader examination of \u201cneoliberalism\u201d that would come out this year. It also fitted, he argued, with work on everything from austerity and inequality to debt and the desirability of open capital accounts that he and others have been publishing since the 2008 financial crisis \u2014 and with a growing sentiment in the broader economics community. \u201cThere are a lot of people thinking the same thing at this point, that basically some aspects of the neoliberal agenda probably need a rethink,\u201d he said. \u201cThe crisis said: \u2018The way we\u2019ve been thinking can\u2019t be right\u2019.\u201d Financial Times: IMF economists put \u2018neoliberalism\u2019 under the spotlight Neoliberal economics has attracted plenty of critics over the years, as the impact of privatisations, shrinking the state and austerity measures has become clear. And now, a team at the International Monetary Fund have delivered a remarkable attack on the consequences of neoliberalism. In a new paper they argue that the benefits of neoliberal policies has been over-blown, and its damage has been underplayed by policymakers. They put their finger on two key issues \u2013 the impact of capital flows into emerging markets, and the austerity measures and fiscal tightening forced on governments. They conclude that neoliberalism simply hasn\u2019t worked as well as supporters claim, and has created inequality that actually hurt growth. Here\u2019s their key conclusions: The benefits in terms of increased growth seem fairly difficult to establish when looking at a broad group of countries. The costs in terms of increased inequality are prominent. Such costs epitomize the trade-off between the growth and equity effects of some aspects of the neoliberal agenda. Increased inequality in turn hurts the level and sustainability of growth. Even if growth is the sole or main purpose of the neoliberal agenda, advocates of that agenda still need to pay attention to the distributional effects. This won\u2019t surprise those who have lived through the eurozone debt crisis, or previous economic perils. But it does highlight that some global policymakers are trying to learn from the mistakes of the past. The paper suggests that capital controls, once seen as a thoroughly bad thing, might actually have helped avoid causing economic problems. The IMF team even takes aim at the notion that running a budget surplus is a bright idea, asking: Is there really a defensible case for countries like Germany, the United Kingdom, or the United States to pay down the public debt? And they argue it\u2019s probably not, because: Austerity policies not only generate substantial welfare costs due to supply-side channels, they also hurt demand\u2014and thus worsen employment and unemployment. The piece does state that neoliberalism has had its benefits; global trade has lifted millions out of abject poverty, for example, while some privatisations have delivered better services. But even so, \u201cthere are aspects of the neoliberal agenda that have not delivered as expected\u2019. Here\u2019s the full piece: Neoliberalism: Oversold? Activist Naomi Klein points out that the damage has already been done: While economist Duncan Weldon of the Resolution Foundation argues that the IMF really is changing: Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets wonder if Yellen might play it cool at Harvard: In focus today will likely be Fed Chair Yellen\u2019s speech after the European close, especially after her colleagues (mostly non-voters) were out in force this week swaying expectations about a Summer rate hike. Note, however, Yellen is only receiving an award from Harvard so may well swerve explicit mention of US monetary policy to avoid adding fuel to the fire. Janet Yellen\u2019s comments may not come until around 5.30pm BST, or later. She\u2019s due to speak at a lunch at Harvard, along with her predecessor Ben Bernanke. More details here. Janet Yellen could move the markets today, when she visits Harvard to collect the Radcliffe Medal in recognition of her work. FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga says investors will be watching the Fed chair closely, for any hints that a rate hike could be close. Sentiment towards the US economy has improved this month with an impressive array of domestic data bolstering speculation that US rates could be increased in June or July. With retail sales, inflation and new homes sales exceeding forecasts, the prerequisites for another US rate hike in Q2 could be fulfilled if US GDP and next week\u2019s NFP exceed expectations. Yellen\u2019s comments could act as a catalyst today for Dollar bulls to rampage if she chants the same hawkish tune as the other board governors. Although the CME group Fedwatch tool displays a 26% probability that a June hike could occur, concerns over slowing global growth and persistent China woes may also disrupt the Fed\u2019s efforts to take action. Europe\u2019s stock markets are open, but frankly there\u2019s little happening out there. The main indices are all broadly unchanged, as investors wait for the US growth figures at 1.30pm BST. Some traders may also be pondering the long weekend (there\u2019s a bank holiday on Monday), or wondering how England will fare against Sri Lanka in the Test Match (probably rather well). Mining shares are leading the risers in London, where the FTSE has managed to rise by 3 whole points. Tony Cross of TrustNet Direct explains: Commodity stocks are still finding favour, helped in no small part by US dollar weakness amidst the idea that the Fed may not be in a position to hike rates next month as had been earlier thought. A glimmer of good news from across the Channel. French consumer confidence has hit its highest level since October 2007, when the world economy was reeling from the credit crunch. The country\u2019s main consumer confidence gauge has jumped to 98 in May, which beats economists\u2019 expectations of 95. That\u2019s tantalising close to the long-term consumer confidence average of 100. I do wonder, though, whether the clashes on the streets this week will hurt confidence. Tens of thousands of people have been protesting against legislation to make it easier to both hire and fire workers, prompting clashes with riot police yesterday. My colleague Angelique Chrisafis explains: Striking French workers continued to disrupt oil refineries and nuclear power stations, halted some air traffic and trains and prevented almost all national newspapers from printing in the growing industrial action. Union activists blocked roads and bridges in northern France while some train drivers and air traffic controllers joined the action. World leaders at the G7 meeting in Tokyo have declared that global growth is their \u201curgent priority\u201d, but not actually announced any new measures to deal with it. The official declaration following the meeting declares: Global growth remains moderate and below potential, while risks of weak growth persist..... They then warn that growth is \u201cmoderate and uneven\u201d, while global trade is disappointing. David Cameron, the UK PM, has also managed to get a reference to next month\u2019s EU referendum into the communique. Leaders have agreed that Brexit would harm international trade, and is a \u201cfurther serious risk\u201d to growth. Japan\u2019s stock market has gained ground today, following reports that prime minister Shinzo Abe is considering postponing one of his flagship policies. Abe dropped a broad hint earlier today that the planned hike in sales tax could be delayed. This tax was a crucial part of Abe\u2019s attempts to improve Japan\u2019s financial situation, but with the economy weak and inflation low, a rethink could be on the cards. Abe told a press conference at the G7 meeting that: \u201cWe must reignite powerfully the engine of Abenomics. That undoubtedly would include a decision on what to do with the sales tax hike.\u201d A postponement probably would help consumer confidence and economic growth. However, it would undermine Abe\u2019s commitment to improving Japan\u2019s troubling fiscal position (a national debt of more than 200% of GDP). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s Friday, and it\u2019s a bit quiet. But there are still a few events coming up that might get the blood pumping. Investors are mainly waiting for the second estimate of America\u2019s growth in the first three months of the year, at 1.30pm BST. The first estimate was pretty dire, showing that growth slowed to an annual rate of just 0.4%. But with more data now available, economists believe we could get an upgrade to perhaps 0.9%. That\u2019s still only a quarterly rate of around 0.2%, but it would calm fears that the US economy was faltering. All US data is currently seen through the lens of monetary policy, and whether it\u2019s strong enough to prompt an interest rate rise soon. America\u2019s top central banker, Janet Yellen, might have something to say about that when she visits Harvard (where she taught in the early 1970s). RBS Capital Markets explains: Yellen speaks at Harvard\u2019s Radcliffe Day, where she will engage in \u201ca conversation about her groundbreaking achievements.\u201d The widespread expectation is, of course, that she will reiterate the more hawkish line taken by almost all recent Fed speakers. That event begins at 3.30pm BST, or 10.30am local time. Otherwise, the economics calendar is as bare as Old Mother Hubbard\u2019s cupboard before payday. But we\u2019ll also keep one eye on Japan, where the G7 leaders meeting is wrapping up. Our G7 liveblog is here: The other eye will be on Greece, where Russian president Vladimir Putin is paying a visit to Athens (having been blackballed from the G7) . This trip will is likely to reignite concerns in Brussels that Moscow could be using austerity-gripped Greece as a lever to divide Europe. Officially, the visit will deliver a \u201cnumber of bilateral agreements\u201d and will focus on trade, investment and joint energy and transport projects. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day (and hoping the newsflow picks up a bit)",

                "bodyText":"Monday is Memorial Day, the official start of summer and another celebration traditionally marked by sales and a shopping bonanza. But the sun isn\u2019t shining for US retailers. On the face of it, the economic superpower that is the American consumer should be having a party. Low interest rates and unemployment rates, low oil prices, a high stock market, healthy property prices \u2013 nothing it would seem, to put off doing what comes most naturally to them \u2013 shopping. Yet they\u2019re stubbornly refusing to do it \u2013 or at least refusing to do it in predictable ways \u2013 leaving consumer experts to wonder, as fashion bible Women\u2019s Wear Daily recently did, if the consumer psyche, \u201cbombarded by digital messages, stressed financially and overwrought emotionally\u201d, has \u201cfinally exploded\u201d. Certainly, there\u2019s conflicted evidence to suggest it has. Retail stocks for Macy\u2019s, Nordstrom and Gap have all fallen sharply this year, with some reporting their worst comparable sales results since the Great Recession. Last week jeweler Tiffany\u2019s reported its sharpest drop in quarterly sales since the global financial crisis pushed the world to the brink in 2008. It\u2019s an international trend. In the UK, analysts are reporting 10% declines in the number of shopper visits to high streets and shopping centres around the country over the past year. In part, the shopping slump can still be blamed on the financial crisis. Consumers\u2019 incomes have not kept pace with household spending, and they are less confident about long-term economic stability. According to a recent Pew Charitable Trust survey, American household incomes fell between 2010 and 2013. Adults in the survey questioned \u201cwhether the American Dream is within reach, and many doubt that their children will fare any better than they have\u201d. Earnings for those at the top of the economic food chain have soared. Analysis by the AFL-CIO union found that chief executive officers of the top 500 companies took home on $12.4m on average \u2013 or 355 times what an average worker makes. Yet statistics show the same psychological hurdles to spending exist across income strata. At the high end of the US property market in New York and Miami a glut of residential developments and weak demand is triggering warnings that current pricing is unsustainable and future developments or commercial-to-residential conversions are being abandoned. In the art market, record sales are being achieved but against a backdrop of reduced demand and lower volume of sales than even a year ago. Executives spoke of \u201ctrepidation\u201d and going into sales holding the hands of prospective buyers. \u201cNo one wants to be the last person at the party,\u201d said Christie\u2019s Brett Gorvy. Beneath the economics, something else has changed. A contract has been broken. Researchers say neither consumers nor brands are getting much of what they want: consumers don\u2019t want to put their money with brands that don\u2019t speak to their values, while brands aren\u2019t seeing any loyalty from consumers they are trying to cultivate.

They are price-makers as well as price-takers, so you have to take it with a pinch of salt when they talk about pressures driving down prices.\u201d</p> <p>The biggest influence on air fares is the cost of fuel, which has more than halved in the past two years. Because big airlines buy their fuel up to two years in advance, they have only recently felt the benefit of the falling oil price and have plenty of scope to cut fares.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e39beb94e711b659e9fb4d02d30ab189c2e2db53\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e39beb94e711b659e9fb4d02d30ab189c2e2db53/0_170_3744_2245/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carolyn McCall, chief executive of easyJet.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carolyn McCall, chief executive of easyJet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Micha Theiner/City AM/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That is handy for them because smaller airlines, which can\u2019t buy fuel as far in advance, have cut prices and laid on extra flights to sell more seats. EasyJet and Ryanair both plan to increase capacity, and the result is that European short-haul capacity is up about 8% this year.</p> <p>\u201cEasyJet and Ryanair, as big operators in the market, are trying to squeeze out smaller operators so they offer discounts and attractive fares and hope that the competition fails,\u201d Byde says.</p> <p>The received wisdom in the industry is that travelling is now so much a part of everyday life that demand will always bounce back after shocks. McCall reiterated that comforting message when the airline announced its results. \u201cDemand always comes back,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen that with both the tragic events that have happened [last] year and we\u2019ve seen that in the past. If you are a consumer, it\u2019s a very, very good time to fly.\u201d</p>",

David Hope, GfK\u2019s business group director, says: \u201cPrices are going up and up and up.\u201d But he says this is only healthy for tour operators if they can provide enough rooms to meet demand. \u201cIt\u2019s looking quite healthy at the moment but the concern is that if the likes of Spain and Portugal become booked up, will they have stock left that people want to buy?\u201d he says. \u201cWhat is left will be lower-grade property they can get in Spain or hotels in Turkey \u2013 and do people want to go there?\u201d Thomas Cook\u2019s rival, Tui, which owns Thomson, has fared better because it is bigger in Spain and relies less on Turkey. It has also gone upmarket by operating its own boutique-style hotels \u2013 a model Thomas Cook is trying to copy. Wyn Ellis, an analyst at the City broker Numis, says: \u201cThat seems to be a more resilient part of the market, partly because it tends to book earlier. At the commodity end of the market, people will book a lot later because they think they can get bargains.\u201d The industry turmoil has also hit the budget airlines. Dame Carolyn McCall, easyJet\u2019s chief executive, said she was forced to slash prices following the Paris attacks in November. Both Ryanair and easyJet have reported demand returning to normal but prices are likely to stay low. Ryanair predicted its fares would be down 7% over the next 10 months. Robin Byde, an analyst at broker Cantor Fitzgerald, says: \u201cThe thing to remember with easyJet and Ryanair is that between them they have more than 20% of European short-haul traffic. They are price-makers as well as price-takers, so you have to take it with a pinch of salt when they talk about pressures driving down prices.\u201d The biggest influence on air fares is the cost of fuel, which has more than halved in the past two years. Because big airlines buy their fuel up to two years in advance, they have only recently felt the benefit of the falling oil price and have plenty of scope to cut fares. That is handy for them because smaller airlines, which can\u2019t buy fuel as far in advance, have cut prices and laid on extra flights to sell more seats. EasyJet and Ryanair both plan to increase capacity, and the result is that European short-haul capacity is up about 8% this year. \u201cEasyJet and Ryanair, as big operators in the market, are trying to squeeze out smaller operators so they offer discounts and attractive fares and hope that the competition fails,\u201d Byde says. The received wisdom in the industry is that travelling is now so much a part of everyday life that demand will always bounce back after shocks. McCall reiterated that comforting message when the airline announced its results. \u201cDemand always comes back,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen that with both the tragic events that have happened [last] year and we\u2019ve seen that in the past. If you are a consumer, it\u2019s a very, very good time to fly.\u201d",

The BAT holding is not the only controversial investment; its biggest holding was \u00a3344m in Royal Dutch Shell.</p> <p>But the tobacco investment will come as a shock to many researchers, academics and staff. One scientist, who is employed by a leading university but whose post is funded by CRUK, was horrified to learn that her money was being invested in this way.</p> <p>\u201cThis means that, even if only indirectly through our time and labour, CRUK money is being invested in growing and supporting the tobacco industry,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cThe idea that we all have our pension invested in BAT is outrageous. </p> <p>\u201cAll the work of this institute is done under the guidance of CRUK, and we are, quite rightly, regularly reviewed to ensure that CRUK money is being spent effectively and efficiently in the global fight against cancer. How can this possibly be in line with the fact that most of us will retire comfortably on money earned from tobacco investments?\u201d</p> <p>Universities UK, which represents vice-chancellors and principals, said USS was a responsible investor. \u201cUSS, as part of its investment duties, takes into account wider social, ethical, and environmental and governance issues, so long as that ensures that the assets of the scheme are invested in the best financial interests of members and their beneficiaries,\u201d said a spokesperson.</p> <p>\u201cUSS is also a responsible and engaged investor. They have, for example, undertaken engagement with tobacco companies on marketing approaches and regulations around e-cigarettes.\u201d</p> <p>But public health campaigners say it is not possible to reform the tobacco industry. In March, the European Public Health Association called on investors to dump their holdings. \u201cFor decades, it has actively sought to mislead the world about the harms caused by its products. It has corrupted public officials, been complicit in illicit activities such as smuggling, and has undermined legislation to protect the health of the public,\u201d said the association in a statement.</p> <p>It praised the campaigning organisation Tobacco Free Portfolios in Australia, which had successfully argued for pension funds to disinvest in tobacco. Prof Martin McKee, the president of the EUPHA, said it was calling on European institutional investors such as USS to follow suit. </p> <p>\u201cGiven the hard work of so many of its members to eliminate the scourge of tobacco-related death and misery, it is simply unacceptable that USS should continue to invest in this discredited industry,\u201d he said. </p> <p>CRUK, some of whose money indirectly ends up in BAT, said the university pension arrangements were not under its control. It is now supporting Tobacco Free Portfolios in the UK.</p> <p>George Butterworth, CRUK\u2019s tobacco policy manager, said: \u201cThe tobacco industry\u2019s deadly products are responsible for one in four cancer deaths. Many people would be shocked to learn that their pensions are invested in tobacco company shares \u2013 especially those striving to develop cures for diseases caused by this lethal industry. Cancer Research UK\u2019s own pension funds are tobacco-free, but many of our researchers are based at institutions where that is not the case.</p> <p>\u201cTo help make it easier for organisations\u2019 pension schemes to opt out of tobacco shares, we\u2019re now funding the UK arm of Tobacco Free Portfolios to encourage investment funds to divest from tobacco stocks. AXA\u2019s move earlier this week to withdraw billions in investment from the tobacco industry shows what can be done.\u201d</p> <p>USS said in a statement that it was \u201can active and responsible shareowner, an approach which USS\u2019s trustee believes will protect and enhance the long-term value of the fund. In order to ensure appropriate diversification we invest in a wide range of companies and assets.</p> <p> \u201cWe have a significant in-house responsible investment team and work with the companies in which we invest to improve ethical, environmental and governance standards, in the best financial interest of our members and beneficiaries. In recent times, this has included engaging with tobacco companies on marketing approaches and regulations around e-cigarettes. The trustee keeps its approach under review.\u201d</p>",

But the tobacco investment will come as a shock to many researchers, academics and staff. One scientist, who is employed by a leading university but whose post is funded by CRUK, was horrified to learn that her money was being invested in this way. \u201cThis means that, even if only indirectly through our time and labour, CRUK money is being invested in growing and supporting the tobacco industry,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cThe idea that we all have our pension invested in BAT is outrageous. \u201cAll the work of this institute is done under the guidance of CRUK, and we are, quite rightly, regularly reviewed to ensure that CRUK money is being spent effectively and efficiently in the global fight against cancer. How can this possibly be in line with the fact that most of us will retire comfortably on money earned from tobacco investments?\u201d Universities UK, which represents vice-chancellors and principals, said USS was a responsible investor. \u201cUSS, as part of its investment duties, takes into account wider social, ethical, and environmental and governance issues, so long as that ensures that the assets of the scheme are invested in the best financial interests of members and their beneficiaries,\u201d said a spokesperson. \u201cUSS is also a responsible and engaged investor. They have, for example, undertaken engagement with tobacco companies on marketing approaches and regulations around e-cigarettes.\u201d But public health campaigners say it is not possible to reform the tobacco industry. In March, the European Public Health Association called on investors to dump their holdings. \u201cFor decades, it has actively sought to mislead the world about the harms caused by its products. It has corrupted public officials, been complicit in illicit activities such as smuggling, and has undermined legislation to protect the health of the public,\u201d said the association in a statement. It praised the campaigning organisation Tobacco Free Portfolios in Australia, which had successfully argued for pension funds to disinvest in tobacco. Prof Martin McKee, the president of the EUPHA, said it was calling on European institutional investors such as USS to follow suit. \u201cGiven the hard work of so many of its members to eliminate the scourge of tobacco-related death and misery, it is simply unacceptable that USS should continue to invest in this discredited industry,\u201d he said. CRUK, some of whose money indirectly ends up in BAT, said the university pension arrangements were not under its control. It is now supporting Tobacco Free Portfolios in the UK. George Butterworth, CRUK\u2019s tobacco policy manager, said: \u201cThe tobacco industry\u2019s deadly products are responsible for one in four cancer deaths. Many people would be shocked to learn that their pensions are invested in tobacco company shares \u2013 especially those striving to develop cures for diseases caused by this lethal industry. Cancer Research UK\u2019s own pension funds are tobacco-free, but many of our researchers are based at institutions where that is not the case. \u201cTo help make it easier for organisations\u2019 pension schemes to opt out of tobacco shares, we\u2019re now funding the UK arm of Tobacco Free Portfolios to encourage investment funds to divest from tobacco stocks. AXA\u2019s move earlier this week to withdraw billions in investment from the tobacco industry shows what can be done.\u201d USS said in a statement that it was \u201can active and responsible shareowner, an approach which USS\u2019s trustee believes will protect and enhance the long-term value of the fund. In order to ensure appropriate diversification we invest in a wide range of companies and assets. \u201cWe have a significant in-house responsible investment team and work with the companies in which we invest to improve ethical, environmental and governance standards, in the best financial interest of our members and beneficiaries. In recent times, this has included engaging with tobacco companies on marketing approaches and regulations around e-cigarettes. The trustee keeps its approach under review.\u201d",

In our view, two catalysts are likely to lead to a material re-rating of Zoopla\u2019s shares in the coming months: the continued decline of challenger portal, \u2018On The Market\u2019 (Zoopla has now had 12 consecutive months of agency customer growth) and the Capital Markets Day on 15 September 2016, which will lift the curtain on the future strategy of Zoopla and its recent acquisitions of uSwitch and PSG. We continue to have very high conviction on Zoopla. In our view, the strategy is logical and commercial and it is working. Strong performance from uSwitch drives our upgrades today as we believe that Zoopla is entering a prolonged purple patch and we have yet to see the real benefits of PSG, which, in our view, will provide traditional agents significant firepower as the agency battlefield moves from the high street to the cloud.",

Mixed signals from the US economy also took the shine off shares. Markets had seemingly been taking the prospect of a US rate rise, perhaps as early as June, in their stride, supported by the idea that at least the US economy was showing signs of strength. But ahead of the non-farm payrolls figures due on Friday, weaker consumer confidence and manufacturing figures put a bit of a dent in that theory.</p> <p>There was also some caution ahead of some key events this week. As well as non-farms there is the latest meeting of the European Central Bank and a get-together of Opec ministers.</p> <p><em>So the FTSE 100, which had been heading for a fourth successive monthly rise, actually ended May slightly in the red. But European shares fared better, with the Stoxx 600 index rising 1.7% on the month, its best performance since October.</em></p> <p>With metal prices hit by the stronger dollar, copper declined more than 7% in May, the biggest monthly fall since November.

Most notably, with the FTSE attempting to break out of its 30 point range that has dominated the past week, this could set the groundwork for a very volatile week. Today has seen a substantial amount of data released, and with a whole week of economic data risk ahead, traders will be wary of increased unpredictability in the coming days.</p> </blockquote> <p>Then there is the US data:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At a time when markets have been seemingly focusing on the positives of a stronger economy rather than the looming possibility of a rate hike, today\u2019s data highlights the fact that while a hike is likely, consumers may not feel so optimistic.

                "bodyText":"The closing scores on European markets showed: The FTSE 100 fell 40 points or 0.64% to 6230.79 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.68% to 10,262.74 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.53% lower at 4505.62 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.45% to 18,025.25 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.91% at 9034.0 But in Greece, the Athens market added 0.93% to 646.97 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 88 points or 0.5%. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Inmarsat looks set to leave the FTSE 100 in the quarterly reshuffle announced on Wednesday. The changes are based on Tuesday\u2019s closing prices, and its near 4% fall making it the day\u2019s biggest faller in the index has confirmed the inevitable. The changes need to be ratified on Wednesday, but it\u2019s pretty safe to say Inmarsat will be replaced by Hikma Pharmaceuticals, as forecast. Companies set to be demoted from the FTSE 250 are: Jimmy Choo, Highbridge Multi-Strategy Fund, Interserve, Lookers, Melrose Industries, Northgate and Ophir Energy. They are likely to be replaced by: Ascential, CMC Markets, Countryside Properties, CYBG, Hill &amp; Smith, Metro Bank and Smurfit Kappa Group. European markets have ended the last day of the month on a downbeat note, with declines accelerating through the day after a Guardian/ICM poll showing the Brexit camp firmly in the lead ahead of June\u2019s EU referendum. The poll knocked sterling lower which in turn unsettled equity investors. Mixed signals from the US economy also took the shine off shares. Markets had seemingly been taking the prospect of a US rate rise, perhaps as early as June, in their stride, supported by the idea that at least the US economy was showing signs of strength. But ahead of the non-farm payrolls figures due on Friday, weaker consumer confidence and manufacturing figures put a bit of a dent in that theory. There was also some caution ahead of some key events this week. As well as non-farms there is the latest meeting of the European Central Bank and a get-together of Opec ministers. So the FTSE 100, which had been heading for a fourth successive monthly rise, actually ended May slightly in the red. But European shares fared better, with the Stoxx 600 index rising 1.7% on the month, its best performance since October. With metal prices hit by the stronger dollar, copper declined more than 7% in May, the biggest monthly fall since November. Gold has lost nearly 6%, again its worst peformance since November. Oil has recorded its fourth monthly rise in a row, helped by output disruptions from Nigeria, Libya and Canada. With markets slipping lower, Joshua Mahony at IG said: What looked like a boring day in the markets has been kicked into gear as the European indices fell sharply after a surprise EU referendum poll in favour of the \u2018leave\u2019 campaign. Most notably, with the FTSE attempting to break out of its 30 point range that has dominated the past week, this could set the groundwork for a very volatile week. Today has seen a substantial amount of data released, and with a whole week of economic data risk ahead, traders will be wary of increased unpredictability in the coming days. Then there is the US data: At a time when markets have been seemingly focusing on the positives of a stronger economy rather than the looming possibility of a rate hike, today\u2019s data highlights the fact that while a hike is likely, consumers may not feel so optimistic. Today\u2019s rise in the Fed preferred core PCE measure of inflation paves the way for a potential hike in the summer, yet with consumer confidence on the wane, it is clear the everyday person is not looking forward to the prospect of higher rates. Two Guardian/ICM polls showing voters moving in favour of the UK leaving the European Union have helped send sterling to a one week low against the dollar and euro. The pound fell nearly a cent to $1.4547 after news of the polls, while the euro rose 0.8% to 76.72p. As a consequence, stock markets are slipping back on concerns about the disruption which might be caused by a Brexit vote. The FTSE 100 is down 0.4% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is 0.3% lower. See the latest EU referendum developments in our live blog here: And another May miss. The Dallas Fed Texas manufactuing index has come in at -20.8, down from -13.9 in April and well below expectations of a figure of -8. And more on the Chicago PMI numbers: On the confidence figures, Lynn Franco at the Conference Board said: Consumer confidence declined slightly in May, primarily due to consumers rating current conditions less favorably than in April. Expectations declined further, as consumers remain cautious about the outlook for business and labor market conditions. Thus, they continue to expect little change in economic activity in the months ahead. So after a couple of pieces of US data which beat expectations, we have two in a row which have disappointed. The US consumer confidence index came in at 92.6 in May compared to forecasts of 96. This is down on the April figure of 94.7 (itself revised up from 94.2). This is the lowest level for the Chicago PMI since February and the sixth time it has been in contraction over the past 12 months. Index compilers MNI said: \u201cBarring a solid revival in June, the second quarter could be the weakest outturn since the fourth quarter of 2015 given the April-May average of just 49.9.\u201d MNI chief economist Philip Uglow said: While expectations are that growth in the US economy will bounce back in the second quarter, the evidence from the MNI Chicago Report shows activity weakening from an already low level. Firms ran down stocks at the fastest pace for more than 6 years in May, and while a rebuilding over the coming months could support output, the underlying message appears to be that businesses are not confident about the outlook for growth. After the earlier strong US economic data, the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index has come in weaker than expected in May. The index fell from 50.4 in April to 49.3, below estimates of a level of 50.7. Anything below 50 signals contraction. More for the Federal Reserve to think about. Back in the US, and markets have opened virtually unchanged after the day\u2019s economic data came in stronger than expected and renewed talk of a possible rate rise next month. On Friday Fed chair Janet Yellen said an increase would be appropriate in the coming months. Investors remain cautious however ahead of Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll numbers, the last before the Fed\u2019s June meeting. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down around 8 points or 0.04%, torn between the prospect of a rate rise and the data showing the economy is growing more strongly than expected. Here\u2019s our story confirming that 1,000 jobs are to go as 120 Austin Reed stores are shut: More fuel for the members of the Fed who want to raise rates before long: better than expected housing figures. US single family house prices rose 5.4% in March on a year on year basis, the same as the previous month and higher than forecasts of a 5.2% increase, according to the latest S&amp;P/Case Schiller index. David M. Blitzer at the Index Committee said: The economy is supporting the price increases with improving labor markets, falling unemployment rates and extremely low mortgage rates. Another factor behind rising home prices is the limited supply of homes on the market. Just in..... personal spending across America rose by a chunky 1.0% in April. That beats estimates of a 0.7% rise, and is the biggest jump since August 2009. It suggests US consumers were pretty upbeat about economic prospects last month. Reuters explains: The Commerce Department said on Tuesday consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, surged 1.0 percent last month as households bought automobiles and a range of other goods and services. The Commerce Department also reports that personal incomes in America rose by 0.4% in April. That\u2019s in line with expectations, and means that spending is outstripping income growth. It may fuel the debate about whether the Federal Reserve could, or should, raise interest rates.... Good news! Portugal is growing twice as fast as we thought. Bad news! Portugal only grew by 0.2% in the last quarter. That\u2019s according to the Lisbon stats office, which has revised up the initial growth estimates (from 0.1% to 0.2%) today (the FT has more details). It means the Portuguese economy has now grown for the last two years, but not fast enough to eliminate fears about the country, which was bailed out in 2011. Today\u2019s jobless report also showed that Portugal has the fourth-higher unemployment rate in the EU, at 12%. Investors should enough the quiet of May while they can, because June is going to be very dramatic. Britain\u2019s vote on EU membership will obviously be huge, while America\u2019s central bank\u2019s monetary policy meeting could also move global markets. Mihir Kapadia, CEO at Sun Global Investments, says: \u2018\u2019As the month of May comes to an end, June looks likely to be even more volatile \u2013 with a potential US interest rate hike, the EU referendum in the UK and the price of oil being key risk factors for a market that has been on edge for the entire year. May was a month where expectations of interest rate increases in the US were brought forward, with the Fed\u2019s Bullard the latest prominent voice to suggest that a hike is approaching fast. This week, the markets will be looking to the May non-farm payrolls data on Friday \u2013 a strong jobs number will be seen as providing the Fed with the data needed to push ahead with an interest rate hike in June.\u2019\u2019 Swiss bank UBS is also predicting plenty of action: A reminder that it\u2019s a big week for US economic data, especially for those wondering if the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month. It starts with US personal income figures for April, in an hour\u2019s time, followed by the consumer confidence report at 3pm BST. Developments in Athens.... The drop in European unemployment hasn\u2019t improved the mood in a rather damp City. All the main stock markets are now in the red, as May drags to an end. The news that the eurozone is still experiencing negative inflation may be weighing on spirits, as Conner Campbell of Spreadex explains: The Eurozone-wide inflation figure, meanwhile, came in at an expected -0.1%. That is an improvement on the -0.2% seen last month, but still means that the region has spent more of 2016 in deflation territory than it has not despite the influx of new stimulus measures back in March. None of this news provided much cheer for investors. Over in Greece, scuffles have broken out between protesting port workers and riot police. The dock workers are demonstrating in the Greek capital, against plans to privatise Piraeus, the largest port in Greece. They fear the sale, which is demanded by creditors, will cost jobs. The workers have already been on strike for six days, in the latest show of opposition against Greece\u2019s austerity programmes. The Kathimerini newspaper has more details: Fearing layoffs, port workers have been on 48-hour rolling strikes since last week and have said they will not return to work unless their requests are addressed. \u201cEverything, taxes, bills, the living cost, is going up. Daily food has become more expensive. And myself, I don\u2019t know if I have job tomorrow,\u201d said port worker Antonis Peristerakis, 49, father of two children. \u201cI need security. I want to have food for my children. I don\u2019t want to look for a job at the age of 49.\u201d Back in the UK, almost 1,000 jobs are being lost as part of a deal to \u2018rescue\u2019 high street tailor Austin Reed. That\u2019s according to the Daily Telegraph\u2019s Ben Marlow, who writes: The majority of Austin Reed\u2019s stores will close with the loss of nearly 1,000 jobs after administrators to the collapsed menswear chain were only able to find a buyer for its famous brand and stock. Sources familiar with the negotiations said Edinburgh Woollen Mill had refused to take the bulk of the shops as part of a deal, meaning administrators will now begin an orderly \u2018wind down\u2019 of the chain\u2019s estate in the coming days. The move comes a month after Austin Reed went into administration, handing control of the company to AlixPartners. AlixPartners had hoped to find a buyer for some, or all, of the business. Dragons\u2019 Den star Touker Suleyman, and Sports Direct chief Mike Ashley, had both emerged as possible options. Young people are still bearing the brunt of Europe\u2019s unemployment problem. The youth jobless rate in the EU has dropped to 18.8%, from 20.7% in April 2015. That still leaves 4.2 million under-25s out of work across the region. In the euro area, the youth unemployment rate is now 21.1%. And again, the situation is much worse in some countries than others. The lowest rates were observed in Germany (7.0%), Malta (8.9%) and the Czech Republic (9.5%), and the highest in Greece (51.4% in February 2016), Spain (45.0%), Croatia (38.9% in the first quarter 2016) and Italy (36.9%). Martin Janicko, economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, also believes Europe\u2019s labour market is improving... \u201cThe euro zone\u2019s unemployment rate was 10.2% in April, unchanged from the previous month but down from 11% a year earlier.\u201d \u201cDeclines in the jobless rate were recorded in most euro zone countries. Particularly encouraging are drops in joblessness in Greece, Ireland, and Spain. Periphery countries have had the largest drops over the past few months, reflecting their rebound, while the European core broadly held ground. Nevertheless, headline unemployment and youth unemployment rates are still elevated in the euro zone, with only Germany reporting a youth unemployment rate below 10%.\u201d \u201cThe downward trend in the jobless rate will likely persist in coming months, reflecting improving economic conditions around the monetary bloc, labour market reforms, and a strengthening industrial base in Spain, Portugal and Ireland. Businesses and consumers should benefit from easier access to credit following the easing of lending standards and a monetary stimulus from the European Central Bank.\u201d Here\u2019s some reaction to the news that the eurozone inflation rate remains negative this month, at -0.1%. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says inflation remains \u201cwithin the doldrums\u201d; even though the European Central Bank is running a huge bond-buying QE programme and record low interest rates. Despite the ECB embarking on a substantial round of easing, the fact that the Eurozone remains within deflation is a clear heads up that monetary policy alone cannot fix the problem of stagnant price growth. Holger Zschaepitz, journalist at Die Welt, points out that the ECB has massively expanded its balance sheet recently, in an attempt to drive up inflation. But Fred Ducrozet of private Swiss bank Pictet points out that core inflation (stripping out energy and food costs) has risen: Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight, reckons today\u2019s data shows the eurozone labour market is slowly improving. He points out that the jobless total did drop in April, although not by enough to pull the headline rate down from 10.2%. Eurozone unemployment fell by 63,000 in April to stand at 16.420 million, which is the lowest level since August 2011..... The decent underlying marked drop in Eurozone unemployment in April/March suggests that the pick-up in Eurozone GDP growth in the first quarter may be feeding through to lift employment. There are still stark differences in Europe\u2019s labour markets, which partly reflects the austerity measures imposed on its weaker members. Today\u2019s report shows that there are 21.2 million unemployed men and women across the 28 countries which make up the EU, including 16.4 million were in the euro area. The lowest unemployment rates were recorded in the Czech Republic (4.1%), Germany (4.2%) and Malta (4.3%). But there\u2019s no prizes for guessing the country with the highest unemployment rates --its Greece (24.2% in February 2016), followed by Spain (20.1%). Unemployment in the European Union has hit a new seven-year low of 8.7% in April. That\u2019s rather better than the eurozone average of 11.2%, but still means Europe is lagging behind America (where the jobless rate is 5%) The eurozone is still stuck in negative inflation! Prices across the single currency region fell by 0.1% in May, the flash estimate from Eurostat shows. Once again, cheap oil is mainly responsible. Energy prices fell by 8.1% year-on-year in May, while service prices rose by 1%. Food, alcohol &amp; tobacco gained 0.8%, while non- energy industrial goods cost 0.5% more. Here comes the splurge of Euorpean economic data, to take City traders\u2019 minds off the weather. And Europe\u2019s unemployment rate remains stuck at 10.2% in April, meaning no improvement on March\u2019s figures.... Told you it was looking a bit grim out there #splishsplashsplosh The British pound has weakened a little this morning, as investors continue to ponder next month\u2019s EU referendum. Sterling is down almost half a cent against the US dollar, at $1.4601. Despite that, the pound has still been one of the best-performing currencies in May; it strengthened after opinion polls suggested the public will vote to Remain in the EU. But there\u2019s still more than three weeks to go, so everything could change. City traders are taking steps to profit from the vote. As the FT explains this morning, some firms are commissioning their own exit polls on the day, so they can either buy or sell sterling. That\u2019s not illegal, as long as they don\u2019t publish the results.... Unfortunately, the Italian jobs malaise also continues... The Italian unemployment rate has jumped to 11.7% in April, up from 11.5% in March. Economists had expected 11.4%, so this weak reading suggests Mattei Renzi\u2019s government is struggling to breathe life into its labour market. But it\u2019s not all bad new; some 51,000 new positions were created in April, according to the statistics body ISTAT. So the rise in the jobless rate suggests previously inactive workers are now seeking a job. The German jobs miracle continues. Germany\u2019s jobless rate has fallen to a new record low of just 6.1% in May, down from 6.2%. That\u2019s the lowest since East and West Germany were reunified in 1990, as Europe\u2019s largest economy outperforms its weaker neighbours. Reuters has more details: \u201cThe labour market continues its overall positive development,\u201d Frank-Juergen Weise, head of the Federal LabourOffice said in a statement. \u201cUnemployment fell in the course of spring. Employment rose sharply and the demand for labour also increased significantly.\u201d The seasonally-adjusted jobless total fell by 11,000 to2.695 million, the Labour Office said. That compares with a consensus forecast in a Reuters poll for unemployment to fall by 5,000. Unless we get a big crash today, European stock markets will post their best month since last October. The STOXX 600, which tracks the 600 biggest European companies, has gained 2.5% during May as investors put recent market turmoil behind them. This flow of money into shares has come at the expense of other assets, such as precious metals. Gold has fallen by 6% this month, its worst month since November. European stock markets have started the week in an edgy mood. Most of the main indices have dropped, although the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 has scrambled a little higher. Traders are waiting for the eurozone data, in an hour\u2019s time. But they\u2019re also pondering the prospect of a US interest rate hike in June or July. Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct explains: London\u2019s blue chip index is starting the shortened trading week with some limited gains, helped along by the fact that markets appear increasingly confident that if the Federal Reserve do hike rates again next month, the US economy is now looking strong enough to cope with the fallout. China\u2019s stock market has enjoyed its best day since February. The CSI 300 index closed 3.4%, driven by predictions that the market could soon be included in the MSCI Emerging Markets index (a move which could encourage international investors to hold Chinese shares). But the session was also marked by a curious plunge in the main futures index, which tumbled 10% before immediately jumping back. No-one seems to know what caused the volatility, which is also making investors worried. Bloomberg explains that it could be caused by a single large bet that shares are going ot fall. \u201cLiquidity in the market is really thin at the moment,\u201d Fang Shisheng, Shanghai-based vice general manager at Orient Securities Futures Co., said by phone. \u201cSo the market will very likely see big swings if a big order comes in. The order looks like it\u2019s from a hedger.\u201d German consumers kept their hands in the pockets last month, fuelling concerns that Europe\u2019s largest economy may be in the doldrums. Retail sales fell by 0.9% month-on-month in April, dashing expectations of a 0.9% rise following the 1.4% decline in March. This data is quite volatile, but it does suggest that the German public are being cautious... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s a somewhat gloomy feel to the City of London, as traders trudge back to their desks after the bank holiday weekend. That\u2019s partly due to the blanket of cloud sitting over the capital, mocking anyone who\u2019s taken the half-term holiday off. But it also reflects persistent concerns over the global economy as we head towards the summer. Today we\u2019ll get a new healthcheck on the eurozone, with the latest inflation and unemployment data. It may not be too pretty. Economists predict that the consumer prices index inched up to minus 0.1% in May, despite the European Central Bank\u2019s attempts to push up prices. And the jobless rate, for April, may remain pegged at 10.2%; twice as high as in the UK or America. These figures will be scrutinised ahead of the ECB\u2019s next governing council meeting, on Thursday. Traders will also be watching the oil price, ahead of an OPEC meeting on Thursday. And then on Friday, we get the next US unemployment report. That will give fresh clues about whether American interest rates could be hiked over the summer. Here\u2019s the agenda: 8.55am BST: German unemployment report for May 9am: Italian unemployment report for April 10am: Eurozone unemployment report for April 10am: Eurozone flash inflation report for May 1.30pm: Canadian Q1 GDP 3pm: US consumer confidence for May And we\u2019re not expecting any early fireworks in the markets...",
