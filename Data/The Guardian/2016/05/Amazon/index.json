If we can take the latest GDP data at face value, then the first quarter of 2016 saw US activity slide to an almost standstill. Yet, the labour market continues to fare well and was the one bright spot amid a general soft patch last month</p> <p>Over time, activity and labour data are likely to converge, but right now there is little evidence to untangle how this will play out. Were the April jobs figures to come in on a softer note, then this would endorse the weakness in activity and imply that lagging variables such as employment are also now turning lower. Conversely, if the labour data stays resilient then we will further linger in a state of limbo as either it is the activity data that is the aberration or the lags have yet to kick in. The April jobs report may in fact accentuate the stagflationary trends (soft activity, rising inflation) noted of late:</p> <p><strong>Payrolls to come in a tad softer than expectations</strong> (ING: +190,000; consensus: +200,000). While some indicators continue to signal a robust hiring backdrop, the softer ADP print suggests that there are some (albeit marginal) downside risks to jobs growth in April. </p> <p><strong>Upward bias in the unemployment rate still in place</strong> (ING: 5.0%; consensus: 4.9%). The discrepancy between payrolls and the household survey (from which the unemployment rate rate is derived) is still evident, while the very strong labour force growth is unlikely to endure. A slight correction in both components may put some upward pressure on the unemployment rate.</p> <p><strong>Robust underlying wage pressures should result in decent headline wage growth </strong>(ING: 2.4% year on year; consensus 2.4%). We note that the headline AHE measure has been hovering at the lower end of a range of US wage indicators, with the Atlanta Fed\u2019s wage growth tracker continuing to tick higher (on a moving average basis). Thus, we think the odds of a positive wage growth surprise are slightly higher this month.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-05-05T15:07:26.095Z\">at 4.07pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-572b53e7e4b0d509448a6423\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-05T14:13:07.499Z\">3.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US crude stocks rise by more than forecast</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US crude stocks increased by a higher than expected 2.8m barrels last week, according to the Energy Information Administration.</p> <p>Analysts had forecast a rise of 1.7m barrels.

                "bodyText":"Some reasonable results from the likes of BT helped stock markets recover some poise after the volatile start to trading in May. There were more signs of weakness in the global economy, including disappointing UK services data and US jobs figures. But oil moved higher as supply concerns outweighed news of higher than expected US crude inventories, giving some support to commodity stocks. But there was little to really enthuse investors ahead of Friday\u2019s US non-farm payroll numbers, and the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up just 5.23 points or 0.09% at 6117.25 Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.24% to 9851.86 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.11% at 4319.46 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.07% to 17,923.90 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.41% at 8689.4 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.94% to 601.48 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 41 points or 0.24%. On that note, we\u2019ll close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow for non-farm payroll day. More on Greece, where strikes are set for the weekend and a parliamentary vote on reforms is due on Sunday: Global economic pressures which have dissuaded the US Federal Reserve from raising interest rates again could be waning, according to one of the central bank\u2019s policymakers. St Louis Fed president James Bullard said in a speech in California: International influences on the U.S. economy have been widely discussed in global financial markets during the last several years. Those factors appear to be waning during the first half of 2016. Financial stress has fallen according to recent readings. The effects of a stronger dollar appear to be waning. But he said there was evidence for both the Fed\u2019s view of a gradual pace of rate increases and the market\u2019s belief in only a few increases: Evidence from labor markets, inflation readings and global influences suggests the [Federal Reserve\u2019s] median projection may be more nearly correct. Evidence from readings on GDP growth and market-based inflation expectations suggests the market view of the path of the policy rate may be more nearly correct. Which does not appear to shut the door to a June hike, following December\u2019s increase. Markets are struggling to make any headway ahead of Friday\u2019s US non-farm payroll numbers. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, says: While markets have stabilised after days of losses, there seems little that can revive bullish sentiment as the day heads to its close. Despite an early attempt at a rally, indices remain under pressure, and it looks as if sellers will continue to dominate as the week enters its final session. ...Stocks remain under pressure, and with non-farm payrolls tomorrow the outlook remains resolutely grim. Further US dollar strength provides the reason for why there is little hope for indices at the present time. After weeks of weakness the impetus to buy the dollar appears too strong to hold back, which would provide a cogent reason for why indices have little ability to move higher. Ahead of non-farm payrolls, the market waits to see if the figure can best the number produced by ADP figures on Wednesday. Meanwhile Greece\u2019s unions have called a general strike for Friday and Saturday to protest against the tax and pension reforms due to be debated in parliament over the weekend, Reuters is reporting. Over in Greece, there has been talk of a possible weekend parliamentary vote on pension reforms, ahead of the Eurogroup meeting on Monday. The Syriza government is reportedly meeting on Friday: A solid US non-farms report on Friday could spark a near term revival in the US dollar, says Rob Carnell at ING Bank: April jobs report might uphold the stagflationary trend in US data. If we can take the latest GDP data at face value, then the first quarter of 2016 saw US activity slide to an almost standstill. Yet, the labour market continues to fare well and was the one bright spot amid a general soft patch last month Over time, activity and labour data are likely to converge, but right now there is little evidence to untangle how this will play out. Were the April jobs figures to come in on a softer note, then this would endorse the weakness in activity and imply that lagging variables such as employment are also now turning lower. Conversely, if the labour data stays resilient then we will further linger in a state of limbo as either it is the activity data that is the aberration or the lags have yet to kick in. The April jobs report may in fact accentuate the stagflationary trends (soft activity, rising inflation) noted of late: Payrolls to come in a tad softer than expectations (ING: +190,000; consensus: +200,000). While some indicators continue to signal a robust hiring backdrop, the softer ADP print suggests that there are some (albeit marginal) downside risks to jobs growth in April. Upward bias in the unemployment rate still in place (ING: 5.0%; consensus: 4.9%). The discrepancy between payrolls and the household survey (from which the unemployment rate rate is derived) is still evident, while the very strong labour force growth is unlikely to endure. A slight correction in both components may put some upward pressure on the unemployment rate. Robust underlying wage pressures should result in decent headline wage growth (ING: 2.4% year on year; consensus 2.4%). We note that the headline AHE measure has been hovering at the lower end of a range of US wage indicators, with the Atlanta Fed\u2019s wage growth tracker continuing to tick higher (on a moving average basis). Thus, we think the odds of a positive wage growth surprise are slightly higher this month. US crude stocks increased by a higher than expected 2.8m barrels last week, according to the Energy Information Administration. Analysts had forecast a rise of 1.7m barrels. Meanwhile gasoline stocks rose unexpectedly by 536,000 compared to expectations of a 144,000 barrel decline. But stockpiles of distillate, which includes diesel and heating oil, fell by 1.3m barrels, more than the 83,000 decline expected. Brent is currently up 3% at $46 a barrel despite the higher than expected inventory figures. The price is being supported by the wildfire threatening Canada\u2019s oil sands region, as well as growing tensions in Libya. In the latest pay revolt nearly 24% of shareholders at Reckitt Benckiser voted against the remuneration policy and nearly 18% voted against the remuneration report. At Ladbrokes 42% voted against the remuneration report. The latest data on US jobs will not give much grounds for optimism for Friday\u2019s non-farm numbers, says David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco. He said: [Weekly jobless claims] have generally been a bright spot over the past few years. They used to come in around the high 300,000s \u2013 even topping 400,000 at the end of 2012. But now we are used to seeing claims coming in below 300,000 on a regular basis. But now traders will focus on the main event which is tomorrow\u2019s Non-Farm Payroll release. Early expectations were for an increase of just over 200,000. But the \u201cwhisper number\u201d will probably be well below that following yesterday\u2019s grim ADP number. Today\u2019s jobless claims together with a worse than expected Challenger Job-cut number haven\u2019t helped either. More US employment data ahead of Friday\u2019s non-farm numbers. After a jump in the number of US workers laid off last month it is probably no surprise that jobless claims rose last week. According to the Labor department the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose 17,000 to 274,000, the largest increase since February of last year. Analysts had expected a figure of around 260,000. Donald Trump also says he\u2019d scrap a swathe of federal regulations which are (he argues) holding back US firms. He told CNBC: \u201cWe\u2019re lowering taxes very substantially and we\u2019re going to be getting rid of a tremendous amount of regulations.\u201d With the Republican nomination in the bag, Donald Trump is now turning his attention to how he\u2019d run the American economy if he makes it to the White House. And he\u2019s just declared that he would probably replace Janet Yellen as chair of the Federal Reserve when her current term expires. Yellen\u2019s crime? Not being a Republican, apparently. Speaking to CNBC, Trump declared: I have nothing against Janet Yellen whatsoever. She\u2019s been doing her job, and I have absolutely nothing against her. I don\u2019t know her, but she\u2019s a very capable person and people that I know have a very high regard for her. But she\u2019s not a Republican\u2026 When her time is up, I would most likely replace her because of the fact that it would be appropriate. But in a typical piece of Trump logic, the billionaire businessman also backed Yellen\u2019s monetary policy stance: She\u2019s a low interest-rate person, she\u2019s always been a low interest-rate person \u2026and I must be honest, I\u2019m a low interest rate person. If we raise interest rates, and the dollar starts getting too strong, we\u2019re going to have some very major problems. Yellen\u2019s current four-year term expires in February 2018, but she could potentially serve a second term (as did her predecessor, Ben Bernanke). Bloomberg\u2019s Jon Ferro questions Trump\u2019s logic on this one: You can watch a clip of the interview here. We also have worrying news from America. The number of US workers laid off last month jumped, and hit the highest level for an April in seven years. It indicates American companies are feeling the pinch, after its economy slowed to virtual stagnation in the first quarter of 2016. Reuters has the details: Layoffs by U.S.-based companies accelerated in April, sending year-to-date job cuts to the highest level since 2009, a private study reported Thursday. Domestic companies announced plans to let go 65,141 workers last month, a 35 percent increase from March, according to the report by outplacement firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas . In the first four months of the year, employers said they would hand out 250,061 pink slips. That is the highest total for the January-to-April period since 2009. \u201cWe continue to see large scale layoffs in the energy sector, where low oil prices are driving down profits. However, we are also seeing heavy downsizing activity in other areas, such as computers and retail, where changing consumer trends are creating a lot of volatility,\u201d Challenger CEO John A. Challenger said in a statement. Meanwhile in London, the boss of consumer goods group Reckitt Benckiser has apologised over a humidifier steriliser scandal that has claimed around 100 lives. Julia Kollewe reports: Rakesh Kapoor, chief executive of Reckitt Benckiser told shareholders at an AGM in central London: \u201cI\u2019m personally very sorry and very much regret that our Oxy product caused harm to people in Korea.\u201d He said the company had \u201cmade a mistake\u201d and vowed to ensure that \u201csomething like this never happens again\u201d. He will meet representatives from one patient group, who were demonstrating outside the AGM, in his office on Friday. The humidifier steriliser is believed to have killed nearly 100 people and injured others. It was invented in Korea and only sold there. Reckitt acquired the firm that made the steriliser in 2001. Some of these products were also manufactured by rival companies. Kapoor\u2019s comments come three days after the head of Reckitt Benckiser Korea and Japan was struck while apologising for the scandal. James Sproule, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, fears the Britain\u2019s economy is suffering from more than the Brexit jitters. Sproule warns: \u201cThese figures will be put down to uncertainty over the EU referendum, but while this may explain part of the fall, we should also consider whether there are underlying factors feeding into a less rosy economic picture. \u201cThe question we must ask is whether growth is built on solid foundations. My concern is that the exceptional period we are living in of low rates and cheap money is not the basis of a sustainable economy. We do not know what the outcome of the referendum will be, or the exact effects on the economy in the short and longer term, but this uncertainty is not an excuse to take our eye off the ball on more fundamental issues of economic sustainability.\u201d And this chart, from the Indie\u2019s Ben Chu, underlines how worrying this week\u2019s data is: With Britain\u2019s economy seemingly slowing, there\u2019s even less chance of the Bank of England raising interest rates in the next few months. Some economists are even speculating that the BoE could cut rates this year. And Chris Williamson of data firm Markit has confirmed that the Bank has previously eased monetary policy when its PMI readings have been this week. This graph plots Markit\u2019s PMI (dark blue) against interest rate cuts (light blue) and bouts of quantitative easing (grey). Williamson says: The three Markit/CIPS PMI surveys collectively indicated the weakest rate of expansion since March 2013, with growth slowing across the board. The combined Output Index fell from 53.6 in March to 51.9 in April. The latest reading is consistent with a near-stalling of economic growth, down to just 0.1% in April. The deterioration in April pushes the surveys into territory which has in the past seen the Bank of England start to worry about the need to revive growth, either by cutting interest rates or non-standard measures such as quantitative easing. This chart shows why the weak service sector data probably show that UK growth has slowed sharply. It\u2019s from German bank Berenberg. Their economist Kallum Pickering, says there are \u201csubstantial downside risks\u201d to UK growth, but.. If, as we expect, the UK votes to remain in the EU, then the growth rate should recover to its trend rate of 0.5% qoq in the second half of the year. While there are some risks relating to the current account deficit and concerns that households are returning to pre-Lehman borrowing and saving habits, underlying fundamentals are sound. Anthony Cheung of City firm Amplify Trading agrees that the UK economic picture has deteriorated: Dean Turner, Economist at UBS Wealth Management, agrees that Britain\u2019s economy appears to have weakened in April. And that means growth in the current quarter will be lower than in January-March, when GDP expanded by only 0.4%. Turner says: Uncertainty over the EU Referendum is clearly taking its toll on activity and with this backdrop, we expect second quarter GDP growth to dip below the already disappointing first quarter print. With such subdued levels of growth, we expect the Bank of England will hold fire on interest rates in next week\u2019s MPC meeting, and for many months thereafter.\u201d Britain\u2019s services sector makes up around three-quarters of the economy, so this slowdown is pretty worrying. David Noble, CEO of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, says June\u2019s EU referendum is partly to blame. \u201cThe UK\u2019s services sector is stuck between a rock and a hard place. Mounting global economic uncertainty at the top of the supply chain and the reality of the new National Living Wage at the bottom mean that firms are feeling the pinch from both ends. As a result, the sector credited with being the main driver of the UK\u2019s economic fortunes appears to be slowing down. \u201cThe looming EU referendum has had a profound effect on the sector, keeping prices relatively stagnant and delaying new orders. At the other end of the supply chain, the National Living Wage has compounded cost increases, resulting in the overall rate of input price inflation hitting a 27-month high. Together, these factors have squeezed margins while fewer than half of businesses expect to grow over the next twelve months. Breaking: Britain\u2019s service sector\u2019s growth has slumped to its lowest level in three years. Markit, the data firm, says its service sector PMI has fallen to 52.3 in April, down from 53.7 in March. That\u2019s the weakest level since February 2013, and close to the 50-point mark that splits expansion from contraction. Firms reported that job creation slowed last month, while business optimism has fallen to a three year low too. This makes a hat-trick of bad UK economic news this week. Construction firms reported yesterday that growth has hit a three-year low, while the factory PMI showed that manufacturing is now contacting. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, fears that UK economic growth almost stalled last month: \u201cThe slowdown in the service sector follows similar weakness in manufacturing and construction to make a triple-whammy of disappointing news on the health of the economy at the start of the second quarter. \u201cThe PMI surveys are collectively indicating a near- stalling of economic growth, down from 0.4% in the first quarter to just 0.1% in April. \u201cSome of the slowdown may be attributable to the early timing of Easter, though April also saw an increase in the number of companies reporting that uncertainty about the EU referendum caused customers to hold back on purchases, exacerbating already-weak demand linked to global growth jitters and ongoing government spending cuts. More to follow.... Here we go..... Lets see if those forecasts of a small slowdown are accurate. As well as posting stronger profits, BT has announced a \u00a36bn investment in broadband and 4G coverage: You can now buy shares in Britain\u2019s luxury chocolate firm, Hotel Chocolat. The company floated on the stock market this morning, raising \u00a320m each for its two founders. The IPO will also yield \u00a312m to fund new store openings, as its expansion drive continues. Launching a new print newspaper, in this time of digital revolution, was always a risky move. So you can understand why Trinity Mirror is pulling its latest offering, The New Day, after seeing sales falling to 30,000. But the speed of the move is a shock \u2013 the paper only launched 9 weeks ago. The news broke last night (here\u2019s Mark Sweney\u2019s piece), and Trinity has confirmed it to shareholders this morning, saying: Although The New Day has received many supportive reviews and built a strong following on Facebook, the circulation for the title is below our expectations. As a result, we have decided to close the title on 6 May 2016. Whilst disappointing, the launch and subsequent closure have provided new insights into enhancing our newspapers and a number of these opportunities will be considered over time. But that\u2019s not the only bad news. Trinity has also revealed that revenues from print advertising has fall almost 20% - highlighting the tough conditions across media.... Europe\u2019s stock markets have made a nervous start to trading, after two days of losses. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is up 15 points, or 0.2%, while Germany\u2019s DAX is up 0.3% and the French CAC is flat. BT is leading the London risers, up 3%, after reporting a 5% jump in underlying earnings this morning. Supermarket group Morrisons has gained 1.7%; after a troubled time, it posted a 0.7% rise in underlying sales this morning. It also reported that Amazon is about to start supplying its customers with Morrisons\u2019 products, though a deal announced recently. Energy firm Centrica, though, has slumped by 7% after it announced plans to sell around \u00a3770m of new shares to cut its debt pile. Turkey\u2019s stock markets has plunged by 2% at the start of trading, as investors react to the country\u2019s latest political crisis. Investors are alarmed by reports that prime minister Ahmet Davuto\u011flo is poised to resign, following a power struggle with president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. The Turkish lira is also suffering, shedding 5% overnight. Davuto\u011flo and Erdo\u011fan held crunch talks last night, but failed to mend their disagreements over key areas such as economic policy. Local reports suggest that elections for a new party leader to replace Davuto\u011flo could soon be called, causing fresh instability at a time when Turkey is already grappling with high inflation and the refugee crisis. Anxiety over a possible global downturn has hit stock markets in Asia again. The Hong Kong, South Korea and Philippines markets all shed around 0.5%. This send stocks across the region down for the seventh day running, its longest losing streak of the year Sharon Zollner of ANZ Bank New Zealand Ltd explains that signs of economic slowdown is hurting confidence again: Markets seem to be at something of a crossroads at present, waiting for clearer signals on whether U.S. activity will bounce back in the second quarter,\u201d. \u201cIf the global economy were to tip into recession at some point, what ammo, precisely, do central banks have left that won\u2019t do more harm than good?\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. So far this week, the UK economic data has been quite disappointing. Construction firms are growing at the slowest rate in three years, and activity across Britain\u2019s manufacturers is actually shrinking again. And investors are worried that the service sector, which makes up around 80% of the economy, may also be weakening. At 9.30am, the latest Service Sector PMI hits the wires, and it may show that growth slowed in April. A bad reading will surely reinforce concerns that the UK economy is running out of steam, with the Brexit referendum of 23 June casting a darker shadow over the country. CMC Markets\u2019 Michael Hewson has the details: Both manufacturing and construction PMI\u2019s came in short of expectations with manufacturing slipping into contraction territory for the first time since early 2013. Given how important the services sector is to the UK economy we really need to see a decent number here or run the risk that we see a growth downgrade next week from the latest Bank of England inflation report. Expectations are for a slight decline to 53.6 from 53.7. After two days of heavy falls, European stock markets are expected to inch higher this morning. But there\u2019s still plenty of angst about global growth prospects, and recent fluctuations in the foreign exchange markets. And on the corporate front, we\u2019re getting results from telecoms firms BT, supermarket chain Morrisons, and newspaper group Trinity Mirror.",

It was eventually rescued by Hilco, the investment firm.</p> <p>Overall, sales of entertainment products in bricks-and-mortar shops fell by 2% during the 12 weeks to 10 April, according to Kantar Worldpanel.</p> <p>However, online retailers suffered a much larger decline, with sales down by 12%. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/amazon\">Amazon</a>, the country\u2019s biggest entertainment retailer, saw its sales fall by 0.6% year-on-year, reducing its market share from 22.6% to 22%.</p> <p>Analysts said that high street entertainment stores were being underpinned by music and video games. One-in-four customers still only buy CDs, while 77% of video games were bought at shops during the quarter.

                "bodyText":"HMV has reclaimed is position as the second biggest entertainment retailer in the UK as high street chains enjoy a revival against their online competitors. HMV recorded a 2% year-on-year rise in sales of music, DVDs and games over the last quarter, giving it a market share of 16.9%, ahead of Tesco\u2019s 16.1%. The figures represent HMV\u2019s best performance since it collapsed into administration more than three years ago. It was eventually rescued by Hilco, the investment firm. Overall, sales of entertainment products in bricks-and-mortar shops fell by 2% during the 12 weeks to 10 April, according to Kantar Worldpanel. However, online retailers suffered a much larger decline, with sales down by 12%. Amazon, the country\u2019s biggest entertainment retailer, saw its sales fall by 0.6% year-on-year, reducing its market share from 22.6% to 22%. Analysts said that high street entertainment stores were being underpinned by music and video games. One-in-four customers still only buy CDs, while 77% of video games were bought at shops during the quarter. Tesco and Game achieved their biggest share of video game sales for five years. This helped high street stores and supermarkets to claim 69.8% of spending on all physical entertainment products, up from 67.5% a year ago. Fiona Keenan, strategic insight director at Kantar, said: \u201cDespite recent high profile casualties for high street fashion retailers the performance of bricks and mortar entertainment stores has demonstrated the strong appeal this channel still holds for consumers. \u201cSome 14% of the population now has a music subscription service and paid-for Spotify subscriptions are growing at 25%.

Popular products include David Bowie\u2019s albums Blackstar and Best of Bowie following his death in January, as well as the compilation Now That\u2019s What I Call Music! 93 and Adele\u2019s 25. The best-selling DVD during the period was Spectre, the latest James Bond film, which has sold more than 1.7m copies since it went on sale in February.",
