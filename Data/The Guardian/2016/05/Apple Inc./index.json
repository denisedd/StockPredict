As is the weight of Apple this upwards shift more than compensated for the weak manufacturing figure and, alongside the oil-inspired gains for the likes of ExxonMobil and Chevron, ensured the Dow opened nearly 90 points higher after the bell.</p> <p>The FTSE couldn\u2019t get anywhere near that level of growth as the day went on.

A number of fund managers have been making positive noises on the iPhone maker:</p> <p>Thomas Fitzgerald at EdenTree Investment Management said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Apple\u2019s share price has fallen about 28% from 2015\u2019s February peak on uncertainty over the future growth of iPhones, which accounts for 66% of sales. Beyond these near-term concerns, the anticipated launch of iPhone 7 will create fresh opportunity to take further market share. There is also still a large upgrade opportunity within its existing installed base \u2013 with only 40% of iPhone users upgraded to the new generation 6 or 6S models. </p> <p>Continued strong cash generation and its balance sheet fortress will continue to support the Apple\u2019s design and development over the long term. As a result, we believe shares are attractively valued at current levels. The company is also making significant progress towards a higher recurring, subscription-led revenue model through the launch of Internet and entertainment services, such as cloud storage, Apple Music and Apple TV. This could drive greater earnings visibility and potentially stronger profitability in future years.</p> </blockquote> <p>And here\u2019s Geir Lode, Head of Hermes Global Equities and manager of the Hermes Global Equity Fund:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Apple share price has been undergoing some recent volatility, but we remain supporters of the stock. People tend to get hung up on things like new products and how many it is selling, and when it will disclose numbers, but we think you need to take a broader, longer-term view.</p> <p>There is work to be done in product transitioning in the US and Europe, but if you look at the quality of its product lines versus the competition and the company\u2019s enormous cash pile, we believe Apple remains in a very strong market position.</p> </blockquote> <p>But Josh Spencer, manager of the T. Rowe Price Global Technology Equity Fund, is less convinced about the company\u2019s growth prospects:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We own a very small position in Apple, as like many others, we find the company and its products appealing. However, we are seeing signs the smartphone industry is starting to mature and Apple is trying to reinvent itself and come up with other ideas to generate revenue.</p> <p>Its recent share price fall has certainly made Apple appear more attractive, but also important to keep in mind the size of the company. At a market cap of more than $500bn, it is quite difficult to continue to compound from here. We are currently seeing more compelling opportunities to generate returns in the tech sector in areas such as cloud computing.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5739cfcde4b05be498d5f914\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-16T13:49:45.631Z\">2.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Apple shares jump after Buffett takes stake</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Apple has now reclaimed the title of \u2018world\u2019s most valuable company\u2019 from Alphabet, Reuters says.</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5739ce2fe4b0ac0aa28f50ad\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-16T13:45:12.897Z\">2.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Ding ding....

                "bodyText":"News that Warren Buffett had bought a stake in Apple has helped lift US markets, but Europe has turned in a more mixed performance. The FTSE 100 has edged higher as commodity companies benefited from a bounce in metal prices including copper, which followed some weakness in the dollar. Markets were also supported by a rise in the oil price, after an interruption to supplies from Nigeria and a Goldman Sachs forecast that crude would reach $50 for the rest of the year. But with the German market closed, there was little to enthuse investors elsewhere on the continent. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 added 12.90 points or 0.21% to 6151.40 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.18% at 4312.28 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished up 0.04% at 17,737.02 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.45% lower at 8682.1 In Greece, the Athens market was down 0.35% at 620.5 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 153 points or 0.88% higher. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Brent crude continues to hover close to the $50 a barrel market, currently up 2.55% at $49.05 having earlier climbed as high as $49.47. It is at its highest levels for around six months. More on the Greek vote this weekend, courtesy Reuters: Greece\u2019s parliament will vote on a new package of tax hikes and reforms demanded by its international lenders on Sunday, two days before euro zone finance ministers assess whether Athens qualifies for much-needed bailout loans. The bill would increase value added tax by 1 percentage point to 24 percent, raise tax on fuel, tobacco and alcohol, liberalise the sale of banks\u2019 non-performing loans and detail the set-up a new privatisation fund, government officials said. It will also include details on a contingency mechanism to impose tighter austerity measures, which will be activated only if Greece misses its fiscal targets, the officials said on Monday. The vote is expected to test Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 left-led government, which has a thin majority of 153 lawmakers in the 300-seat parliament. Athens says that if activated, the contingency measures will not hurt the poor. Passing the reforms before the Eurogroup meeting on May 24, is a demand of international lenders to wrap up the review which will unlock the next tranche of funds that Athens will use to pay IMF loans, state arrears and ECB bonds maturing in July. Wall Street is moving higher, helped by the Apple news, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average currently 101 points or 0.58% higher. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: There was one very clear source of growth for the Dow Jones this afternoon, and it wasn\u2019t the latest US economic data. The Empire State manufacturing index, the only notable number on the day\u2019s agenda, vastly underperformed expectations, plunging from a 14 month high of 9.6 to a 3 month nadir of -9.0. Yet news that Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway took a $1 billion stake in Apple during its (miserable) first quarter helped lift the tech company by over 2.5%. As is the weight of Apple this upwards shift more than compensated for the weak manufacturing figure and, alongside the oil-inspired gains for the likes of ExxonMobil and Chevron, ensured the Dow opened nearly 90 points higher after the bell. The FTSE couldn\u2019t get anywhere near that level of growth as the day went on. Yet with Brent Crude crossing $49 per barrel for the first time since in 6 months, and its miners led on a merry-romp by the jubilant Lonmin, the FTSE finally managed to eke out a 5 point rise as the afternoon wore on. Over in Greece, reports of new votes in parliament ahead of the next Eurogroup meeting: Warren Buffett is not the only one keen on Apple. A number of fund managers have been making positive noises on the iPhone maker: Thomas Fitzgerald at EdenTree Investment Management said: Apple\u2019s share price has fallen about 28% from 2015\u2019s February peak on uncertainty over the future growth of iPhones, which accounts for 66% of sales. Beyond these near-term concerns, the anticipated launch of iPhone 7 will create fresh opportunity to take further market share. There is also still a large upgrade opportunity within its existing installed base \u2013 with only 40% of iPhone users upgraded to the new generation 6 or 6S models. Continued strong cash generation and its balance sheet fortress will continue to support the Apple\u2019s design and development over the long term. As a result, we believe shares are attractively valued at current levels. The company is also making significant progress towards a higher recurring, subscription-led revenue model through the launch of Internet and entertainment services, such as cloud storage, Apple Music and Apple TV. This could drive greater earnings visibility and potentially stronger profitability in future years. And here\u2019s Geir Lode, Head of Hermes Global Equities and manager of the Hermes Global Equity Fund: The Apple share price has been undergoing some recent volatility, but we remain supporters of the stock. People tend to get hung up on things like new products and how many it is selling, and when it will disclose numbers, but we think you need to take a broader, longer-term view. There is work to be done in product transitioning in the US and Europe, but if you look at the quality of its product lines versus the competition and the company\u2019s enormous cash pile, we believe Apple remains in a very strong market position. But Josh Spencer, manager of the T. Rowe Price Global Technology Equity Fund, is less convinced about the company\u2019s growth prospects: We own a very small position in Apple, as like many others, we find the company and its products appealing. However, we are seeing signs the smartphone industry is starting to mature and Apple is trying to reinvent itself and come up with other ideas to generate revenue. Its recent share price fall has certainly made Apple appear more attractive, but also important to keep in mind the size of the company. At a market cap of more than $500bn, it is quite difficult to continue to compound from here. We are currently seeing more compelling opportunities to generate returns in the tech sector in areas such as cloud computing. Apple has now reclaimed the title of \u2018world\u2019s most valuable company\u2019 from Alphabet, Reuters says. Ding ding.... Wall Street is open. Apple has jumped to the top of the Dow Jones risers, following the news that Berkshire Hathaway has taken a $1bn stake. Another day, another warning against Brexit from the Bank of England. Today\u2019s message comes from deputy governor Andrew Bailey, who has told City executives that Britain could lose its status as an international financial sector if the UK leaves the EU. That\u2019s because banks from outside Europe can currently base themselves in the capital, and then offer financial services more easily across the bloc. He was speaking at a Financial Regulation Summit organised by Reuters, so over to them for the details: \u201cWe need a banking system to support the domestic economy but I am afraid we don\u2019t have a God-given right to have anything in terms of international. That decision will be taken by many actors over time,\u201d Bailey said. The EU provides rules for banks, insurers and asset managers that provide a \u201cpassport\u201d for them to operate freely across the bloc\u2019s single market. This includes banks from outside Europe,such as the United States and Asia. \u201cWhat matters to them a lot is having the passport. If you are a non-EU firm operating in London, then having the passport is important,\u201d Bailey said. New economic data out of America has reinforced concerns that economic growth is stumbling. The Empire State manufacturing index, which tracks factory output in the New York region, has lurched to -9.02 this month. Many firms reported a drop in new orders, pulling the index down. Economists expected a reading of +6.5%. Warren Buffett is probably nursing a chunky loss on the Apple shares, given he bought them between 1 January and 31 March. The FT points out: Shares in the technology giant have fallen by more than 19 per cent since mid-April after it disclosed its first quarterly revenue fall in 13 years and its first decline in iPhone sales. Bruce Kasman, chief economist at JPMorgan Chase, predicts that the oil price will be quite subdued over the next year. Up they go.... Billionaire investor Warren Buffett hasn\u2019t lost faith in Apple, despite the recent drop in its share price. Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway group has just revealed it took a new stake in the tech firm in the first quarter of 2016, worth around $1bn. That\u2019s a welcome boost to Apple CEO Tim Cook, after his company lost its title of the world\u2019s most valuable company to Alphabet (parent company of Google) last week. One for technical chartists in the audience: (basically, the oil price has surged to a point where you\u2019d expect it to fall back. But if it doesn\u2019t, then it might \u2018break out\u2019 and continue to rise #chartism ) Here\u2019s more detail from the Goldman Sach\u2019s oil report that has sent crude prices soaring to a six-month high today. This chart suggests that the oil market has dramatically rebalanced in recent weeks, due to declining production and a surge in demand: Goldman reckons that demand has picked up in Asia: Stronger vehicle sales, activity and a bigger harvest are leading us to raise our Indian and Russia demand forecasts for the year. And while we are reducing our US and EU forecasts on the combination of weaker activity and higher prices than previously assumed, we are raising our China demand forecasts to reflect the expected support from the recent transient stimulus. The headline news is that Goldman now believes the oil market has lurched back into deficit this quarter, earlier than expected. However, the firm also believes we\u2019ll be facing a surplus again in 2017: And that\u2019s because oil nations will probably keep boosting production: Goldman says: Low-cost producers will continue to drive production growth in the New Oil Order \u2013 with growth driven by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iran, the UAE and Russia. Second, non-OPEC producers had mostly budgeted such price levels and there remains a pipeline of already sanctioned non-OPEC projects. In fact, we see risks to our production forecasts as skewed to the upside as we remain conservative on Saudi\u2019s ineluctable ramp up and Iran\u2019s recovery. Brexit could also send UK house prices tumbling, Fitch suggests today. Bad news for home owners, but possibly a boost to younger renters \u2013 if they aren\u2019t hit by other side-effects..... Fitch has also pointed out that some British firms might benefit if the UK quits the European Union, weakening the pound. The rating agency says: For the corporate sector, the leave scenarios could have mixed effects, depending on sector. UK exporters would benefit from improved price competitiveness, due to sterling\u2019s depreciation. However... UK companies with significant foreign currency debt would face servicing issues. UK airlines could be significantly affected by sterling depreciation due to their foreign currency cost base. So perhaps it\u2019s no surprise that budget airline Ryanair opposes Brexit. It just wheeled out a Boeing 737 with a Remain campaign slogan painted on the fuselage, for a press conference with chancellor George Osborne today. Rating agency Fitch has just warned that European economies could be disrupted if Britain votes to leave the EU. In a new report, Fitch warns that the populist parties across the region would get a boost if the UK public decide to quit. And that could drive up the borrowing costs of weaker members - possibly sparking a repeat of the 2012 eurozone debt crisis \u2013 if investors begin to fear that countries will quit the euro. They say: Brexit would create a precedent for countries leaving the EU. It could boost anti-EU or other populist political parties, and make EU leaders more reluctant to implement unpopular policies with long-term economic benefits. Negotiating the terms of the UK\u2019s exit could exhaust the EU\u2019s time and energy and open up new fronts of disagreement. Brexit could shift the centre of gravity of the EU, making it more dominated by the eurozone core, poorer, more protectionist and less economically liberal. If the UK were to thrive outside of the EU, it might encourage other countries to follow suit. Fitch points out that the banking sectors of Ireland, Malta, Luxembourg, Spain, France and Germany all have sizeable links to the UK. The EU could also be a poorer place without Britain: Brexit would reduce the UK\u2019s contribution to the EU budget (a net \u20ac7.1bn in 2014 after rebates), potentially to zero. This would imply that other net contributors would have to increase payments, or net recipients accept lower EU expenditure. Fitch: \u2018Brexit\u2019 Would Increase Downside Risks to EU Sovereigns Morgan Stanley agrees with Goldman Sachs: This chart explains very clearly why Goldman has reversed its position on the oil market. It shows the various incidents that have disrupted oil supply recently, and their likely impact on supply during the rest of 2016. Reuters is reporting that the Nigerian authorities have apprehended members of a group behind recent attacks on its oil pipelines: The Nigerian army has arrested several people suspected of having been involved in a recent wave of attacks on pipelines in the restive Delta region, a military source said on Monday. Nigerian newspapers reported that the army had arrested several members of a militant group called Niger Delta Avengers which has claimed a string of attacks in the southern swamps. Those attacks have knocked Nigeria\u2019s oil output down to its lowest level in decades; one reason that the oil market is now in deficit, according to Goldman. More UK business chiefs are cutting back on investment ahead of the EU referendum next month. That\u2019s according to a survey conducted by Credit Suisse that found little enthusiasm for Brexit: Although mining companies are rallying this morning, other sectors are in retreat. Big name companies like BT, Barclays, ITV and Unilever have all lost at least 1.3%. And traders are blaming persistent worries about the UK\u2019s EU referendum next month. Overnight, the CBI has cut its growth forecasts for the UK this year to 2%, down fdrom 2.3%, partly due to Brexit concerns. CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn warned that: \u201cA dark cloud of uncertainty is looming over global growth, particularly around weakening emerging markets and the outcome of the EU referendum, which is chilling some firms\u2019 plans to invest.\u201d Those disappointing Chinese retail sales, industrial production and investment figures released on Saturday aren\u2019t helping the mood either. Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct says: Losses are broad based with some mixed economic data out of China over the weekend and ongoing fears over the risk of the UK voting to leave the EU at the end of next month both weighing. Shares in BP and Royal Dutch Shell have risen by around 0.8% this morning, following the jump in the oil price. Goldman is also predicting that the oil market will remain in deficit until the end of the year. However, it would then return to oversupply in 2017: If they\u2019re right, that suggests prices may not rise too dramatically from current levels. Brent crude oil is bobbing around a six-month high, as traders digest Goldman\u2019s claim that the market is now in deficit: The oil price has jumped this morning after Goldman Sachs declared that the long run of oversupply was coming to an end. In a new report, the Wall Street firm argues that the oil market has actually flipped into deficit, due to various supply disruptions. That would end a two-year run of oversupply that pushed crude prices down to 13-year lows at the start of 2016. Goldman writes: \u201cThe oil market has gone from nearing storage saturation to being in deficit much earlier than we expected.... The market likely shifted into deficit in May ... driven by both sustained strong demand as well as sharply declining production.\u201d Goldman has also hikes its US crude price forecast to $50 a barrel for the second half of 2016, from a $45 estimate in March. That has send US crude jumping by 1.5% in early trading, to $46.92 per barrel. Brent crude (sourced from the North Sea) is also up 1.5% to $48.55 per barrel. The wildfires that struck Canada\u2019s Fort McMurray were the most newsworthy reason that production levels have fallen recently. Other factors include disruption in Nigeria, where pipelines have been sabotaged, and the swathe of US shale producers who have halted drilling since prices fell. Ands that means the market will stay in deficit through the second half of this year, according to Goldman anyway. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the global economy, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s a definite Monday morning feeling in the City today. Europe\u2019s main stock markets have opened in the red, following some disappointing Chinese economic data over the weekend. China\u2019s factory output missed forecasts in April, growing by 6% versus expectations of 6.5%. Investment and retail sales also grew more slowly than expected last month, which is giving investors another reason to worry about its economy. Commerzbank economist Zhou Hao summed up the mood: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing that growth engines are losing momentum, and the growth outlook has turned soft as well. It\u2019s clear the government wants to manage down or re-anchor market expectation.\u201d And that\u2019s pushed markets down in early trading: Britain\u2019s FTSE: 6108, down 29 points French CAC: 4289, down 30 points (Germany is closed for Whit Monday or Pentecost Monday). We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day. That will include any developments around Greece \u2013 with just seven days to go until finance ministers to (hopefully) conclude the Greek bailout review.",

                "bodyText":"Some of the biggest US companies have accumulated cash piles worth almost $1.7tn (\u00a31.1tn) \u2013 more than two thirds of it overseas. According to the calculations by ratings agency Moody\u2019s, the five companies hoarding the most cash \u2013 Apple, Microsoft, Google, Cisco and Oracle \u2013 between them held $504bn by the end of last year. The tech sector held 46% of the total. Apple \u2013 described as the \u201ccash king\u201d by the ratings agency \u2013 held $216bn of cash, more than double the $102bn held by the next largest hoarder, Microsoft. The figures will add to the controversy about companies sitting on cash as the data shows they are parking it offshore to avoid the tax bill that would be due on returning it to the US. An estimated $1.2tn of cash was held overseas at the end of 2015 \u2013 about 72% of the $1.68tn cash stockpile, Moody\u2019s said. Of the five big hoarders of cash, three \u2013 Apple, Microsoft and Cisco \u2013 keep more than 90% outside the US. \u201cThis amount reflects the negative tax consequences of permanently repatriating money to the US and the use of domestic cash for dividends, share buybacks and the majority of acquisitions,\u201d Moody\u2019s said. Earlier this year, anti-poverty charity Oxfam had estimated US companies had $1.4tn in subsidiaries based offshore, while the $1.68tn that Moody\u2019s estimates is being stashed by US companies is a sum equivalent to the size of the Canadian economy. \u201cBecause domestic cash is consumed by dividends and share buybacks and is used to pay for the majority of acquisitions, we expect that overseas cash balances will continue to grow unless tax laws are changed to encourage companies to repatriate money,\u201d Moody\u2019s said. \u201cThere has been little progress toward corporate tax reform that would incentivise US companies to permanently repatriate funds held overseas. At this stage in the political cycle and given strong differences on both sides of the aisle in Washington, we do not expect tax law reform that would prompt overseas cash repatriation,\u201d Moody\u2019s said. But with the US presidential election looming, Moody\u2019s said it did not expect any major tax reforms that would prompt companies to start sending money to the US. Companies can put their cash to use in a number of ways, with capital expenditure \u2013 spending on equipment \u2013 usually the largest use. Payouts to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends is another use, as is making acquisitions. The Moody\u2019s research also shows that US companies have been increasing their cash balances every year since 2007 when the ratings agency first began its research. Nearly $1tn has been added since 2007 when the total was $742bn. The cash is increasingly concentrated among the top 50 hoarders, who held 67% of 2015\u2019s total compared with 58% when the research began. But while cash piles are increasing, so is the amount of debt with borrowing outpacing cash levels for the first time since 2012. Apple has dominated the table since 2009. \u201cSince Apple became the cash king in 2009, its $176 bn increase represents 26% of the total $670bn increase in corporate cash over the same period,\u201d Moody\u2019s said. The biggest cash pile held by a non-tech company is the $39bn in the coffers of pharmaceutical company Pfizer. It was forced to abandon a tie-up with rival Allergan - in what was regarded as the biggest pharmaceutical deal in history - in April after the US government clamped down on so-called tax inversion deals. Such transactions are structured to allow corporations to relocate their headquarters to countries with a lower tax rate. The top 50 list includes a number of well-known names such as Ford, Visa, eBay, McDonald\u2019s and Asda-owner WalMart. Moody\u2019s, which analysed more than 1,000 companies, said that to gain a place in the top 50, companies needed $6.12bn of cash, up from $6.07bn last year and $2.9bn in 2007.",
