                "bodyText":"A combination of downbeat factors - the raft of disappointing data from around the world, the EU cutting its growth forecasts, falling commodity prices thanks to weak Chinese numbers, a cut in Australian interest rates to boost flagging growth and a volatile day for the dollar - all combined to revive worries about the state of the global economy and sent stock markets sharply lower. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 56.30 points or 0.9% to 6185.59 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.94% to 9926.77 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 1.59% at 4371.98 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 2.46% to 17,966.81 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 2.85% lower at 8764.9 In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.15% to 583.65 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 150 points or 0.8%. Elsewhere Brent crude is down 1.9% at $44.96 a barrel. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Commenting on the JP Morgan global survey, Capital Economics said: Manufacturing activity seems to have remained weak across the board at the start of the second quarter. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global manufacturing PMI, released today, slipped from 50.6 in March to 50.1 in April, extending a downward trend which began in 2013. On past form, it is now consistent with global growth of only around 2%. A number of factors have led to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market sell-off, including weak economic data and a volatile dollar. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: Woeful economic news and weak bank earnings put stock market bears in charge on Tuesday. Weak manufacturing data from China and the UK, downgraded forecasts for UK and Eurozone growth as well as the Reserve Bank of Australia cutting interest rates to ward off deflation all point to a weaker economic outlook. US stocks slumped on the open with the Dow Jones losing over 200 points after weak auto sales number added to a weak economic outlook in China, the UK and Europe. The day started with new multi-month lows for the dollar index and corresponding highs in the euro, British pound and the yen. But dollar losses were reversed after the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dennis Lockhart suggesting June was a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclive meeting\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 triggered short-covering at oversold levels. Global manufacturing growth slipped in April, according to the latest JPMorgan and Markit survey. The global manufacturing purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index came in at 50.1 in April, down from 50.6 in March and only just above the 50 level which separates growth from contraction. The reading is the second weakest in the past forty months. David Hensley, director of global economic coordination at J.P.Morgan, said: The latest PMI data indicate global manufacturing output is growing at an anemic pace, similar to the past year. What is notable is the sharp drop in the PMI finished goods inventory index. Once manufacturers have aligned inventories with sales, faster production gains should ensue. Markets continue to come under pressure. with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now down 178 points or just over 1%. Here are the biggest movers in the index: The latest New York manufacturing survey showed business activity growing at its fastest pace since December last year. But there was a drop in the six-month outlook in April to a seven year low. The Institute for Supply Management index rose from 50.4 in March to 57 but the six month outlook fell to 53.1. The ISM said the drop in outlook \u00e2\u20ac\u0153should raise a caution flag.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As expected, and in line with other global markets, Wall Street is on the slide. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 134 points or 0.75% in early trading, as fears about the global economy re-emerge. Poor manufacturing data from the US on Monday, and China and the UK today, have unsettled investors, along with the news that Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank cut interest rates to help support growth. The S&amp;P opened 0.4% lower while Nasdaq is down 0.7%. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 is currently 0.65% lower, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has dropped 1.68% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has fallen 1.2%. The US could raise interest rates twice this year, following December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increase, but there were a number of uncertainties including whether Britain votes to leave the European Union. That is the view of Atlanta Federal Reserve president Dennis Lockhart. Speaking to reporters in Florida he said two hikes were possible, but it depended on how the economy evolved. He said (quote from Reuters): It is the repercussions [of a Brexit vote] for the US economy that would concern me....it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really a question of indications in the financial markets of a reaction to rising uncertainty and the degree of volatility we are seeing again in financial markets. But he added that the markets should put more probability on June being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a real option\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for a rise. Indeed the dollar is currently weaker after Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing US manufacturing data suggested no imminent rate rise. Never let it be said that government ministers can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t learn from their mistakes. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business secretary, Sajid Javid, has postponed a trade delegation to Iran so he can focus on the UK steel crisis. The trip had been billed as Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest ever trade mission to Iran, giving UK companies a chance to cash in develop business opportunities following the lifting of sanctions. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been put on ice, until the future of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steel industry is resolved. A spokesman told Reuters: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Given the Business Secretary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focus on the steel industry,he has decided to postpone his trip to Iran. He remains committed to exploring the opportunities for trade and investment with this emerging market and an alternative date will be arranged in due course.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tata UK wants potential buyers to register their interest in its steel operations this week, so Javid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision may indicate that progress is being made. One company, Liberty House, has already thrown its hard hat into the ring: Alternatively, Javid may be desperate to avoid a repeat of his infamous Australia trip - which left him on the far side of the world when Tata announced it was selling up. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an old City motto, to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sell in May and go away\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The theory is to cash in your gains once the May Day morris dancers have done their thing. Then, sit tight until the horses competing at the St Leger Stakes in early September have been rubbed down and fed a few sugar lumps It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always pay off - although it worked rather well last year, when the FTSE 100 hit a record high in April, only to shed 12% by the end of August. So perhaps that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one reason that investors are reacting badly to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing economic data. The selloff in European markets has gathered pace, with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX now down around 1.7%. And the FTSE is still at a three-week low, currently down 75 points. Mining stocks are suffering from concerns over the global economy, with Anglo American shedding 10%. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says the decline in the US dollar is hitting European shares, as eurozone companies benefit from a weaker euro, not a stronger one. The foreign exchange markets are taking centre stage today, as incessant US dollar selling has brought about an 18-month low in the US dollar-Japanese yen rate, an eight month high in the euro-US dollar rate, and a four-month high for the pound against the US dollar. With IG clients currently seeing a 71% chance of the UK remaining in the EU, it is clear traders are heavily betting that the late February low of $1.3836 represents the bottom for GBP/USD. Banking shares are also suffering, after Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Commerzbank reported that its net profits had halved in the last quarter. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, has warned that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grim UK factory data could herald more bad new... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Manufacturing output in April recorded a shocking reading dropping to the lowest point since the throes of the euro-zone crisis in March 2013. The tailwinds afflicting the manufacturing sector \u00e2\u20ac\u201c concerns around the health of the global economy, uncertainty surrounding the result of June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum and evidence of a broad slowdown in activity in the UK \u00e2\u20ac\u201c means that the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmakers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 will struggle to avoid a repeat in Q2 of the decline in output seen in the first three months of the year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The detail of the survey offered further causes for pessimism. Both the consumer and investment goods sectors registered declines in output, while survey respondents highlighted a weakening in both domestic and overseas demand. In addition, export orders dropped for the fourth month in a row, while jobs in the sector fell at the fastest rates since February 2013.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on the downturn in UK manufacturing: America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is expected to fall when it opens in three hours time, following today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing news from China and the UK. The EC has also predicted another year of recession in Greece, with its GDP shrinking by 0.3%. We all want Greece to find growth again, and create jobs particularly for its young people, says commissioner Mosocovici. In contrast, Ireland is expected to post the strongest growth this year: European commissioner Pierre Moscovici has challenged Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s politicians to do more to stimulate growth: He says: Growth in Europe is holding up despite a more difficult global environment. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The recovery in the euro area remains uneven, both between Member States and between the weakest and the strongest in society. That is unacceptable and requires determined action from governments, both individually and collectively. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts assume that the British public vote to remain in the EU, the Commisison says: In another blow, the European Commission has just cut its forecast for UK growth this year. The EC now expects Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy to expand by just 1.8% this year, down from a previous forecast of 2.1%, inching up to 1.9% in 2017. It blames the uncertainty created by June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum -- echoing the slump in UK factory output. The commission says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside, reflecting less favourable external demand and uncertainty in the lead-up to the June referendum. Net exports are forecast to continue to detract from growth although less markedly in 2017.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But Britain isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t alone. The EC has also cut its forecast for eurozone growth, despite the bloc posting better-than-expected GDP figures last Friday. It now expects eurozone growth of 1.6% this year (down from 1.7%) and 1.8% in 2017 (down from 1.9%). And it has also admitted that its previous inflation forecasts were too optimistic - predicting that prices will only rise by 0.2% this year. Ms Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 organisation, agrees that the Brexit referendum is partly to blame for the slump in UK manufacturing: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The sharp drop to a three year low and another month of reported job cuts could be the clearest sign yet that referendum uncertainty is starting to weigh on the real economy. However, this is just another straw on the back of a sector already grappling with the struggling oil and gas sector, softening domestic demand and weak order outlook from other parts of the world, all of which are failing to provide any counterbalance to the political uncertainty at home. These chart shows how UK factories have weakened in the last few months: The shock slump in UK factory activity last month is a serious sign, warns David Noble of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply. Noble says an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153atmosphere of deep unease\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is building throughout the manufacturing supply chain, as new orders and exports come under pressure. He also cites the recent collapse of high street chain BHS as proof that economic conditions are worsening. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A sense of apprehension across the sector is being caused by enduring volatility in the oil and gas industry, falling retailer confidence and the uncertainty created by the EU referendum. In a month that saw the collapse of BHS, the troubles in the British High Street are being felt just as keenly in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories. Manufacturers are compensating for stalling new order growth by depleting their stocks, and dramatically cutting the amount of raw materials they buy from suppliers. Noble is also concerned that large factories cut jobs last month: The sector is nervously waiting to see whether this is a temporary blip or the beginning of a more pervasive slow down. UK factories slashed jobs last month at the fastest rate since February 2013, led by major manufacturers. Markit explains: The downturn at manufacturers was reflected in the labour market at the start of the second quarter. Job cuts were reported for the fourth successive month, with the rate of decline the fastest since February 2013. Losses were mainly centred on large-sized companies, as SMEs recorded (on average) a further increase in workforce numbers. Breaking! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector has suffered its worst performance in three years. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK manufacturing PMI, which measures activity across the sector, has slumped to 49.2 in April, down from 50.7 in March It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the first time since March 2013 that the PMI has fallen below the 50-point mark, which separates expansion from contraction. British companies are suffering a double-whammy, with domestic demand softening and new orders from overseas falling too. Markit reports that new export orders fell for the fourth straight month in April, as global economic growth continued to slow. Rob Dobson, economist at Markit, says that June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum is partly to blame too: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Manufacturers are emphasising slower domestic demand growth and declining new export orders as the key weaknesses they are facing, amid rising uncertainty about the global economy, the oil &amp; gas industry, retail sector and the EU referendum. With this backdrop unlikely to change in the coming months, the second quarter is likely to remain a bleak landscape for industry.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More details and reaction to follow.... The British pound is on a tear this morning, hitting its highest level against the US dollar since last December. Sterling has gained almost one cent to $1.4758, a level last seen in mid-December before Brexit fears began to bite. It appears that the pound has been recovering because City traders expect Britain to vote to remain in the EU on June 23, even though recent polls have suggested a tight fight. But the pound isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t alone -- the dollar is weakening against all the major currencies this morning (apart from the Australia dollar, of course). The London stock market has now hit its lowest level since early April, as traders begin May with a bout of selling. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets have all fallen in the first hour of trading. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is down 35 points at 6208, dragged down by those falling mining stocks. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX has shed 1.5%, and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC is down 0.8%. Shares are being hit because the euro has strengthened against the US dollar this morning. Mining stocks are sliding this morning, pulling London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market into the red. The miners are suffering from falling commodity prices, after today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak Chinese factory data. Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct says: Once again commodity stocks are taking a toll with Anglo American leading the pack lower, with a slide in oil prices during yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session instrumental here. The Japanese yen has just hit an 18-month high against the US dollar, in another blow to the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exporters. Investors are piling into the yen after the Japanese central bank disappointed investors last week by not boosting its stimulus programme. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to worry policymakers in Toyko, who are gunning for a weaker currency to help get inflation moving. Over in the City, HSBC shares have jumped 3% in early trading as investors show relief that profits have \u00e2\u20ac\u02dconly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 fallen by 14%. Just Eat, the online takeaway ordering company, have soared by almost 7% after it reported a 41% surge in sales and hiked its profit forecasts. But Aberdeen Asset Management is still struggling from the slowdown in emerging markets. It reported a 40% slump in underlying pre-tax profits this morning, sending its shares down 6% in early trading. Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate cut will fuel fears of another round of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccurrency wars\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as nations fight for the competitive edge of a weaker currency, says Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets. Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has hit a six-month high following today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate cut. The S&amp;P/ASX jumped 2%, as investors welcomed the promise of cheaper money (even though it was driven by deflation fears). The Australian dollar suffered a predictable selloff, slumping by 1.5% against the US dollar to $0.756. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no let-up in the pain gripping China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories. The latest healthcheck of the sector shows that activity fell again last month. Total new orders stagnated and new export orders shrinking for the fifth month in a row. Data firm Caixin also reports that Chinese firms cut jobs, in the face of weakening demand for their products. Overall employment declined again, with the rate of job shedding nearly as sharp as in February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, when it hit a post-global financial crisis record. This drove Caixin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chinese manufacturing PMI down to 49.4, from 49.7, on an index where anything below 50 shows a contraction. Dr. He Fan, chief economist at Caixin Insight Group, fears that the Chinese economy could be heading into dangerous waters: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All of the index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s categories indicated conditions worsened month-on-month, with output slipping back below the 50-point neutral level. The fluctuations indicate the economy lacks a solid foundation for recovery and is still in the process of bottoming out. The government needs to keep a close watch on the risk of a further economic downturn.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Australia has fired another shot in the currency battles by unexpectedly cutting interest rates to fresh record lows. The Reserve Bank of Australia blamed lower inflation, a stronger Aussie dollar and signs of weakness in its jobs market, as it slashed borrowing costs to just 1.75%, down from 2%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the latest sign that economic conditions remain weak, forcing central bankers to ease policy in an attempt to spur demand and ward off another financial crisis. The move also sparked a political row, as my colleague Paul Karp explains: Shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said the interest rate decision reflected the Liberal government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s incredibly poor economic management. He said in August 2013 when interest rates were cut to 2.5% the Coalition seized on it as a sign of economic weakness. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This decision reflects a weaker economic outlook, with the RBA expecting growth to moderate this year,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In addition, incomes are falling, living standards are stagnating and home ownership is out of reach for so many Australians \u00e2\u20ac\u201c facts the government will be hiding from tonight.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In question time, Malcolm Turnbull responded to claims the rate cut demonstrated a softening economy by promising the budget would help manage a transition away from an economy reliant on the mining sector, and deliver jobs and growth. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Traders in London are struggling back to their desks after the long weekend, and wondering whether the advice to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sell in May and go away\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd holds firm this year. So they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be watching the latest UK manufacturing data, due at 9.30am, for signs that the British economy is slowing down in the run-up to June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum. Yesterday, Germany and Italy reported a pick-up in factory growth, but France bucked the trend with another contraction. HSBC, the global bank, has already given investors something to ponder. It has just reported a 14% slide in profits following the stock market turmoil at the start of 2016. Our City editor Jill Treanor has studied the numbers, and explains: Profits at HSBC fell in the first three months of the year after Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest bank was knocked by the volatility that gripped global markets in January and February. Statutory pre-tax profits in the three-months to the end of March fell 14% to $6.1bn, which the bank described as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a resilient performance despite challenging market conditions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. If currency movements and other one-off items were excluded profits fell 18% to $5.4bn. Stuart Gulliver, the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Market uncertainty led to extreme levels of volatility in January and February, which affected our ability to generate revenue in our markets and wealth management businesses. However, our diversified, universal-banking business model helped to cushion the impact through growth in other parts of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Time is running out for potential bidders to express interest in Tata Steel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK operations, including its famous blast furnace at Port Talbot in Wales. One firm, Liberty House, has already revealed it will bid.... At 10am UK time the European Commission releases its latest economic forecasts. Pierre Moscovici will be giving a press conference in Brussels. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also getting results from investment group Aberdeen Asset Management, and takeaway firm Just Eat.",

If we can take the latest GDP data at face value, then the first quarter of 2016 saw US activity slide to an almost standstill. Yet, the labour market continues to fare well and was the one bright spot amid a general soft patch last month</p> <p>Over time, activity and labour data are likely to converge, but right now there is little evidence to untangle how this will play out. Were the April jobs figures to come in on a softer note, then this would endorse the weakness in activity and imply that lagging variables such as employment are also now turning lower. Conversely, if the labour data stays resilient then we will further linger in a state of limbo as either it is the activity data that is the aberration or the lags have yet to kick in. The April jobs report may in fact accentuate the stagflationary trends (soft activity, rising inflation) noted of late:</p> <p><strong>Payrolls to come in a tad softer than expectations</strong> (ING: +190,000; consensus: +200,000). While some indicators continue to signal a robust hiring backdrop, the softer ADP print suggests that there are some (albeit marginal) downside risks to jobs growth in April. </p> <p><strong>Upward bias in the unemployment rate still in place</strong> (ING: 5.0%; consensus: 4.9%). The discrepancy between payrolls and the household survey (from which the unemployment rate rate is derived) is still evident, while the very strong labour force growth is unlikely to endure. A slight correction in both components may put some upward pressure on the unemployment rate.</p> <p><strong>Robust underlying wage pressures should result in decent headline wage growth </strong>(ING: 2.4% year on year; consensus 2.4%). We note that the headline AHE measure has been hovering at the lower end of a range of US wage indicators, with the Atlanta Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wage growth tracker continuing to tick higher (on a moving average basis). Thus, we think the odds of a positive wage growth surprise are slightly higher this month.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-05-05T15:07:26.095Z\">at 4.07pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-572b53e7e4b0d509448a6423\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-05T14:13:07.499Z\">3.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US crude stocks rise by more than forecast</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US crude stocks increased by a higher than expected 2.8m barrels last week, according to the Energy Information Administration.</p> <p>Analysts had forecast a rise of 1.7m barrels.

                "bodyText":"Some reasonable results from the likes of BT helped stock markets recover some poise after the volatile start to trading in May. There were more signs of weakness in the global economy, including disappointing UK services data and US jobs figures. But oil moved higher as supply concerns outweighed news of higher than expected US crude inventories, giving some support to commodity stocks. But there was little to really enthuse investors ahead of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US non-farm payroll numbers, and the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up just 5.23 points or 0.09% at 6117.25 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax edged up 0.24% to 9851.86 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.11% at 4319.46 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.07% to 17,923.90 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.41% at 8689.4 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.94% to 601.48 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 41 points or 0.24%. On that note, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow for non-farm payroll day. More on Greece, where strikes are set for the weekend and a parliamentary vote on reforms is due on Sunday: Global economic pressures which have dissuaded the US Federal Reserve from raising interest rates again could be waning, according to one of the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policymakers. St Louis Fed president James Bullard said in a speech in California: International influences on the U.S. economy have been widely discussed in global financial markets during the last several years. Those factors appear to be waning during the first half of 2016. Financial stress has fallen according to recent readings. The effects of a stronger dollar appear to be waning. But he said there was evidence for both the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view of a gradual pace of rate increases and the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s belief in only a few increases: Evidence from labor markets, inflation readings and global influences suggests the [Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] median projection may be more nearly correct. Evidence from readings on GDP growth and market-based inflation expectations suggests the market view of the path of the policy rate may be more nearly correct. Which does not appear to shut the door to a June hike, following December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increase. Markets are struggling to make any headway ahead of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US non-farm payroll numbers. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, says: While markets have stabilised after days of losses, there seems little that can revive bullish sentiment as the day heads to its close. Despite an early attempt at a rally, indices remain under pressure, and it looks as if sellers will continue to dominate as the week enters its final session. ...Stocks remain under pressure, and with non-farm payrolls tomorrow the outlook remains resolutely grim. Further US dollar strength provides the reason for why there is little hope for indices at the present time. After weeks of weakness the impetus to buy the dollar appears too strong to hold back, which would provide a cogent reason for why indices have little ability to move higher. Ahead of non-farm payrolls, the market waits to see if the figure can best the number produced by ADP figures on Wednesday. Meanwhile Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unions have called a general strike for Friday and Saturday to protest against the tax and pension reforms due to be debated in parliament over the weekend, Reuters is reporting. Over in Greece, there has been talk of a possible weekend parliamentary vote on pension reforms, ahead of the Eurogroup meeting on Monday. The Syriza government is reportedly meeting on Friday: A solid US non-farms report on Friday could spark a near term revival in the US dollar, says Rob Carnell at ING Bank: April jobs report might uphold the stagflationary trend in US data. If we can take the latest GDP data at face value, then the first quarter of 2016 saw US activity slide to an almost standstill. Yet, the labour market continues to fare well and was the one bright spot amid a general soft patch last month Over time, activity and labour data are likely to converge, but right now there is little evidence to untangle how this will play out. Were the April jobs figures to come in on a softer note, then this would endorse the weakness in activity and imply that lagging variables such as employment are also now turning lower. Conversely, if the labour data stays resilient then we will further linger in a state of limbo as either it is the activity data that is the aberration or the lags have yet to kick in. The April jobs report may in fact accentuate the stagflationary trends (soft activity, rising inflation) noted of late: Payrolls to come in a tad softer than expectations (ING: +190,000; consensus: +200,000). While some indicators continue to signal a robust hiring backdrop, the softer ADP print suggests that there are some (albeit marginal) downside risks to jobs growth in April. Upward bias in the unemployment rate still in place (ING: 5.0%; consensus: 4.9%). The discrepancy between payrolls and the household survey (from which the unemployment rate rate is derived) is still evident, while the very strong labour force growth is unlikely to endure. A slight correction in both components may put some upward pressure on the unemployment rate. Robust underlying wage pressures should result in decent headline wage growth (ING: 2.4% year on year; consensus 2.4%). We note that the headline AHE measure has been hovering at the lower end of a range of US wage indicators, with the Atlanta Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wage growth tracker continuing to tick higher (on a moving average basis). Thus, we think the odds of a positive wage growth surprise are slightly higher this month. US crude stocks increased by a higher than expected 2.8m barrels last week, according to the Energy Information Administration. Analysts had forecast a rise of 1.7m barrels. Meanwhile gasoline stocks rose unexpectedly by 536,000 compared to expectations of a 144,000 barrel decline. But stockpiles of distillate, which includes diesel and heating oil, fell by 1.3m barrels, more than the 83,000 decline expected. Brent is currently up 3% at $46 a barrel despite the higher than expected inventory figures. The price is being supported by the wildfire threatening Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil sands region, as well as growing tensions in Libya. In the latest pay revolt nearly 24% of shareholders at Reckitt Benckiser voted against the remuneration policy and nearly 18% voted against the remuneration report. At Ladbrokes 42% voted against the remuneration report. The latest data on US jobs will not give much grounds for optimism for Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm numbers, says David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco. He said: [Weekly jobless claims] have generally been a bright spot over the past few years. They used to come in around the high 300,000s \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even topping 400,000 at the end of 2012. But now we are used to seeing claims coming in below 300,000 on a regular basis. But now traders will focus on the main event which is tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Non-Farm Payroll release. Early expectations were for an increase of just over 200,000. But the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153whisper number\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will probably be well below that following yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grim ADP number. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobless claims together with a worse than expected Challenger Job-cut number haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helped either. More US employment data ahead of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm numbers. After a jump in the number of US workers laid off last month it is probably no surprise that jobless claims rose last week. According to the Labor department the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose 17,000 to 274,000, the largest increase since February of last year. Analysts had expected a figure of around 260,000. Donald Trump also says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d scrap a swathe of federal regulations which are (he argues) holding back US firms. He told CNBC: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re lowering taxes very substantially and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to be getting rid of a tremendous amount of regulations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd With the Republican nomination in the bag, Donald Trump is now turning his attention to how he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d run the American economy if he makes it to the White House. And he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just declared that he would probably replace Janet Yellen as chair of the Federal Reserve when her current term expires. Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crime? Not being a Republican, apparently. Speaking to CNBC, Trump declared: I have nothing against Janet Yellen whatsoever. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been doing her job, and I have absolutely nothing against her. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know her, but she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very capable person and people that I know have a very high regard for her. But she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a Republican\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 When her time is up, I would most likely replace her because of the fact that it would be appropriate. But in a typical piece of Trump logic, the billionaire businessman also backed Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy stance: She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a low interest-rate person, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always been a low interest-rate person \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and I must be honest, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a low interest rate person. If we raise interest rates, and the dollar starts getting too strong, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to have some very major problems. Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current four-year term expires in February 2018, but she could potentially serve a second term (as did her predecessor, Ben Bernanke). Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jon Ferro questions Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s logic on this one: You can watch a clip of the interview here. We also have worrying news from America. The number of US workers laid off last month jumped, and hit the highest level for an April in seven years. It indicates American companies are feeling the pinch, after its economy slowed to virtual stagnation in the first quarter of 2016. Reuters has the details: Layoffs by U.S.-based companies accelerated in April, sending year-to-date job cuts to the highest level since 2009, a private study reported Thursday. Domestic companies announced plans to let go 65,141 workers last month, a 35 percent increase from March, according to the report by outplacement firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas . In the first four months of the year, employers said they would hand out 250,061 pink slips. That is the highest total for the January-to-April period since 2009. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We continue to see large scale layoffs in the energy sector, where low oil prices are driving down profits. However, we are also seeing heavy downsizing activity in other areas, such as computers and retail, where changing consumer trends are creating a lot of volatility,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Challenger CEO John A. Challenger said in a statement. Meanwhile in London, the boss of consumer goods group Reckitt Benckiser has apologised over a humidifier steriliser scandal that has claimed around 100 lives. Julia Kollewe reports: Rakesh Kapoor, chief executive of Reckitt Benckiser told shareholders at an AGM in central London: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m personally very sorry and very much regret that our Oxy product caused harm to people in Korea.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He said the company had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153made a mistake\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and vowed to ensure that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153something like this never happens again\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He will meet representatives from one patient group, who were demonstrating outside the AGM, in his office on Friday. The humidifier steriliser is believed to have killed nearly 100 people and injured others. It was invented in Korea and only sold there. Reckitt acquired the firm that made the steriliser in 2001. Some of these products were also manufactured by rival companies. Kapoor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments come three days after the head of Reckitt Benckiser Korea and Japan was struck while apologising for the scandal. James Sproule, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, fears the Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is suffering from more than the Brexit jitters. Sproule warns: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These figures will be put down to uncertainty over the EU referendum, but while this may explain part of the fall, we should also consider whether there are underlying factors feeding into a less rosy economic picture. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The question we must ask is whether growth is built on solid foundations. My concern is that the exceptional period we are living in of low rates and cheap money is not the basis of a sustainable economy. We do not know what the outcome of the referendum will be, or the exact effects on the economy in the short and longer term, but this uncertainty is not an excuse to take our eye off the ball on more fundamental issues of economic sustainability.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And this chart, from the Indie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ben Chu, underlines how worrying this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data is: With Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy seemingly slowing, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s even less chance of the Bank of England raising interest rates in the next few months. Some economists are even speculating that the BoE could cut rates this year. And Chris Williamson of data firm Markit has confirmed that the Bank has previously eased monetary policy when its PMI readings have been this week. This graph plots Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI (dark blue) against interest rate cuts (light blue) and bouts of quantitative easing (grey). Williamson says: The three Markit/CIPS PMI surveys collectively indicated the weakest rate of expansion since March 2013, with growth slowing across the board. The combined Output Index fell from 53.6 in March to 51.9 in April. The latest reading is consistent with a near-stalling of economic growth, down to just 0.1% in April. The deterioration in April pushes the surveys into territory which has in the past seen the Bank of England start to worry about the need to revive growth, either by cutting interest rates or non-standard measures such as quantitative easing. This chart shows why the weak service sector data probably show that UK growth has slowed sharply. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s from German bank Berenberg. Their economist Kallum Pickering, says there are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153substantial downside risks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to UK growth, but.. If, as we expect, the UK votes to remain in the EU, then the growth rate should recover to its trend rate of 0.5% qoq in the second half of the year. While there are some risks relating to the current account deficit and concerns that households are returning to pre-Lehman borrowing and saving habits, underlying fundamentals are sound. Anthony Cheung of City firm Amplify Trading agrees that the UK economic picture has deteriorated: Dean Turner, Economist at UBS Wealth Management, agrees that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy appears to have weakened in April. And that means growth in the current quarter will be lower than in January-March, when GDP expanded by only 0.4%. Turner says: Uncertainty over the EU Referendum is clearly taking its toll on activity and with this backdrop, we expect second quarter GDP growth to dip below the already disappointing first quarter print. With such subdued levels of growth, we expect the Bank of England will hold fire on interest rates in next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s MPC meeting, and for many months thereafter.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services sector makes up around three-quarters of the economy, so this slowdown is pretty worrying. David Noble, CEO of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, says June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum is partly to blame. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services sector is stuck between a rock and a hard place. Mounting global economic uncertainty at the top of the supply chain and the reality of the new National Living Wage at the bottom mean that firms are feeling the pinch from both ends. As a result, the sector credited with being the main driver of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic fortunes appears to be slowing down. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The looming EU referendum has had a profound effect on the sector, keeping prices relatively stagnant and delaying new orders. At the other end of the supply chain, the National Living Wage has compounded cost increases, resulting in the overall rate of input price inflation hitting a 27-month high. Together, these factors have squeezed margins while fewer than half of businesses expect to grow over the next twelve months. Breaking: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth has slumped to its lowest level in three years. Markit, the data firm, says its service sector PMI has fallen to 52.3 in April, down from 53.7 in March. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the weakest level since February 2013, and close to the 50-point mark that splits expansion from contraction. Firms reported that job creation slowed last month, while business optimism has fallen to a three year low too. This makes a hat-trick of bad UK economic news this week. Construction firms reported yesterday that growth has hit a three-year low, while the factory PMI showed that manufacturing is now contacting. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, fears that UK economic growth almost stalled last month: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The slowdown in the service sector follows similar weakness in manufacturing and construction to make a triple-whammy of disappointing news on the health of the economy at the start of the second quarter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The PMI surveys are collectively indicating a near- stalling of economic growth, down from 0.4% in the first quarter to just 0.1% in April. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some of the slowdown may be attributable to the early timing of Easter, though April also saw an increase in the number of companies reporting that uncertainty about the EU referendum caused customers to hold back on purchases, exacerbating already-weak demand linked to global growth jitters and ongoing government spending cuts. More to follow.... Here we go..... Lets see if those forecasts of a small slowdown are accurate. As well as posting stronger profits, BT has announced a \u00c2\u00a36bn investment in broadband and 4G coverage: You can now buy shares in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s luxury chocolate firm, Hotel Chocolat. The company floated on the stock market this morning, raising \u00c2\u00a320m each for its two founders. The IPO will also yield \u00c2\u00a312m to fund new store openings, as its expansion drive continues. Launching a new print newspaper, in this time of digital revolution, was always a risky move. So you can understand why Trinity Mirror is pulling its latest offering, The New Day, after seeing sales falling to 30,000. But the speed of the move is a shock \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the paper only launched 9 weeks ago. The news broke last night (here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mark Sweney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s piece), and Trinity has confirmed it to shareholders this morning, saying: Although The New Day has received many supportive reviews and built a strong following on Facebook, the circulation for the title is below our expectations. As a result, we have decided to close the title on 6 May 2016. Whilst disappointing, the launch and subsequent closure have provided new insights into enhancing our newspapers and a number of these opportunities will be considered over time. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the only bad news. Trinity has also revealed that revenues from print advertising has fall almost 20% - highlighting the tough conditions across media.... Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets have made a nervous start to trading, after two days of losses. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is up 15 points, or 0.2%, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX is up 0.3% and the French CAC is flat. BT is leading the London risers, up 3%, after reporting a 5% jump in underlying earnings this morning. Supermarket group Morrisons has gained 1.7%; after a troubled time, it posted a 0.7% rise in underlying sales this morning. It also reported that Amazon is about to start supplying its customers with Morrisons\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 products, though a deal announced recently. Energy firm Centrica, though, has slumped by 7% after it announced plans to sell around \u00c2\u00a3770m of new shares to cut its debt pile. Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets has plunged by 2% at the start of trading, as investors react to the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest political crisis. Investors are alarmed by reports that prime minister Ahmet Davuto\u00c4\u0178lo is poised to resign, following a power struggle with president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an. The Turkish lira is also suffering, shedding 5% overnight. Davuto\u00c4\u0178lo and Erdo\u00c4\u0178an held crunch talks last night, but failed to mend their disagreements over key areas such as economic policy. Local reports suggest that elections for a new party leader to replace Davuto\u00c4\u0178lo could soon be called, causing fresh instability at a time when Turkey is already grappling with high inflation and the refugee crisis. Anxiety over a possible global downturn has hit stock markets in Asia again. The Hong Kong, South Korea and Philippines markets all shed around 0.5%. This send stocks across the region down for the seventh day running, its longest losing streak of the year Sharon Zollner of ANZ Bank New Zealand Ltd explains that signs of economic slowdown is hurting confidence again: Markets seem to be at something of a crossroads at present, waiting for clearer signals on whether U.S. activity will bounce back in the second quarter,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the global economy were to tip into recession at some point, what ammo, precisely, do central banks have left that won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do more harm than good?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. So far this week, the UK economic data has been quite disappointing. Construction firms are growing at the slowest rate in three years, and activity across Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturers is actually shrinking again. And investors are worried that the service sector, which makes up around 80% of the economy, may also be weakening. At 9.30am, the latest Service Sector PMI hits the wires, and it may show that growth slowed in April. A bad reading will surely reinforce concerns that the UK economy is running out of steam, with the Brexit referendum of 23 June casting a darker shadow over the country. CMC Markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Michael Hewson has the details: Both manufacturing and construction PMI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s came in short of expectations with manufacturing slipping into contraction territory for the first time since early 2013. Given how important the services sector is to the UK economy we really need to see a decent number here or run the risk that we see a growth downgrade next week from the latest Bank of England inflation report. Expectations are for a slight decline to 53.6 from 53.7. After two days of heavy falls, European stock markets are expected to inch higher this morning. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still plenty of angst about global growth prospects, and recent fluctuations in the foreign exchange markets. And on the corporate front, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting results from telecoms firms BT, supermarket chain Morrisons, and newspaper group Trinity Mirror.",

                "bodyText":"A former Topshop finance chief, along with a one-time managing director of Deutsche Bank, have been found guilty of insider dealing in one of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most high-profile cases. Eight years after the investigation began, Andrew Hind, 56, who was finance director at Topshop in the 1990s, and his friend Martyn Dodgson, 44, who used to work in corporate broking at Deutsche and Lehman Brothers, were both convicted following a 12-week trial at Southwark crown court. The pair will be sentenced at a later date and face a maximum of seven years in prison as well as a confiscation order. The longest sentence handed down for being convicted of insider dealing in the UK is the four years given to Richard Joseph in 2013. The Financial Conduct Authority alleged that Dodgson had handed inside information he had discovered through his work to Hind, who was then alleged to have passed it on to two other men to trade on their behalf. It was alleged that the group, which also included another corporate broker, then split the profits, which the FCA claimed totalled \u00c2\u00a37.4m.

The Greek request for debt relief poses to the European centre the question: which side are you on?</p> <p>Amid this, the resurgent radical left faces tough decisions of its own. To understand why, we have to understand the source of its recent strength.

The SYRIZA-led government had campaigned strongly on an anti-austerity platform before assuming power in 2015. Achieving some degree of debt relief therefore represents a crucial life line for the administration, especially given the cost-cutting measures it has been forced to pass.</p> <p>Failed debt negotiations could trigger further and more violent protests (violence has so far been caused primarily by anarchist groups). Significantly increased civil disorder would put pressure on the leftist government to resign. An early election would not favour SYRIZA and would risk a political stalemate, without any party able to form a stable majority government.

                "bodyText":"Long experience of the eurozone debt crisis means we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get too excited tonight. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extraordinary meeting does seem to have made real progress, but the next two weeks could still see some turbulence. And Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term economic prospects remain deeply troubled, even if it does get finally some debt relief. But this could still be remembered as a moment when the crisis eased a little, meaning the eurozone could experience a summer free of debt dramas. Three things have been agreed: 1) Greece is on the brink of receiving a much-needed slug of bailout cash, after eurozone finance ministers welcomed its latest package of austerity measures, tax rises and pension reforms 2) However, the eurogroup are demanding more work on contingency measures in case Greece cannot hit its bailout targets. A compromise is being hammered out, which means Greece won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to vote specific measure into law right now. 3) In a historic step, ministers actually talked about how to cut Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt burden. However, in the short-term, it is only considering relatively modest changes. In the medium term, though, Greece could be granted longer grace and payment periods. And in the long-term, further debt writedowns could be considered. The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mehreen Kahn has dubbed it a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153baby steps\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd approach. But encouragingly, both sides appear happy tonight. European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici described the situation as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153work in good progress\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, suggesting that officials would make good progress before the next meeting on 24 May. And Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, also seemed cheerful, declaring that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was a very good Eurogroup for Greece and I think a very good Eurogroup for Europe.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This point has also just echoed by prime minister Alexis Tsipras, who is claiming success in his handling of the crisis. Tsakalotos did admit, though, that there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153meeting of minds\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the debt relief issue.... But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one major question mark tonight - we still don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if the International Monetary Fund is going to accept this plan, and come on board. Leaving the eurogroup meeting, Finland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alex Stubb said this is crucial. He simply doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a mandate for a Finnish involvement in the Greek bailout unless the IMF are there too, for example. And there would be merry hell in the Bundestag too if the IMF walked away. So, plenty of opportunity for twists and turns in the next two weeks, until the eurogroup meets again on the 24 May. For now, though, most commentators agree this has been that rare thing, a good day for Greece. So let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enjoy that. Goodnight, and thanks for reading and commenting! GW Over in Greece, prime minister Alexis Tsipras is welcoming the progress made in Brussels today. Given the scale of last weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anti-austerity protests, Tsipras is understandably keen to argue that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s making progress. The commitment to debt relief was the only real success from last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout talks, after all. Paul Mason, the former Channel 4 News economics editor, has written about the Greek crisis for the Guardian tonight. He argues that the call for Greek debt relief is part of a larger transformation in Europe: So, now it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no longer about austerity: there is a three-way battle for the soul of Europe; between a beleaguered centre that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seeing its consent to govern drain away; a resurgent nationalist and racist right; and a modernised radical left. The Greek request for debt relief poses to the European centre the question: which side are you on? Amid this, the resurgent radical left faces tough decisions of its own. To understand why, we have to understand the source of its recent strength. Podemos came out of the millions-strong indignados movement in 2011; Syriza expanded during the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153occupation of the squares\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the same year. The 188,000 people who joined the Labour party during and after Corbyn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign are not just trade unionists and old lefties; at their core are student activists who learned their politics during occupation movement of 2010/11, and hordes of returning Greens. Sinn Fein\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s transformation and growth in Ireland is likewise driven by a grassroots protest movement against water charges.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full piece: The Greek finance ministry has issued an upbeat statement, saying that further austerity measures will not be required following today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting: Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras should be hot-footing it to the presidential palace within 30 minutes: Euclid Tsakalotos concludes his press conference by saying he expects the IMF to come on board and support this deal. And all sides are confident that Greece can achieve its targets, meaning contingency measures may never be needed. This is one reason the Greek side are happy tonight: The Greek government did succeed in passing pension reforms, and income tax changes, last night - but it could have faced a revolt if it asked for more detailed austerity. The IMF was pleased that debt relief was discussed today, says Tsakalotos, although obviously it wants more debt relief for Greece than some countries. Euclid Tsakalotos is now outlining the new plan for contingency measures (extra austerity, if needed) If Greece misses its targets, then a presidential decree would enforce \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcacross the line\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 cuts, he says. The government could subsequently implement some different measures in a budget. We think this is legally binding, and will address creditors concerns. Euclid Tsakalotos says there was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very interesting exchange of views\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the issue of Greek debt relief today. Ministers didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree on everything, but there was a commitment to tackle the issue. He also supports the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthree-layer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 approach, to tackle Greek debt relief on a short, medium and long-term basis (see earlier). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153great relief\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to finally have this meeting on debt relief and talk about the specifics, to help Greece finally turn the corner. Our expectation is that by 24 May we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have an agreement on fine-tuning the contingency measures, and we may also have agreement on debt relief too. Greece, and our creditors, both need to feel that we are turning the page and that the vicious circle of measures leading to recession, leading to new measures, is over, Tsakalotos says. Once we have the green light from creditors, it will give much-needed confidence to businesses, investors and consumers. Tsakalotos says that Greece is relieved that its contingency measures is being used as the basis for discussions. Hang on.... Euclid Tsakalotos, Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, is giving a press conference now. He being by telling reporters that This was a very good eurogroup for Greece, and I think a very good eurogroup for Europe. He thanks Jeroen Dijsselblom for acting as an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchonest broker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the build-up to this meeting. We have agreed a package of measure of fiscal measures, and structural reforms. And once they are legislated, funds will be dispensed to Greece. Q: What happens if Greece does not legislate for extra contingency measures? And has the eurogroup made a big mistake by adding it at all? No, it was a clever idea to bridge the difference between the eurogroup and IMF forecasts, Dijsselbloem replies to the second question. We need an insurance in case the pessimists (at the IMF) are right. And on the first point, Dijsselbloem says the eurogroup has recognised Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns about voting through extra austerity that might or might not be needed We will not make the Greeks legislate specific measures up front, he says. We will make them legislate the mechanism, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear what happens if the programme goes off course. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the end of the press conference. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll do a summary now.... Q: Do we need an agreement on the whole package, including debt relief, before the next tranche of aid is paid out? No, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not necessary formally, or politically necessary either, says eurogroup chair Jeroen Dijsselbloem. As long as we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re comfortable that the IMF are going to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccome on board\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and support the package, we could simply move to the disbursement, he adds. Finland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alex Stubb has tweeted that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccarefully optimistic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that there will be a deal by the next meeting on 24 May. The IMF is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153less optimistic, or more conservative if you will\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about how Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy will perform by 2018, Jeroen Dijsselbloem says. Thus, the extra contingency measures are needed, in case the Fund are right. The IMF agreed and supported our approach at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, Dijsselbloem adds. Q: Are you ready to go ahead with the programme without the IMF (as Slovakia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister suggested earlier) No, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a possibility for the eurogroup as a whole, Dijsselbloem insists. Several members cherish the involvement of the IMF, he adds [such as Germany, of course]. Q: What have you changed to Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposal for contingency measures in case it misses its fiscal targets? We have accepted Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposal, but with a couple of new conditions to enforce it, Dijsselbloem says. They are 1) They will initially consist of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Expenditure measures across the board, discretionary and non-discretionary\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Ie, Greece would have to slash spending. 2) Greece could then adjust the measures in a subsequent budget, to add revenue elements (to replace some expenditure cuts). That could make it more balanced. 3) The package must be agreed with creditors first. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It would be unfortunate if Greece implemented contingency measures and then the eurogroup said it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t good enough.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting was about opening the debate on Greek debt sustainability and considering the options, Jeroen Dijsselbloem continues, and also deciding what officials should start to work on. Some instant reaction: Onto questions..... Q: You are only proposing long-term debt relief for Greece after 2018, if Greece hits its commitments. Will that really satisfy the IMF? It depends what is agreed by May 24, says Dijsselbloem. It is fair to assume that there will be debt sustainability with Greece, he continues, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely that it will need extra help at the end of the current bailout package in 2018. Now Klaus Regling, who runs the eurozone bailout fund (the EFSF), is speaking, and confirms that Greek debt relief talks began today. The liquidity situation in Greece is getting tighter, he warns, and important debt repayments are coming up (Athens owes \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3.5bn in July). Regling also points out that Greece did get a big debt writedown in 2012, when private creditors took a haircut that saved Athens billions in debt repayments each year. Commissioner Pierre Moscovici is now speaking. He says that ensuring the sustainability of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fundamental element\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the agreement reached last summer. Dijsselbloem\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to consider Greeces\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt relief on a short-term, medium-term and long-term basis is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very wise\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Today is work in progress, but work in good progress, he concludes. The Eurogroup\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aim is to make Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debts sustainable in the long term, Jeroen Dijsselbloem adds. Dijsselbloem turns to debt relief. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurogroup meeting held a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153first round\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of talks about Greek debt relief, he says. They are now looking at Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual gross financing needs, rather than the debt/GDP measure. And they considered Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s short-term, medium-term and long-term debt sustainability, he says. In the short term, they are looking at ways of optimising Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt to lower repayment costs. In the medium term, the eurozone working group has been asked to look at measures which could take place in 2018, at the end of the current programme. They could lower Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt costs, by lowering interest rate costs or changing repayment dates. For the long term, the eurogroup stands ready, if necessary and if Greece is compliant with its targets, to consider whether further debt relief is needed. On the contingency measures, Dijsselbloem says the eurogroup took the last proposal from the Greek government and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcenforced it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or amended it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to make sure revenues can be recovered if Athens fails to achieve its fiscal targets. Those measures will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153legislated upfront\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and kick in automatically, Dijsselbloem says. That may means the Greek parliament has to vote these measure through, which could be a challenge... 8pm update: a presidential decree will be used, so there shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a revolt in parliament The press conference is starting now.... Jeroen Dijsselbloem says the eurogroup discussed three things the policy package which has been drawn up, following last summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout deal the contingency mechanisms in case Greece veers off course A first-round discussion on debt sustainability. He says the eurogroup welcomed the Greek policy package, which should pave the way for the (long-awaited) successful completion of its first bailout review. The next two weeks could be quite tense as Greece and her creditors try to carve up a staff level agreement. Slovakia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Peter Ka\u00c5\u00beim\u00c3\u00adr says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting was much better than he had expected: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not *quite* the same as saying it actually went well..... The eurogroup press conference will be broadcast here. EC vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis is tweeting that the meeting has ended. He says eurogroup ministers welcomed the package of measures which Greece has agreed. But he also says discussions will continue on May 24th, at the next scheduled eurogroup meeting. The eurogroup meeting on Greece has ended, we hear, so the press conference should begin shortly. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, warns that Greece could be driven into default unless its creditors compromise. He writes: This was a situation only narrowly averted last summer and on his way into Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, Austria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, Hans J\u00c3\u00b6rg Schelling, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think anyone wants a repeat of summer 2015.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Schelling spoke for many, including David Cameron, who could certainly do with Greece being out of the headlines for the next six weeks. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum means that the eurozone has to act with unaccustomed speed and sort Greece out within a fortnight. Otherwise the issue will be parked until after June 23 and another long, hot summer will loom large. More here: The Greek government will face serious criticism back home unless it gets a substantial deal on debt relief soon. Blanka Kolenikova, senior analyst at IHS Country Risk, says it could even collapse: The government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public support will depend on progress on debt relief, which IHS maintains will take the form of extended maturities and fixing/lowering the interest rates applied to official loans. The SYRIZA-led government had campaigned strongly on an anti-austerity platform before assuming power in 2015. Achieving some degree of debt relief therefore represents a crucial life line for the administration, especially given the cost-cutting measures it has been forced to pass. Failed debt negotiations could trigger further and more violent protests (violence has so far been caused primarily by anarchist groups). Significantly increased civil disorder would put pressure on the leftist government to resign. An early election would not favour SYRIZA and would risk a political stalemate, without any party able to form a stable majority government. In turn, this would reduce Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to pass bailout-related measures and threaten its ability to secure future releases of official funding. The Wall Street Journal has seen the Greek debt sustainability analysis drawn up by Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors, which is on the table in Brussels today. It shows remarkable uncertainty over Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to reduce its debt pile. One estimate shows Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 borrowing spiralling out of control over the next 45 years; another shows it being steadily eroded. The WSJ says: Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt may rise to as much as 258.3% of gross domestic product by 2060 or fall to as low as 62.6% of GDP, according to an official analysis of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt trajectory, a wide divergence that indicates difficult discussions ahead on the possibility of debt relief. More here: Official Analysis Suggests Tough Talks Over Greek Debt Relief Hopes of a breakthrough deal between Greece and creditors on debt relief have been dashed today, although in truth is never looked like (as we warned in the opening post). Instead, May 24 has been inked in as the next in a long line of Greek deadlines. That gives the eurozone two weeks to achieve three things: agree whether Greece has met the terms of its bailout, to unlock around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn in aid settle on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccontingency measures\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that would kick in if Greece fails to hit bailout targets find a mutually agreeable way to make Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt pile, worth 180% of GDP, more sustainable. Eurozone ministers are now hunkered down in Brussels, considering whether the austerity measures agreed by Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s MPs last night are enough. Some key players sounded relatively optimistic, such as commissioner Pierre Moscovici: Others, such as Finland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alex Stubb and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble, may still need convincing that Greece has done enough. And eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem says that while debt relief is on the agenda, there won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be any firm conclusions today. A press conference is scheduled for this evening, at perhaps 6pm or 7pm Brussels time (5pm or 6pm BST). Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance chiefs are now gathered inside the EU council building to discuss Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout programme. These photos have just arrived, showing ministers in good spirits: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Slovakian position: This may not be very practical. The financial markets might be alarmed if the IMF dropped out of the Greek bailout, and the German parliament would probably be furious. Irish finance minister Michael Noonan says his country still opposes cutting Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt pile. Instead, Ireland favours giving Greece debt relief by extending the repayment dates and cutting interest rates. Noonan adds that he expects progress, but no deal today. Instead, he points to next meeting on May 24th. Finland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alex Stubb is also playing down expectations for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister is also defending Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s three bailout programmes: Schauble forgot to mention that much of the money went to those who held Greek debt, helping German banks to stay on their feet.... Austria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, Hans J\u00c3\u00b6rg Schelling, speaks for us all: Austria certainly doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want another Greek crisis; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already reeling from the shock resignation of chancellor Werner Faymann this morning (see earlier post) May 24th has just been inked in as the next deadline in the Greek debt saga. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble, has just told reporters that he hopes to make progress today, but no financial decision. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem says that he hope to reach an agreement with Greece by May 24, when ministers hold their next scheduled meting. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem has just warned that a final decision on Greek\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout, and debt relief, is not likely today. He just arrived at the eurogroup meeting in Brussels, and spoke to reporters. Q: What are the prospects for Greek debt relief to be on the table today? We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re definitely going to discuss it. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll discuss when, if, under what conditions this could take place. Is it necessary? But this is the first discussion. i don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect any definite conclusions on it yet. Dijsselbloem also warned that ministers need more time to consider Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reforms, and its proposals for contingency measures: Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, says ministers will not consider cutting the face value of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debts: (as explained earlier, they could ease Athens burden in other ways) Pierre Moscovici also denies that the eurogroup is backtracking on its commitment to debt relief. With progress made on reforms and the contingency measures, attention can now turn to debt, he says. European commissioner Pierre Moscovici has just arrived at the eurogroup meeting (for the second time - he must have sneaked out and in again). He is telling reporters that the EC believes Greece has achieved a lot. The pension reforms and income tax reforms voted yesterday are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very important steps\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Moscovici. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We should today recognise that this effort has have been taken.... It represents a very strong amount of measures - and with that, Greece will be on this way to recover growth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Moscovici adds that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on the right path\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in talks about the extra contingency measures which lenders are demanding. He also admits that the issue of debt relied is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a question mostly for the member states.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd B he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still hopeful, declaring: I hopes today that we will set the framework for a global deal, a demanding deal. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what the commission believes, and we believe it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible. Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s man in Brussels today, Luis de Guindos, says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s optimistic of a deal between Greece and creditors soon: You can watch the arrivals in Brussels on the EbS service, here: LIVE Eurogroup meeting Arrivals Slovakia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, Peter Ka\u00c5\u00beim\u00c3\u00adr, tweets that he expects a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdebate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s progress. He was one of Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 toughest critics during last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout dramas. German government spokesman Steffen Seibert has tried to pour cold water on hopes of a Greek debt relief deal today. Nothing can be discussed until Greece has proved that its economic reforms are satisfactory, Seibert told a press conference this morning. More here Back in Brussels, officials are getting ready for ready for talks on how to make Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debts more sustainable. Options on the table could include lowering the interest rate on Greek bonds, or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reprofiling\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd them to give Athens more time to repay. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters latest: Euro zone finance ministers will start talks on Monday on how to reprofile Greek debt to make future annual servicing costs manageable for Athens despite opposition from Germany, which does not believe any relief isneeded, euro zone officials said. The International Monetary Fund believes that Athens must get debt relief for its economy to develop and wants the discussions to focus on capping Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual debt servicing costs at around 15% of GDP or less. Germany believes Greece can do without debt relief for now,especially that it does not have to service its debt until after 2022, when a 10-year grace period expires. This sudden political crisis in Austria threatens to overshadow today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurogroup meeting. Perhaps it might also encourage eurozone finance ministers to make some progress on Greece, to show populist voices that Europe can work..... More breaking news: Austria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leader, chancellor Werner Faymann, has just resigned. Faymann had been under pressures from his party, the centre-left social democrats, to work with the far-right Freedom Party. The Freedom Party, which is anti-Islam and eurosceptic, is in a strong position to win the Austrian presidency in a ballot later this month. This appears to have triggered another bout of political instability in Europe.... Newsflash: The International Monetary Fund is urging Germany speed up its public infrastructure spending, and get more refugees into work. In its latest assessment of the German economy, the IMF says: More progress on structural reforms would revitalize potential growth and enhance the authorities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 leadership at the European level in this area. A more dynamic Germany would also benefit the still fragile economic recovery in the euro area. The IMF also warns that economic growth will remain moderate. Strong domestic demand will offset weak external demand, meaning Germany will continue to run a near-record current account surplus. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dckey policy messages\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to Berlin: Accelerate structural reforms to boost growth potential by broadening the labor market participation of refugees, women, and older workers, and spurring competition in the services sector. Step up public and private investment to meet infrastructure needs, while tackling administrative bottlenecks. Remove impediments to housing supply expansion to better relieve the pressure on the housing market. Develop the legal basis for real-estate-related macroprudential tools to better contain potential future excesses. Improve financial sector oversight and macroprudential policy analysis by enhancing data collection. Implement measures to strengthen the oversight role of banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 supervisory boards by increasing their responsibilities and tightening member qualifications standards. Together with the European competent authorities, complete the new bank resolution and crisis management agenda, as Germany is home to globally systemic institutions. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting could be fiery, predicts John Springford of the Centre for European Reform. The problem is that the IMF is insisting on debt relief and lower fiscal targets for Greece, otherwise it walks away. Germany isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced that either are needed, but is also adamant that the IMF must be involved in the Greek programmes. We can usually rely on Pierre Moscovici, the European Commissioner for monetary union, for some upbeat quotes. Not today, though. Moscovici has arrived at the eurogroup meeting without speaking to the press. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, Michel Sapin, has arrived early for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. He sounds pretty upbeat: What would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the best\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd be? Well, agreement on the contingency measures, releasing the next bailout tranche, and starting to talk about debt relief would cover it..... Update: Sapin even gave reporters a cheery wave: German vice chancellor Sigmar Gabriel has urged eurozone finance ministers to start talks about Greek debt relief today. Gabriel, who is the deputy leader of the Social Democrat Party (junior coalition partners), warned that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy cannot take further austerity. In a speech in Berlin this morning, he declared: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We must help the country to reduce its debt burden..... That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why a step must finally be made at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurogroup meeting in Brussels to move towards a situation where Greece doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to fight every year again to get new loans in order to repay old loans.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an timely intervention from Gabriel, which also highlights the split with the German government over Greece. Finance minister Wolfgang Schauble has argued that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s huge borrowing pile is currently sustainable, meaning debt relief is not required. And those tensions could make it harder to get a deal today, warns Alex White of the Economist Intelligence Unit: Officials at the Greek finance ministry are insisting this morning that an agreement in principle has been reached on the core \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5.4bn package of measures demanded by lenders. One said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is an agreement in principle [concerning] the contents of the review: the privatisations fund, Non Performing Loans, social security and tax [systems], indirect taxes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s counter proposal to institute an automatic mechanism that would trigger across the board cuts in the event of finances veering of course \u00e2\u20ac\u201c rather than extra contingency measures that would never get parliamentary approval - will be discussed in Brussels at a euro working group this morning, the ministry said. Analysts in Athens say the automatic brake is crucial if the once vehemently anti-austerity leftist-led government is to be able to return triumphantly from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crunch meeting. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The irony is that this government has already put it name to very tough measures,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the veteran politics watcher Christos Memis told me. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The protracted negotiations have been all about proving they are not traitors of the left. It is crucial that they now win this battle over extra [contingency] measures \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. If not, they will probably do something out of the box like early elections.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Finland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, Alex Stubb, is on his way to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurogroup meeting. Greek bonds are rallying this morning, as traders welcome the news that MPs approved fresh austerity measures overnight. Money is flowing back into Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt, pushing down the interest rate (or yield) that investors demand to hold the bonds. The yield on two-year Greek debt has fallen sharply to 9.4%, down from 10.2% on Friday. That still shows a significant risk of default, though -- many shorter-dated eurozone bonds actually trade with a negative yield today. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-year bonds, the benchmark of financial health, are also rallying. Their yield has fallen to 8.4%, down from 8.6%, which looks like a four-month low. Patrick Jacq, European rate strategist at BNP Paribas, says the drop in Greek yields is a good sign: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The vote in parliament is constructive and positive for the Eurogroup talks and that should help the decision to give Greece additional support,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said (thanks to Reuters for the quote) This pie chart, from Bloomberg, shows how the IMF and European institutions now hold most of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt: Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit also predicts trouble ahead: Greece could soon be plunged into the uncertainty of another general election, fears analyst Wolfgang Piccoli of Teneo Intelligence. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worried that the two sides still haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reached a decision on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccontingency measures\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (fresh austerity) that would be implemented if Greece failed to hit the targets set by creditors. While Athens insists on an automatic fiscal brake that would trigger across-the-board cuts, the institutions, and especially the IMF, consider this option neither credible nor sustainable. In contrast, they are calling for specific measures that should be legislated upfront and have an automatic trigger. While Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 preference is to conclude the review as soon as possible, the nature of the contingency package could determine the fate of his government as it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to secure the required 151 votes. Conversely, Germany will be unwilling to discuss debt relief any further without a specific Greek contingency package with automatic triggers. Teneo reckons there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 65% chance that a deal will be reached. But.... The risk of snap polls could increase significantly if the lenders decide to play hardball by insisting on a contingency package that Tsipras cannot either accept or get approved in parliament. The Eurogroup meeting scheduled for 24 May could offer the next opportunity for a deal. UKIP leader Nigel Farage has leapt on the protests in Athens last night, as proof that Britain should quit the EU: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth noting that while thousands of people protested in Athens, the violence appeared to be restricted to a group of youths throwing flares and Molotov cocktails at officers who responded with volleys of tear gas. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest dispatch from Athens: The Greek crisis is returning to centre stage on today, says Bloomberg. Aid deliberations by its international creditors will signal whether the country faces a renewed period of political drift or wins some economic breathing space after six years of turbulence. Bloomberg: Greece Fights to Unlock Aid as Impasse Risks Political Unrest The Wall Street Journal says that the pension and tax measures agreed last night match the bulk of the austerity demanded by lenders. However.... Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most influential creditors, Germany and the International Monetary Fund, remain deadlocked over the terms of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout plan, which the IMF thinks is badly flawed but Germany says can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be changed. The Eurogroup, as the committee of eurozone finance ministers is known, will meet in Brussels on Monday to discuss Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal strategy and the sustainability of its debts. A resolution of the deep differences isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expected. WSJ: Greece Passes Austerity Measures as Creditors Remain Deadlocked Over Bailout Terms The Financial Times warns that IMF and Germany are still demanding extra austerity in case Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout goes off course -- but are opposed by the Greek side, and the European Commission. Eurozone officials said that the stalemate over the contingency measures made it unlikely that any agreement to close the first review will be reached at Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. Greece needs the additional bailout aid by July, when \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3.5bn in debt comes due. The Greek government has sought to blame the IMF for the delays, and a senior Greek official said on Sunday that both the commission and the European Central Bank believed that Athens had done enough to close the review. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are some measures that still have to be adopted but the Europeans now appear to be satisfied,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the official said. FT: Greece approves pension and income tax reforms There were familiar scenes in Athens last night as MPs gathered to vote on a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5.4bn package of budget cuts and pension reforms. Thousands of demonstrators flocked to the Greek capital to protest against the austerity piled on the country, at the end of a three-day general strike. It turned violent at one stage, with riot police using tear gas after a group of masked demonstrators threw rocks and petrol bombs. There was drama inside the parliament too, with opposition leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis laying into prime minister Tsipras over his handling of the crisis. Crisis watcher Iliana Magra live-tweeted the whole thing here: Tsipras, though, insisted that Greece was making progress, saying: We have an important opportunity before us for the country to break this vicious cycle, and enter a virtuous cycle. And the PM also argued that Monday will be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very important day\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, because: After six years (of crisis), the Eurogroup will meet to discuss debt relief. Despite predictions of defections, Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coalition stuck together and approved the package, including a lower income-tax threshold. Good morning. The long-running, seemingly never-ending Greek debt crisis is back on the agenda. Finance ministers from across the eurogroup will gather in Brussels this afternoon, hoping to make two important moves. They could finally complete the long-stalled first review of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s massive EU-IMF bailout (the one agreed last July) They could start talking about debt relief measures for Greece. The talks could be productive (at least by EU standards), as the Greek parliament has just agreed a new package of tough austerity measures overnight. That vote should pave the way to unlock the next tranche of bailout aid for Greece. That would be welcome, following months of deadlock between Athens and creditors over \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3.5bn of extra \u00e2\u20ac\u0153contingency measures\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd demanded in case Greece fails to hit its budget targets. There won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a major decision on debt relief today, of course. Officially, the eurogroup\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan is to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153discuss possible debt relief measures aiming at ensuring that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gross financing needs remain at a sustainable level, with a view to reach a political agreement.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But it is still an important meeting. Last Friday, the International Monetary Fund urged the eurozone to begin debt relief negotiations right away, and to recognise that the fiscal targets set for Greece last summer are simply unachievable. Otherwise, the IMF could possibly walk away from the whole adventure.... Eurozone ministers should gather in Brussels around 3pm local time (2pm BST), followed by an early-evening press conference. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll track all the main events through the day....",

The biggest declines in personal finances were felt in Wales, followed by London. Households said a pick-up in price pressures was weighing on finances, with inflation perceptions at the highest in 17 months. UK inflation was steadily picking up from a low of -0.1% in October 2015, until official figures published on Tuesday revealed the first drop in annual inflation in seven months in April.

Along with stronger than expected US data, this seemed to put a June rise firmly on the table. Not everyone agrees, however, with Joseph Lake, US analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, suggesting there will be no move until at least September:</p> <blockquote> <p>All eyes today are on the release of the minutes of the April FOMC meeting, which will give markets an indication of the future direction of interest rates, and the likelihood of a Fed rate rise in June. This will influence the future direction of the US dollar, and have a large bearing on whether commodity prices can sustain their recent rally. </p> <p>Politics will play a key role in when the Fed decides to increase the policy rate. The next FOMC meeting is on June 14-15, just one week before the UK votes on whether it will leave or remain in the European Union. Although the EIU expects the UK to vote to remain in the EU, polls are close and the vote will be tight. This will weigh on financial markets and factor in to the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision.

However, while economic data has been positive, it has not been overwhelmingly so and, combined with the Brexit vote, this will be enough to persuade the Fed to delay the next rate increase. It is unlikely to move at the following FOMC meeting, in July, as it is not accompanied by a press conference. Although the Fed insists that all meetings are live, given the very gradual nature of this tightening cycle, and the importance of clear communication, the Fed will probably skip July, leaving the following FOMC meeting in September as the most likely date of the next policy rate increase.</p> <p>Thereafter, politics will once again enter the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s calculations, but this time it will be domestic matters. The lead up to the November presidential and congressional elections will increase investor uncertainty, and raise volatility in financial markets. Although we think the domestic economic prospects for the second half of 2016 are bright, the uncertainty generated by politics will deter the FOMC from tightening policy at the November meeting, leaving the FOMC gathering in mid-December as the last chance to increase the policy rate for a second time in 2016.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-573c91eae4b0451a6f482647\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-18T16:05:21.819Z\">5.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A quick look at what is expected at this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s G7 finance ministers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 meeting in Japan, from Capital Economics. In sum, not much:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s G7 finance ministers meeting in Sendai, Japan, is likely to focus on exchange rate and fiscal policy and to end with another warning about the dangers of Brexit. However, no major policy announcements are on the cards. </p> </blockquote> <p>In more detail:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The hosts, Japan, will be looking for support for the view that currency intervention can be a legitimate policy option in some circumstances. After all, the appreciation of the yen, of 10% so far this year, has been much bigger than that of the euro (and has had a major impact on corporate earnings. And Japanese officials have hinted recently that they may intervene to push the yen down...US officials are not likely to criticise the euro-zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s or Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exchange rate policy too heavily at this weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting because neither the ECB nor the Bank of Japan has been intervening to weaken their currencies.</p> <p>Indeed, the US is more concerned about China, which is of course not a G7 member, though the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank has been selling foreign currency over the past year in order to prop the renminbi up, rather than trying to gain competitive advantage.</p> <p>All in all, it seems highly likely that the G7 will stick to its established formula on exchange rate policy. The key elements are a commitment to market-determined exchange rates and to using fiscal and monetary policies to achieve domestic objectives.</p> <p>Finance ministers will also discuss fiscal policy, with Germany likely to be singled out for criticism once again. But the Japanese government is unlikely to push for a coordinated statement in favour of fiscal stimulus given implacable opposition from Germany itself. Moreover, Japan is not in a good position to argue for a coordinated fiscal stimulus: under current plans, its fiscal policy will be tightened more than that of any other G7 economy apart from the UK during 2016-2020.</p> <p>Finally, the G7 will surely issue yet another warning about the dangers posed by Brexit. With only five weeks to go until the referendum, getting this in any formal communique\u00cc\ufffd will be the only significant objective of the UK government. But this would surely do little to change anybody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view on the merits of Brexit. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-573c876ae4b0451a6f482617\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-18T15:22:04.877Z\">4.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Oil is still in negative territory following the US inventory figures, but it is not seeing a major slide, with Brent crude down just 0.2% at $49.17 a barrel.</strong> Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Crude oil dropped in the immediate aftermath of the latest official US oil inventories report from the EIA as traders responded to the headline build of 1.3m barrels.

                "bodyText":"And finally..... here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my colleage Jana Kasperkevic on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed minutes: The US Federal Reserve could rase interest rates as early as June, according to minutes from its April meeting, with Fed members arguing the risks of a slowdown in the global economy have receded. Yet even as the members have become more bullish about US economic resilience, they remained cautious about raising rates. They voted 11-1 to keep interest rates unchanged for a third time this year at the April meeting. The minutes released on Wednesday listed concerns about the slowing growth ofUS economy in the first quarter, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s potential exit from the EU and lingering uncertainty over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Since the March FOMC [Federal Open Markets Committee] meeting, foreign financial market conditions eased, on net, and overall risk sentiment appeared to have improved,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the Fed noted in its minutes. Yet concerns about potential risks of a slowing US economy and global markets remain. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: And with that, goodnight and thanks for reading... GW The New York stock market has closed for the night, pretty much where they started it: The Dow Jones index has only shed 5 points, or 0.03%, at 17,524. The broader S&amp;P 500 index closed flat, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq index finished 0.5% higher. Basically, the selloff sparked by the Fed minutes did wipe out early gains, but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t prompt a rout. Tariq Zahir, crude oil trader and managing partner at Tyche Capital Advisors, reckons the US dollar could continue to strengthen. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We think people really had a June rate hike off the table. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But with the Fed disputing that, we could have a much stronger dollar from here, which is typically bearish for oil and other commodities.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dollar rally has already driven down commodity prices, and sunk oil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest attempt to hit the $50/barrel mark for the first time this year. Brent crude is ending the day down 1.5% at $48.55. Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago, has got the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s message, telling Reuters that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They are ready to pull the trigger on a rate increase in June.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Poor Janet Yellen.... As Fed chair, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to have to keep a close eye on the nitty-gritty of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum battle, points out the FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mehreen Khan. Wall Street now reckons there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 25% chance of a June rate hike - up from below 5% last week: The Federal Reserve is pretty clear that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum is a potential shock to the world economy, as is China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowdown. The minutes state that: [Many policymakers] indicated that they continued to see downside risks to the outlook either because of concerns that the recent slowdown in domestic spending might persist or because of remaining concerns about the global economic and financial outlook. Some participants noted that global financial markets could be sensitive to the upcoming British referendum on membership in the European Union or to unanticipated developments associated with China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s management of its exchange rate.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The next Fed meeting takes place just a week before Britain goes to the polls in a vote that will determine its place in, or our, of the European Union. So the Fed might well judge it too risky to raise borrowing costs after all (as Joseph Lake, US analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, suggested earlier today) The yield, or interest rates, on US government bonds has spiked sharply since the minutes were released. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another sign that investors are now expecting American interest rates to rise earlier than before. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at foreign exchange firm World First, reckons the Federal Reserve are trying to signal to the market.... Ironically, by pushing up the dollar, markets create the kind of tighter monetary conditions that allow the Fed to hold off actually raising rates at all..... Investors are rapidly repricing their expectations for US interest rate moves this year. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now a greater expectation that borrowing costs could rise during 2016, based on market moves in the last 20 minutes. However, they still don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that a June hike is terribly likely, despite the Fed saying that many policymakers think it could be justified if the data improves. CNBC has the details: June rate hike: 26 percent chance, up from 19 percent prior to the minutes being released July: 46 percent chance, up from 38 percent September: 62 percent, up from 57 percent November: 64 percent, up from 60 percent December: 78 percent, up from 74 percent February 2017: 80 percent, up from 76 percent More here: Rate hike odds spike across the board after Fed minutes Shares on Wall Street have erased all their gains after the Fed minutes revealed that a June rate hike is certainly possible. And the dollar is soaring... hitting a nine-week high against the Swiss franc and a three-week high against the yen. Breaking: Policymakers on the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy-setting committee are leaning towards raising interest rates at their next meeting in June. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the top line from the minutes of last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, which just hit the wires. They show that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153most\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd policymakers judge that a June rate hike would be appropriate, if data suggest that the US economy is recovering this quarter after its winter slowdown. And some Fed officials are concerned that the markets aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready for a June hike -- that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true, given many investors only expect one hike in 2016. This is the key quote from the minutes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Most participants judged that if incoming data were consistent with economic growth picking up in the second quarter, labor markets continued to strengthen, and inflation making progress toward the committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2 percent objective, then it likely would be appropriate for the committee to increase the target range for the federal funds rate in June.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, the minutes also show that the Fed is concerned that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum could spook the financial markets next month. Nearly time for the final event of the day....the minutes of the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s April monetary policy meeting. Paul La Monica of CNN hopes we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get too carried away... Another mixed day for stock markets, with the FTSE 100 hit by falling commodity stocks in the wake of the strong dollar but a rebound in banks providing support elsewhere. And even the FTSE 100 managed to end virtually unchanged on the day. Tony Cross, markets analyst at Trustnet Direct said: It seems fair to say that today could have been a whole lot worse for equity markets and by all accounts that shock IPSOS/MORI poll on the referendum does seem to have played at least some part in helping ensure the FTSE-100 rounds the day out broadly unchanged. It paints a picture that the remain campaign is quite literally a country mile ahead and whilst the stronger pound has done little to help commodity stocks, many other sectors seem to be finding some solid support off the back of this shift in sentiment. So the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished virtually flat, down 1.97 points or 0.03% at 6165.80 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax added 0.54% to 9943.23 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac climbed 0.51% to 4319.30 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB rose 1.23% to 17,713.62 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.88% at 8775.1 In Greece, the Athen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market added 0.31% to 628.29 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currentlyi up 33 points or 0.19%. Meanwhile oil prices have shaken off their earlier dip following a surprise rise in US crude stocks. Brent is now up 0.65% at $49.60 a barrel. More on the Fed: There has been much talk about when the US Federal Reserve would raise interest rates again after December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hike, and the minutes of last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed meeting which will be released later could give further clues. On Tuesday two - albeit non-voting - members said the June meeting was a live one, and two to three rate increases could be expected this year. Along with stronger than expected US data, this seemed to put a June rise firmly on the table. Not everyone agrees, however, with Joseph Lake, US analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, suggesting there will be no move until at least September: All eyes today are on the release of the minutes of the April FOMC meeting, which will give markets an indication of the future direction of interest rates, and the likelihood of a Fed rate rise in June. This will influence the future direction of the US dollar, and have a large bearing on whether commodity prices can sustain their recent rally. Politics will play a key role in when the Fed decides to increase the policy rate. The next FOMC meeting is on June 14-15, just one week before the UK votes on whether it will leave or remain in the European Union. Although the EIU expects the UK to vote to remain in the EU, polls are close and the vote will be tight. This will weigh on financial markets and factor in to the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision. It would be risky to lift US interest rates just one week before a UK poll which could have wide ranging consequences for the global economy. Had the domestic economic data been overwhelmingly positive in the past two months, the Fed would probably have moved in June. However, while economic data has been positive, it has not been overwhelmingly so and, combined with the Brexit vote, this will be enough to persuade the Fed to delay the next rate increase. It is unlikely to move at the following FOMC meeting, in July, as it is not accompanied by a press conference. Although the Fed insists that all meetings are live, given the very gradual nature of this tightening cycle, and the importance of clear communication, the Fed will probably skip July, leaving the following FOMC meeting in September as the most likely date of the next policy rate increase. Thereafter, politics will once again enter the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s calculations, but this time it will be domestic matters. The lead up to the November presidential and congressional elections will increase investor uncertainty, and raise volatility in financial markets. Although we think the domestic economic prospects for the second half of 2016 are bright, the uncertainty generated by politics will deter the FOMC from tightening policy at the November meeting, leaving the FOMC gathering in mid-December as the last chance to increase the policy rate for a second time in 2016. A quick look at what is expected at this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s G7 finance ministers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 meeting in Japan, from Capital Economics. In sum, not much: This weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s G7 finance ministers meeting in Sendai, Japan, is likely to focus on exchange rate and fiscal policy and to end with another warning about the dangers of Brexit. However, no major policy announcements are on the cards. In more detail: The hosts, Japan, will be looking for support for the view that currency intervention can be a legitimate policy option in some circumstances. After all, the appreciation of the yen, of 10% so far this year, has been much bigger than that of the euro (and has had a major impact on corporate earnings. And Japanese officials have hinted recently that they may intervene to push the yen down...US officials are not likely to criticise the euro-zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s or Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exchange rate policy too heavily at this weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting because neither the ECB nor the Bank of Japan has been intervening to weaken their currencies. Indeed, the US is more concerned about China, which is of course not a G7 member, though the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank has been selling foreign currency over the past year in order to prop the renminbi up, rather than trying to gain competitive advantage. All in all, it seems highly likely that the G7 will stick to its established formula on exchange rate policy. The key elements are a commitment to market-determined exchange rates and to using fiscal and monetary policies to achieve domestic objectives. Finance ministers will also discuss fiscal policy, with Germany likely to be singled out for criticism once again. But the Japanese government is unlikely to push for a coordinated statement in favour of fiscal stimulus given implacable opposition from Germany itself. Moreover, Japan is not in a good position to argue for a coordinated fiscal stimulus: under current plans, its fiscal policy will be tightened more than that of any other G7 economy apart from the UK during 2016-2020. Finally, the G7 will surely issue yet another warning about the dangers posed by Brexit. With only five weeks to go until the referendum, getting this in any formal communique\u00cc\ufffd will be the only significant objective of the UK government. But this would surely do little to change anybody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view on the merits of Brexit. Oil is still in negative territory following the US inventory figures, but it is not seeing a major slide, with Brent crude down just 0.2% at $49.17 a barrel. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index, said: Crude oil dropped in the immediate aftermath of the latest official US oil inventories report from the EIA as traders responded to the headline build of 1.3m barrels. Clearly this wrong-footed many speculators who had expected to see another drawdown following last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 3.41m barrel decrease in US oil stocks. This is the second time in as many weeks that the API has got it completely wrong. [The American Petroleum Institute earlier this week reported a 1.1m barrel drop in US crude oil supplies.] But the other aspects of the oil report were not too bad at all. For a start, oil production fell once again. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, there were larger-than-expected draws in distillates and \u00e2\u20ac\u201c more importantly for this time of the year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c gasoline stocks as refineries processed more crude now that the driving season is underway. Hence, [US benchmark] oil has not exactly fallen off a cliff (yet). Back with the latest shareholder spring, and nearly 32% of the votes cast at Paddy Power Betfair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual meeting were against the approval of the remuneration report. Unsurprisingly, oil prices have fallen on the US inventory news. Brent crude, having touched $49.54 a barrel earlier, is now down 0.3% at $49.13. Reuters has the report on the US data: U.S. crude stocks rose unexpectedly last week even as gasoline and distillate inventories fell more than expected, data from the Energy Information Administration showed on Wednesday. Crude inventories rose by 1.3 million barrels in the week to May 13, compared with analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations for an decrease of 2.8 million barrels. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub rose by 461,000 barrels, hitting a fresh record high, the data showed. Refinery crude runs rose by 192,000 barrels per day, EIA data showed. Refinery utilization rates rose by 1.4 percentage points. Gasoline stocks fell by 2.5 million barrels, compared with analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations in a Reuters poll for a 150,000-barrel drop. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, fell by 3.2 million barrels, versus expectations for a 642,000-barrel drop, the EIA data showed. U.S. crude imports rose last week by 22,000 barrels per day. US crude stocks have unexpectedly risen compared to expectations of a weekly decline. According to the Energy Information Administration, crude stocks rose by 1.3m barrels to 541.29m compared to forecasts of a 2.8m draw. US oil inventory data is due shortly and the crude price is steadying ahead of the news, given the recent supply problems including the Canadian wildfires. Brent is currently up 0.3% at $49.45 a barrel having earlier fallen as low as $48.88. The US stock market has opened in the red, as Wall Street continues to ponder the possibility of a hike in interest rates. Hawkish comments from some Federal Reserve policymakers yesterday, plus strong inflation data, have reignited talk about higher borrowing costs. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get a better clue at 7pm tonight (2pm Washington time), when the minutes of last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed meeting are released. In the meantime, the Dow has lost 30 points or 0.2% to 17,499, extending yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Lucy Meakin has shown how the pound has jumped against all major currencies today, as Brexit fears suddenly ease..... Money is continuing to pour into sterling, after the latest EU referendum poll gave the Remain side a shock 18 point lead. Investors are reacting to the news that 55% of those polled want to stay in the EU, while 37% want so leave, according to IPSOS MORI. The pound has now surged by 1.2 cents against the US dollar to $1.459, up from $1.446 overnight. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a two-week high. Sterling has also jumped by 1.5 eurocents against the single currency, to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.2935 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a 10-week high. And the pound is also surging against the Japanese yen and the Australian dollar, sending it to a three-month high against a basket of currencies. Investors are clearly calculating that this poll is a turning point in the EU campaign, and suggests Britain will decide against Brexiting the EU. However, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only one poll \u00e2\u20ac\u201c others have suggested that the race is tighter, especially as Leave voters are more likely to actually vote.... Indeed, Gideon Skinner, head of political research at Ipsos MORI, told the Evening Standard that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Remain has been boosted by a Conservative swing, but they are also more likely to change their mind, so in this volatile election, with voters divided over the short and long-term impacts of their decision, nothing can be taken for granted.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The test manipulation scandal that is gripping the automobile industry has claimed another casualty. The president of Mitsubishi Motors, Tetsuro Aikawa, has resigned today, four weeks after the company admitted it had falsified fuel efficiency reports for decades. Mitsubishi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mistake was not to adjust its testing to reflect new rules introduced in 1991 to better reflect stop-start urban driving. Aikawa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure \u00e2\u20ac\u201c marked with a traditional Japanese bow \u00e2\u20ac\u201c came hours after rival carmaker Suzuki revealed that it had also used improper methods to test the fuel economy of its vehicles. Shares in Suzuki plunged by 10%. By delaying sanctions against Spain today, the EC could be preparing the ground to rebuke the next Spanish government (if they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comply with Brussels\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 demands)... Speaking of Europe...Spain and Portugal have just been given more time to get their finances into order. The European Commission had been expected to get tough with both countries for running deficits over the 3% target mandated by Brussels. It could even have imposed its first ever fines against a member state. But with political tensions high in both countries, and the Brexit vote threatening to destabilise Europe, eurocrats have taken a softly-softly approach. Spain, which is holding a general election in June, has now been given until the end of the year to cut its deficit. Portugal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deadline for fixing its public finances will be extended to 2017 - a boost for its new socialist government. Commissioner Pierre Moscovici has admitted that political concerns played a factor: The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mehreen Khan explains why: The delay will be a source of relief for Madrid, where voters will be heading to the polls in a second general election in just seven months. Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s incumbent prime minister Mariano Rajoy was defiant ahead of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s showdown with Brussels, promising to implement a fresh round of tax cuts should he be re-elected in the summer.... More here: Breaking away from the jobs report, the pound has jumped after a new opinion poll showed a big lead for the campaign to Remain in the EU. IPSOS MORI reports that 55% of the public are planning to vote to stay in Europe in June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum, with just 37% backing Brexit. The poll also found that the public haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t swallowed some of the more alarmist claims from the two sides. That includes the prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that Brexit would raise the risk of another World War..... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the story. Josh Hardie, CBI Deputy Director-General, reckons that George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnational living wage\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is starting to hit the labour market: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s encouraging that employment has risen there are some signs of a softening in the labour market, particularly with job vacancies falling back. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, continued uncertainty could be weighing on hiring intentions. In addition we are seeing evidence that employers are considering the impact of the National Living Wage, introduced last month.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The NLW means that all workers aged 25 and over are now legally entitled to at least \u00c2\u00a37.20 per hour, which will rise to \u00c2\u00a39 per hour by 2020. The Department for Work and Pensions have riffled through their old collection of vinyl to give today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report some musical context: (Disappointing lack of Stone Roses, but otherwise pretty neat) John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, has sent over a handy summary of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data confirms that the great UK job creating machine slowed somewhat in the first quarter of this year, with unemployment flattening off at pre-crisis levels and average earnings growth remaining relatively muted at around 2%. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The employment rate is still rising, however, reaching record levels of 74.2% in the first quarter, fuelled in part by more women in the 60-64 age group working as the state pension age rises. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Continued strong inflows of workers from other EU countries has also been important, accounting for over half of the net rise in UK employment over the past year. This has helped the economy to grow steadily over this period without sparking inflationary wage pressures. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The relative cooling of the jobs market in the first quarter may in part reflect worries about the global economy, which reached a peak in January and early February, and in part uncertainty related to the EU referendum outcome, particularly from mid-February onwards once the timetable for this became clear. If these uncertainties abate after the vote on 23rd June, we may see both jobs and earnings growth pick up in the second half of the year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound has dipped a little this morning, despite Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment rate hitting a record high. Andy Scott, economist at HiFX, says traders are concerned that March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claimant count was revised high this morning, to show the biggest jump since autumn 2011. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures continue to show that the UK economy has lost momentum with the claimant count rising by almost 15,000 in March \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the biggest increase for over four years. There was some positive news on average earnings including bonuses which rose unexpectedly, but even if you strip out some potential impact from Brexit concerns, underlying growth has weakened. Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, is concerned that wage growth has dipped. It could be a worrying signal.... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The jobs market has been a standout success for the UK economy in recent years, delivering record levels of employment and one of the lowest jobless rates in Europe. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But the momentum of job creation has eased in recent months and we still haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen lift-off for wages. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Indeed, real wage growth has slowed in the last year, a development that represents a real risk to the consumer-led recovery.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ian Brinkley, chief economic advisor at Lancaster University\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Work Foundation, flags up that young people are continuing to get a rough deal: For the first time in many quarters, there was no rise in permanent jobs. All of the increase was for the self-employed and temporary employee workers. With weak hiring it is the young, as usual, who lose out. Overall unemployment remained unchanged at 5.1% but unemployment among 18 to 24 year olds went up from 12% to 12.2%. Brinkley also thinks it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unlikely\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that the EU referendum is hurting the labour market. Worsening world trade conditions pushing some export based sectors such as manufacturing into recession and increased costs from the introduction of the National Living Wage are more immediate explanations for employers being more cautious about new hires.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd If you adjust for inflation, then average earnings have fallen from their recent peak: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the main charts points from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour force report: Some fascinating historical context from Royal Bank of Scotland: Digging into today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report, its clear that the employment rate has hit a record high partly because more women are working longer. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because of changes to the retirement age, pushing it up to 65 for men and women by November 2018, and then 66 by October 2020 (more details here) The ONS explains: 79.3% of men and 69.2% of women aged from 16 to 64 were in work the employment rate for men (79.3%) was the highest since January to March 2005 the employment rate for women (69.2%) was the highest since comparable records began in 1971, partly due to ongoing changes to the state pension age for women resulting in fewer women retiring between the ages of 60 and 65 It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also possible that more older people of both gender are having to work longer, of course, for economic reasons, but that isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spelled out in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report. Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb has welcomed this latest rise in the employment total, and the small drop in unemployment: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These are another record-breaking set of figures, with more people in work than ever before and the unemployment rate is the lowest in a decade at 5.1%. More people in work means that more families across the UK are benefiting from the security of a regular wage and the fulfilment that employment brings. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But the job is not done, which is why our welfare reforms, such as Universal Credit, are making sure that it always pays to be in work.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Real wages continues to grow in the last quarter, the Office for National Statistics reports. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a mixed picture. Average weekly earnings for employees in Great Britain increased by 2.0% in January-March, up from 1.9% in October-December. But if you strip out bonuses, pay rose by 2.1%, down from 2.2% the previous quarter. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report also shows that the number of people out of work dipped by 2,000 in the last quarter, to around 1.69m. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 139,000 fewer than for a year earlier. Breaking: The proportion of people in work across the UK has hit a new record high. The latest labour market report, just released, shows that the employment rate has hit 74.2%, the highest since comparable records began in 1971. The total number of people in work has risen again, by 44,000 in the last three months, to 31.567 million. Here are other key points from the report, just released: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate remains unchanged at 5.1% in the January-March quarter. Surprisingly, the claimant count (the number of people receiving unemployment benefit) has fallen in April, to 738,000. But March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claimant count has been revised up, to show a gain of 14,700 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the biggest monthly rise since September 2011. More to follow.... A new report has warned that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153years behind schedule\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in its bid to halve the employment gap between disabled and non-disabled people. According to the TUC union, the target may not be hit until 2030 - a whole decade later than planned. The Daily Mirror explains: Tory promises to halve the unemployment gap of disabled workers will be missed by a shameful 10 years, research shows. The election manfesto pledge is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153years behind schedule\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at current rates of progress, according to a TUC study. Ministers had promised to reach the milestone of halving the employment gap between disabled and other workers by 2020. That would see nearly two-thirds (63%) of disabled people in work by the end of the decade, but the government is on target to miss the target by 11% with just over half (52%) in work. More here: The US dollar has hit a three-week high against the euro, on that renewed talk of an American interest rate hike. This has pushed the euro down to $1.1265, from $1.1311 last night. A weaker euro will be welcomed by the European Central Bank, as it should help exporters and raise inflation. Fashion chain Burberry is under pressure again this morning after it issued yet another downbeat report to the City. Burberry posted a 10% drop in profits for the last financial year, and warned that earnings in the current financial year will be at the bottom of analyst expectations. Shares have slumped by 4%, making it the worst performer on the FTSE 100. The company has been hit by slowing demand in key markets such as China and Hong Kong, where consumer have been cutting back. It tells shareholders that: Burberry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance [last year] reflected a difficult period for the luxury sector as a whole as demand slowed in many markets for both cyclical and structural reasons. Burberry is now launching a three year plan aimed at raising revenues, improving productivity and deliver at least \u00c2\u00a3100m of cost savings. And CEO Chris Bailey warns that he expects \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the challenging environment for the luxury sector to continue in the near term\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. More here: World stock markets are sliding this morning as investors begin to worry that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank might raise interest rates again soon. The FTSE 100 has shed 40 points, down 0.7%, to 6125, which erases all yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains. Other European markets are down too, following a selloff on Wall Street last night. The selloff is being driven by speculation that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank could be closer than thought to raising borrowing costs again, possibly in June. Yesterday Dennis Lockhart, the head of the Atlanta Fed, told reporters he still expects two or three rate hikes before the end of the year. Investors had expected fewer \u00e2\u20ac\u201c quite possibly none \u00e2\u20ac\u201c due to signs of economic slowdown, particularly in an election year. But yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprisingly strong US inflation data, which showed core inflation above 2.1%, is causing some rethinking.... Overnight, Japan made a rather spectacular escape from recession. New growth figures showed that the Japanese economy expanded at an annual rate of 1.7% in the last three months (meaning it grew by over 0.4% during the quarter). Economists had only expected growth of 0.3% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but Japan surprised them with unexpectedly strong consumer spending. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story: Now the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, must decide whether to press on with a sales tax that could hurt growth but improve the battered Japanese public finances.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The resilience of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market has been one of the more remarkable aspects of the aftermath of the financial crisis. Despite the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s austerity crackdown, the jobless rate has fallen steadily from 8.4% in autumn 2011 to just 5.1% at the start of 2016. But last month, the unemployment total jumped by a worrying 21,000 while wage growth stalled. And new figures released at 9.30am will show whether this trend is continuing. Economists expect earnings growth (including bonuses) to have slipped again, from 1.8% to 1.7%. The employment total, which has regularly hit record highs, could possibly have bottomed out. And the number of people signing on for unemployment benefit is tipped to have risen by 4,500, on top of a 6,700 jump last month. That might show that jitters over the EU referendum are hitting the labour market, but may also reflect the fact that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth appears to be slowing. If the numbers are bad, we can probably expect the government to warn about the dangers of Brexit. And if the numbers are good, we can also probably expect the government to warn about the dangers of Brexit. Also coming up today.... The European Commission is announcing its latest review of national budget policies around 11am BST (I think). This may include penalties against countries who have failed to hit fiscal targets, such as Spain and Portugal.... We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also getting results from luxury fashion chain Burberry, beermaker SAB Miller and energy firm SSE. And late tonight (7pm BST), the minutes of the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most recent meeting are released. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite timely, after US inflation jumped yesterday - putting talk of another rate hike back on the agenda....",

Following Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more hawkish than expected Fed minutes, a number of the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key figures have lined up to suggest the June meeting is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153live\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in terms of a possible rate hike.</p> <p>Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Anxiety is setting in for financial markets, as the proposition of another rate hike from the Fed draws the bears out once more. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US open has seen the Dow crash to a two month low, bringing the FTSE down with it as rate sensitive banks benefit at the expense of the wider market. The US dollar strength continues to be a running theme, as energy, metal and materials producers suffer at the hands of a yet another sea of red for the sector.</p> <p>Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed minutes provided the latest clue that perhaps a June rate hike may not be such a crazy idea, with the markets now factoring in a 32% chance of action. This shift from 4% on Monday to 32% today goes a long way to explain the substantial rise in the US dollar this week. With a hawkish Fed and a three year high in US CPI, the potential implications of a strong jobs report in June is starting to click in the minds of investors.</p> </blockquote> <p>With the dollar rising on the interest rate outlook, commodity prices fell back, including copper hitting a three month low and Brent crude losing 1% to $48.33. So mining companies were among the leading fallers, as were travel companies in the wake of a disappointing update from Thomas Cook and the disappearance of a flight from Paris to Cairo. But banks benefited from hopes that any US rate rise would support their balance sheets. The final scores showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 fell 112.45 points or 1.82% to 6053.35, its biggest one day percentage fall since early February</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.48% to 9795.89</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.85% at 4282.54</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.95% to 17,545.56</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 1.14% lower at 8674.7</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market fell 0.96% to 622.28</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 140 points or 0.8%.</p> <p><em>On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening.

                "bodyText":"The increasing fear that the US Federal Reserve could raise interest rates next month, earlier than expected, has sent global markets tumbling. Following Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more hawkish than expected Fed minutes, a number of the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key figures have lined up to suggest the June meeting is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153live\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in terms of a possible rate hike. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Anxiety is setting in for financial markets, as the proposition of another rate hike from the Fed draws the bears out once more. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US open has seen the Dow crash to a two month low, bringing the FTSE down with it as rate sensitive banks benefit at the expense of the wider market. The US dollar strength continues to be a running theme, as energy, metal and materials producers suffer at the hands of a yet another sea of red for the sector. Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed minutes provided the latest clue that perhaps a June rate hike may not be such a crazy idea, with the markets now factoring in a 32% chance of action. This shift from 4% on Monday to 32% today goes a long way to explain the substantial rise in the US dollar this week. With a hawkish Fed and a three year high in US CPI, the potential implications of a strong jobs report in June is starting to click in the minds of investors. With the dollar rising on the interest rate outlook, commodity prices fell back, including copper hitting a three month low and Brent crude losing 1% to $48.33. So mining companies were among the leading fallers, as were travel companies in the wake of a disappointing update from Thomas Cook and the disappearance of a flight from Paris to Cairo. But banks benefited from hopes that any US rate rise would support their balance sheets. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 112.45 points or 1.82% to 6053.35, its biggest one day percentage fall since early February Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.48% to 9795.89 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.85% at 4282.54 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.95% to 17,545.56 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 1.14% lower at 8674.7 In Greece, the Athens market fell 0.96% to 622.28 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 140 points or 0.8%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. If the US Federal Reserve is considering raising interest rates, then the Bank of England may be heading in the opposite direction. Katie Allen reports: A top Bank of England policymaker has warned that even if Britain votes to stay in the EU, underlying weakness in the economy could require more support from the central bank. Jan Vlieghe, one of the nine policymakers who vote on interest rates, has previously floated the idea of them being cut below zero. Speaking on Thursday, he again raised the prospect of rates coming down further from their record low of 0.5%, when he said the economy could require \u00e2\u20ac\u0153additional monetary stimulus\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if it does not rebound after a remain vote in the EU referendum on 23 June. Helena also reports that Handelsblatt, the German financial daily, says lenders may agree to give Greece a much large tranche of bailout aid once the reform package is passed than earlier thought. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Instead of the scheduled \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5.7bn, the ailing country could receive \u00e2\u201a\u00ac9bn to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac11bn.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That would be enough to keep it solvent until the end of the year - both delaying another potentially explosive financial review and allowing lenders to sort out their own differences over how to deal with Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staggering \u00e2\u201a\u00ac321bn debt load But while politically expedient, senior Athens-based EU diplomats also admit that it does not resolve the underlying problem of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic fundamentals simply not adding up. More from Athens where a war of words has broken out on the first day of debate over the controversial omnibus bill the government has brought to parliament outlining the latest reforms the country must take. Helena Smith reports: At 7,500 pages the omnibus bill was never going to be passed lightly. And MPs, faced with the daunting task of reading it, have ensured that debate has got off to a tumultuous start. Highlighting the explosive mood, the former prime minister Antonis Samaras accused the leftist-led government of legislating practically everything it had ever denounced. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is increasing Enfia [property tax] that it said it would abolish \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and heating oil which we reduced,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said the ex-conservative leader listing the various levies his successor Alexis Tsipras has agreed to raise in return for further bailout funds. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And the worst thing: we brought results. Now they [creditors] don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe [Athens] will bring results. And that is why they are imposing an automatic fiscal brake,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he added referring to the mechanism that will trigger automatic across-the-board cuts in the event of Greek finances veering off course. Since being replaced by Tsipras in January 2015, Samaras has made few public interventions. In a caustic statement released in the last ten minutes, Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 office said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Samaras should speak publicly more often so that citizens can remember his time in power when the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP was destroyed [fell] by 25 %.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Opposition parties are describing the fiscal break as amounting to the enforcement of a fourth bailout for a populace already hit by runaway unemployment and poverty. On the eve of the debate beginning, the finance ministry announced that the mechanism would not be included in the omnibus bill but would be tabled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as an amendment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at a later date. Insiders admit they cannot agree with lenders over the cuts that will be made should it be activated next year. And, given the falls seen in stock markets since Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more hawkish than expected Federal Reserve minutes: Back with the Fed, and New York Fed president William Dudley has added more comments about possible rate rises. He has echoed the comments elsewhere that June is a live meeting, and that the Fed believes markets were underestimating the probability of a rate rise. He said a June or July move was a reasonable expectation, if his forecasts for the way the US economy is going appear on track. But again, he added that the risk of the UK leaving the EU was one that needed to be considered, and the probability of Brexit will influence the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision. Over to Greece, and the International Monetary Fund has said debt relief negotiations for the country need to focus on extended maturity periods and very low interest rates. The IMF reportedly wanted a halt to Greek debt repayments until 2040, but spokesman Gerry Rice would not confirm this in his regular news briefing. But he said (quote from Reuters): We have exchanged preliminary views with our partners on general principles regarding debt relief. We believe that it is possible to restore debt sustainability without upfront haircuts, although this would involve providing very concessional loan terms, including long grace and maturity periods and very low interest rates. The Greek parliament is due to vote on the latest series of reform measures over the weekend, ahead of the latest Eurogroup meeting next Tuesday. New York Federal Reserve president William Dudley has repeated that interest rate changes are very much dependent on the economic data at the time. In a speech confirming the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s desire to help households and businesses understand how the economy is progressing and how that helps determine the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisions, he said: When asked about the trajectory for the monetary policy stance, I always point out that it is data dependent. The Federal Open Market Committee calibrates the stance of monetary policy to best achieve our twin objectives of price stability and maximum sustainable employment, taking into account our forecast for how the economy is evolving. This forecast reflects the ongoing flow of the data. Data releases that are close to our expectations have little additional impact on the forecast, while data releases that deviate significantly from our expectations can lead to more significant revisions of the forecast. It is, therefore, important for market participants and households to be able to follow the data along with the FOMC and to understand how we are likely to interpret and react to incoming data. The market fall is accelerating as Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses increase, following the suggestion from the US Federal Reserve minutes that a June rate rise could be on the cards. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down 159 points or 0.9%, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has dropped 1.2% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has fallen 0.58%. In the UK the FTSE 100 is 110 points lower at 6055, a fall of 1.7%. The prospect of a US rate hike as early as June has helped push American markets lower at the start of trading. With the oil price also falling - West Texas Intermediate is down around 2% at $47.15 a barrel - the Dow Jones Industrial Average has slipped 51 points or 0.32%. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq both opened around 0.4% lower. Another Fed speaker, in the form of vice chairman Stanley Fischer, but there appear to be few clues to the next rate hike in his comments. In a speech - entitled (Money), Interest and Prices: Patinkin and Woodford - at an economics conference in New York, he said: Faster trend growth would increase the long-run equilibrium interest rate, and what we need most, now that we are near full employment and approaching our target inflation rate, is faster potential growth. [The equilibrium rate is the level of borrowing costs associated with stable inflation and full employment, according to Reuters]. New York Federal Reserve president William Dudley is due to speak in an hour or so. There is a strong case for the US to raise interest rates in June, but there might be grounds to wait until July after the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum, according to Richmond Federal Reserve president Jeffery Lacker. Lacker, a notable hawk but non-voting member at the moment, told Bloomberg Radio that a vote for the UK to leave the EU posed risks to the UK and Europe and could spill over to the US. He said the markets took the wrong signal from the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to leave rates on hold at its last two meetings, overestimating how likely it was to leave rates unchanged in future. Lacker said he was comfortable with four rate rises this year, and had supported an increase at April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. Meanwhile, there are only tenuous signs of growth according to the latest Philadephia Federal Reserve survey. The current business conditions index came in at -1.8 in May compared to -1.6 in the previous month, and the consensus of +3.5. The Fed said: Firms responding to the Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey continued to report tenuous growth this month. The indicator for general activity was essentially unchanged in May and remained slightly negative. Other broad indicators also reflected general weakness in business conditions. The indicator for employment improved but remained negative. Manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 forecasts of future activity tempered slightly from last month, overall, but continue to suggest confidence in future growth. It concluded: The survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s indicators for general activity, new orders, shipments, and employment all remained negative. Though indicators for future conditions fell from last month, expectations for future growth continue to be positive. Here are the weekly jobless claims: Another sign of the strength of the US economy - and therefore another sign that the Federal Reserve may want to raise interest rates next month - has come from the weekly jobless claims. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefit fell by 16,000 to 278,000 last week, although analysts had been expecting a decline to 275,000. Still, the weekly rate has been below 300,000 for 63 weeks in a row, a sign of the strong jobs market. The previous week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claims had been at a 14 month high. Commenting on the minutes, economist Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight said: The account of the 20-21 April policy meeting reinforces belief that the ECB is firmly in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wait and see mode\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd following March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s delivery of a major package of stimulative measures. However, the minutes do indicate that the ECB is prepared to eventually act again if deemed necessary. The account also brings out the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s determination to strongly defend itself from recent intensified German criticism over its highly expansionary policy. The European Central Bank has followed the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead, and just released the minutes of its own April meeting. But rather than hint at rate hikes, the ECB is firing a warning shot at some of its critics, particularly in Germany. The minutes state: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There was general agreement that there was a need to counter the perception that monetary policy could no longer contribute to a return of inflation (to the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target).\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In light of recent public criticism...in a Member State, it was viewed as important to reaffirm collectively the independence of the ECB in the pursuit of its mandate.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That independence looked under threat last month, when German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble blamed the ECB for fuelling the popularity of the anti-immigrant, eurosceptic Alternative for Deutschland party. ECB chief Mario Draghi, though, slapped down such criticism at his April press conference -- pointing out that undermining the ECB simply hampered its ability to drag Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy forwards. The minutes also show that the ECB is in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwait and see\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 mode, having announced new stimulus measures in March. It cautions that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153patience was needed for the measures to fully unfold over time in terms of output and inflation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. And the governing council also urged Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s politicians to do more, saying they: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strongly reiterated the need for other policy areas to contribute much more decisively.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The minutes are online here. The old advice to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsell in May and go away\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 worked quite well in 2015 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if you timed your entry back into the market right. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exactly a year since the Dow Jones hits its record high - closing at 18,312 points. It then suffered quite a dive in August, due to worries over China. And although it then recovered, it then suffered another selloff around new year before reviving again.... Last night it closed at 17,526, 4% lower than a year ago: Over in Frankfurt, ECB chief Mario Draghi will be breaking out the best Prosecco. The euro has just hit a seven week low against the US dollar, as the greenback continues to benefit from the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hawkishness. A weaker euro should help to drag Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate away from zero, and help exporters too.... Oh dear.... Asda, Wal-Mart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK operation, has endured another shocking few months. Like-for-like sales across Asda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stores slumped by 5.7% in the first quarter of 2016. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only slightly better than the 5.8% drop in the final quarter of 2015. Clearly the price-wars and heavy competition in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supermarkets isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t letting up... Shares in supermarket giant Wal-Mart just jumped by 5% in pre-market trading, after it released better-than-expected results. Wal-Mart posted earnings of $0.98 per share, compared to estimate of $0.88 per share. Revenues also beat forecasts: Wall Street is expected to join the selloff when it opens at 2.30pm BST (9.30am East Coast time) The Dow Jones is currently being called down 71 points, or around 0.4%, at 17454. But there is some US data due in the next coouple of hours to maybe shift the mood. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explains: Whilst Europe has seen a nasty US rate-hike chatter-inspired decline this morning (the DAX and CAC joining the FTSE with 1.5% and 0.9% plunges respectively), the Dow futures aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite as calamitous just yet. It looks like the US index will open just shy of half a percent lower after the bell, but with Philly Fed manufacturing index and jobless claims figures to come before the session begins. There are also speeches this afternoon from Fed vice-chair William Dudley and FOMC member Stanley Fischer, with investors likely keen to hear their take on the chances of a June rate-hike. Despite the hawkish tone of last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minutes, most economists don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next month. Derivatives traders are now pricing in a 32% probability that the Fed hikes rates at its June 14-15 meeting. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from 4% last week. Some analysts believe the Fed will be reluctant to move, just a week before the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum. Policymakers may also want to hold off until they receive growth figures for the second quarter of 2016, in July. The team at RBC Capital Markets believe the Fed is signalling its ability to hike, rather than actually setting the scene for action in June. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some more views: After three hours of trading, the FTSE 100 is in full-blown retreat - down almost 90 points or 1.4% at 6079. Mining stocks continue to lead the fallers, with Fresnillo, Anglo American and BHP Billiton all down around 5%. Royal Dutch Shell has shed 4.5%, due to the oil price dropping back to $47.70 per barrel today. And Royal Mail have dropped 4%, after reporting a 33% drop in pre-tax profits in a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcchallenging\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 market. Chris Beauchamp, Senior Market Analyst at IG, blames \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a hawkish set of Fed minutes and poor results from a number of firms\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. The Fed has put the market on notice for June, and for the moment the market doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like it. Equities have sold off heavily this morning as investors scramble to reallocate funds towards those areas likely to benefit from rising rates in the US \u00e2\u20ac\u201c namely the US dollar, Treasuries and also US bank stocks. As a result, the rug has been pulled from underneath European markets, with the news of the EgyptAir tragedy having an impact on airline and travel names. The battle over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum has switched to that dinner party favourite - house prices. Moodys, the rating agency, has predicted this morning that first-time homebuyers in the UK would benefit from a vote to leave the EU. They argue that prices would fall following a Brexit vote, and there could also be less competition for housing. Buy-to-let landlords could also suffer from lower demand, particularly in London if the capital became less attractive to citizens from overseas. The National Association of Estate Agents also believes that house prices would be hit by a Brexit vote. It reckons homeowners in London could lose as much as \u00c2\u00a37,500, while homes elsewhere in the UK could lose \u00c2\u00a32,300. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, says the rise in UK consumer spending last month is reassuring: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe UK economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s glass was beginning to look decidedly half-empty, so today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales figures are a welcome tonic to the gloomy economic mood. Diminishing confidence ahead of the EU referendum and weak pay growth were expected to take a toll on retail sales. Indeed market researcher GfK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer sentiment indicator hit a 15-month low in April, which looked ominous for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures, but in the event fears that the referendum would have a negative impact on consumer spending proved unfounded. The pound has hit a three and a half-month high against the euro. Sterling has hit \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.305, up from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.301 last night, thanks to those strong retail sales figures. Here come the latest UK retail sales figures....and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve smashed forecasts! The amount of stuff bought in the shops last month jumped by 4.3% compared with a year earlier, the Office for National Statistics reports. Sales volumes were also 1.3% higher than a month earlier. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no sign of pre-Brexit jitters here. Instead, shoppers may have been spurred into action by the fact that average shop prices have fallen by 2.8% over the last year. Sales of most items jumped, but there was a 6.3% drop in clothing turnover. That may be due to cold weather in April, which put people off from buying summer garments. Melanie Richard, ONS Head of Retail Sales, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Clothing stores remain the main drag on growth in the retail sector, with sales hampered by unseasonal weather. However, both the volume and value of sales increased in April compared with March as lower prices boosted sales. The selloff is gathering pace across Europe, with the main indices all losing ground this morning: Tom Floyd, Senior Sales Trader at Foenix Partner, says investors are taking last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed minute seriously: With multiple Fed speakers in recent days failing to convince markets of the possibility of June hikes, yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Minutes seem to have finally done the trick. The Minutes showed Fed members would deem a June hike as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153appropriate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd so long as economic data continued to improve. With inflation data trending towards target and improving labour market conditions, the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remaining issue was convincing markets a rise was a likely scenario. The first Harry Potter readers have long since left the classroom for the world of adult mugglehood. But Hogwart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finest continues to work his charms for UK publishers, Bloomsbury. They have reported a 5% jump in revenues for the last year, thanks to a 133% surge in sales of Harry Potter books. That includes a new illustrated version of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Stone\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which apparently went down terribly well. Bloomsbury say: Reviews were consistently good with the Telegraph saying the book was: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a triumph - a book so alive it seems to jump, explode and slither out of your hands as you read.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We sold rights in Jim Kay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s illustrations in 28 languages. Our re-jacketed Jonny Duddle editions of the seven Harry Potter novels continued to perform strongly in all territories. An illustrated version of the Chamber of Secrets is coming soon, along with new content from J. K. Rowling for the new edition of Fantastic Beasts &amp; Where to Find Them. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a case of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Revenues leviosa!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, say those wizards at fastFT.... Peter Fankhauser, chief executive of Thomas Cook, is also calling for a shake-up in the school holiday system to help parents get cheaper holidays. He tells reporters that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153UK authorities should look across the pond to Germany and Switzerland where they agree a staggered start of school holiday dates. That relieves some of the pressure. If you had an agreement from local authorities in the UK to spread the dates... that would help us as well, it would help everybody.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fankhauser said Thomas Cook was doing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153everything we can\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to make holidays more affordable for families who face huge hikes in prices during the school holidays. To get the best deal: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153you have to start early in the cycle\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he said. Last week, a UK parent won a landmark case in the High Court against his local authority, after he took his daughter away on holiday during term time. The ruling appeared to give the green light for parents to take their children out of state schools without permission so long as they have a good record of attendance. The government, though, quickly vowed to close this new loophole.... Shares in Thomas Cook have fallen by 15% to a three-year low, after it reported a 5% drop in summer bookings. The holiday company warned this morning that underlying profits will hit the bottom of analyst expectations. It reported that tourists are shunning Turkey, where a suicide bomber killed 10 Germans in an Istanbul square in January. Turkey had been Thomas Cook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second most popular destination last year; in 2016, though, more tourists are choosing the Balearics (up 14%), Canaries (up 23%) and and USA (up 29%). Thomas Cook says: Demand for Turkey - our second largest market last year - remains significantly below last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s levels. This has impacted our German Airlines business in particular. Demand for holidays to Belgium is also down, following the Brussels terrorist attacks in March. And that sent shares down to 75p, the lowest since March 2013. The London stock market has shed 50 points, or 0.8%, at the start of trading. Mining shares are leading the selloff, with silver miner Fresnillo sliding by 5%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the prospect of higher US interest rates is pushing up the US dollar, and driving down commodity prices. Other European markets are also dropping, with the German DAX shedding 1% and the French CAC down 0.5%. Most Asian stock markets are in the red today after the Federal Reserve put a June interest rate rise on the table. The Singapore and Hong Kong indices are leading the selloff Investors are baulked at the prospect of tightening of monetary policy, as Andrew Sullivan, sales trader at Haitong Securities explains (via Associated Press) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Markets have looked for government stimulus as a reason for investing rather than good company economics or fundamentals. Obviously therefore if there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s less chance of stimulus people are left wondering what to do. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yes it will be a shock to people, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure there will be a knee jerk reaction but the reality is we are nowhere near normal rates.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Only Japan has avoided any damage -- because Tokyo traders are pleased to see the yen weakening against the US dollar. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. Coming up today... We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking the reaction to last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve minutes, which showed that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank could be ready to raise interest rates next month. The Fed surprised investors by revealing that many policymakers believe a June rate hike is appropriate, if economic data over the next few weeks justifies it. As we covered in last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liveblog, the minutes of April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting showed that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Most participants judged that if incoming data were consistent with economic growth picking up in the second quarter, labor market conditions continuing to strengthen and inflation making progress toward the [Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] 2% objective, then it likely would be appropriate for the [Fed] to increase the target range for the federal funds rate in June.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And that has sent investors scrambling to adjust their expectations - as many had only expected one rate rise in 2016, or even none at all. The minutes also sent the dollar spiking last night, and is likely to weigh on European markets today. Also coming up today \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 9.30am: UK retail sales figures for April. Economists are expecting a rise of 0.7%, following a shock 1.6% tumble in March 12.30pm: The European Central Bank releases the minutes of its last meeting. Analysts will look for details of its new stimulus programme, and signs of dissent among the governing council. 1.30pm: The latest weekly US jobless report, showing how many people filed new unemployment claims last week Top Federal Reserve policymakers Stanley Fischer and William Dudley are speaking later today. 6pm: Gertjan Vlieghe, member of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee, is delivering a speech in London There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite a flurry of financial results this morning, including: Thomas Cook, Mothercare, Bloomsbury Publishing, Royal Mail, drinks firm Britvic, construction firm Balfour Beatty, financial services group Hargreaves Lansdown and asset manager 3i. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pick the most interesting bits out... There could be fireworks in Germany today, where Deutsche Bank is holding its AGM: And leading finance minister are heading to Japan, for a G7 meeting, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s any action today.",

Monday and Tuesday saw the index pushing 17800 thanks to the Goldman Sachs-inspired surge from Brent Crude. Yet since then the Dow has suffered, with first the best US inflation figure since February 2013, and then that surprisingly hawkish set of Fed meeting minutes from April, spooking the index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate-hike adverse investors.</p> <p>It will be interesting to see where the Dow is this time next week. By then the second estimate first quarter GDP reading will have been released, and without any upwards revisions to that woeful 0.5% (at the annualised rate) the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hawks may find their cause undermined by the seriously weak US growth, something that could work in the Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favour.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-573f18d0e4b0a21b62d98c32\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-20T14:10:53.470Z\">3.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US home sales rise by more than expected</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More signs of a strong US housing market.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.realtor.org/news-releases/2016/05/existing-home-sales-rise-in-april-for-second-straight-month\">Existing home sales rose by 1.7% in April to an annual rate of 5.45m</a></strong>, better than the 5.4m expected by economists.

                "bodyText":"The number of oil rigs in use in the US was unchanged last week after eight weeks of falls. Total rig numbers dropped by 2 to 404, according to the weekly Baker Hughes rig count. The two rigs cut were for gas. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the week. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back next week. After Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market falls on fears of a US interest rate rise in June, investors ended the week in a more positive mood as they decided those fears may have been overdone. Much of the previous day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s declines were regained, with banks and mining shares among the main risers. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: After charging higher at the open, London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE-100 has done a sterling effort of holding onto those gains through the session despite the abject lack of fresh fundamental data to work on. The concerns of a US rate hike that were largely responsible for driving yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sell-off have been side lined, although the market still seems to be thinking that the chance of monetary policy tightening in June remains well below 50%. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 102.97 points or 1.7% at 6156.32, its best one day performance since the middle of April Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax jumped 1.23% to 9916.02 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac climbed 1.67% to 4353.90 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB put on 1.52% to 17,812.35 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 1.11% at 8771.2 In Greece, the Athens market added 2.76% to 639.48 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 98 points or 0.56%. As for oil, Brent crude is unchanged at the moment at $48.81 a barrel. Speaking of next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agenda: Wall Street continues to recover, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now up 104 points or 0.6%. Connor Campbell, financial analysts at Spreadex, said: A strong open from the Dow Jones ensured Europe brought its gains into the afternoon, though there was little actual reason for Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chunky growth beyond cooler heads prevailing after two days of rate-hike fearing losses. [But] the Dow Jones is still on track for one of its worst weeks (and months) in a while. Monday and Tuesday saw the index pushing 17800 thanks to the Goldman Sachs-inspired surge from Brent Crude. Yet since then the Dow has suffered, with first the best US inflation figure since February 2013, and then that surprisingly hawkish set of Fed meeting minutes from April, spooking the index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate-hike adverse investors. It will be interesting to see where the Dow is this time next week. By then the second estimate first quarter GDP reading will have been released, and without any upwards revisions to that woeful 0.5% (at the annualised rate) the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hawks may find their cause undermined by the seriously weak US growth, something that could work in the Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favour. More signs of a strong US housing market. Existing home sales rose by 1.7% in April to an annual rate of 5.45m, better than the 5.4m expected by economists. March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure was revised up from 5.33m to 5.36m. Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, said the increase signalled slowly building momentum for the housing market this spring: Primarily driven by a convincing jump in the Midwest, where home prices are most affordable, sales activity overall was at a healthy pace last month as very low mortgage rates and modest seasonal inventory gains encouraged more households to search for and close on a home. Except for in the West \u00e2\u20ac\u201d where supply shortages and stark price growth are hampering buyers the most \u00e2\u20ac\u201d sales are meaningfully higher than a year ago in much of the country. Now here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something. Tesco Bank boss Benny Higgins spent more than \u00c2\u00a318,000 on taxis in eight months despite a clampdown in costs at all the supermarket\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s operations. Sarah Butler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full story is here: The rebound in global markets continues as Wall Street opens. As investors came to terms with all the talk of a US rate rise next month, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has recovered 78 points or 0.45% in early trading. The S&amp;P 500 opened 0.25% higher and Nasdaq climbed 0.39%. A number of members of the US Federal Reserve have spent the week suggesting a rate rise in June was not off the table, which the minutes of the last meeting released on Wednesday were more hawkish than expected. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets said: William Dudley of the New York Fed [gave] the game away somewhat...when he said that market pricing of Fed hike odds was way too low prior to the minutes, which would suggest that the events of the past week or so have been predominantly a process of expectations realignment. He also suggested that a move in July was probably more likely given the proximity of the UK vote. Consumer confidence in Belgium stabilised in May after falling for four consecutive months, according to the latest survey from the National Bank of Belgium. The index stood at -8, the same as April and the Bank said: On the one hand, consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 forecasts for macroeconomic developments in Belgium have got gloomier. Fears of a rise in the unemployment rate over the next twelve months have grown considerably, while expectations about the general economic situation have been revised downwards slightly. On the other hand, households have become more optimistic about their own personal situation. They are now expecting their finances to improve a little over the coming year, and, notably, to save more money. Back with Brexit and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker has said the UK will not get friendly treatment from the EU if it votes to leave. He told Le Monde that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Deserters will not be welcomed with open arms.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd My colleague Andrew Sparrow has the details in the politics live blog: European Union commissioner Pierre Moscovici - who warned there was no Plan B in the event of Brexit - has also been talking about Greece, ahead of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote on reforms this weekend and Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurogroup meeting. He said the EU was making good progress on Greece and said he hoped to reach a global deal on Greek debt soon. Ensuring the sustainability of Greek debt was fundamental, he added. But Finnish finance minister Alexander Stubb has said the eurozone and International Monetary Fund are still far apart on Greek debt relief, and a decision on the issue on Tuesday is in doubt, Reuters is reporting. Meanwhile a Greek parliamentary committee has approved the reform measures which will be voted on on Sunday. Kathimerini reports: A multi-bill bundling together a series of reforms that Greece must legislate to unlock further rescue loans was approved by a parliamentary committee on Friday ahead of a plenary session vote on Sunday. The bill, which details a slew of new tax increases, a new privatization fund, and a contingency mechanism that would automatically cut state spending if Greece misses budget targets, was backed by leftist SYRIZA and rightwing Independent Greeks who form the governing coalition. It was opposed by opposition New Democracy as well as PASOK, the Communist Party, Potami, Union of Centrists and Golden Dawn. On Saturday the bill is to go to Parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plenary session ahead of a vote scheduled for Sunday. But four Greek unions have issued a statement criticising the tax measures in the bill, according to the Athens Macedonian news agency. Meanwhile, in China health authorities have slashed the prices of three expensive drugs made by Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca, and China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Betta Pharmaceuticals. Reuters reports: The National Health and Family Planning Commission said the cost of GSK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hepatitis B drug Viread would fall to 490 yuan ($75) a month from 1,500, while AstraZeneca\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lung cancer pill Iressa drops to 7,000 yuan from 15,000. Icotinib, another lung cancer drug made by Betta Pharmaceuticals, will come down to 5,500 from 12,000 yuan a month. The Commission said in March it would cut prices of some medicines used to treat serious diseases, including cancer, but had not named the drugs involved. GSK, which has struggled to rebuild sales in China following a damaging bribery scandal that landed it with a record fine in 2014, said it expected the lower price to stimulate increased volume sales. At the reduced price, its hepatitis drug will now be covered by Chinese reimbursement policies, which means patients will no longer have to pay the entire price out of pocket. The high cost of healthcare is a major point of contention in China, where low levels of state health insurance coverage means patients and their families often burn through savings to buy drugs to treat chronic disease. At the G7 summit in Japan, US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said the G7 finance leaders need to find ways to use all the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153policy levers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd they have to ward off a global economic slowdown. Finance ministers and heads of central banks spent Friday discussing ways to use monetary policy, government spending and longer-term reforms to help support growth. The common view among the G7 industrialised financial leaders was that while there is no one-size-fits-all approach, all economies are facing a stifling lack of demand, and the private sector must play a key role in kickstarting growth. Lew told reporters: The G-7 is meeting at a significant time not because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a time of crisis, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a time when there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of uncertainty in the global economy and there a need for us to talk to each other about what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing and what tools we have to use to promote the most balanced use of all the policy levers that we have. The Group of 20 meeting in Shanghai in February was successful because there was a renewed commitment to refrain from competitive currency devaluation to communicate closely with each other other \u00e2\u20ac\u0153so we won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t surprise each other,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said, expressing hope that the current G7 summit would be equally effective. It carries on tomorrow. The Brexit impact is still tough to quantify, says Allan Monks at JPMorgan Chase, following comments by Bank of England policy maker Kristin Forbes this morning. While signs of an EU referendum-related impact on the UK growth data have become clearer in recent weeks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a story that so many had been waiting to tell \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we have argued that there could still be other factors at work too, including a fragile global backdrop. These sentiments were echoed in comments by MPC member Kristin Forbes in an interview with the Belfast Telegraph today. Another member, Jan Vlieghe, yesterday also highlighted that policy easing cannot be dismissed even under a vote to remain \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if, for example, growth failed to recover from its current soft patch. While the relative influence of Brexit on UK growth cannot be known for sure, the extent to which the activity data are weakening ahead of the referendum will be an important factor for BoE policy decisions, whatever the outcome of the vote. European Union commissioner Pierre Moscovici has said that policymakers \u00e2\u20ac\u0153have no plan B\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if Britain voted to leave the EU in June. He told reporters on the sidelines of the G7 finance ministers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 summit in Sendai in northern Japan: We have no plan B for Brexit. Our only plan is for Britain to remain in a united Europe. Looks like something was lost in translation. A Japanese finance ministry official has clarified, again according to Reuters, that As\u00c5\ufffd meant to say that some European ministers thought it would be good for the UK to stay in the EU. Some snaps from the G7 meeting in Japan on Reuters. The EU commissioner Pierre Moscovici said the general mood among G7 countries suggested that they wanted Britain to stay in the EU. But according to the Japanese finance minister Tar\u00c5\ufffd As\u00c5\ufffd, some European countries thought Brexit would be good in the long run. We will report more details as soon as we get them. British factory output is rising at the strongest pace since August, according to a survey from the Confederation of British Industry. Order books also improved, although they continued to decline. The survey of 489 manufacturers found that a rebound in the food and drink sector, following flooding in parts of the country earlier this year, drove an increase in overall output in the three months to May. Excluding food and drink, the output balance was stable, with the other 17 manufacturing sectors showing minimal movement. Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s director of economics, said: Conditions in the manufacturing sector seem to be a little better overall, with improving order books compared with a couple of months ago. But domestic and global uncertainty remains high, alongside lacklustre export demand. Despite recent choppiness in emerging markets, China and India remain significant sources of potential demand. An exports commission would enable exporters to better exploit the growth opportunities provided by these and other growth markets. Manufacturers need to work in partnership with the Government to embrace long-term opportunities and trends, particularly in digital. A greater focus is also required on developing the right skills in the sector, managing energy costs, and encouraging further R&amp;D investment. Several European Central Bank policymakers have backed president Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wait-and-see stance today. The ECB unveiled a big stimulus package in March but several key elements, such as like corporate debt purchases and new ultra-cheap loans to banks, have yet to be implemented. Draghi called for patience last month, dampening market expectations for more stimulus. Estonian central bank chief Ardo Hansson told a conference this morning, according to Reuters: The monetary policy stance should remain broadly accommodative at this point ... [and we need] to maintain a degree of patience. A lot of accommodation that has been decided already is still in the pipeline and it will work its way through. Slovak central bank chief Jozef Makuch also saw no need for further measures. Interest rates can still be lower still and we are now testing how low they can go. But if this tool must continue to be used, then I must urge caution so [we do not] bring about a totally counterproductive threat to financial stability. The scope for deploying standard instruments is almost exhausted. As reported earlier, Benoit Coeur\u00c3\u00a9, a member of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s executive board, told a Japanese newspaper that there were no plans to further reduce the deposit rate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is in negative territory, at -0.4% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for the time being. Eurostar has said that passenger numbers have fallen in the wake of the Paris and Brussels terror attacks, as people from the US and Asia have been afraid to travel to Europe. You can read more here. And here is our full story about France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fears over the planned \u00c2\u00a321bn merger between the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche B\u00c3\u00b6rse. Oil prices are pushing higher today, getting close to six-month highs, as the global oil glut eased due to a series of production outages in Nigeria, Canada and Libya. Brent crude, the global benchmark, is now trading at $48.86 after rising to $49.26 earlier, close to the six-month high of $49.85 reached a couple of days ago. In Japan, finance ministers and central bankers from the G7 industrialised nations are gathering to discuss what to do about flagging global growth. George Osborne is there \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The pound is having a good week. It has retreated somewhat after hitting a 3 1/2 month high against a trade-weighted basket of currencies yesterday, but remains on track for its best weekly performance in nearly 10 months \u00e2\u20ac\u201c up 2% this week. Sterling has been boosted by strong retail sales numbers for April and an opinion poll suggesting that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd camp had extended its lead ahead of the 23 June referendum on EU membership. An Ipsos-Mori poll found 55% of those surveyed supported staying in the EU, while just 37% wanted to leave. An open letter by 250 British celebrities including Benedict Cumberbatch and Helena Bonham Carter appears to have had little impact on markets. The actors, musicians, writers and artists warned that if Britain were to leave the European Union it would become \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an outsider shouting from the wings\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The planned \u00c2\u00a321bn merger between the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche B\u00c3\u00b6rse raises competition concerns, the French finance minister, Michel Sapin, has said. His comments echoed those made by economy minister Emmanuel Macron in February, but Sapin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments carry more weight as he is in charge of banking and financial industry issues in France. The proposed merger would create a group similar in scale to ICE, which owns the New York stock exchange and has taken a big slice of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s derivatives markets, and would leave smaller European rivals such as Euronext Paris far behind. ICE, which initially said it was considering a bid for the LSE, ruled itself out earlier this month. Sapin told Reuters: I want to express the concern of the French government on this tie-up. We have doubts about the consequences this could have for the financing of the real economy in France and Europe.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The merger of these two entities will result in a large group which could hold within it a majority of the tools that make our markets function efficiently. That poses a competition problem, and we want to make sure the European Commission gets involved to avoid a situation where a dominant position arises. European stock markets have opened higher, as expected. FTSE 100 index in London up 85 points, or 1.4%, at 6138.36 CAC 40 in Paris up 56 points, or 1.4%, at 4343.15 Dax in Frankfurt up nearly 118 points, or 1.2%, at 9913.57 Here in Britain, Ladbrokes and Coral could be forced to sell up to 400 betting shops if the \u00c2\u00a32.3bn merger of the two bookmakers is to go ahead, the competition regulator has said. The Competition and Markets Authority said the proposed merger between Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second and third largest betting shop chains would reduce choice for customers in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a large number of local areas\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. You can read the full story here. Turning to corporate news... Deutsche Bank suffered a damaging investor revolt over executive pay last night. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest lender held its annual meeting in Frankfurt yesterday, where more than half of shareholders (51.9%) voted against a new pay scheme for its top executives, and just 48.1% backed it. The vote was non-binding, however. Under the pay plan, in addition to bonuses linked to the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and their own performance, divisional heads will also get a bonus linked to their division\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance. Chairman Paul Achleitner suggested that the bank would take the vote into account when implementing the pay plan. A shareholder proposal for a special audit of whether top managers breached their obligations in how they handled the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s litigation issues was narrowly rejected \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 46.4% of investors voted in favour, and 53.6% against. You can view the voting results here, and listen to the speeches made at the AGM. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive John Cryan said the bank expected further big legal costs this year related to a series of scandals (such as Libor) that have damaged its reputation and hurt profits \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but is getting closer to the end of its litigation nightmare. I am cautiously confident that we are gradually approaching the home straight as far as our litigation is concerned. The bank has set aside \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5.4bn to settle pending litigation this year. Cryan, a Brit, spoke in German \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which went down well with shareholders, according to Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. A Bank of England policymaker, Kristin Forbes, has said that the central bank had no concrete evidence that recent weaker UK economic data was all related to uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the 23 June referendum on EU membership. She told the Belfast Telegraph during a visit to Northern Ireland that she believed the uncertainty was weighing on businesses and their investment plans, and that any doubts could be lifted quite quickly if there is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd vote. But she added: We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have concrete evidence that some of the softening we are seeing now is all referendum-related and uncertainty related, and there is a chance other things are going on. Meanwhile, a senior International Monetary Fund official said last night that negotiations on a new bailout programme for Greece should focus on a long grace period and maturity extensions along with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very low interest rates\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. IMF chief spokesman Gerry Rice also said that the fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t approve a new bailout unless it contains debt relief measures from European lenders along with policies to boost Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal savings. He declined for confirm reports that the IMF is pushing for a pause in Greek debt repayments until 2020. He said at a regular weekly briefing: We have exchanged preliminary views with our partners on general principles regarding debt relief. We believe that it is possible to restore debt sustainability without upfront haircuts, although this would involve providing very concessional loan terms, including long grace and maturity periods and very low interest rates. Eurozone finance ministers are due to meet next Tuesday to try to hammer out a deal with Greece on a package of steps to ensure Athens meets future fiscal targets, with hopes for a political agreement on future debt relief for Greece. A European Central Bank policymaker has poured cold water on hopes that the central bank could cut interest rates further. Benoit Coeur\u00c3\u00a9, member of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s executive board, said there are no plans to reduce the deposit rate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is in negative territory, at -0.4% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for the time being. The negative deposit rate, effectively a charge on banks for hoarding cash, has been criticised by banks and investors for squeezing their profits and distorting financial markets. Coeur\u00c3\u00a9 said that banks had largely benefited from the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s loose monetary policy and that markets continued to work smoothly. He told Japanese newspaper The Yomiuri Shimbun: It is in principle possible to cut this rate further, but there is currently no plan to do so. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. Signs of hawkishness among US Federal Reserve members sent global markets tumbling yesterday, marking another disappointing week for stocks. US markets finished lower but recovered from the lows hit earlier in the day. Asian stock markets rose overnight, with Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hang Seng up 1.2% and Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei closing 0.5% higher. European markets are expected to take their cue from Asia and open higher. The meeting of G7 finance ministers and central bankers kicks off in Sendai in Japan today, where will be discussing ways of breathing life into the sluggish global economy as well as risks from a potential \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.",

On Wednesday morning, Perez boarded Air Force Two and with Vice-President Joe Biden and flew to Columbus, Ohio, where they made the official public announcement inside <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://jenis.com/\">Jeni\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Splendid Ice Creams</a>.</p> <p>The new rule has been described by some as second only to the Affordable Care Act in its ability to affect the wellbeing of working- and middle-class Americans. Perez, who has been at the head of the US Department of Labor for nearly three years, has made the overtime rule a priority even as he has toured the country speaking to workers and advocating for other worker-friendly policies such as higher minimum wages at the local, state and federal level. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/17/obama-overtime-pay-new-rule\">Millions could get a raise under Obama administration's new overtime rules</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With two-thirds of a year left until the new president is sworn in, Perez still has an intimidating list of unfinished business \u00e2\u20ac\u201c paid leave, auto-enrolling US workers into 401K or other pension programs and a higher minimum wage among others\u00e2\u20ac\u201c that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to accomplish. As the election nears, he may have even more on his plate: Perez is said to be a potential vice-presidential pick.</p> <p>He is clearly unafraid of a challenge. Big business has come out swinging against his changes to paid leave. Perez is unfazed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are the only industrialized nation on the planet that does not have some form of paid leave. We are the only industrialized nation where paid leave is a partisan issue,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Perez said. </p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I got in trouble recently because I said: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe United States and Papua New Guinea are the only nations on the planet that do not have some form of paid leave.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Someone approached me after and said: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHey, I am from Papua New Guinea and we have been taking an initiative. Stop dissing New Guinea.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 So I want to note my own error and apologize for dissing New Guinea. We are alone as a nation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <h2>A good listener</h2> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tom Perez has guts,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Michael Subin, executive director of the Montgomery County\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criminal justice coordinating commission. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When he sees injustice, he is not afraid to take on those committing the injustice.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd<br></p> <p>Subin and Perez worked together in the early 2000s when Perez served as a member and then a president of the Montgomery County council. Together they proposed the Perez-Subin bill that sought to limit predatory lending. According to Subin, Perez knows how to get things done.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Lot of legislators don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand what they have to do and how the system works best. He was able to get things done because he was able to work with people,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He understood what they were looking for, what their issues might have been regarding specific pieces of legislation.

In a small conference room, six workers sat awaiting his arrival. Most of them had started at UnCommonGoods as seasonal workers and have then transitioned into permanent positions, quickly climbing the ladder within the company. UnCommonGoods is what Perez would describe as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153conscious capitalism\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd company focused on developing its workers by paying them well, listening to their feedback and incorporating that into how the company is managed. </p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I came here for the job, but I stayed for the culture,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Joel Villa, an operations supervisor who started at the company in 2013. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 I can grow and learn here.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d5bd34465ddae336de303beb51bb0d94ed42cfc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d5bd34465ddae336de303beb51bb0d94ed42cfc/181_605_3255_1952/1000.jpg\" alt=\"4 May U.S. Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez tours UnCommonGoods and has a roundtable discussion on Conscious Capitalism with it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s workers. ***Official Department of Labor Photograph*** Photographs taken by the federal government are generally part of the public domain and may be used, copied and distributed without permission.

He is as comfortable in a kitchen as he is in a warehouse, in a hard hat on a construction site or bending pipes in a garage. Making house calls, as he refers to his visits with employees and employers, is a key part of his job as a labor secretary and enables him to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153understand the angst\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of those Americans who still feel left behind in the economic recovery.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a58cc7caf8a0fa68c6d8bdc113caec32aad69dbf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a58cc7caf8a0fa68c6d8bdc113caec32aad69dbf/0_725_5760_2860/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Perez at the Modern\" width=\"1000\" height=\"497\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Perez tours The Modern restaurant and has a roundtable discussion on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcconscious capitalism\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with its workers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shawn T Moore/US Department of Labor</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153People in this country are resilient.

                "bodyText":"It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a busy week for the US labor secretary, Tom Perez. On Tuesday night, the White House announced that the Obama administration had finalized a new rule that could potentially expand overtime benefits to 4.2 million more Americans. On Wednesday morning, Perez boarded Air Force Two and with Vice-President Joe Biden and flew to Columbus, Ohio, where they made the official public announcement inside Jeni\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Splendid Ice Creams. The new rule has been described by some as second only to the Affordable Care Act in its ability to affect the wellbeing of working- and middle-class Americans. Perez, who has been at the head of the US Department of Labor for nearly three years, has made the overtime rule a priority even as he has toured the country speaking to workers and advocating for other worker-friendly policies such as higher minimum wages at the local, state and federal level. With two-thirds of a year left until the new president is sworn in, Perez still has an intimidating list of unfinished business \u00e2\u20ac\u201c paid leave, auto-enrolling US workers into 401K or other pension programs and a higher minimum wage among others\u00e2\u20ac\u201c that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to accomplish. As the election nears, he may have even more on his plate: Perez is said to be a potential vice-presidential pick. He is clearly unafraid of a challenge. Big business has come out swinging against his changes to paid leave. Perez is unfazed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are the only industrialized nation on the planet that does not have some form of paid leave. We are the only industrialized nation where paid leave is a partisan issue,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Perez said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I got in trouble recently because I said: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe United States and Papua New Guinea are the only nations on the planet that do not have some form of paid leave.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Someone approached me after and said: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHey, I am from Papua New Guinea and we have been taking an initiative. Stop dissing New Guinea.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 So I want to note my own error and apologize for dissing New Guinea. We are alone as a nation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A good listener \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tom Perez has guts,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Michael Subin, executive director of the Montgomery County\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criminal justice coordinating commission. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When he sees injustice, he is not afraid to take on those committing the injustice.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Subin and Perez worked together in the early 2000s when Perez served as a member and then a president of the Montgomery County council. Together they proposed the Perez-Subin bill that sought to limit predatory lending. According to Subin, Perez knows how to get things done. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Lot of legislators don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand what they have to do and how the system works best. He was able to get things done because he was able to work with people,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He understood what they were looking for, what their issues might have been regarding specific pieces of legislation. And he listened.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mary Kay Henry, president of the SEIU \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one of the largest labor unions in the US \u00e2\u20ac\u201c enjoys working with Perez because \u00e2\u20ac\u0153he gets us\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to explain struggles that people have. He is often telling me stories of people he has just met \u00e2\u20ac\u201c about how they are stitching together two or three jobs to make ends meet and that we have to stop it. What are we going to do together to get things right? He has really been a privilege to work with.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd One morning early in May, Perez made his way to Brooklyn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sunset Park neighborhood to visit UnCommonGoods, an online and catalogue retailer. In a small conference room, six workers sat awaiting his arrival. Most of them had started at UnCommonGoods as seasonal workers and have then transitioned into permanent positions, quickly climbing the ladder within the company. UnCommonGoods is what Perez would describe as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153conscious capitalism\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd company focused on developing its workers by paying them well, listening to their feedback and incorporating that into how the company is managed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I came here for the job, but I stayed for the culture,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Joel Villa, an operations supervisor who started at the company in 2013. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 I can grow and learn here.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As he toured the UnCommonGoods warehouse, Perez displayed an easy charm. Spotting one of the workers with a staff-designed handheld scanner, he said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Can I see your gun for a minute?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As the employee handed it over, Perez looked it over and posed for photos. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so elegant,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said handing it back. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Show me what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing here?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Later that day, Perez would go on to visit the kitchen of The Modern \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one of Danny Meyer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurants with a no-tipping policy. He is as comfortable in a kitchen as he is in a warehouse, in a hard hat on a construction site or bending pipes in a garage. Making house calls, as he refers to his visits with employees and employers, is a key part of his job as a labor secretary and enables him to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153understand the angst\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of those Americans who still feel left behind in the economic recovery. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People in this country are resilient. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve met so many folks who got kicked to the side of the road in the Great Recession and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve rebounded. They inspire me,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I also meet people who are trying their hardest and are working a full-time job and they are getting their food at a food pantry. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve met a woman in Detroit a few months ago \u00e2\u20ac\u201c she joined the Fight for $15 movement, mother of three. The night before I met her, she slept in her car with her three kids. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not right. We can do better as a nation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Just days after his visit to Brooklyn, the Department of Labor released its April jobs report noting that the US economy added just 160,000 jobs, about 40,000 fewer than expected. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another solid report,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Perez told the Guardian that afternoon, pointing out that the number of long-term unemployed has been dropping amid optimism about the US job market. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The percentage of long-term unemployed is the lowest in seven years.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd With the unemployment rate reaching 5% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c down from 10% in October 2009 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there are fewer workers on the market and employers are going to have to hire workers who \u00e2\u20ac\u0153might have a 12-month hole on their r\u00c3\u00a9sum\u00c3\u00a9\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve met these folks. They have incredible talent,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Perez. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Their only mistake \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if you want to call it a mistake \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is that they were at a wrong place at a wrong time during the Great Recession.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd On a cold, wet February morning, Perez met half a dozen New Jerseyans who were over 55 years old and had been out of work for an average of 1.8 years. The panel took place at Rutgers University, which had recently launched a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153New Start Career Network\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd focusing on older, long-term unemployed workers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For them, it was hugely significant, the simple fact that the highest-ranking official in the country who deals with these issues took the time to talk to them about their experiences with long-term unemployment,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Maria Heidkamp, director of the network, told the Guardian. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was very meaningful to them.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In the nearly four months since they met Perez, one of the attendees got a one-year contract.

Larry Elliott writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>The International Monetary Fund called for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153upfront\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unconditional\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd debt relief for Greece as it warned that without immediate action the financial plight of the recession-ravaged country would deteriorate dramatically over the coming decades.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=43915.0\">In a strongly-worded assessment</a>, the Fund said that there was no prospect of Greece meeting the draconian terms of its current bail-out plan and that debt interest payments on the soaring national debt would eat up 60% of the budget by 2060 in the absence of debt forgiveness.</p> <p>The debt sustainability analysis by the Washington-based IMF said Greece should have longer to pay, have the interest rate on its loans fixed at 1.5%, and that its creditors should make debt relief automatic once the bail out programme ends in 2018.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The implementation of debt relief should be completed by the end of the program period\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the IMF said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Providing an upfront unconditional component to debt relief is critical to provide a strong and credible signal to markets about the commitment of official creditors to ensuring debt sustainability, which in itself could contribute to lowering market financing costs. An upfront component can also help garner more ownership for reforms.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>The hard-hitting nature of the report makes it clear to the EU that the IMF will not be prepared to put its own money into the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac86bn bail out unless Germany and other eurozone countries ease their hardline stance towards Greece.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening.

                "bodyText":"Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our report on the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Greek comments ahead of Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurogroup meeting. Larry Elliott writes: The International Monetary Fund called for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153upfront\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unconditional\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd debt relief for Greece as it warned that without immediate action the financial plight of the recession-ravaged country would deteriorate dramatically over the coming decades. In a strongly-worded assessment, the Fund said that there was no prospect of Greece meeting the draconian terms of its current bail-out plan and that debt interest payments on the soaring national debt would eat up 60% of the budget by 2060 in the absence of debt forgiveness. The debt sustainability analysis by the Washington-based IMF said Greece should have longer to pay, have the interest rate on its loans fixed at 1.5%, and that its creditors should make debt relief automatic once the bail out programme ends in 2018. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The implementation of debt relief should be completed by the end of the program period\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the IMF said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Providing an upfront unconditional component to debt relief is critical to provide a strong and credible signal to markets about the commitment of official creditors to ensuring debt sustainability, which in itself could contribute to lowering market financing costs. An upfront component can also help garner more ownership for reforms.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The hard-hitting nature of the report makes it clear to the EU that the IMF will not be prepared to put its own money into the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac86bn bail out unless Germany and other eurozone countries ease their hardline stance towards Greece. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a link to the IMF report: Despite the prospect of Greece finally receiving much needed bailout cash, most European markets have ended the day lower, with commodity stocks on the slide again. An imminent rise in US interest rates was one of the factors, helping lift the dollar and hitting metal and oil prices. But Greece was an exception, with the Athens market up 1.5% and ten year bond yields falling to six month low. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 19.89 points or 0.32% to 6136.43 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 0.74% to 9842.29 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.66% at 4325.10 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 2.74% to 17,325.08 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 0.65% lower at 8714.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.5% to 649.10 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently virtually unchanged, up just 6 points. More from the IMF staff report on Greece: In all key policy areas\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfiscal, financial sector stability, labor, product and service markets\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe authorities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 current policy plans fall well short of what would be required to achieve their ambitious fiscal and growth targets. Consequently, staff believes that a realignment of assumptions with the evident political and social constraints on the pace and scope of adjustment is needed, and it has revised the DSA assumptions for the primary balance and growth. It has cut its primary surplus estimate from 3.5% of GDP to 1.5% and its long term growth assumption to 1.25%: [The primary surplus] target would in staff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view be within the realm of what is plausible, although it remains ambitious in as much as it requires the fiscal adjustment to be underpinned by much stronger support for reforms and much stronger resolve by policy making institutions, in Greece and at the European level, than currently evident. Two more US Federal Reserve members have added to the recent chorus suggesting a possible rate rise in June or July. San Francisco Fed president John Williams indicated a rise would not be delayed much longer, despite risks such as the possibility of the UK voting to leave the European Union. Williams told reporters (quotes from Reuters): [Brexit is] a factor in the decision for June obviously because you have an event right after, and we can obviously hold off until July if we wanted. But of course we could also make a decision to raise rates at a meeting and if later on economic conditions for the US change, we can always move interest rates back down. Earlier St Louis Fed president James Bullard said keeping rates too low for too long could cause financial instability in future. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: The Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bullard and Williams reiterated the new more hawkish stance of the Fed, though data showing a bigger than expected fall in manufacturing activity didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t support their calls. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current policy plans fall well short of what is needed to achieve fiscal and growth targets, according to the International Monetary Fund. In a staff report ahead of Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurogroup meeting, the IMF said Greece needs a substantial reprofiling of the terms of its European loans, and debt relief must be unconditional. But revised targets for economic growth and its primary budget surplus could meet the criteria for receiving IMF support, it said. Even before the growing signs that Greece may finally receive its long awaited bailout funds, eurozone consumer confidence improved for the second month in a row. The May figure came in at -7.0 compared to -9.3 the previous month and better than the -9.0 which had been expected, according to the European Commission. In the European Union as a whole, consumer sentiment rose by 1.1 points to -5.7. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something for the Fed to ponder as it wonders when to raise rates. The Markit provisional manufacturing PMI for May has fallen from a final 50.8 in April to 50.5. Analysts had been expecting a figure of 51. This is the worst level for more than six years. Stock markets continue to drift, with Wall Street opening marginally higher while European shares slip back. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up just 10 points as investors hold fire ahead of further clues as to whether the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 has dipped 0.27% while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is down 0.6% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac is 0.8% lower. But in Greece, the Athens market continues to benefit from hopes that Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurogroup meeting will release much needed bailout funds, following the weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parliamentary vote approving the latest package of austerity measures. It is currently up 1.76% while bond yields continue to fall. Ten year Greek bond yields have dropped around 28 basis points to 7.34%, a six month low. Two year yields are down 100 basis points to 8.51%. The cost of insuring Greek debt against default in terms of five year credit default swaps has fallen to a six month low. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reminder of the breakdown of Greek debt, from the Financial Times: Last summer, European officials worried that Greece might break off ties with Europe in favour of a new arrangement with Russia. So they might be interested to hear that Russian President Vladimir Putin is paying a visit to the Hellenic Republic on May 27-28. (Friday and Saturday). The Kremlin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press service reports that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[Putin] will meet Prokopis Pavlopoulos, the president of the Hellenic Republic, andPrime Minister Alexis Tsipras. The summit talks are expected to dwell on key issues of bilateral trade, economic and investment interaction, including the implementation of joint energy and transport projects.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Those joint energy projects could includes a landmark \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2bn gas deal which the two countries outlined last July \u00e2\u20ac\u201c days before the third Greek bailout was agreed. Tass, the Russian newswire, says the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upcoming visit will also pay \u00e2\u20ac\u0153special attention\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to cultural and humanitarian cooperation, while Putin and the Greek leaders will exchange views on urgent international and regional problems. AFP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Danny Kemp reckons eurozone finance ministers may take notice.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the mood on the streets of Athens today after MPs approved the latest package of austerity measures: And they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a point. Last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153omnibus bill\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd includes: Raising VAT to 24%, from 23% Increasing fuel consumption tax A special tax on cigarettes, tobacco and electronic cigarettes A new levy on craft beer A new tax on imported coffee Consumption taxes on fuel and natural gas use A new overnight accommodation tax for hotels. Some measures are implemented in July; others don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t kick in until 2017. Campaigners are concerned that the plans for Greek debt relief are far too modest. Eurozone finance ministers are due to discuss the issue tomorrow, and consider whether to extend the grace period on Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bonds and give Athens more time to repay. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s part of the pledge made when the current bailout was agreed last summer. There are also reports that the eurozone could buy up \u00e2\u201a\u00ac14bn of Greek bonds held by the IMF, to get around the Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns over Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt sustainability (the FT has a good take) But the Jubilee Debt Campaign argues that much more dramatic action is needed. Otherwise, according to the eurogroup\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own forecasts, Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt repayments will hit 30% of government revenue in 2019, fall to 20% in the early 2020s, then rising back over 30% after 2040. Instead, they believe Greece should get the same kind of deal that Germany got in the 1950s, which pegged its debt servicing costs at less than 4% of government income. Sarah-Jayne Clifton, Director of the Jubilee Debt Campaign said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greece needs a reduction in debt payments now to help tackle the humanitarian crisis in the country. A significant amount of debt needs to be cancelled, not just rescheduled, if the Greek economy is going to have the breathing space it needs to recover. And the costs of cancelling the debt should be recovered from the real beneficiaries of bailout loans, including the German, French and British banks that lent recklessly to Greece in the first place.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Despite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally, Greek debt is still pretty risky: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some other developments across business this morning: Angela Merkel and Alexis Tsipras have held their meeting in Istanbul: Back in the markets, money is pouring into short-dated Greek bonds. The yield on Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two-year debt has fallen to 8.5%, down from 9.5% on Friday night. Such a big drop in borrowing costs shows that traders are expecting Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout tranche to be signed off in Brussels tomorrow. Greek media are reporting that prime minister Tsipras will meet with German chancellor Angela Merkel shortly, in Istanbul. Both leaders are in the Turkish capital for a major international summit on the refugee crisis, that will consider how to improve the international humanitarian aid system. Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is hosting the summit, is calling on European countries to take more Syrian refugees. Writing in the Guardian today, Erdogan argues Turkey is doing more than its fair share: Having adopted an open-door policy towards Syrian refugees in 2011, we now host nearly 3 million Syrian nationals from diverse ethnic, religious and sectarian backgrounds. In the past five years Turkey has allocated $10bn to provide Syrian refugees with free healthcare, education and housing. At a time when the international community failed the Syrian people \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 600,000 of whom have lost their lives in the civil war, with 13 million forced from their homes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Turkey, along with the rest of Syria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s neighbours, was left to deal with the conflict\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consequences. As the Syrian civil war enters its sixth year, we are calling on the world to create a fair mechanism for sharing the burden. But some aid agencies doubt whether the summit will yield any real progress; with M\u00c3\u00a9decins Sans Fronti\u00c3\u00a8res calling it a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fig-leaf\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for international failures. More here. EU Economic Affairs commissioner Pierre Moscovici has welcomed Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to approve further austerity measures last night, despite public opposition. The AFP newswire has the details: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A key step has been taken... towards the conclusion of the first stage of the Greek programme,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Moscovici said in Paris, a day after Greek lawmakers voted in favour of spending cuts and tax hikes. Eurozone finance ministers are set to discuss easing Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt burden and disbursing the next round of funds at a closely-watched Eurogroup meeting in Brussels on Tuesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I hope and wish for an agreement at the Eurogroup meeting,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told a news conference. Bloomberg are reporting that eurozone finance ministers are planning to hand Greece \u00e2\u201a\u00ac11bn of bailout funds tomorrow. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to a draft version of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurogroup statement, seen by the newswire: Greek banks are among the best-performing shares in Athens this morning: Greek government bonds have hit their highest level in six months, after MPs approved last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s austerity package. The yield, or interest rate, on Greek 10-year debt has fallen to 7.4%, from 7.2% on Friday night. As this chart shows, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the lowest since last November: Yields fall when bond prices rises, so traders are prepared to pay a higher price for Greek debt today. And the cost of insuring those bonds against default has also dropped this morning, following the news that the package of tax rises and economic reforms has been agreed. That suggests investors are confident that eurozone finance ministers will sign off on its bailout review on Tuesday, unlocking fresh bailout loans for Greece. The Greek stock market is also rallying. The main ASE index has jumped 1% in early trading, defying the selloff in other markets. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets expect the Eurogroup to agree to release bailout funds tomorrow, allowing Greece to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153meet forthcoming debt repayments and clear arrears which have built up as the review has dragged on.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This slowdown in Eurozone growth rather undermines critics of the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus measures. So suggests Carsten Brzeski of Dutch bank ING: Ouch. Growth across Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector has slowed to a sixteen-month low. The eurozone composite PMI calculated by Markit, just released, has inched down to 52.9 from 53.0 in April. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprising, given the decent numbers from France and Germany this morning. But it appears that other areas of the eurozone struggled: Eurozone firms reported the smallest rise in new business since January 2015, even though many cut prices to encourage sales. Happily, though, employment levels did rise. But Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, warns that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery appears to be slowing: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are signs of improving life in the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 countries of France and Germany, led mainly by their service sectors, as manufacturing continued to struggle. However, elsewhere the rate of expansion slowed to its weakest for almost one-and-a-half years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The survey therefore paints a picture of a region stuck in a low-growth phase, managing to eke out frustratingly modest output and employment gains despite various ECB stimulus \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbazookas\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, a competitive exchange rate and households benefitting from falling prices.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets are suffering a dose of Monday morning blues. The main indices are all down, amid disappointment that global finance ministers didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take any decisive action at their G7 meeting over the weekend. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE has shed 23 points, or 0.4%, while there are bigger losses in France and Germany. And in Italy, the stock market has shed 2.8%, led by banking stocks. Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct explains: The weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s G7 meeting wrapped up with a lack of consensus and this appears to be very much setting the pace right now. Finance ministers did debate the risks facing the global economy, but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree any new stimulus packages. Perhaps they were too busy wondering why Japanese central bank chief Haruhiko Kurodo decided to pat George Osborne on the bottom.... May is also looking like a good month for German companies. Markit reports that growth across Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector has hit a three-month high. Its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccomposite PMI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, which tracks output across the German economy, has jumped to 54.7, up from 53.6 in April (any reading over 50 shows expansion). Good news from France....its private sector is growing at the fastest rate in seven months. Markit, the data firm, reports that new business has picked up, encouraging French firms to take on more staff. This pushed up the French composite index up to 51.1 for May, from 50.2 in April. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the highest level since last October - shortly before the Paris terrorism attacks. The service sector led the way, with companies reporting faster growth. The factory sector lagged behind, but at least it contracted at a slower rate: Flash France Services Activity Index climbs to 51.8 (50.6 in April), 7-month Flash France Manufacturing PMI rises to 48.3 (48.0 in April), 2-month high Fred Ducrozet, economist at Swiss bank Pictet, says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good performance: Last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t without incident. One government MP, Vassiliki Katrivanou, refused to back parts of the package, saying Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lenders were taking too much control. Katrivanou has now resigned, meaning she can be replaced as an MP - leaving Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s narrow majority of 155 MPs, out of 300, intact. Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras cut a defiant figure at last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote. He told MPs that this latest package of austerity is the last one: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greeks have already paid a lot, but this is probably the first time that the possibility of these sacrifices being the last is so evident.... Tsipras also gave eurozone finance ministers a dig in the ribs to sign off Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout funds at Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153European leaders will receive a message tonight, that Greece fulfils its obligations. Tomorrow, the other side must also take responsibility.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But outside the parliament, protesters demonstrated against the package of tax rises and reforms: One demonstrator, 60-year old businessman Panayiotis Kehris, told Reuters: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a disaster! We will cut down on everything, from food to driving.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. Greece is on the brink of receiving a much-needed dose of bailout, after its parliament agreed to the latest batch of austerity measure to be piled on its already weakened economy. Last night MPs in Athens approved the package, which includes \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.8bn in tax increases, VAT hiked from 23% to 24%, and a new privatization fund. That should be enough to allow eurozone finance ministers to sign off much-needed bailout payment to Greece when they meet in Brussels tomorrow. That would ease fears of another summer of Greek drama, with Athens struggling to meet debt repayments. It should also trigger more detailed discussions about debt relief. But as our correspondent Helena Smith reports, these latest restrictions on Greece are the toughest yet: The belt-tightening legislation, outlined in a 7,500-page omnibus bill, includes measures that range from the taxation of coffee and luxury goods to the creation of a new privatisation fund in charge of real estate assets for the next 99 years. Under the stewardship of EU officials, the body will oversee the sale of about 71,500 pieces of prime public property in what will amount to collateral for the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac250bn in bailout loans Greece has received since 2010. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They are with the exception of the Acropolis selling everything under the sun,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Anna Asimakopoulou, the shadow minister for development and competitiveness. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are giving up everything.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But some big problems remain, including whether the International Monetary Fund will take the plunge and support Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current bailout. Germany demands the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s involvement, but balks at the Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key demand \u00e2\u20ac\u201c substantial debt relief for Athens. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the reaction to last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote, and the build-up to tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurogroup meeting. Also coming up today... On the economic front, data firm Markit is releasing its latest PMI reports, showing how the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sectors are faring this month. We also get the latest measure of consumer morale across the euroarea. 8am: Flash French manufacturing PMI for May 8.30am: Flash German manufacturing PMI for May 9am: Flash eurozone manufacturing PMI for May 3pm: Eurozone consumer confidence for May. The markets? They look rather quiet this morning, with IG calling the FTSE 100 index up just 4 points. And on the corporate front, budget airline Ryanair is reporting results. It has just posted profits to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.242bn for the last financial year -- a 43% jump, but not enough",

IMF policy is determined by its shareholders (represented by the board), rather than its staff. Politics matter much more to the former. And there is little enthusiasm in Germany for debt relief which would be hard to sell to the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s voters.</p> <p>On the other hand the Eurogroup will be unwilling to risk a crisis that could break up the Euro in the run-up to the UK Brexit vote on 23 June and the Spanish elections on 26 June, so arguably today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting is the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best chance to use its negotiating power to force the concessions it believes are necessary.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Cebr sees two ways the situation could develop:</p> <blockquote> <p>1. The IMF backs off and avoids confrontation with the Europeans. This would continue the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extend and pretend\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd strategy that has governed the Greek crisis since it started. This would most certainly be bad for the Greek economy, as the IMF staff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s projections show. And, it could prove very damaging to Europe as it raises the likelihood of a default and Grexit further down the line \u00e2\u20ac\u201c meaning that debt owed to European taxpayers (including in the UK) would never be repaid.</p> <p>2. The IMF plays hardball and poses a painful dilemma to the Europeans. This would certainly be risky. A failure to agree could lead to another Eurozone crisis, possibly a Grexit. But it is in everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest that this is avoided. The debt relief itself need not take the form of an outright haircut. Some form of reprofiling, as outlined in the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DSA could do the trick. This would put the Greek economy on a more sustainable trajectory but would be costly politically to Eurozone leaders and may lead to political instability in the already-troubled union. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-574454c7e4b04536c2a43b62\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-24T13:25:42.970Z\">2.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble, has just put his finger on the problems over the Greek bailout.</strong></p> <p>Arriving for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble told reporters that there can be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no programme\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for Greece without the IMF. </p> <p>However, he then declared that a decision on Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt relief can only come in 2018, at the end of the bailout.

                "bodyText":"Eurozone ministers are finally heading to their beds, and the frazzled Brussels press pack are heroically filing copy. So let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s have a brief recap. Greece has finally received the green light to receive more than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10bn in bailout funds, easing concerns that it could face financial peril this summer. After a marathon meeting in the Belgian capital, creditors agreed that Greece has done pretty-much everything required under its bailout A few prior actions do remain, concerning pensions and privatisations, but once that is resolved, the money will flow -- starting with \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7.5bn in June. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem told reporters that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s programme was back on track. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We achieved a major breakthrough on Greece which enables us to enter a new phase in the Greek financial assistance programme,....This is stretching what I thought would have been possible not so long ago.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In an important development, the International Monetary Fund has signalled that it could join the bailout. That could happen by the end fo 2016. However, European chief Poul Thomsen insisted that the Fund must check that the eurozone is offering substantial debt relief. Thomsen said: We welcome that all stakeholders recognise that Greek debt is unsustainable. We welcome that it is understood that Greece needs debt relief to make it sustainable. Crucially, Eurozone ministers have agreed to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a package of debt measures\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to make Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debts sustainable. That will start with short-term tweaks to Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debts, to smooth out its obligations. Medium-term measures are also promised, although not until 2018, which looks like a concession from the IMF. There is also a commitment to consider whether further restructuring will be needed once the bailout ends, assuming Athens sticks to the programme and everything works out. The deal has been welcomed by Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister. Euclid Tsakalotos said it would help end the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vicious circle of austerity and recession. Donald Tusk, the head of the European Council, said the Greek deal was good for the global economy. Slovakia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister Peter Kazimir also sounded satisfied, comparing the negotiations to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a complicated birth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. And France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michel Sapin was positively upbeat, saying the deal was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153first and foremost a declaration of confidence in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Greece.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Some questions remain, over the details of the debt relief, whether it will satisfy the IMF, and whether Greece can ever exit its financial crisis while sticking to the tough terms of its bailout. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll consider them tomorrow later today. Until then, goodnight! GW It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s late, but Bruno\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brain is still whirring. Greek finance chief Tsakalotos added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think there is some ground for optimism that this can be the beginning of turning Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vicious circle of recession-measures-recession into one where investors have a clear runway to invest in Greece. (via Reuters) Down the corridor, Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has told reporters that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal is an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcimportant moment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (echoing Dijsselbloem, Thomsen and Moscovici) Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, has hailed the agreement - which comes as world leaders head to Japan for a G7 meeting. And finally.... Jeroen Dijsselbloem insists that the eurozone would not \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgo it alone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 without the International Monetary Fund. If, hypothetically speaking, the Fund found it couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t back the package then the two sides would work together to find a solution, he says, promising that: We will stay in close co-operation with the IMF. And that, blessedly, is the end of the press conference, at almost 3am in Brussels. Ah.... Bruno Waterfield of the Times is concerned that the measures agreed tonight aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually quantified. Why not? Poul Thomsen says Europe can deliver the measures which the IMF has been calling for. He agreed that they need to be quantified, before the Fund can come on board. The key is that Greece must be able to stand on its own at the end of the programme period (in 2018) And Thomsen warns that he will not ask the Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board to join the bailout programme otherwise. Q: When will the eurozone decide the details of medium-term debt relief? Not until after the German elections? Dijsselbloem claims he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know when those elections are! (I think they could be in August 2017, or later). He then explains that the Greek deal expires in 2018 - so if the programme is completed, we will draw up a new debt sustainability analysis. He also insists that the package hammered out for Greece is truly ambitious, Ministers have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stretched their political capital\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to get this deal on the table, Dijsselbloem adds. Q: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt relief measures seem weaker than what the IMF has been proposing, so is there a danger that it fails your debt sustainability test? Poul Thomsen says the IMF will assess the latest proposals (online here) and see if they go far enough. [On Monday, the IMF argued that the eurozone should grant Greece debt relied until 2040 -- today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s measures don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go that far] Onto questions. Q: What has to happen before Greece receives its bailout funds? ESM chief Klaus Regling says some additional steps are needed on privatisations, pensions and non-performing loans. Now the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European chief, Poul Thomsen, speaks! He says the Fund welcomes the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153important package of measures\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which Greece has adopted. All sides have had to compromise. And Thomsen then turns to the big issue - debt relief. We welcome that all stakeholders recognise that Greek debt is unsustainable. We welcome that it is understood that Greece needs debt relief to make it sustainable. And we welcome that there is agreement on the methodology and the objectives of what debt relief will achieve. The IMF will now spend some time analysing the short-term debt relief measures being taken. And crucially he confirms that IMF staff will recommend joining the bailout by the end of 2016, as long as the debt sustainability analysis shows that the measures on the table will work. Ultimately, though, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a decision for the Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board. Onto the details.... The boss of the ESM bailout fund, Klaus Regling, says Greece needs to complete the outstanding \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcprior actions\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 previously agreed with its lenders. Then national governments must give their approval, before the first portion of the bailout funds - worth 7.5 billion euros -- can be handed over in June. European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici says the eurogroup has reached a good agreement. It opens the way to rebuild confidence and create a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lasting economic recovery in Greece\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Moscovici adds: It is a very important moment in this long and sometimes difficult journey\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sometimes?! Curious metaphor alert, from the Slovakian finance minister: The Eurogroup\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement is online here: Eurogroup statement on Greece It confirms that Greece will receive its bailout loans, that the eurozone will offer debt relief, and that IMF officials are planning to recommend that they join the Greek bailout programme. The key points: Dijsselbloem sounds quite cheerful, telling reporters that this is an important moment in the long Greek saga. Confidence has begun to recover since the drama of last summer, and he extends his thanks to Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos and his staff. We have entered a new phase, and I welcome that very much, Dijsselbloem concludes. In another important development, Dijsselbloem says that that IMF is on board with the Greek bailout. He explains that the Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s management have agreed to recommend a new financial arrangement for Athens before the end of this year. Eurogroup president Dijsselbloem says ministers have agreed a range of debt relief measures for Greece. In the short term, these relate to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdebt management\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 - smoothing Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s repayments to avoid any shocks. Medium-term measures will kick in from mid-2018, when Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout expires (assuming Athens complies with its demands). He also explains that profits which the European Central Bank has made on Greek bonds will be returned to Athens, to help with debt sustainability. This decision eases concerns that Greece could default over the summer. However, most of this new loan will be returned to Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors, of course, or used to cover outstanding government bills. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official! Jeroen Dijsselbloem confirms that the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout vehicle has agreed to extend \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10.3bn of bailout loans to Greece. But as rumoured earlier, the aid will be handed over in several instalments, not in one lump. Dijsselbloem says: This is very good news... the programme is fully back on track. Greece is delivering a lot, and we are making good progress. Jeroen Dijsselboem has arrived at the press conference, rubbing his hands. And excitingly, IMF chief Poul Thomsen is there too. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem is about to hold a press conference about the meeting. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being streamed live, here (right-click to open in a new tab) AFP are now reporting that the eurogroup has done enough to unlock its long-awaited bailout funds: Michel Sapin has also declared that the IMF is part of this deal with Greece, which covers short, medium and long-term debt relief (Reuters reports) French finance minister Michel Sapin says a deal has been struck with Greece, according to a newsflash on Reuters. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official, the eurogroup meeting had concluded! And there are reports that an agreement has been reached between the eurozone and the IMF on Greek debt relief, and reforms. Remember that Zorba the Greek tune we mentioned earlier? Apparently it was played to the eurogroup! Hang in there.... the latest word is that the meeting might *finally* be over. Current state of play: The clocks have now chimed 1am in Brussels, and the eurogroup meeting still grinds on. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expecting a press conference at some stage, meaning ministers won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get much sleep before they return for fresh meetings on Wednesday morning.... The IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top man in Europe, Poul Thomsen, is reportedly consulting with Christine Lagarde over the Greek issue.... Sounds like Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors are still divided... Oh goodness me.... AFP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alex Pigman has heard the eurogroup ministers haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reached an agreement after all.... That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bad news all round, as ministers are due back for an ECOFIN meeting (including non-euro countries) tomorrow morning..... Euronews have produced a handy explanation to the Greek debt crisis - which you can see here. It includes clips of the anti-austerity protests which gripped Brussels today (as covered earlier today), and saw riot police use water cannons on demonstrators. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now Wednesday in Brussels, and 1am over in Greece, and still the eurogroup meeting continues. More seriously, my local pub just rang \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctime at the bar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 :( Excellent news.... That could mean that ministers are ready to sign off an agreement.... Heads-up! Eric Maurice of EUobserver reckons eurozone finance ministers might wrap things up in 20 minutes.... Bong! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now eight hours since eurozone finance ministers began today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, and just 30 minutes until the Brussels bells chime midnight. So far, it sounds like they may agree to hand Greece its \u00e2\u201a\u00ac11bn aid tranche, but in two installments. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no sign of a breakthrough over how to give Greece debt relief. At least they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still talking, though.... Alex White of the Economist Intelligence Unit suspects tough decisions on Greek debt relief could be delayed until after the next German general elections, in autumn 2017. That may not be acceptable to the IMF, though.... Cross everything.... OK, I have no idea what this means....but EC spokesman Simon O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Connor just tweeted this catchy tune from Zorba the Greek. Might it be a sign that talks are speeding up?... Finland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister has just tweeted that the eurogroup has taken a break, and that these long days require \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcendurance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: What would we do without online translation sites, eh? The Wall Street Journal have a great timeline showing Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt repayments: Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Debt Due: What Greece Owes When This chart shows its obligations this year: Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry too much about the grey lines - they show short-term debt held by Greek banks which can be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrolled over\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 at regular auctions. The red and blue lines are important, though - they show money owed to the IMF and the ECB. Defaulting on either creditor would have serious consequences. Splitting Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout funds into two tranches would leave Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 a little more exposed over the summer. It has to repay around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3bn of long-term debt to its creditors in July, which should be manageable if it receives \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7.5bn in loans next month (as is rumoured). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 latest report from Brussels, confirming what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been hearing: Euro zone finance ministers are likely to approve new loans to Greece of 10.3 billion euros, according to a draft statement seen by euro zone officials. The 10.3 billion euros in new loans is likely to be paid out in two tranches, officials said, with the first one in June worth 7.8 billion euros. The amount and timing are not final yet, officials said. The disbursement was conditional on Greece delivering on reform promises. Our own Jennifer Rankin confirms that Greece may get its aid loans in two portions, not all in one lump as expected: She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also hearing that negotiations over debt relief for Athens are continuing... A Slovak government advisor tweets that eurogroup ministers are taking a break. I hate to rush you, guys, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 11pm in Greece and our dear readers may need their sleep..... A few journalists in Brussels are reporting that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout payment is going to be split into two instalments. Efi Koutsokosta of Euronews has the details: If so, that could mean that creditors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t totally happy with the measures approved by Athens last weekend. Or it could mean something else.... Over in New York, Wall Street has just closed for the night with gains across the board. Banks and tech stocks led the rally, as investors appeared to stop worrying about the prospect of a US rate rise. The Dow Jones index finished 211 points higher at 17,704 points, a jump of 1.2%, following a strong day in Europe. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problem in a nutshell: Rumblings of discontent in Brussels.... Greek government bonds traded at a six-month high today. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thanks to hopes that Athens would receive the bailout funds needed to avoid another financial crisis. Bond yields (the interest rate on the debt) fell sharply on Monday after MPs approved the austerity measures sought by creditors. They fell a little further today, as traders waited for developments in Brussels. Ciaran O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Hagan, a strategist at Societe Generale, says investors are now looking for concrete moves on debt relief: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The fall in Greek bond yields reflects optimism that the reforms passed by the Greek parliament pave the way for support from the Eurogroup later today.... If there is debt relief, you will see further outperformance.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (thanks to Reuters for the quote) The Eurogroup meeting is now entering its seventh hour. Greek journalist Yannis Karagiorgas sums up the mood: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest news story from Brussels: It begins thus: European officials have voiced optimism that Greece could unlock the next tranche of bailout money even as an ongoing row between the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors threatens to plunge the eurozone back into crisis. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s international creditors remain deadlocked over how to reduce the recession-hit country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u201a\u00ac321bn (\u00c2\u00a3245bn) debt mountain, worth 180% of annual economic output. The International Monetary Fund has threatened to walk away from the Greek bailout unless substantial debt relief is agreed, but Germany maintains there can be no changes before 2018. Going into the talks between 19 eurozone finance ministers in Brussels, Valdis Dombrovskis, the European commissioner in charge of the euro, said he hoped to see \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an agreement in principle\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, including on disbursement of bailout funds..... (click here for more) The Greek delegation are briefing reporters in Brussels now, and confirming that talks are continuing. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also suggesting that Germany is pushing for changes to the austerity measures passed last Sunday. Eleni Varvitsiotis, EU correspondent at Greek newspaper Kathimerini, says three outstanding issues must be resolved before Greece gets its aid tranche: EKAS is Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pensioners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Social Solidarity Benefit, which is being cut back under the bailout programme (some wealthier pensioners are reportedly being told to hand back some recent payments). NPL means non-performing loans - the bad debts held by Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks , which are to be sold off. Matthew Klein, one of FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alphaville\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s many blindingly-bright sparks, has been digging through Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finances, and spotted something rather interesting. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all to do with Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s net debt (basically its gross debt minus the financial assets the country holds). The International Monetary Fund reckons those financial assets are worth just \u00c2\u00a33bn, a drop in the ocean compared to its debt mountain. But Matt has discovered that the Bank of Greece has calculated it as \u00c2\u00a330bn - using the methodology recommended by the IMF itself. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not really obvious why such a difference should occur - but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s obviously important when assessing Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial health. If you have any ideas why, please tell Matt here: Is the IMF under-counting the Greek government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial assets? Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ANA newswire are reporting that eurozone finance ministers are likely to approve Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u201a\u00ac11bn bailout tranche tonight. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the story, hot off the Reuters terminal: Negotiations at Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurogroup meeting are focusing on Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt, a source from the European Commission said, adding that Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance ministers are expected to approve the disbursement of the loan installment totaling 10.3 billion euros. The same source said there are still some pending issues which will be included in the final statement. Commenting on these issues, a government source said they are not decisive and will be resolved summarily. But what about the showdown between Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors? As we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve reported earlier, the two sides are someway apart. ANA says: On the issue of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt, the distance between the IMF and Germany is still great and the aim is to achieve greater convergence today. The Commission source said that after pressure by the IMF, the weight has shifted towards measures that will be taken in the short term. However, Eurozone officials hope some deal will eventually be achieved with the IMF tonight, as there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political pressure to avoid reviving the crisis. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fill the time with some dispiriting Greek charts, via Open Europe analyst Raoul Ruparel: Brussels correspondent Jennifer Rankin says there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no sign when the talks about Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout, and other eurozone economic issues, will end. Last time, the eurogroup were done and dusted by around 7pm local time (6pm BST). But regular crisis watchers will know that these meetings have a nasty habit of running on towards midnight.... Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former top central banker fears that the country is ill-prepared to exit its economic crisis. Our Athens correspondent, Helena Smith, explains: While we wait for progress at the Eurogroup, here are some more photos from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. But... More optimism the Eurogroup\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talks will be constructive: The story is here (in Greek). Stock markets appear to have come to terms with the prospect of a US interest rate rise, perhaps as early as next month. Indeed, the idea of the Federal Reserve hiking rates put financial shares in the spotlight, on the basis that dearer borrowing costs could boost their balance sheets. Meanwhile there was also optimism that a deal between Greece and its creditors could finally be reached at the Eurogroup meeting, despite tensions with the IMF over the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt situation, thus releasing much needed bailout funds. Another EU referendum survey showing the remain camp in the lead also helped support markets, as did another rise in the oil price. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been nothing short of a stellar day for the FTSE-100 as the market has shaken off earlier woes to forge a path higher, despite what could be construed as a raft of adversity. Public sector borrowing was higher than expected and Bank of England officials painted another gloomy picture over the economic outlook in their parliamentary appearance. The saving grace however appears to have been a combination of that latest Brexit survey data showing the Remain camp forging its way ahead, plus the fact that oil prices are evidently ascending, too. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 82.83 points or 1.35% at 6219.26 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax added 2.18% to 10,057.31 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac climbed 2.46% to 4431.52 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB jumped 3.34% to 17,903.97 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 2.34% higher at 8918.1 But in Greece, there was some profit taking after recent rises, and the Athens market fell 1.08% to 642.08 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 215 points or 1.23%. As for oil, Brent crude has climbed 0.54% to $48.61 a barrel. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s summary of the comments ahead of the Eurogroup meeting on Greece: The eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top official expressed optimism Tuesday that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors will approve its reform efforts, paving the way for the payout of a new batch of rescue loans that would keep Athens from defaulting on its massive debts this summer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I hope that there is full agreement between the institutions, that we can move on in the program,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the eurogroup of finance ministers, as he arrived for the talks in Brussels. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parliament passed a bill over the weekend on a series of measures that creditors had demanded. They included tax hikes, more budget-cutting reforms and a new privatization superfund, which will manage almost all state property. The next step for creditors would be to find a way to lighten the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt load, which mainly consists of past rescue loans from eurozone states. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt is predicted to reach more than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac333bn this year, around 180% of its annual economic output. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greece needs room to breathe, it needs certainty. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s made considerable efforts, and again this weekend,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said French Finance Minister Michel Sapin, referring to the reforms Greece passed. On the question of debt relief, Dijsselbloem said there was no appetite for any outright cut to the value of the money Greece owes. Rather, the creditors are likely to examine a possible lowering in the interest rates and possibly an extension of the rescue loans\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 maturity dates, as called for by the International Monetary Fund. There are fears the IMF may even pull out of the bailout program if Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt burden is not lightened. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153An actual haircut of the loans will not happen,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dijsselboem said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What we can look at is the annual debt burden, so Greece can on an annual basis pay its debts. If not, we are ready to help them in the coming years.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Senior EU officials believe the plans being drawn up by experts to address Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s short, mid- and longer-term debt needs will be enough to keep the IMF on board. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is a real added value to have the IMF on board, so it is not an option to go on without the IMF,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dijsselbloem said. US investors have followed their European counterparts and moved back into the stock market, with continuing talk about an imminent Federal Reserve rate rise helping to lift financial stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 187 points or just over 1%, while the S&amp;P 500 has added 0.7% and Nasdaq is 0.85% better. In Europe, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is 1.8% higher while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 2%. The FTSE 100 is up 70 points or 1.1%. But as the Eurogroup meets to try and resolve the Greek debt situation, the Athens market has slipped 1.27%. Back with Mark Carney, and here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our report on the Bank of England governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appearance at the Treasury select committee: More comments made ahead of the Eurogroup meeting which should now be well underway: And Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem: The International Monetary Fund is using its negotiating position to try and persuade the Eurogroup to make concessions in the Greek debt crisis, says the Centre for Economics and Business Research, and this may be its best chance to push its point of view. But Cebr economist Danae Kyriakopoulou said: Cebr warns against premature optimism that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting will mark \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe end of the Eurozone crisis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. IMF policy is determined by its shareholders (represented by the board), rather than its staff. Politics matter much more to the former. And there is little enthusiasm in Germany for debt relief which would be hard to sell to the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s voters. On the other hand the Eurogroup will be unwilling to risk a crisis that could break up the Euro in the run-up to the UK Brexit vote on 23 June and the Spanish elections on 26 June, so arguably today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting is the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best chance to use its negotiating power to force the concessions it believes are necessary. The Cebr sees two ways the situation could develop: 1. The IMF backs off and avoids confrontation with the Europeans. This would continue the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extend and pretend\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd strategy that has governed the Greek crisis since it started. This would most certainly be bad for the Greek economy, as the IMF staff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s projections show. And, it could prove very damaging to Europe as it raises the likelihood of a default and Grexit further down the line \u00e2\u20ac\u201c meaning that debt owed to European taxpayers (including in the UK) would never be repaid. 2. The IMF plays hardball and poses a painful dilemma to the Europeans. This would certainly be risky. A failure to agree could lead to another Eurozone crisis, possibly a Grexit. But it is in everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest that this is avoided. The debt relief itself need not take the form of an outright haircut. Some form of reprofiling, as outlined in the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DSA could do the trick. This would put the Greek economy on a more sustainable trajectory but would be costly politically to Eurozone leaders and may lead to political instability in the already-troubled union. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble, has just put his finger on the problems over the Greek bailout. Arriving for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble told reporters that there can be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no programme\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for Greece without the IMF. However, he then declared that a decision on Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt relief can only come in 2018, at the end of the bailout. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s later than the IMF is demanding. However, Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153optimistic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that these issues can be resolved. Back at the eurogroup, European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker has revealed that all isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t well: I suspect he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worried about the tensions between Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors, after the International Monetary Fund urged the eurozone to give Athens deeper debt relief. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting could become a serious showdown between the two sides, over the issue of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt sustainability. Belgium\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance chief, Johan Van Overtveldt, told reporters outside today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting that he wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed by the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new call for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunconditional\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 debt relief. Such relief must always have conditions attached, he argues. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why Belgium\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s workers took to the streets today, from AFP: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am here to protest against all the measures that this right-wing government is taking. They are attacking workers, pensioners and the unemployed,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Michel Beis, a trade union member taking part in the peaceful rally told AFP before the violence broke out. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are going backwards,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd added Jacques Warnier, a protester from the town of Liege. The AFP newswire are tweeting photos from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clashes in Brussels: They report: Belgian police fired water-cannon during clashes with protesters at a huge demonstration in Brussels on Tuesday against the centre-right government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s austerity measures, AFP journalists said. A group of around 100 masked protesters broke away from the peaceful main rally of around 60,000 people in the Belgian capital and started hurling objects and firecrackers at riot police, they said. Officers then drove them back with jets of water from three cannon. Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s protest is supposed to kick off months of planned demonstrations and national strikes led by trade unions against the policies of Prime Minister Charles Michel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government. Clashes are breaking out in the Belgium capital, as an anti-austerity demonstration turns violent. Local media are reporting that riot police are using water cannon on protesters; just as eurozone finance ministers meet to discuss Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s protests are organised by Belgium\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unions, to oppose the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost-cutting measures and employment reforms. The demonstrations had started peacefully: But some protesters then began throwing rocks at the police.... ....prompting the water cannons to be deployed. Meanwhile in Brussels, eurozone finance ministers have been gathering for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurogroup meeting. As explained back in the introduction, we had expected ministers to sign off on a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac11bn bailout payment for Greece. But, in a worrying sign, Slovakia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister has warned that the meeting will be difficult - and could last all night! Peter Ka\u00c5\u00beimer appears to be pushing for a deal on Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s loans today, but not on the sticky issue of debt relief which is dividing the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors. Cambridge lecturer Finbarr Livesey has helpfully tweeted the timings of the best moments of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hearing: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction to Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appearance at parliament today, from Calum Bennie, savings expert at Scottish Friendly: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grilling of Mark Carney by the Treasury Select Committee has only helped fuel the speculation on the impact a Brexit would have on the UK economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The build-up to the EU referendum appears to be having a significant impact on the economy as sterling has been incredibly volatile, while GDP and inflation have slowed are slowing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mr Carney didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly offer savers much ground for optimism today as he merely said the next move in interest rates would \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcprobably\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 be up if there is a vote to remain, while a Brexit would mean there is less chance of a rate rise. Once again savers are left wondering how long rates will continue at rock bottom, potentially eroding the value of their cash. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Savers should heed this warning from the Governor and look to the long term returns stocks and shares ISAs can offer, though risk is attached.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That was a livelier morning than expected. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a quick recap. The governor of the Bank of England has fought off criticism following his warning that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy would suffer if the public vote to leave the EU. Mark Carney insisted that the Bank was right to outline its concerns, saying: By our actions, and comments, we have made it more likely that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll bring inflation back to target, whatever the outcome of the referendum, sooner and more sustainably. Carney also warned that the financial markets could have a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Pavlovian\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd reaction to the EU referendum vote. If Britain chooses to Brexit on June 23, then it would have a negative impact on growth and the pound, and push inflation up, he argued. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important not just for those in financial markets to understand that, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important also to (be) straight with the British people about that. But Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg accused the governor of peddling government propaganda. In one of the more ill-tempered exchanges seen recently, Rees-Mogg argued that the Bank had broken its own rules on independence, and damaged its reputation. And fellow Tory Steve Baker appeared to shock Carney, by asking him to deny that he was secretly working for Goldman Sachs. Carney said he was shocked that such a thing could even be suggested. Carney was supported by three other top officials. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent, and external MPC members Martin Weale and Gertjan Vleighe, said they shared the governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns. And the governor also revealed that he had an early peek at the Brexit paper produced by the Treasury yesterday, over breakfast with the chancellor. Before the session began, we learned that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial position was worse than thought. The UK was forced to borrow \u00c2\u00a34bn more than forecast in the 2015-16 financial year, in a blow to George Osborne. But every challenge is also an opportunity -- in this case, an opportunity to warn about Brexit fears.... Andrew Tyrie has returned from his little chin-wag with Jacob Rees-Mogg, to wrap up the session. He thanks Martin Weale for his work at the Bank of England, as this could be his final appearance before the committee. Tyrie cites Weale\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153independence of mind\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (which included several lonely, hawkish votes to raise interest rates). Tyrie then hints that Weale might have another job lined up.... We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re very grateful for your public service, and we hope it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the last. Weale keeps a straight face. And committee chairman Tyrie can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t resist causing some mischief. He then picks up a copy of the Financial Times, which reports that governor Carney is the most trusted foreigner, ahead of German chancellor Angela Merkel or the US president. Q: What did Carney make of this, as he enjoyed his porridge, or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwhatever you have in the morning, when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not having breakfast with the chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122? Carney says that the committee had to consider the impact of the EU referendum, because of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mandate. And he jokes that he assumes Tyrie won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be questioning everyone else on that list. Tyrie then suggests that IMF Christine Lagarde could \u00e2\u20ac\u0153drift by\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the committee in a few weeks time, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153if she does decide to put both feet in it\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Get the popcorn ready.... Back in the committee room, Scottish Nationalist MP George Kerevan asks about the Banks medium-term view of the UK economy. Mark Carney says that growth has slowed from the high days of 2013, when GDP was expanding by around 3% per year. Now, though, it has dropped to around 1%. Stripping out the referendum effect.... the bigger picture is that growth will move in line with supply growth, which is weaker than it was. So once the uncertainty effect of the Brexit vote fades, the Bank expects growth to return to around 2.25%, Mark Carney concludes. Get a sponge and a towel, folks -- here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the moment when the gloves came off between Mark Carney and Jacob Rees-Mogg. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jill Ward sums it up: Mark Carney displayed flashes of anger at his chief pro-Brexit tormentor on Parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Treasury Committee in his most robust defense yet of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments on the European Union vote. It \u00e2\u20ac\u0153may be inconvenient, but by our actions, and comments, we have made it more likely that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll bring inflation back to target, whatever the outcome of the referendum, sooner and more sustainably,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the governor told Jacob Rees-Mogg, the lawmaker who called this month for him to be fired. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our contribution to a better economic outcome for the British people, and for you to suggest otherwise is to try and undermine that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More highlights earlier in this blog.... The committee turns to the issue of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current account deficit. Mark Carney says there would be a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnecessary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rebalancing of sterling (a fall, basically), if Britain chose to leave the EU. And that would have an import on exporters, meaning the domestic sector would increase relative to the export sector (ie, Britain would sell less overseas, at least for a while). However, Carney insists that talk of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sterling crisis\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is overdone. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Telegraph cartoon will amuse those who take government Brexit warnings with lashings of salt. The committee then turn to the weapons available to the Bank to stimulate the economy. MPC member Gertjan Vleighe says he believes another round of quantitative easing (buying bonds from banks with newly created money) would still be effective. And there is still room to cut bank rate. Jacob Rees-Mogg then gets up and leaves the room, with a polite nod to the witnesses. Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie then hops up and follows him...... #curious.... Steve Baker MP then leaves Mark Carney briefly speechless, by asking him to refute the suggestion that Goldman Sachs have pushed him into the Brexit debate. Baker tells the Bank governor that he is asking \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcin the spirit of goodwill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (!!).... We know that Goldman Sachs has been a donor to the Remain campaign, you are a former managing director of Goldman Sachs. Can I just give you the opportunity to refute any suggestion that Goldman Sachs may have put pressure on you to take a view? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Wow....\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, replies Carney, seemingly at a loss for words. Baker: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not an allegation - it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an opportunity to refute it. Carney refutes it with gusto: Yes, I refute it categorically... and am stunned to ever have it raised. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pretty remarkable jibe at the credibility of one of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top central bankers -- but one which conspiracy theorists will like to hear aired.... Q: Why do the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest graphs show uncertainty over UK assets falling, just as the EU referendum reaches its height, asks Steve Baker. Policymaker Martin Weale suggests that it is tracking the support for the Remain campaign. Steve Baker then turns to the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s [not unblemished] track record on forecasting You said that interest rates might rise when unemployment fell to 7%, but they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Then you said they might rise once real wages went up, but they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Then you suggested rate could go up at the turn of 2016. They didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. So.... Q: If the bank can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forecast its own actions, why should we trust your forecasts? You didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even predict the halving of the oil price. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent says no-one predicted that oil would fall so sharply. Financial markets make their best guess about these moves. Q: Well, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just proved the impossibility of making major economic predictions (such as the impact of Brexit) That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a false dichotomy, Broadbent replies. You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say that forecasting is impossible, just because you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t predict everything. Just because the future is uncertain doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that forecasting is useless, he adds. [This is an example of what Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Faisal Islam yesterday called the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpizza analogy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122:] Steve Baker MP goes next, and reduces Mark Carney to giggles. Baker, another pro-Brexit MP, tells the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top brass that he positively rejects the idea that they are wicked conspirators. Instead.... I choose to believe your wholesale innocence, completely unsullied by the grubby politics of this referendum matter. As it happens I think you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just wrong.... Baker also invites Carney to the Annual Hayek Memorial Lecture held by the IEA thinktank on 8 June, to learn the error of his ways. You can sign up here: George Selgin on stability without Central Banks During a long discussion on sterling, Ben Broadbent suggests that the pound could fall by 5% if Britain votes to leave the EU. Ben Chu of the Independent says that Mark Carney has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153doubled down\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on his concerns over the EU referendum this morning. And that could be significant, as opinion polls have found that the public trust the Bank of England governor more than Westminster\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best and brightest. Ben writes: The Governor of the Bank of England, one of the most trusted public figures in the UK, has sounded another warning about the instant economic shock Brexit would inflict on Britain. Speaking in front of MPs on the Treasury Select Committee, Mark Carney, who recent polling suggested is more trusted among the public than senior politicians, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexit to my mind would have a material impact on growth and inflation. It would be likely to have a negative impact in the short term.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Following up on his words earlier this month, Mr Carney added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I certainly think that would increase the risk of recession.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mr Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning follows a stark warning from the Chancellor yesterday, citing Treasury economic analysis, that Brexit would lead to an immediate year-long recession for the UK. More here: Asked about recent movements in the pound, Mark Carney says sterling has been tracking the probability of Britain leaving the EU (rising when Brexit looks less likely). This may not reassure critics of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence.... Carney says he saw the draft version, because it included economic forecasts, but he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give any feedback. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent, though, says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hardly looked at the Treasury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s analysis at all (which warns that Brexit would cause a DIY recession) John Mann MP now takes up the issue of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence (or lack of) over Brexit. He says the external members of the Monetary Policy Committee \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Martin Weale and Gertjan Vlieghe \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are being accused of simply \u00e2\u20ac\u0153doing whatever the governor tells you to do\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Weale points out that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s often disagreed with the rest of the committee, by voting to raise interest rates in recent years (before changing his mind). Q: But why aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the external members at the Bank speaking up against these slurs on your integrity? Vlieghe says he does resent the implication that the committee are under the control of Mark Carney, or George Osborne. He insists that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no secretive control of the Bank. No-one has told me, or asked me, about which way these discussions should go. Mann suggests that if the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s external members are truly independent, they should speak up a bit. Perhaps sensibly, Mark Carney declines to comment on the Brexit analysis issued by the Treasury yesterday, which predicted four quarters of recession. Mark Carney then warns that a vote to leave the EU could prompt a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPavolvian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reaction in the City, pushing up the risk premium on UK assets. But it would also be hard to the Bank to stimulate the economy, if a weaker pound drove up inflation. Rachel Reeves then questions Mark Carney about the implications of Britain leaving the EU. Mark Carney agrees that Brexit could cause the pound to weaken, creating an upside shock to inflation that would make it harder to keep interest rates low. If Britain stays in the EU, the next move in interest rates is probably up. If the public vote to leave, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s less chance of a rate rise. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent then points out that the UK economy appears to have slowed quite sharply this year - it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unclear how much of this is due to Brexit fears. Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie steps in -- perhaps worried that Mark Carney and Jacob Rees-Mogg might take their argument outside. He tells the BoE governor that many members of the commitee would have been concerned if the Bank had NOT discussed the EU referendum. Labour MP Rachel Reeves than puts the boot into Rees-Mogg, saying: If anyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation has been damaged by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the Bank of England. Jacob Rees-Mogg MP now accuses Carney of being influenced by chancellor George Osborne. As the gloves come off, Carney insists that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not being played by government. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no possibility of undue influence from the Treasury\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Carney insists. It wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work anyway, even if they tried Q: So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very convenient that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re putting out the same propaganda as the Chancellor? I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accept that at all, Carney replies. Q: But you have a duty to remain apolitical. How can anyone trust you on interest rates now? Our comments might not please you, Carney shoots back, but it has improved the chances of the economy recovering from the Brexit undertainty. To suggest otherwise is to try to undermine it. Rees Mogg insists that Carney has become politically involved... I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth replying to, says Carney, trying to swat the pro-Brexit MP aside. Q: What contact have you had with George Osborne about the referendum? Mark Carney says he has had a series of conversations around how membership of the EU allows the bank to achieve its monetary targets. Ultimately we can achieve the inflation target whether we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in the EU or not. And there have also been conversations about the impact of Brexit on financial stability, and on the mechanics of potentially exiting the EU, Carney says. Q: How would any directions from the government come? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect it in writing, and in public, Carney says - he wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accept \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinformal direction\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Mark Carney warns that sterling has been hit since November by the single issue of whether Britain stays in the EU, or leaves. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why the Bank was right to flag up that the referendum could change monetary policy, he argues. Rees-Mogg isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed: pointing out that a Labour government in his lifetime proposed re-introducing capital controls. Yet the Bank wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give a view on a general election - but here it is, wading into the referendum issue. Your comparison is essentially false, he tells Carney. Now Jacob Rees-Mogg MP, a pro-Brexit MP, takes the microphone. Q: In general elections, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give a view on opposition policies, so why is the Bank giving its view on Brexit? Carney explains that the EU referendum is a single event that creates a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdiscrete risk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to monetary policy, while a general election does not, as policies are implemented over time. Q: But a change of government is a discrete event, Rees-Mogg gently insists. You get a new economic policy and a new chancellor. Carney argue that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still not a single event whose impact can be clearly identified. The Treasury committee now turns to other top officials from the Bank of England. First Martin Weale, who sits on the monetary policy committee which sets interest rates. He says Brexit would probably have a materially negative impact on growth and inflation, in the short term. And that would increase the risk of recession, Weale adds. Dr Gertjan Vleighe, another independent MPC member agrees. It is likely that there would be a material slowing in growth, inflation would rise, the exchange rate would fall, if Britain votes to leave the EU, Vleighe explains. Ben Broadband, deputy governor, says he agrees too. Q: So is there anyone on the MPC who disagrees? Governor Mark Carney says there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t - the Committee is united on this one. Q: How about the Financial Policy Committee? (responsible for financial stability). Carney says they are also concerned about the referendum: It is the consensus view of the FPC that Brexit represents the biggest domestic risk to financial stability. Q: And there are no dissenters on the FPC either? No, Carney replies. The key points so far: Next question for Mr Carney.... Q: Is it acceptable for the International Monetary Fund to turn up a week before the EU referendum and give its views? [explainer: the Fund is due to publish its full health check on the UK, including in-depth calculations on the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBrexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 effect, next month] Quite frankly, I have no influence over the IMF, says Carney. Q: But is it acceptable? The thrust of the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s views on this issues is well known, Carney argues Q: But is it a good idea for the IMF to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcjump in\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with both feet, at such a crucial political time? Carney says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only expecting to get \u00e2\u20ac\u0153detail\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from the IMF about the UK economy next month.... Mark Carney begins his hearing by defending the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that Britain could plunge into recession if it leaves the EU. Asked what principles and guidelines are being used for such forecasts, the governor says the Bank has adopted \u00e2\u20ac\u0153substantially the same rules as the UK civil service\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one big difference - civil servants support a minister, while the Bank is independent and doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t support government policy. And the Bank will soon go into purdah, to prevent any officials saying anything controversial in the run-up to the June 23 referendum. However, the Bank will be setting UK interest rates on 16 June, and will release the minutes of its meeting on that day Q: So we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exclude the possibility of anoher intervention in the Brexit debate, asks chairman Andrew Tyrie.... It can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be excluded, Carney agrees. But in his judgement, the Bank has already highlighted the main issues. So he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to say anything new on the 16th. There is a lot of uncertainty in the economy at the moment, so the Bank could be over-or-under-estimating the strength of the economy, Carney concludes. Bank of England governor Mark Carney is appearing before parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Treasury committee to answer questions about the UK economy, and his warnings against Brexit. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a livefeed. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure to hit its borrowing targets last year are a blow to chancellor George Osboene, as he tries to rally the country to remain in the EU. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says: The upwardly revised shortfall for 2015/16 leaves the Chancellor open to criticism that he clearly missed the 2015/16 public finances targets that were set out as recently as March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and could well be used by supporters of the UK leaving the EU as evidence that the Treasury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts are unreliable (although the public finance forecasts are actually done by the Office for Budget Responsibility). Breaking: Britain missed its borrowing target last year by more than previously expected. The UK borrowed almost \u00c2\u00a376bn in the 2015-16 financial year to cover the deficit, according to new figures just released by the Office for National Statistics. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost \u00c2\u00a34bn more than the \u00c2\u00a372bn estimate set by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also \u00c2\u00a32bn more than the ONS initially estimated last month. On the upside, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a315.7bn less than Britain had to borrow in the previous 12 months -- but still a long way from George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target of a surplus. The ONS also reports that the UK borrowed \u00c2\u00a37.2bn in April (the first month of the new financial year). That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a30.3bn lower than in April 2015, and the lowest for any April since 2008. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also more than expected, with corporation tax receipts weaker than expected. The pound has jumped this morning, after a new opinion poll gave the Remain campaign a big lead. Sterling has gained half a cent against the US dollar, to $1.4538. This comes after the Daily Telegraph reported that the campaign to stay in Europe holds a 13-point lead over the Brexit camp. And crucially, the poll showed more support for Remain from older voters and Conservative supporters (there is some overlap, of course...). Cue a monstrous jump in the pound.... Elsewhere in the eurozone, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest bank has just had its credit rating slashed. Deutsche Bank has been downgraded by one notch by Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to Baa2, which is just two notches above Junk. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warned that Deutche\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent performance has been weak, after seeing profits halve in the last quarter. And it also faces \u00e2\u20ac\u0153substantial operating headwinds\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, including the record low interest rates in the eurozone, and uncertainty over the global economy. CEO John Cryan, who has been pushing a turnaround plan and cutting bonuses, says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvery disappointed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by the news. In an encouraging sign for Athens, the yield on Greek debt has hit the lowest level since last November. Investors are buying into Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government bonds, in the hope that the country is less likely to default on its bonds. That shows they are expecting Greece to receive its much needed \u00e2\u201a\u00ac11bn of bailout funds from the eurogroup today. This has driven down the yield on 10-year Greek debt down to 7.35%, from 7.37% yesterday. A small move, but in the right direction. Yields move inversely to bond prices, and this chart shows how they soared last summer as Greece flirted with crashing out of the eurozone. The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mehreen Kahn explains why this eurogroup meeting is a little different: She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also produced this graph, showing why the IMF is demanding deeper Greek debt relief (as explained earlier). European stock markets have opened in the red, as investors watch to see how today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurogroup meeting proceeds. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX led the declines, down 0.5% . The City is watching to see whether Greece receives funds to help it cover this summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt repayments, and for clashes between the eurozone and the International Monetary Fund. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx explains: Whilst it seems almost guaranteed that Greece will receive this monetary boost, things aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so cut and dry. The IMF is reportedly refusing to participate in this latest bailout without Greece being granted \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcupfront and unconditional\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 debt relief. The issue continues to be the one major division over the treatment of Greece, and could cause a few heated debates among the Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance ministers as they try and bridge the schism between those fiercely opposed to the idea and those willing to cut the country some debt-slack. A surge in investment helped Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy to grow at the fastest pace in two years. The Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden has reported that capital investment jumped by 1.8% in January-March, with building activity surging by 2.3%. Consumers, though, were more restrained, as private consumption rose by 0.4%. And that meant Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP jumped by a punchy 0.7% in the last quarter, confirming the initial estimate two weeks ago. Economists, though, reckon growth is now slowing.... Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurogroup meeting begins at 3pm Brussels time, or 2pm in the UK. And the AFP newswire explains why it matters: Greece urgently needs the next tranche of bailout money to repay big loans to the European Central Bank (ECB) and IMF in July, and has already fallen behind in paying for everyday government duties and public sector wages. The outcome of the meeting remains highly uncertain, due to a row between Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors, the eurozone governments and the International Monetary Fund, over the state of the Greek economy and debt relief. Royal Bank of Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economics team are quite confident that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors will agree to hand over \u00e2\u201a\u00ac11bn of bailout loans today. They told clients: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting of euro area finance ministers will be focused on Greece. On Sunday, the Greek parliament passed a package of tax increases and reforms along with the contentious contingency to be deployed in the event of the 2018 budget going off track. Assuming it finds the measures acceptable, Eurogroup is expected to disperse the next tranche of programme funds (c.\u00e2\u201a\u00ac11bn) which would allow Greece to meet forthcoming debt repayments and clear arrears which have built up as the review has dragged on. The focus then moves on to debt relief with the ministers set to discuss options for debt relief that have been drawn up by officials as the euro area looks to bridge the gap between it and the IMF on the sustainability of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt and allow the IMF participate in the latest Greek programme. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nine months since Greece signed up to its third bailout, after months of torturous negotiations and deadlock climaxed in an all-night summit meeting. And today, Athens could finally pass the first review of that programme, unlocking \u00e2\u201a\u00ac11bn in loans to help ward off another financial crisis. Eurozone finance ministers will gather in Brussels this lunchtime for a Eurogroup meeting. They are likely to agree that the austerity package of tax rises and reforms passed by Greek MPs on Sunday go far enough. But the relief could be short-lived. Although Greece will get a pat on the head for doing its best, there are still serious tensions between its creditors. Last night, the International Monetary Fund made a significant intervention, warning that the Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to give Greece some debt relief simply don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go far enough. It also insisted that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal targets are simply unachievable. The Fund is pushing European creditors to forgo any Greek debt payments until 2040 and to also peg the borrowing costs at 1.5%. That would be politically awkward for some eurozone members, such as Germany, as it could expose them to further Greek bills. The Fund also wants Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt relief wrapped up in two years, undermining the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goal of delaying some debt relief until after the current bailout expires in 2018 (after the next German federal elections). In a clear challenge to the eurozone, the IMF declares: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The implementation of debt relief should be completed by the end of the programme period. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Providing an upfront, unconditional component to debt relief is critical to provide a strong and credible signal to markets about the commitment of official creditors to ensuring debt sustainability, which in itself could contribute to lowering market financing costs. An upfront component can also help garner more ownership for reforms.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd So it could be a difficult meeting.... Also coming up today... Bank of England governor Mark Carney will be in the spotlight this morning, when he testifies to parliament about the latest Quarterly Inflation Report. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll surely face criticism from pro-Brexit MPs, over his prediction that Britain could fall into recession if it leaves the EU. The punch-up hearing starts at 10am, and City experts are predicting a lively one.... Before that, the latest UK public finance figures are released, at 9.30am, showing how much Britain had to borrow in April. DIY chain Kingfisher and building society Nationwide are both reporting result this morning. Oil giant Shell is holding its AGM. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also getting two pieces of German data. The second estimate of GDP in the last quarter is just being released, confirming that the economy grew by 0.7%. The ZEW institute is publishing its estimate of investor confidence at 10am.",

The ratings agency said:</p> <blockquote> <p>The agreement reached between Greece and its eurozone creditors reduces the risk of another Greek liquidity crisis this summer, and incentivises the country to complete its third bail-out programme. However, with little debt relief offered upfront, the Greek government may find it progressively more difficult to continue with politically controversial measures required to meet ambitious programme commitments. Implementation risk therefore remains high.</p> <p>The agreement highlights the improved relations between Greece and its official creditors since last summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s often confrontational negotiations leading up to the current ESM programme. The Greek government has implemented prior actions, including pension reform and a contentious requirement for additional fiscal contingency measures to safeguard the 2018 budget target.</p> <p>For their part, Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official creditors have agreed to possible debt relief (nominal haircuts are still excluded)...</p> <p> Delivering debt relief in stages and contingent on programme performance could incentivise the Greek authorities to meet programme targets. However, given the track record of slippage under previous programmes in the past five years, we think there is still a high risk that the 2018 surplus target will be missed despite the agreement on a contingency fiscal mechanism. This risk could increase if the conditionality in Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement meant that sizeable debt relief came to be seen by Greek politicians or the public as a distant or unattainable prospect.</p> <p>A question mark is therefore likely to remain over the sustainability of Greek debt in the medium term. While gross financing needs are modest over the next few years, substantial increases in gross financing requirements would follow in the long term without further debt re-profiling.</p> <p>Our \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCCC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sovereign rating, which we affirmed in March, reflects risks to programme implementation and debt sustainability. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5745c9b8e4b00a2e2e3a0720\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-25T16:07:31.676Z\">5.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The Eurogroup \u00e2\u20ac\u0153breakthrough\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on debt relief was no such thing, </strong>says Joan Hoey, Greek analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit:</p> <blockquote> <p>The coveted debt relief upon which the [Greek] prime minister has been banking, to provide a political fig leaf for his acceptance of another bailout, remains out of reach, contingent and unquantified.</p> <p>The Eurogroup did not finalise the long-delayed first review of the bailout programme.

To participate financially in the programme before the end of the year, the IMF would need to approve a new debt sustainability analysis (DSA) on Greece that would meet its normal lending standards.</p> <p>For Germany too, the deal amounted to a trade-off. Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble, German finance minister, met his two main red lines: no haircuts and no Bundestag votes before the German federal elections in 2018.</p> <p>But to secure the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political participation, he made a concession: an implicit commitment to meeting a DSA that will be hard to retreat from.

                "bodyText":"News of the Greek debt deal has seen stock markets record some good gains - apart ironically from in Athens - while Greek bond yields have fallen sharply. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax added 1.47%, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 1.13% higher, while Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB rose 1.66% and Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 2.32% higher. But after an early 1.5% rise, the Athens market ended virtually unchanged, slipping back 0.04% amid the threat of further strikes in protest against the proposed pension and tax reforms. Greek two year bond yields are currently down 80 basis points at 7.4% as investors welcomed the progress in the bailout talks. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. After Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s saying the Greek deal was credit positive, Fitch has also welcomed the late night agreement but warned of possible problems implementing reform measures. The ratings agency said: The agreement reached between Greece and its eurozone creditors reduces the risk of another Greek liquidity crisis this summer, and incentivises the country to complete its third bail-out programme. However, with little debt relief offered upfront, the Greek government may find it progressively more difficult to continue with politically controversial measures required to meet ambitious programme commitments. Implementation risk therefore remains high. The agreement highlights the improved relations between Greece and its official creditors since last summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s often confrontational negotiations leading up to the current ESM programme. The Greek government has implemented prior actions, including pension reform and a contentious requirement for additional fiscal contingency measures to safeguard the 2018 budget target. For their part, Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official creditors have agreed to possible debt relief (nominal haircuts are still excluded)... Delivering debt relief in stages and contingent on programme performance could incentivise the Greek authorities to meet programme targets. However, given the track record of slippage under previous programmes in the past five years, we think there is still a high risk that the 2018 surplus target will be missed despite the agreement on a contingency fiscal mechanism. This risk could increase if the conditionality in Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement meant that sizeable debt relief came to be seen by Greek politicians or the public as a distant or unattainable prospect. A question mark is therefore likely to remain over the sustainability of Greek debt in the medium term. While gross financing needs are modest over the next few years, substantial increases in gross financing requirements would follow in the long term without further debt re-profiling. Our \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCCC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sovereign rating, which we affirmed in March, reflects risks to programme implementation and debt sustainability. The Eurogroup \u00e2\u20ac\u0153breakthrough\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on debt relief was no such thing, says Joan Hoey, Greek analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit: The coveted debt relief upon which the [Greek] prime minister has been banking, to provide a political fig leaf for his acceptance of another bailout, remains out of reach, contingent and unquantified. The Eurogroup did not finalise the long-delayed first review of the bailout programme. It looked at the reforms passed so far and found them wanting. It concluded that several conditions \u00e2\u20ac\u0153prior reforms\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will have to be met before any money can be handed over. The release of funds would then follow in two sub-tranches, the first amount of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7.5bn in June, depending on successful completion of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153prior actions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The balance of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.8bn will be released only after the clearance of government arrears and after the government has met milestones related to the privatisation fund, bank governance, the revenue collection agency and the energy sector. This disbursement is scheduled for the end of the third quarter. The Eurogroup won a commitment from the IMF, with which it has been at loggerheads over debt relief, to participate in the bailout, pending approval from the Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s executive board. We retain our view that disaffection in the party and among the electorate will grow, posing risks to political stability and Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s membership of the eurozone. And now some comments emerging from the IMF: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a timeline of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s incoming bailout funds and outgoing payments in the next few months: European markets are holding onto their gains as they head to the close. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: Stocks extended gains on Wednesday as a tentative agreement on Greek debt relief and a fresh seven-month high in the price of US oil offered more cause for optimism. Banks were top risers for a second day as markets price-in the earnings benefit of a possible US rate rise in the summer. Banks in the peripheral of Europe most exposed to Greek debt, including Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Banco Santander, were top performers. Less exposure to Greece and weak earnings from M&amp;S weighed on the FTSE 100, which rose less than its European counterparts. Greek shares rose and the yield on Greek Debt fell after the IMF and Germany deferred a quarrel on Greek debt relief until 2018... Greece avoiding another cliff-edge moment is undoubtedly positive for markets, which already face the uncertainty of the Brexit referendum and Spanish elections in June. The funds to be released following the late night Eurogroup agreement should last Greece until the end of October when the second review of the bailout programme is due start, according to the Athens-Macedonian News Agency. It says: The \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10.3bn tranche that the Eurogroup decided to disburse to Greece will fully meet the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financing needs until the end of October, when the second review of the Greek programme is set to start, Eurozone officials said on Wednesday. Describing the events behind the scenes at Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurogroup, the sources said that the IMF and Europeans had reached a compromise in spite of their different initial positions, while confirming that the IMF will participate. According to one EU official, this was not so much a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153power play\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but more that all sides moved from their initial position, with the IMF fully understanding that the Eurozone operates in a different way from the fund. Regarding the measures for the debt, the European sources said that there were no \u00e2\u20ac\u0153immediate decisions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but this was not a surprise, since there were no debts maturing in the short term. In the medium-term, the Eurozone countries said they will examine the possibility of buying up debt to the IMF early, or the bilateral loans with Eurozone countries, using the unspent funds (approximately 20 billion euros) originally destined for the recapitalisation of the banks. This would, however, require the approval of some national parliaments. According to Eurozone officials, the chances that Greece can return to borrowing from the markets at reasonable interest rates at the end of the programme are much higher following the agreement at Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurogroup. They said that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s access to the markets can begin to be restored gradually, in the second half of 2017, and that the aim is to restore full market access by the end of 2018. The more credible Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic policy, including its success in delivering primary surplus targets, the smaller the spreads on Greek bonds will be, though borrowing from the Eurozone will always be cheaper, the same sources said. The second review of the Greek programme would begin at the end of October, they added, noting that the measures that remained to be taken will not be as difficult as those required by the first review. In Greece trade unionists are already flexing their muscles and planning mass industrial action, reports Helena Smith. Strikes are expected to start tomorrow when workers at the Piraeus Port Organisation and Thessaloniki Port Organisation begin a 48-hour walk-out in opposition to the controversial privatisation programme the government has signed up to. Adedy, which represents employees in the public sector, has also decided to hold a Pan-Hellenic work stoppage on June 8. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We decided, today, after meeting health and education federations that we would take this action to protest all the things that these new measures mean: lack of staff, underfunding, appointments that should, but will never happen,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Adedy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief policy maker, Grigoris Kalomoiris told the Guardian. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Eurogroup was a fiasco for Greece. The government was just a spectator while Germany rode roughshod over everyone else and made all the decisions. To conclude the review we agreed to sell off all our public wealth and impose more of the same counter-productive measures. It makes no sense. Come September/October we foresee mass and dynamic reaction because it is then that the measures will start to kick in.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kalomoiros said the trade union now firmly believed the only way out for the debt-stricken country was to leave the eurozone. Back with German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble. According to Bloomberg he has said a fourth Greek bailout programme is not needed as of now. As expected, US markets have followed their counterparts elsewhere and moved higher in early trading, partly buoyed by the Greek agreement overnight and continuing strength in the oil price. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 124 points or 0.7% while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.28% and Nasdaq 0.34% better. The moves came despite some weaker than expected US services and composite PMI data. Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble also said there were no major changes to the Greek bailout programme, according to Reuters, so there was no need for German parliamentary approval. German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble has said last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s result on Greece was a good one, and the next tranche of aid can now be paid out. But it looks like it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all sweetness and light with the IMF: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a link to the transcript of the comments by Klaus Regling, head of the European Stability Mechanism, after last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurogroup meeting: Markets continue to be buoyed by the early morning Greek deal, although are now off their best levels. Banks are among the main movers, both on the Eurogroup agreement and because a rise in US interest rates, which could come as early as June or July, is likely to bolster their balance sheets. In Greece, the Athens market is currently up 0.45%, while the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10 year bond yields are down 8 basis points at 7.3%. Two year bond yields are currently down 87 basis points at 7.37%. Elsewhere in Europe, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is up 1.4%, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 1.1%, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB is up 1.3% and Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex has added 2.1%. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 is up 0.6% and on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is forecast to open around 73 points higher. The European Central Bank holds its regular meeting next week and some are hoping that it will discuss reintroducing a waiver to allow the central bank to accept Greek bonds (as UniCredit suggested below). FastFT reports (\u00c2\u00a3): Greek officials are optimistic that the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top monetary policymakers will take a big step towards rehabilitating the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking system next week, by deciding to accept Greek bonds as collateral for the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s loans for the first time in more than a year. The ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governing council...will meet next Thursday in Vienna. Officials are likely to use the Vienna meeting to discuss whether to reintroduce a waiver that allows the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank to accept Greek debt in its regular auctions of central bank cash. Athens is confident that the council will support the reintroduction of the waiver. The waiver was scrapped in February 2015 as the crisis escalated. Someone else who thinks Germany gave the least ground at the marathon Eurogroup meeting, given the delay on any major decisions on debt. Economist Tullia Bucco at UniCredit Research said: In our view, there are two important features in this framework that are intended to provide reassurance to the European creditors for which Greece poses a thorny political issue: 1. The bulk of the debt-relief measures will only be granted at the end of the program in 2018, if necessary, and 2. Long-term relief measures remain very vague. All in all, Germany can be considered to be the winner of the negotiations, given that any major decision on debt relief will only be taken after next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general elections, whereas the IMF committed to participate financially to the program already before the end of 2016. The agreement could also pave the way to returning Greek banks to some kind of normality: Last but not least, we think that the deal would soon allow the ECB to reinstate the waiver for Greek bonds posted as collateral at its refinancing operations. This is good news for Greek banks. There were some tired faces at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ECOFIN meeting, among ministers who worked late into the night on the Greek agreement. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, looked positively pensive at one point: Tsakalotos also had an expressive chat with Pierre Moscovici, EU Commissioner for Economic Affairs... All sides made some concessions at last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurogroup meeting, but it does seem that Germany gave the least ground. Writing for Macropolis, the Greek analysis site, Yiannis Mouzakis explains: German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble is probably the one participant in the Eurogroup that completely achieved his objective. His only concession is that he had to compromise on his initial stance that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt does not need to be discussed before 2023. There is nothing in this agreement to make him uncomfortable beyond that. It does not require any major changes to the programme\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s modalities, the targets remain, large-scale debt measures are not due to happen until after the German elections in autumn next year and the IMF has committed that it will go to its board with a recommendation to participate in the Greek programme with financing and a new programme that will ensure policing of compliance and reform implementation. Yiannis also cautions that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal could turn sour in a few months, particularly if the IMF concludes that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt relief doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go far enough. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the piece: A Eurogroup deal that might be hard to stomach Over in Greece, the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supporters have hailed the eurogroup deal. Opponents, though, have dismissed it - and argued that Greece must leave the euro. Our Athens correspondent, Helena Smith, reports The sense of d\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00a0 vu \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the underlying current of this six-year crisis \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was in full play this morning, in the media, on the streets and in the commentary of politicians, trade unionists and businessmen, the actors in the drama. While pro-government newspapers lauded the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153white smoke\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that had finally appeared at the end of a gruelling 11-hour euro group, opposition newspapers slammed it as a sham. Avgi, mouthpiece of prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 leftist Syriza party, enthused: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The review has been concluded, roadmap [agreed] for the debt.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The paper quoted Syriza\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prominent MEP Dimitris Papadimoulis as saying Athens had finally moved on from vagaries to concrete plans regarding the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staggering debt pile. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are no longer speaking about the debt in general, vague terms but have a framework of an agreement, a concrete roadmap,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said of the decision to deal with debt load in three stages, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good decision that allows us to turn the page.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd On the streets, however, enthusiasm was remarkably muted. Shopkeepers shrugged off any suggestion that Greece was about to turn the corner. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It might bring some stability,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Panos Tsekouras who runs a textile store in the heart of downtown Athens. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see the drama of last year but once the summer is over and the taxes have piled up who is going to pay the bill? There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be mayhem.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Opposition politicians from the left and right described the deal as a fiasco. Speaking to the Guardian, Panaghiotis Lafazanis, the former energy minister who broke ranks with Syriza to set up the breakaway anti-austerity Popular Unity party, predicted it would be only a matter of time before there was widespread reaction when the government tried to enforce new taxes and cuts. Lafazanis told me: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to enforce the measures it has agreed to. This is an agreement that solves no problems and on the contrary creates new ones. Greece, simply, cannot survive in this currency. There will be a disorderly default and ultimate exit from the euro that will be all the worse for not being planned.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Austria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, Hans J\u00c3\u00b6rg Schelling, hopes that the eurozone will avoid a summer of Greek debt drama. Analyst Wolfango Piccoli of Teneo Intelligence is concerned that Greece hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t won the solid commitments which prime minister Alexis Tsipras has promised. That may make it harder for Tsipras to hold his small parliamentary majority together, and implement the unpopular austerity measures it has agreed to. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wolf\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key points: After prolonged talks, Greece and its international lenders achieved a deal about the conclusion of the on-going review in the early hours of 25 May. The standoff between Germany and the IMF has \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for now \u00e2\u20ac\u201c been settled by careful reference to the possibility of limited debt relief measures. While this is a move in the right direction from the Greek perspective, the roadmap remains vague and the eventual meaningful debt relief measures distant. Athens remains stuck with harsh fiscal targets and reform commitments but only vague promises of debt relief, leaving Tsipras badly exposed domestically. The Greek agreement is part of a broader strategy to avoid rocking the boat until Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum is over, argues my colleague Jonathan Freedland. He writes: Whatever the rights and wrongs of the [Greek] austerity argument, Cameron has wanted the issue to go away \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at least for another month. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout loan has achieved that. Rating agency Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has just announced that the Greek deal is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153credit-positive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s says the promise of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10.3bn of bailout loans alleviates the danger that the country defaults this summer. It also welcomes the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153road map\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on debt relief agreed by creditors, although it is light on details. Although the announcement doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide specifics on the type of relief, it is clear that material relief will be considered only after the program expires in 2018 and remains contingent on the Greek governments\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ability to implement successfully the conditions associated with the program. However, the agency is also concerned that Athens will struggle to implement the measures agreed with creditors. We consider implementation risks in Greece to remain high, given the small governing majority, weak institutions, and the backdrop of political and social discontent.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mihir Kapadia, CEO at Sun Global Investments, is relatively upbeat about the deal: The Eurozone provided Greece with a firm offer of debt relief yesterday at a meeting of finance ministers in Brussels, a decision which could see the Euro provide \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10bn in new funds for the country. The IMF seems to have softened its stance significantly from its hard line position as it had previously insisted that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed programme did not offer a path to fiscal sustainability. The positive conclusions to these talks are a good sign on a number of fronts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c showing flexibility by the IMF and European ministers, and some early signs of improving confidence in Greece. Greek 10-year bond yields fell below 7% this morning for the first time since November 2015.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to need a new metaphor.... Yanis Varoufakis, Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former finance minister, has given the deal the thumbs-down: A year ago, Varoufakis was doing battle with the eurogroup on a weekly basis (at least, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how it felt), trying to persuade fellow ministers to abandon their push for austerity packages laden with tax rises. That approach died after the Greek people voted to reject creditors demands\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, only for prime minister Tsipras to sign up to the third bailout. If you missed the Greek agreement, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s online here: The Financial Times has a good word to describe the Greek deal - \u00e2\u20ac\u0153messy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the really sticky issue, of how to make Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 debts sustainable, has been kicked down the road. Although the creditors have made commitments, the agreement released in the early hours of this morning is light on detail. Mehreen Khan and Alex Barker sum it up: The ambiguities are legion. A target was set to maintain Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gross financing needs at no more than 15 per cent of national income until 2030. And measures were outlined to do that, including maturity extensions and a possible buyout of IMF loans in 2018. The caveat: no numbers were agreed on what relief the measures would actually deliver. And while the IMF dropped its most ambitious debt relief demands \u00e2\u20ac\u201d including the need for them to be automatic when Greece exits its programme in 2018 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d there was a big caveat. To participate financially in the programme before the end of the year, the IMF would need to approve a new debt sustainability analysis (DSA) on Greece that would meet its normal lending standards. For Germany too, the deal amounted to a trade-off. Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble, German finance minister, met his two main red lines: no haircuts and no Bundestag votes before the German federal elections in 2018. But to secure the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political participation, he made a concession: an implicit commitment to meeting a DSA that will be hard to retreat from. And language was softened on the requirement for Greece to meet a 3.5 per cent budget surplus target for at least the next 10 years; this would now be reviewed in 2018. More here: Messy Greek debt deal leaves key questions unanswered In another reassuring signal from the markets, the yield on 2-year Greek bonds has tumbled below the 10-year bond yield. Why does that matter? Because it means investors are now rating Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s short-term debt as less risky than its longer-term borrowings. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how markets usually operate -- but for months Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two-year yields (which rise when prices fall) have soared over the 10-year yield. Why? Because if Greece can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t repay its debts, it will default on shorter-dated bonds first. This chart, from Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 John Geddie, explains all: Although the London market is at a three-week high, City investors do recognise that the details of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt relief are still up in the air. Joshua Mahony of IG explains: Eurozone discussions finally reached a conclusion regarding the restructuring of Greek debt, yet the outcome was far from constructive as ministers decided to kick the can by simply resume talks after the French and German elections. This issue will drag on for years and there is a feeling that the Greeks will say whatever they need to in order to get a good deal. With austerity crippling the Greek economy, the hopes of it standing on its own two feet and paying back its debts anytime soon seem negligible. Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit is also concerned about Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt mountain, which is currently 180% of GDP. The International Monetary Fund is coming under fire from debt campaigners this morning. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re disappointed that the Fund has abandoned its commitment to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153upfront\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Greek debt relief as part of last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal. Instead, medium-term debt relief will only kick in around 2018 - and the details are still Sarah-Jayne Clifton, Director of the Jubilee Debt Campaign, says this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t acceptable: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153IMF staff are proposing to lend more money to Greece without the upfront and unconditional debt relief they called for. This is a major climb down, which once again breaks the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own rules not to lend when they know a debt cannot be paid. Last night, the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Poul Thomsen agreed that the Fund had made a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmajor concession\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, in order to reach a deal. In return, all creditors agreed that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debts are unsustainable, paving the way to debt relief over time. Clifton though, insists that action is needed now. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Eurozone finance ministers cannot keep repeating this pattern of sticking plaster measures followed by near defaults and all night crisis meetings for the next 40 years. Only significant cancellation of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt now, including payments coming due now such as to the IMF and ECB, will help tackle the humanitarian crisis in the country and restore the lack of confidence which is holding back Greece and the wider European economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Economist Megan Greene, of asset management firm Manulife, says Berlin appears to have won last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tussle in Brussels: Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has jumped by 1.4% in early trading, led by bank stocks. Greek government bonds are on an absolute tear this morning, as fears of a disorderly default fade away. The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-year bonds are rallying hard, driving down the interest rate (or yield) on the debt below 7% for the first time since last November. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an important sign \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 7% is traditionally the level where a country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debts are unaffordable. So investors are calculating that this agreement is significant, despite the doubts and question marks. Henrik Enderlein, director of the Jacques Delors Institute, sums up the deal: After a few hours sleep, Eurozone ministers are returning to the Justis Lipsius building for a full Ecofin meeting with EU ministers. They won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be discussing Greece - instead, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be debating an anti tax avoidance Directive. Commissioner Pierre Moscovici just shared a touching embrace with Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem. A cheerful-sounding Dijsselbloem then says that last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement with Greece is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153really important step\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. All sides realised we had to get a deal, he says, even though we all realised it would be difficult. The IMF was asking a lot, and we were asking a lot of Greece. But the deal brings the IMF on board, strengthens confidence between all sides, and thus should improve confidence within the eurozone. Q: So are we 100% sure that the IMF will be on board? No, Dijsselbloem says. The Fund must conduct its own debt sustainability analysis, and the final decision is up to its board. Marc Ostwald of City firm ADM Investor Services is also underwhelmed by the deal: This is another to be sorted under \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccan kicking\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, leaving any decision on genuine debt relief until 2018, after the French and German elections, but also not creating any precedents or short-term crises which might influence the Italian municipal elections on June 5, the UK Brexit referendum on June 23 or the Spanish election on June 26. It also continues to impose austerity measures which will continue to strangle the Greek economy, per se ensuring that the next crisis moment in the Greek saga will not be far away. European stock markets have jumped in early trading. The news that Greece will finally receive the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10bn bailout tranche is easing concerns of another eurozone financial crisis over the summer, on top of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum. In London, the FTSE 100 has swiftly gained 40 points, or 0.6%, to 6255. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its highest level since May 3rd. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX has gained 0.8%. Peter Spiegel, the FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former Brussels bureau chief, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t completely convinced by the agreement. Last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal may not be perfect, but it appears to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dckick the can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 down the road until after France and Germany have gone to the polls in 2017. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets explain: \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7.5bn will be released in June that will allow Greece cover maturing IMF and ECB loans in June and July and begin to clear arrears which have built up as the review process has stalled. The outstanding portion of the payment will then be made after the summer. There was also agreement on a roadmap for Greek debt relief. In the short term this is mainly through managing the interest rate and repayment profile of euro area loans. Further out, there was commitment on further measures once the programme is completed in 2018. While not quite the unconditional debt relief the IMF had called for in its assessment of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt sustainability, the measures are sufficient for the Fund to stay involved in the programme although that will still have to be formally approved by the IMF board. The deal means that Greece should now be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcparked\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 until after next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s German general and French presidential elections but, equally important, any decision on Greek debt relief won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to be taken in the German parliament until after the next autumn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote. Money is pouring into government debt issued by the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker members this morning, as investors react to Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt real. This has driven down the yield (or interest rate) on peripheral government bonds -- a sign that traders are happy to buy these riskier assets. Reuters has the details: Portugal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-bond yield fell 4.8 basis points to a three-week low at 3.02%, while Spanish and Italian 10-year bond yields fell to one-month lows at around 1.51% and 1.40% respectively. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The agreement between Greece and its creditors is positive for risk sentiment and in turn peripheral bond markets,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Rene Arecht, a derivatives market analyst at DZ Bank. I imagine we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also see a rally when the Greek stock and bond markets open shortly.... Our Brussels correspondent, Jennifer Rankin, explains how the IMF has backed down over its demands for immediate Greek debt relief: European officials have agreed to unlock \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10.3bn in bailout money for Greece as the International Monetary Fund made a significant climbdown in its demand for upfront debt relief for the recession-hit country. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s international creditors emerged from an 11-hour meeting in Brussels at 2am on Wednesday having agreed on steps to ease the burden of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u201a\u00ac321bn (\u00c2\u00a3245bn) debt mountain, worth 180% of annual economic output. But the debt relief plan was a far cry from the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153upfront\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unconditional\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd debt relief the IMF had demanded on Monday, when it warned that Greece would face an ever-growing bill to service its loans. Poul Thomsen, director of the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European programme, said the IMF had made \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a major concession\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We had argued that [debt relief measures] should be approved up front and [now] we have agreed that they should be made at the end of the programme period. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s her full dispatch from Brussels, a few hours ago: Good morning. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sense of relief in the eurozone this morning after Greece and its creditors finally hammered out a deal to unlock \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10bn in bailout funds, and trigger work on debt relief. After a lengthy meeting, which we liveblogged through the night, ministers emerged to report that a breakthrough had been reached. Both sides appear to have given some ground to get the deal onto the table. One the one hand, all creditors have agreed that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt mountain is unsustainable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c suggesting Germany has given up some ground. On the other, debt relief isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as immediate or concrete as the International Monetary Fund has been demanded, meaning the Fund has made concessions too. If you were snoozing during the action, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key points: 1) Greece has finally received the green light to receive more than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10bn in bailout funds, easing concerns that it could face financial peril this summer. A few prior actions do remain, concerning pensions and privatisations, but once that is resolved, the money will flow -- starting with \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7.5bn in June. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem told reporters that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s programme was back on track. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We achieved a major breakthrough on Greece which enables us to enter a new phase in the Greek financial assistance programme.... This is stretching what I thought would have been possible not so long ago.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 2) In an important development, the International Monetary Fund has signalled that it could join the bailout. That could happen by the end of 2016. However, the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European chief Poul Thomsen insisted that the Fund must check that the eurozone is offering substantial debt relief. In a rare public appearance, Thomsen said: We welcome that all stakeholders recognise that Greek debt is unsustainable. We welcome that it is understood that Greece needs debt relief to make it sustainable. 3) Eurozone ministers have agreed to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a package of debt measures\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to make Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debts sustainable. That will start with short-term tweaks to Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debts, to smooth out its obligations. Medium-term measures are also promised, although not until 2018, which looks like a concession from the IMF. There is also a commitment to consider whether further restructuring will be needed once the bailout ends, assuming Athens sticks to the programme and everything works out. However, this doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear to be as comprehensive, wide-ranging and unconditional as the IMF has been demanding. 4) The deal has been generally welcomed by Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister. Euclid Tsakalotos said it would help end the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vicious circle of austerity and recession. Donald Tusk, the head of the European Council, said the Greek deal was good for the global economy. Slovakia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister Peter Kazimir also sounded satisfied, comparing the negotiations to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a complicated birth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. And France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michel Sapin was positively upbeat, saying the deal was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153first and foremost a declaration of confidence in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Greece.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But that was last night. Now that people have slept on it (however briefly), we should get some proper reaction.",

If CPI is used, pension entitlements increase by around 1% less per annum than under CPI. Over a 15-20 year period, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 15-20% reduction on the size of an individual\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pension.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whether or not a scheme has the flexibility to adopt CPI comes down to how the lawyer wrote scheme rules before 2011. Some schemes, such as British Airways, allow the flexibility to adopt CPI. Others, such as British Steel, clearly don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcscheme rules lottery\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in respect of RPI and CPI.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>And what would it mean for an individual? Fortes has the answer:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153For a British Steel pensioner with a \u00c2\u00a35,000 per annum pension, a move to CPI will see them \u00c2\u00a350 worse in year one, \u00c2\u00a3100 in year two and so in.

A number of bidders have made it clear that the British Steel Pension Scheme (BSPS) presents a major challenge to any sale. We also fully understand the great importance of this pension scheme to both current and former steelworkers and steel communities across the UK.</p> <p>There has been a lot of speculation that any sale of Tata\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assets would involve the BSPS going into the Pension Protection Fund (PPF). The trade unions believe that such a move would be an unmitigated disaster. The PPF is a financial safety net but it would see every member of the scheme take an unnecessary cut in pension benefits. The financial health of the BSPS is such that going into the PPF can certainly be avoided.</p> <p>We welcome the announcement of a government consultation on the future of the BSPS and the trade unions will of course make a full submission in due course. It is important that all stakeholders continue to explore all available options that avoid the need for the scheme to go into the PPF, which would be the worst deal for scheme members. We will seek to work constructively with the UK Government and the scheme trustees to deliver the best possible deal for our members. We need to ensure that there are cast iron safeguards in place so this unique situation does not result in employers dodging their pensions responsibilities.</p> <p>It is important to remember that Tata Steel remains the employer and sponsor of the BSPS. They have significant legal, social and moral responsibilities with regards to the British steel industry and those men and women who have worked and continue to work within it.</p> <p>As we have done so throughout this process, we will continue to be led by our members in the steel industry. In the midst of this crisis and great uncertainty, they continue to produce world class steel that supports the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s entire industrial base. The steel industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highly skilled and dedicated workforce will surely be the foundation on which a sustainable, profitable future for the industry will be built.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CommunityUnion/status/735800469847715840\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BREAKING: Joint statement on British Steel Pension Scheme from the steel trade unions <a href=\"https://t.co/SCuYDL9lIA\">https://t.co/SCuYDL9lIA</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SaveOurSteel?src=hash\">#SaveOurSteel</a></p>&mdash; Community union (@CommunityUnion) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CommunityUnion/status/735800469847715840\">May 26, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-05-26T14:22:51.633Z\">at 3.22pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57470033e4b006af16bc0aa1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-26T14:01:12.848Z\">3.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The proposed pension changes are controversial for another reason.</strong></p> <p>The prospect of workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pension rights being cut has prompted Tata to reconsider selling its UK assets at all!

                "bodyText":"Time to wrap up. A quick recap: MPs have urged Sajid Javid to treat cautiously, after the business secretary confirmed that the government is considering cutting the pension entitlements of British Steel workers. During an urgent statement in parliament, MPs from across the House warned of the risk that other organisations try to follow suit, potentially hitting millions of workers in the pocket. During the session, Javid explained that the scheme\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Trustees had proposed shifting the scheme to a lower inflation rate [from RPI to CPI], to cover its \u00c2\u00a3700m deficit. He also promised not to be hasty, despite giving just four weeks to consult on the proposal. Jo Stevens, Labour MP for Cardiff Central, said it was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153potentially very risky and precedent-setting proposal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Neil Gray, the SNP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment spokesman, said the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153incredibly sensitive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd pensions issue must be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153handled with extreme care\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by the Government. Otherwise, he fears it could create: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a very dangerous precedent that undermines workplace pensions and incentives to save to secure dignity in retirement\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. And Frank Field, who chairs parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pensions committee, warned that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153thousands of other schemes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are in a similar predicament. Javid had just returned from meeting with Indian conglomerate Tata. He told MPs that there are seven credible bidders interested in buying Tata\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assets. But he refused to comment on rumours that Tata is now considering keeping its plants, if the proposal for pension cuts is accepted. Full coverage of the session, complete with questions from a stream of MPs, starts here. Unions representing Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s workers have welcomed the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to launch a consultation today. They said it would be an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unmitigated disaster\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if the scheme had to be rescued by the Pensions Protection Fund. One expert has predicted that the proposed change to inflation indexing would save the scheme \u00c2\u00a32.5bn, and steadily eat into a pensioners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 income. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest story on the Steel crisis, which will be updated later: And in other news.... Economists are worried that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy suffered a drop in business spending in the last quarter, dragging growth down to 0.4%. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum appears to be partly to blame, along with the financial market turmoil in January and the slowing global economy. In another worrying sign, the proportion of young people not in education, employment or training has jumped. The oil price has fallen back below $50 per barrel, after setting a new 2016 high this morning. And in the eurozone, French protesters have scuffled with police, as dock workers set off smoke bombs and union activists disrupted fuel supplies and nuclear plants. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all part of a new protest against labour market reforms, giving Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois Hollande\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government another headache. Shifting the British Steel pension scheme from the Retail Prices Index to the Consumer Prices index, as the Trustees have proposed, would wipe \u00c2\u00a32.5bn of its liabilities. So says Clive Fortes, Partner at Hymans Robertson, a pensions consultancy firm. Fortes explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In 2011 the Government changed statutory pension increases from RPI to CPI. If CPI is used, pension entitlements increase by around 1% less per annum than under CPI. Over a 15-20 year period, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 15-20% reduction on the size of an individual\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pension. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whether or not a scheme has the flexibility to adopt CPI comes down to how the lawyer wrote scheme rules before 2011. Some schemes, such as British Airways, allow the flexibility to adopt CPI. Others, such as British Steel, clearly don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcscheme rules lottery\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in respect of RPI and CPI. And what would it mean for an individual? Fortes has the answer: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For a British Steel pensioner with a \u00c2\u00a35,000 per annum pension, a move to CPI will see them \u00c2\u00a350 worse in year one, \u00c2\u00a3100 in year two and so in. Over a typical pensioners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 lifetime this is a loss of \u00c2\u00a315,000 of lifetime savings. On the plus side, this only one third of the average loss on falling in to the Pension Protection Fund. The government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed changes to the British Steel pension scheme could prompt a row with the European Union, according to the Financial Times. It says: If the government legislates to amend the rules governing one pension fund \u00e2\u20ac\u201d for a struggling industry \u00e2\u20ac\u201d it could raise alarm bells in Brussels: it is likely to be seen as state aid by EU officials. This won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a problem, though, if Britain votes to leave the EU next month (on the day the consultation closes). The FT also flags up the winners and losers from the plan: In the 40-page consultation document it emerged that not all members of the scheme would be better off under the proposals. Some 5,800 would be worse off, 70,000 would be in the same situation and 40,000 would be in a better situation. (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s compared to entering the Payment Protection Fund, which would also prompt a cut to benefits) Parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Business, Innovation and Skills committee has just moved a step closer to getting Mike Ashley, boss of Sports Direct, to testify before them. The committee has written to Askley, declining his invitation to visit his Shirebrook warehouse. Instead, they expected to see the retail titan in their committee room on June 7 to face questions about working conditions at Sports Direct. Committee chairman Iain Wright also warns Ashley that they may also hear some critical comments about working practices (something the Guardian exposed last year). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full letter: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steel union have welcomed the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to open a consultation on making changes to the British Steel pension scheme. They confirm that the deficit - now \u00c2\u00a3700m, it appears \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is a serious hurdle to finding a buyer for Tata\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s operations in the UK. Crucially, they warn that it would be a disaster if the scheme fell into the Pension Protection Scheme \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the lifeboat for failed pension scheme. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full statement: The steel trade unions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Community, Unite and GMB \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have been in dialogue with the UK Government and Tata Steel for a number of weeks to secure a sustainable future for our industry. A number of bidders have made it clear that the British Steel Pension Scheme (BSPS) presents a major challenge to any sale. We also fully understand the great importance of this pension scheme to both current and former steelworkers and steel communities across the UK. There has been a lot of speculation that any sale of Tata\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assets would involve the BSPS going into the Pension Protection Fund (PPF). The trade unions believe that such a move would be an unmitigated disaster. The PPF is a financial safety net but it would see every member of the scheme take an unnecessary cut in pension benefits. The financial health of the BSPS is such that going into the PPF can certainly be avoided. We welcome the announcement of a government consultation on the future of the BSPS and the trade unions will of course make a full submission in due course. It is important that all stakeholders continue to explore all available options that avoid the need for the scheme to go into the PPF, which would be the worst deal for scheme members. We will seek to work constructively with the UK Government and the scheme trustees to deliver the best possible deal for our members. We need to ensure that there are cast iron safeguards in place so this unique situation does not result in employers dodging their pensions responsibilities. It is important to remember that Tata Steel remains the employer and sponsor of the BSPS. They have significant legal, social and moral responsibilities with regards to the British steel industry and those men and women who have worked and continue to work within it. As we have done so throughout this process, we will continue to be led by our members in the steel industry. In the midst of this crisis and great uncertainty, they continue to produce world class steel that supports the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s entire industrial base. The steel industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highly skilled and dedicated workforce will surely be the foundation on which a sustainable, profitable future for the industry will be built. The proposed pension changes are controversial for another reason. The prospect of workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pension rights being cut has prompted Tata to reconsider selling its UK assets at all! That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to The Times, which reported today that: The sale of Tata Steel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK assets has been thrown into confusion after speculation that the business secretary has offered Tata a deal so attractive that it may yet keep Port Talbot and a dozen other facilities around the country. One of those sweeteners is said to include an accommodation to downgrade the retirement benefits of members in the British Steel Pensions Scheme to try to keep a lid on the \u00c2\u00a315 billion fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a3485 million deficit. But some ministers are apparently fighting the proposal, fearing that it would open a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Pandora\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Box\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and prompt other companies to cut entitlements too. My colleague Graham Ruddick sums up the key exchange from the steel session (which starts back at noon BST) Sajid Javid, the business secretary, said the trustees had asked the government to make the scheme exempt from legislation in the 1995 Pensions Act. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The scheme\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trustees have come forward and asked us to look at current legislation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Javid told MPs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The scheme trustees have put forward this proposal and it is only right that we consider it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, said the plans \u00e2\u20ac\u0153risk setting a very worrying precedent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and questioned whether the government can ensure that any changes to pension laws are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153safely ring-fenced\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest story on the issue: In Yes Minister, Jim Hacker defined a dangerous precedent thus: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we do the right thing this time, we might have to do the right thing again next time.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But several MPs who spoke in parliament this lunchtime are worried that the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans for British Steel could create the wrong sort of precedent, and hurt millions of workers in the pocket. And I think they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re right to be concerned. As Sajid Javid pointed out, the suggestion to switch inflation linking from RPI to the (lower) CPI rate came from the British Steel trustees themselves. Other trustees wrestling with similar pension deficits are likely to be pondering whether a similar shift could work for them. Javid pointed out that the only thing preventing the British Steel trustees is current legislation (pesky laws, eh?). And we must assume that this legislation could be changed, if the consultation backs the plan. I say if, but the Trustees have already concluded that the change would mean workers are either better off, or no worse off, than other options. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Angela Eagle didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let Javid off lightly, though \u00e2\u20ac\u201c reminding the House of the minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure to fly to Mumbai in March, when Tata decided to pull out of the UK. Eagle also put her finger on a serious concern -- the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consultation closes in four weeks time. Is that really enough time to consider such a serious issue? And how much time will be spent deliberating? Tata are clearly determined to get a sale quickly, so there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of pressure on the government. On a brighter note, Javid had just returned to the UK from Mumbai, where he met with Tata\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top brass. He still seems optimistic that a deal will be found, with seven credible bidders showing serious interest. But still..... the precedent of changing pensions rules to that workers get less than they were promised has clearly worried MPs on both sides of the house. Several members pushed Javid to confirm that any changes would just be ringfenced to British Steel, not used as a template for other companies. The business secretary did indeed give that assurance, but some MPs looked pretty concerned. Not just Labour -- Conservative Julian Knight pointed out that there is a fundamental principle here. Pensioners are entitled to receive what they were promised when they paid into a scheme. Javid also appeared to indicate that steel workers wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a ballot on the changes. And finally, Labour MP Madeleine Moon of Bridgend says that other companies are already poaching skilled steel workers. Q: Shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the government give an assurance that public sector contracts will always demand a high percentage of British steel, to underpin confidence? Javid says that the government has already allowed economic and social factors to be taken into account. And he repeats that the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promise of financial help has also provided confidence. And that is the end of the session Geriant Davies, Labour Co-operative MP for Swansea West, tells the house that he warned the government that minimum carbon pricing would hurt the steel industry. Javid agrees that energy costs are important, but not the only factor facing steel plants. Q: Does the government still want to grant China \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmarket economy status\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (which the European Parliament voted against this month) Javid says the European Commission is considering the issue, but it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t prevent tariffs being imposed on Chinese steel. Clive Betts MP asks the government to act on energy costs, which mean steel works pay 85% more than German rivals. Javid repeats that the government has already acted on this issue, and is prepared to do more. Sue Hayman MP asks the business secretary to reassure steel workers that they will get their full pensions. Sajid Javid agrees that steel workers have worked hard for their pensions, so the government must do everything possible to find the best outcome. The SNP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Margaret Ferrier asks about proposals to change the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclesser duty rule\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, which allows Chinese steel firms to sell their products in the UK without a hefty tariff. Javid says there are ways to improve the lesser duty rule, but doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe it should be scrapped. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Paul Flynn says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll soon qualify for a pension after 30 years in the steel industry, but it will be dwarfed by House of Commons pension. Isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it repugnant that workers in such a dangerous, skilled, industry are being asked to pay to cover their pension deficit? Javid says the government will leave no stone unturned to find a buyer for Tata\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK assets. Richard Fuller, Conservative MP, makes an important point -- could any future surplus be transferred out of the pension fund? Javid agrees that pension benefits should always go to those who have paid in. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s David Anderson raises the issue of miners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pensions, saying retired workers are suffering from government decisions in the past. Javid says that the proposals on the table today are different to what happened in the 1990s. [some background: in 1994, the government took half of the surplus in the miners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pension scheme, but some workers then missed out on their half due to pension rules] Kevin Foster, Conservative MP, urges the government to ringfence any pension changes Javid repeats that this is a one-off situation. Javid then warns that unless changes are made, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very likely that the British Steel pension scheme would have to be rescued by the Pension Protection Fund (which would also result in a cut to benefits). Q: Will any changes to the British Steel pension scheme be put to a ballot of members? Javid says that the Trustees already have the right to change the indexing, but they are prevented by legislation. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important that full information is provided to members, he adds. So, no ballot? Asked again about steel-dumping, Sajid Javid says that British steel is the best in the world - and some companies have come to regret buying inferior foreign alternatives. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jessica Morden asks what the government is doing to reassure companies who buy British steel, such as Nissan (who have a plant in her constituency, Newport East). Sajid Javid says the government has been speaking to customers and telling them that British steel has a long-term future. Conservative MP Steve Double asks what impact the climate change levy introduced by Gordon Brown has had on the steel industry. Sajid Javid says the government is providing support and exemptions to help companies with energy costs. Kevan Jones MP raises the importance of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steel industry to the defence sector. Javid says 95,000 tonnes of British steel will be used in the new Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier. Q: Could potential bidders work in partnership to help the steel industry? Javid says that the field of seven bidders will be narrowed, and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confident that Tata would be amenable if bidders wanted to work together. Asked about timings, Savid Javid says there is no deadline to find a buyer - but Tata want to move quickly. Redcar MP Anna Turley, says the government has acted disgracefully over the steel crisis and urges Javid not to inflict more pain on workers. (a steel plant in Redcar closed last autumn with the loss of 1,700 jobs). Sajid Javid says that more details about the proposed pension plans will be released soon, which should provide reassurance to workers. Conservative MP Mark Spencer wants reassurances that any deal will work, and that MPs won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be back discussing this issue in two years. Javid repeates that there is no deal yet, and any deal depends on the approval of the Pension Regulator. Dennis Skinner MP raises the issue of the miners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pension scheme, saying the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lousy rotten Tory government\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd refused to provide any help. Javid says this doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have anything to do today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s issue. Conservative MP Julian Knight says the government must retain the crucial principles that members always have the final say, and that pension promises are delivered. Javid agrees that the integrity of the pension system must be retained. He repeats that the pension scheme trustees believe that changing the inflation indexing is in the best interests of its members. Seema Kennedy, Conservative MP for South Ribble, asks what support is being given to steel workers and their communities. Javid says that the best support is the confidence that there is a long-term future for the UK steel industry. That includes the offer of hundreds of millions of pounds of investment, that could see the government buying a 25% stake. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jo Stevens asks what discussions have taken place with the pensions regulator about this \u00e2\u20ac\u0153potentially risky and precedent-setting proposal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Javid says discussions have taken place, and confirmed that they would need to have the regulator\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full support. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tom Blenkinsop says his father in law is a British steel pensioner. Q: What would happen if the scheme were taken into the Pension Protection Fund? Sajiv Javid says that if this happened, workers would still get 100% of their pension but the indexing would probably move to the CPI inflation rate. Conservative MP Peter Bone says the government needs to get to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153root of the problem\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the dumping of Chinese steel. Q: Why can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the government impose higher tariffs, as the US just did? Javid says the government has acted when there is evidence of steel dumping. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Stephen Kinnock, who represents Port Talbot, raises media reports that Tata could actually retain its UK assets. Javid declines to comment on these rumours, saying the government wants to work constructively with all potential bidders. Conservative David Mowat asks whether changing the benchmarking from RPI to CPI inflation will bring the British Steel pension scheme into surplus. Q: If not, could workers face a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153double-whammy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if the scheme later moves into the Pension Protection Fund? The trustees believe it would bring the scheme into surplus, and make it stable, Javid replies. But the pension regulator would have to be satisfied first. Frank Field, who chairs the work and pension committee, points out that many other pension schemes are in deficit. It will be hard to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 these plans just to the steel industry. He asks for a discussion after the recess, to consider the full impact of the proposed changes. Javid says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happy to meet with Field to discuss the issue, and repeats that the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans are restricted to the steel sector. Tom Pursglove MP asks if the government knows whether more investment could come to steel works in his constituency, Corby. Javid says commercial details are sensitive, but there are seven serious bids on the table. Iain Wright MP, who chairs the business, innovation and skills committee,is also worried about the precedent issue. Q: Is this deal purely for steel, or is it being extended to other strategically important industries? And is the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preferred option the 2012 deal for Royal Mail, which distinguished between past and future contributions? Javid says there is no deal yet, and no preferred option and no decision has been made. He repeats that the government is keen not to create a dangerous precedent. This is a unique case. Conservative MP David Davies, of Monmouth, commends Sajid Javid for his efforts to save the UK steel industry. But he urges the business secretary to proceed carefully Javid agrees that the government shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be reckless, but points out that the trustee of the Pension Scheme has announced his support. SNP MP Neil Gray is disappointed by the lack of detail in the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans. Q: How would it affect current workers, and could it be a dangerous precedent? Javid says the government must tread carefully, and avoid creating any precedents that the House would regretted later. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right to listen to the Trustees\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 concerns. Onto questions. Pauline Latham, Conservative MP, asks about another crisis - the future of BHS. A company in her constituency, Courtaulds, which supplies the stricken retailer has gone into administration. Can the government help? Sajid Javid agrees to meet Latham to discuss Courtaulds. Sajid Javid defends the short length of the consultation - time is of the essence in the search for a buyer. He says the trustees of the British Steel pension fund approached the government, asking for changes to be made. Javid confirms that legislation in the 1995 pension act prevents the trustees from benchmarking pensions against the consumer price index (CPI) rather than the retail price index (RPI). They want the government to allow a change. The trustees believe that, in almost every case, members would be better off, or no worse off, he says. But the government must assess whether it is the right thing to do - thus the consultation. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow business secretary, Angela Eagle, responds. She reminds the house that steel workers protested outside parliament yesterday. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointed that Sajid Javid didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give any more details about the pensions consultation in his statement. And is worried that the consultation will only run for four weeks. She says the business secretary was right to visit Mumbai this week -- a case of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153better late than never\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (a reference to his notorious trip to Australia when the steel crisis blew up) Eagle is worried that moving from the RPI inflation rate to the CPI version \u00e2\u20ac\u0153risks creating a very dangerous precedent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. And it is currently illegal. She asks if the government can ring-fence any such move, to protect other workers. And finally, has the secretary of state considered the impact on the incentive to save, if pensions rights can be arbitrarily cut. The steel crisis is ultimately about the workers who make Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steel industry the best in the world, Javid continues. We will continue to fight for British steel for a long as it takes, he adds. Sajid Javid begins by telling MPs that he just returned from Mumbai a few hours ago. During his trip, he stressed the importance of Tata running a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153responsible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sales process for its UK steel operations. There are several credible bids on the table, which Tata is now considering closely. The government will continue its dialogue with Tata, and those bidders. Javid says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job to pick a winner, but to help with the sales process and remove potential obstacles. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why they have launched a consultation into the pension scheme today. Javid: Several credible bids for Tata\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK steel works Business secretary Sajid Javid is on his feet, updating the House of Commons on the British Steel pensions consulation. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being streamed on the BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Parliament site. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll cover the main points in this liveblog. One of the City of London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top experts on pensions is worried about the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan. Tom McPhail, head of retirement policy at financial service group Hargreaves Lansdown, says: In this case, a change of escalation rates could be the least worse solution. But the potential deal on British Steel could rip a hole in one of the most fundamental principles of pension provision. It is well-established that pension benefits, once granted cannot be taken away. The government should be very cautious about sacrificing such a principle in pursuit of short term interests, even if there are tens of thousands of jobs at stake. McPhail adds that a proper review of final salary guarantees is needed. The situation in the British steel pension fund is worse than first thought.... Opposition MPs have already criticised the government for suddenly launching this consultation, just before the House of Commons breaks for a recess. This one-month consultation is due to end on the same day as the EU referendum.... The trustee of the British Steel pension fund is backing the government over its plans to potentially cut pension payments to workers. Allan Johnston believes this would be a better outcome for members than entering the Pension Protection Fund (when there is an automatic 10% reduction to benefits) My colleague Graham Ruddick explains: The government believes if it can significantly restructure the pension scheme then Tata Steel can be persuaded to keep the business. Sajid Javid, the business secretary, has said the government is willing to offer hundreds of millions of pounds to a buyer and is looking at ways to restructure the pension scheme by reducing its liabilities by billions of pounds. However, there is a row within the government about Javid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to cut the scheme\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liabilities by benchmarking it against the consumer price index (CPI) rather than the retail price index (RPI) and spinning it off into a new financial vehicle. The Department for Work and Pensions is concerned that this could set a dangerous precedent for defined benefit pension schemes, also known as a final salary scheme. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: There are important developments in the crisis gripping Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steel industry, which could hit pensioners in the pocket. The government has announced a new consultation into overhauling the British Steel Pension Scheme. That scheme, currently in deficit, is a stumbling-block to finding a buyer for several steel plants including the Port Talbot blast furnace. Pensions minister Stephen Crabb has told parliament in a written statement that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The consultation includes a full range of options that consider whether and how the scheme could be separated from the existing sponsoring employer and whether it will be necessary to reduce the benefits within the scheme.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Scheme has liabilities of around \u00c2\u00a315bn, and a deficit of around \u00c2\u00a3700m \u00c2\u00a3485m . Crabb\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement is fuelling concerns that pensioners across the country could suffer, if benefits due to steel workers are cut. A former pensions minister, Steve Webb, has warned that the government was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153going down a very dangerous path\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in seeking to change the law. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Everyone has huge sympathy for steel workers and for efforts to protect jobs, but rushed changes to pension rules risk driving a coach and horses through the pension security of hundreds of thousands of workers, well beyond the steel industry.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Business secretary Sajid Javid is expected to update the House of Commons shortly... We should remember that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector has been becoming increasingly dominant for decades, partly due to the sweeping changes during the Thatcher government: Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, fears that the UK economy has continued to slow in the current quarter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Looking ahead to Q2, the latest Services Index release showed services output falling in March providing a weak starting point for expansion. While early days, a run of weak activity surveys in April also casts a gloomy note, suggesting that the economy will see a further deceleration in growth. A cloudy international outlook and the prospect of rising inflation at home will present ongoing headwinds.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, says the 0.5% fall in business investment last quarter is a clear sign that Brexit fears are hurting the Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. He warns: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Global concerns have eased more recently, but uncertainty related to the EU referendum could lead to a further moderation in growth in the second quarter as some businesses continue to defer investment and hiring decisions. But the economy should rebound in the second half of the year in the event of a vote to Remain. City traders agree. Joshua Mahony of IG says: The downward revision of GDP to 2% suggests that perhaps the recovery we have been looking for after 18 months of slowing growth just isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there. Perhaps the most telling figure today was the Q1 business investment reading, which contracted for the second consecutive quarter. This is a clear indication of the fear that firms are experiencing regarding the effects of a Brexit and makes you wonder what this number would look like in the event the UK left the EU. Tom Floyd of Foenix Partners concurs: The weaker annual growth rate (2%) is further confirmation of the Brexit related negativity already embedded in the wider economy and aside from recent retail sales, continues a poor run of UK economic indicators. Anyone remember George Osbornes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153March of the Makers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd? It seems to have taken a wrong-turning. Ms Lee Hopley, Chief Economist at EEF, says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is suffering from problems overseas, and the EU referendum: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The data confirms a softer start to the year as households continue in the driving seat with their foot on the gas Business investment, however, slipped further and net trade again failed to support GDP growth. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s far from a surprising picture given the wobbly world economy at the start of the year is providing little impetus to export growth or, confidence amongst business to press ahead with big expansion plans. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While the referendum is just another dampening factor in the mix, on the other side of it we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need to see a more supportive external environment and a lot more certainty about the domestic industrial policy agenda to see a return of better balanced growth this year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures also confirm that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector is outperforming everything else. Services output jumped by 0.6% during the last quarter, but construction shrank by 1.0% and manufacturing declined by 0.4%. The pound has fallen by half a cent against the US dollar, following the news that business investment fell by 0.5% in the last quarter. Breaking: UK growth slowed to 0.4% in the first quarter of 2016, down from 0.6%, the Office for National Statistics reports. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in line with the first estimate, released last month. But the annual growth rate has been revised down to 2%, from 2.1% initially. And business investment has fallen, for the first time in three years. Business investment fell by 0.5% during the quarter, driven by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153falls in non-residential building\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the ONS says. That may show that companies are more cautious about economic prospects and have been cutting back. That could be due to the recent turmoil in the financial markets, or the EU referendum. However, gross fixed capital formation growth (another measure of corporate investment) did rise by 0.5% in January-March after shrinking in the previous three months. The figures also show another deterioration in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade with the rest of the world. Exports declined in the last quarter, while imports rose. The trade balance deficit widened from \u00c2\u00a316.4bn in Quarter 4 2015 to \u00c2\u00a318.0 billion in Quarter 1 2016 . Following a 0.1% increase in Quarter 4 2015, exports decreased by 0.3% in the latest quarter, while imports increased by 0.8% in Quarter 1 2016 following a 0.9% increase in Quarter 4 2015. Nearly time for those UK growth figures.... Tomas Casasi-Klett, Professor at the University of St Gallen, says the world leaders gatherer in Tokyo have a lot to worry about. He argues that Shinzo Abe was right to warn of a potential Lehman Brothers moment today: The G7 will be about keeping all black swans at bay, starting with the Brexit one, we are at a point where the world is evermore fearful of a black swan, a Minsky moment*. A number of events could mirror the Lehmann trigger we saw in 2008, these include a Trump victory in November or unexpected economic volatility in China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s markets. However, a Brexit is now the most immediate and plausible candidate for such a trigger - it would activate other triggers across the globe, a chain-reaction of sorts originating with British voters. [* - That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hyman Minsky, the economist who showed that financial crises are caused after over-confident investors drive asset prices too high, using cheap credit to fuel speculative trading] Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum is just four weeks away, and City traders are getting nervous. The cost of hedging against wild swings in the value of the pound over the next month has jumped this morning. It hit its highest level since March 2009, in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Those contracts now cover the referendum day, and the day after, when the pound is likely to be volatile \u00e2\u20ac\u201c\u00e2\u20ac\u201c whichever side wins. Shares in miners and oil producers are rallying this morning, following the jump in the oil price. The sight of Brent crude nudging over $50 per barrel is boosting confidence in the City, while a weakening US dollar is pushing up other commodity prices too. Mike van Dulken, Head of Research at Accendo Markets, explains: Energy and Mining stocks are topping the FTSE this morning with gains of 2-3% after Brent Crude broke back above the symbolic $50/barrel 6-month highs overnight and an easing in US Dollar strength benefits the greenback-denominated raw materials space as a whole. But he also points out that a high oil price could encourage firms to boost oil production: Sceptics will point to the breakout by oil \u00e2\u20ac\u201c inspired by a drop in US oil stockpiles on top of falling US output and global supply problems \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as likely attracting shale/frackers back to idle rigs. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PM, Shinzo Abe, has apparently warned G7 world leaders that we could suffer a crisis on the scale of Lehman Brothers in 2008. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the Nikkei news agency The world economy is high on the agenda for the G7 meeting, with Abe pushing fellow leaders for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflexible fiscal spending\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (ie, higher government investment) and structural reforms. My colleague Claire Phipps is live-blogging the whole G7, here: Leaders have taken time out to plant a few trees. Maybe they wanted to show the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgreen shoots of recovery\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, but frankly it looks more like a productivity problem -- nine world leaders to plant three trees?! Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an example of the supply disruptions that has pushed the oil price up, from Reuters: A Nigerian youth group leader confirmed on Thursday that militants had attacked a Chevron oil facility in the Niger Delta. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The attack truly happened,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Eric Omare, spokesman for the Ijaw Youth Council, said. A group called Niger Delta Avengers had claimed the attack late on Wednesday. Oil prices have hit their highest level of the year, after figures showed that the long-running glut in crude prices could finally be eroding. Brent crude, sourced from the North Sea, has jumped over the $50 per barrel mark. This is the highest level since last November, and could herald higher energy costs and petrol prices. The move comes after data, released yesterday, which showed that US crude inventories fell last week. It appears that the industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supply problems, particularly wildfires in Canada and outages in Nigeria, are now hitting home. And analysts are predicting that this means oil reserves will start to be eroded, if demand remains above supply. Citi explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153US oil inventories have largely topped out and should decline through the summer.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And if they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re right, it will have implications for global inflation rates, and possibly nudge central bankers closer to raising borrowing costs (as cheap energy has been keeping the cost of living down). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We get a proper insight into the state of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy this morning, when the second estimate of GDP for the first quarter of 2016 is released, at 9.30am. The figures should confirm that growth slowed to just 0.4% in January-March, meaning Britain lagged behind the eurozone. But we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also get much more detail, on how trade, investment and consumption changed during the quarter. Economists will be looking for signs that the slowdown in overseas markets, such as China, hurt the UK. We could also see some early impact from June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum. The figures are likely to show that, once again, Britain relied on domestic spending rather than exports to keep the economy moving. RBC Capital Markets explain: Private consumption growth is once again expected to make the main contribution to total growth with net trade likely being a drag. Expectations for business investment will also be muted given that the approaching EU referendum became a more high profile source of uncertainty during the period. Also coming up.... World leaders are gathered in Tokyo for the G7 meeting, so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see what Angela Merkel, David Cameron and the gang say about the global economy: And investors will also be watching Greece, following the agreement hammered out with euro ministers. Yesterday, the IMF cautioned that it still isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet ready to join the bailout; meaning more uncertainty for Athens over the next few months.",

                "bodyText":"The closing scores on European markets showed: The FTSE 100 fell 40 points or 0.64% to 6230.79 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 0.68% to 10,262.74 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.53% lower at 4505.62 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 1.45% to 18,025.25 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.91% at 9034.0 But in Greece, the Athens market added 0.93% to 646.97 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 88 points or 0.5%. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Inmarsat looks set to leave the FTSE 100 in the quarterly reshuffle announced on Wednesday. The changes are based on Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s closing prices, and its near 4% fall making it the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest faller in the index has confirmed the inevitable. The changes need to be ratified on Wednesday, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty safe to say Inmarsat will be replaced by Hikma Pharmaceuticals, as forecast. Companies set to be demoted from the FTSE 250 are: Jimmy Choo, Highbridge Multi-Strategy Fund, Interserve, Lookers, Melrose Industries, Northgate and Ophir Energy. They are likely to be replaced by: Ascential, CMC Markets, Countryside Properties, CYBG, Hill &amp; Smith, Metro Bank and Smurfit Kappa Group. European markets have ended the last day of the month on a downbeat note, with declines accelerating through the day after a Guardian/ICM poll showing the Brexit camp firmly in the lead ahead of June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum. The poll knocked sterling lower which in turn unsettled equity investors. Mixed signals from the US economy also took the shine off shares. Markets had seemingly been taking the prospect of a US rate rise, perhaps as early as June, in their stride, supported by the idea that at least the US economy was showing signs of strength. But ahead of the non-farm payrolls figures due on Friday, weaker consumer confidence and manufacturing figures put a bit of a dent in that theory. There was also some caution ahead of some key events this week. As well as non-farms there is the latest meeting of the European Central Bank and a get-together of Opec ministers. So the FTSE 100, which had been heading for a fourth successive monthly rise, actually ended May slightly in the red. But European shares fared better, with the Stoxx 600 index rising 1.7% on the month, its best performance since October. With metal prices hit by the stronger dollar, copper declined more than 7% in May, the biggest monthly fall since November. Gold has lost nearly 6%, again its worst peformance since November. Oil has recorded its fourth monthly rise in a row, helped by output disruptions from Nigeria, Libya and Canada. With markets slipping lower, Joshua Mahony at IG said: What looked like a boring day in the markets has been kicked into gear as the European indices fell sharply after a surprise EU referendum poll in favour of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcleave\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 campaign. Most notably, with the FTSE attempting to break out of its 30 point range that has dominated the past week, this could set the groundwork for a very volatile week. Today has seen a substantial amount of data released, and with a whole week of economic data risk ahead, traders will be wary of increased unpredictability in the coming days. Then there is the US data: At a time when markets have been seemingly focusing on the positives of a stronger economy rather than the looming possibility of a rate hike, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data highlights the fact that while a hike is likely, consumers may not feel so optimistic. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise in the Fed preferred core PCE measure of inflation paves the way for a potential hike in the summer, yet with consumer confidence on the wane, it is clear the everyday person is not looking forward to the prospect of higher rates. Two Guardian/ICM polls showing voters moving in favour of the UK leaving the European Union have helped send sterling to a one week low against the dollar and euro. The pound fell nearly a cent to $1.4547 after news of the polls, while the euro rose 0.8% to 76.72p. As a consequence, stock markets are slipping back on concerns about the disruption which might be caused by a Brexit vote. The FTSE 100 is down 0.4% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is 0.3% lower. See the latest EU referendum developments in our live blog here: And another May miss. The Dallas Fed Texas manufactuing index has come in at -20.8, down from -13.9 in April and well below expectations of a figure of -8. And more on the Chicago PMI numbers: On the confidence figures, Lynn Franco at the Conference Board said: Consumer confidence declined slightly in May, primarily due to consumers rating current conditions less favorably than in April. Expectations declined further, as consumers remain cautious about the outlook for business and labor market conditions. Thus, they continue to expect little change in economic activity in the months ahead. So after a couple of pieces of US data which beat expectations, we have two in a row which have disappointed. The US consumer confidence index came in at 92.6 in May compared to forecasts of 96. This is down on the April figure of 94.7 (itself revised up from 94.2). This is the lowest level for the Chicago PMI since February and the sixth time it has been in contraction over the past 12 months. Index compilers MNI said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Barring a solid revival in June, the second quarter could be the weakest outturn since the fourth quarter of 2015 given the April-May average of just 49.9.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd MNI chief economist Philip Uglow said: While expectations are that growth in the US economy will bounce back in the second quarter, the evidence from the MNI Chicago Report shows activity weakening from an already low level. Firms ran down stocks at the fastest pace for more than 6 years in May, and while a rebuilding over the coming months could support output, the underlying message appears to be that businesses are not confident about the outlook for growth. After the earlier strong US economic data, the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index has come in weaker than expected in May. The index fell from 50.4 in April to 49.3, below estimates of a level of 50.7. Anything below 50 signals contraction. More for the Federal Reserve to think about. Back in the US, and markets have opened virtually unchanged after the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic data came in stronger than expected and renewed talk of a possible rate rise next month. On Friday Fed chair Janet Yellen said an increase would be appropriate in the coming months. Investors remain cautious however ahead of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm payroll numbers, the last before the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s June meeting. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down around 8 points or 0.04%, torn between the prospect of a rate rise and the data showing the economy is growing more strongly than expected. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story confirming that 1,000 jobs are to go as 120 Austin Reed stores are shut: More fuel for the members of the Fed who want to raise rates before long: better than expected housing figures. US single family house prices rose 5.4% in March on a year on year basis, the same as the previous month and higher than forecasts of a 5.2% increase, according to the latest S&amp;P/Case Schiller index. David M. Blitzer at the Index Committee said: The economy is supporting the price increases with improving labor markets, falling unemployment rates and extremely low mortgage rates. Another factor behind rising home prices is the limited supply of homes on the market. Just in..... personal spending across America rose by a chunky 1.0% in April. That beats estimates of a 0.7% rise, and is the biggest jump since August 2009. It suggests US consumers were pretty upbeat about economic prospects last month. Reuters explains: The Commerce Department said on Tuesday consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, surged 1.0 percent last month as households bought automobiles and a range of other goods and services. The Commerce Department also reports that personal incomes in America rose by 0.4% in April. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in line with expectations, and means that spending is outstripping income growth. It may fuel the debate about whether the Federal Reserve could, or should, raise interest rates.... Good news! Portugal is growing twice as fast as we thought. Bad news! Portugal only grew by 0.2% in the last quarter. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the Lisbon stats office, which has revised up the initial growth estimates (from 0.1% to 0.2%) today (the FT has more details). It means the Portuguese economy has now grown for the last two years, but not fast enough to eliminate fears about the country, which was bailed out in 2011. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobless report also showed that Portugal has the fourth-higher unemployment rate in the EU, at 12%. Investors should enough the quiet of May while they can, because June is going to be very dramatic. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote on EU membership will obviously be huge, while America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy meeting could also move global markets. Mihir Kapadia, CEO at Sun Global Investments, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122As the month of May comes to an end, June looks likely to be even more volatile \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with a potential US interest rate hike, the EU referendum in the UK and the price of oil being key risk factors for a market that has been on edge for the entire year. May was a month where expectations of interest rate increases in the US were brought forward, with the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bullard the latest prominent voice to suggest that a hike is approaching fast. This week, the markets will be looking to the May non-farm payrolls data on Friday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a strong jobs number will be seen as providing the Fed with the data needed to push ahead with an interest rate hike in June.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Swiss bank UBS is also predicting plenty of action: A reminder that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big week for US economic data, especially for those wondering if the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month. It starts with US personal income figures for April, in an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time, followed by the consumer confidence report at 3pm BST. Developments in Athens.... The drop in European unemployment hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t improved the mood in a rather damp City. All the main stock markets are now in the red, as May drags to an end. The news that the eurozone is still experiencing negative inflation may be weighing on spirits, as Conner Campbell of Spreadex explains: The Eurozone-wide inflation figure, meanwhile, came in at an expected -0.1%. That is an improvement on the -0.2% seen last month, but still means that the region has spent more of 2016 in deflation territory than it has not despite the influx of new stimulus measures back in March. None of this news provided much cheer for investors. Over in Greece, scuffles have broken out between protesting port workers and riot police. The dock workers are demonstrating in the Greek capital, against plans to privatise Piraeus, the largest port in Greece. They fear the sale, which is demanded by creditors, will cost jobs. The workers have already been on strike for six days, in the latest show of opposition against Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s austerity programmes. The Kathimerini newspaper has more details: Fearing layoffs, port workers have been on 48-hour rolling strikes since last week and have said they will not return to work unless their requests are addressed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Everything, taxes, bills, the living cost, is going up. Daily food has become more expensive. And myself, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if I have job tomorrow,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said port worker Antonis Peristerakis, 49, father of two children. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I need security. I want to have food for my children. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to look for a job at the age of 49.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back in the UK, almost 1,000 jobs are being lost as part of a deal to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrescue\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 high street tailor Austin Reed. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the Daily Telegraph\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ben Marlow, who writes: The majority of Austin Reed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stores will close with the loss of nearly 1,000 jobs after administrators to the collapsed menswear chain were only able to find a buyer for its famous brand and stock. Sources familiar with the negotiations said Edinburgh Woollen Mill had refused to take the bulk of the shops as part of a deal, meaning administrators will now begin an orderly \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwind down\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of the chain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s estate in the coming days. The move comes a month after Austin Reed went into administration, handing control of the company to AlixPartners. AlixPartners had hoped to find a buyer for some, or all, of the business. Dragons\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Den star Touker Suleyman, and Sports Direct chief Mike Ashley, had both emerged as possible options. Young people are still bearing the brunt of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment problem. The youth jobless rate in the EU has dropped to 18.8%, from 20.7% in April 2015. That still leaves 4.2 million under-25s out of work across the region. In the euro area, the youth unemployment rate is now 21.1%. And again, the situation is much worse in some countries than others. The lowest rates were observed in Germany (7.0%), Malta (8.9%) and the Czech Republic (9.5%), and the highest in Greece (51.4% in February 2016), Spain (45.0%), Croatia (38.9% in the first quarter 2016) and Italy (36.9%). Martin Janicko, economist at Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Analytics, also believes Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market is improving... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The euro zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate was 10.2% in April, unchanged from the previous month but down from 11% a year earlier.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Declines in the jobless rate were recorded in most euro zone countries. Particularly encouraging are drops in joblessness in Greece, Ireland, and Spain. Periphery countries have had the largest drops over the past few months, reflecting their rebound, while the European core broadly held ground. Nevertheless, headline unemployment and youth unemployment rates are still elevated in the euro zone, with only Germany reporting a youth unemployment rate below 10%.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The downward trend in the jobless rate will likely persist in coming months, reflecting improving economic conditions around the monetary bloc, labour market reforms, and a strengthening industrial base in Spain, Portugal and Ireland. Businesses and consumers should benefit from easier access to credit following the easing of lending standards and a monetary stimulus from the European Central Bank.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction to the news that the eurozone inflation rate remains negative this month, at -0.1%. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says inflation remains \u00e2\u20ac\u0153within the doldrums\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd; even though the European Central Bank is running a huge bond-buying QE programme and record low interest rates. Despite the ECB embarking on a substantial round of easing, the fact that the Eurozone remains within deflation is a clear heads up that monetary policy alone cannot fix the problem of stagnant price growth. Holger Zschaepitz, journalist at Die Welt, points out that the ECB has massively expanded its balance sheet recently, in an attempt to drive up inflation. But Fred Ducrozet of private Swiss bank Pictet points out that core inflation (stripping out energy and food costs) has risen: Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight, reckons today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data shows the eurozone labour market is slowly improving. He points out that the jobless total did drop in April, although not by enough to pull the headline rate down from 10.2%. Eurozone unemployment fell by 63,000 in April to stand at 16.420 million, which is the lowest level since August 2011..... The decent underlying marked drop in Eurozone unemployment in April/March suggests that the pick-up in Eurozone GDP growth in the first quarter may be feeding through to lift employment. There are still stark differences in Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour markets, which partly reflects the austerity measures imposed on its weaker members. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report shows that there are 21.2 million unemployed men and women across the 28 countries which make up the EU, including 16.4 million were in the euro area. The lowest unemployment rates were recorded in the Czech Republic (4.1%), Germany (4.2%) and Malta (4.3%). But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no prizes for guessing the country with the highest unemployment rates --its Greece (24.2% in February 2016), followed by Spain (20.1%). Unemployment in the European Union has hit a new seven-year low of 8.7% in April. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rather better than the eurozone average of 11.2%, but still means Europe is lagging behind America (where the jobless rate is 5%) The eurozone is still stuck in negative inflation! Prices across the single currency region fell by 0.1% in May, the flash estimate from Eurostat shows. Once again, cheap oil is mainly responsible. Energy prices fell by 8.1% year-on-year in May, while service prices rose by 1%. Food, alcohol &amp; tobacco gained 0.8%, while non- energy industrial goods cost 0.5% more. Here comes the splurge of Euorpean economic data, to take City traders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 minds off the weather. And Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate remains stuck at 10.2% in April, meaning no improvement on March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures.... Told you it was looking a bit grim out there #splishsplashsplosh The British pound has weakened a little this morning, as investors continue to ponder next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum. Sterling is down almost half a cent against the US dollar, at $1.4601. Despite that, the pound has still been one of the best-performing currencies in May; it strengthened after opinion polls suggested the public will vote to Remain in the EU. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still more than three weeks to go, so everything could change. City traders are taking steps to profit from the vote. As the FT explains this morning, some firms are commissioning their own exit polls on the day, so they can either buy or sell sterling. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not illegal, as long as they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t publish the results.... Unfortunately, the Italian jobs malaise also continues... The Italian unemployment rate has jumped to 11.7% in April, up from 11.5% in March. Economists had expected 11.4%, so this weak reading suggests Mattei Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government is struggling to breathe life into its labour market. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all bad new; some 51,000 new positions were created in April, according to the statistics body ISTAT. So the rise in the jobless rate suggests previously inactive workers are now seeking a job. The German jobs miracle continues. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobless rate has fallen to a new record low of just 6.1% in May, down from 6.2%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the lowest since East and West Germany were reunified in 1990, as Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy outperforms its weaker neighbours. Reuters has more details: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The labour market continues its overall positive development,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Frank-Juergen Weise, head of the Federal LabourOffice said in a statement. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unemployment fell in the course of spring. Employment rose sharply and the demand for labour also increased significantly.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The seasonally-adjusted jobless total fell by 11,000 to2.695 million, the Labour Office said. That compares with a consensus forecast in a Reuters poll for unemployment to fall by 5,000. Unless we get a big crash today, European stock markets will post their best month since last October. The STOXX 600, which tracks the 600 biggest European companies, has gained 2.5% during May as investors put recent market turmoil behind them. This flow of money into shares has come at the expense of other assets, such as precious metals. Gold has fallen by 6% this month, its worst month since November. European stock markets have started the week in an edgy mood. Most of the main indices have dropped, although the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has scrambled a little higher. Traders are waiting for the eurozone data, in an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. But they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also pondering the prospect of a US interest rate hike in June or July. Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct explains: London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue chip index is starting the shortened trading week with some limited gains, helped along by the fact that markets appear increasingly confident that if the Federal Reserve do hike rates again next month, the US economy is now looking strong enough to cope with the fallout. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has enjoyed its best day since February. The CSI 300 index closed 3.4%, driven by predictions that the market could soon be included in the MSCI Emerging Markets index (a move which could encourage international investors to hold Chinese shares). But the session was also marked by a curious plunge in the main futures index, which tumbled 10% before immediately jumping back. No-one seems to know what caused the volatility, which is also making investors worried. Bloomberg explains that it could be caused by a single large bet that shares are going ot fall. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Liquidity in the market is really thin at the moment,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fang Shisheng, Shanghai-based vice general manager at Orient Securities Futures Co., said by phone. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So the market will very likely see big swings if a big order comes in. The order looks like it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s from a hedger.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd German consumers kept their hands in the pockets last month, fuelling concerns that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy may be in the doldrums. Retail sales fell by 0.9% month-on-month in April, dashing expectations of a 0.9% rise following the 1.4% decline in March. This data is quite volatile, but it does suggest that the German public are being cautious... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a somewhat gloomy feel to the City of London, as traders trudge back to their desks after the bank holiday weekend. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly due to the blanket of cloud sitting over the capital, mocking anyone who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taken the half-term holiday off. But it also reflects persistent concerns over the global economy as we head towards the summer. Today we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get a new healthcheck on the eurozone, with the latest inflation and unemployment data. It may not be too pretty. Economists predict that the consumer prices index inched up to minus 0.1% in May, despite the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to push up prices. And the jobless rate, for April, may remain pegged at 10.2%; twice as high as in the UK or America. These figures will be scrutinised ahead of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next governing council meeting, on Thursday. Traders will also be watching the oil price, ahead of an OPEC meeting on Thursday. And then on Friday, we get the next US unemployment report. That will give fresh clues about whether American interest rates could be hiked over the summer. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda: 8.55am BST: German unemployment report for May 9am: Italian unemployment report for April 10am: Eurozone unemployment report for April 10am: Eurozone flash inflation report for May 1.30pm: Canadian Q1 GDP 3pm: US consumer confidence for May And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not expecting any early fireworks in the markets...",
