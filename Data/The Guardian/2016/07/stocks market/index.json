With companies craving certainty, heightened tensions between the UK and the European Union are likely to unsettle the global business environment further in coming months, and therefore risk dampening growth in the US and export markets.

                "bodyText":"A tumultuous week, which started with markets continuing their post-Brexit slump, has ended on a positive note as investors regained their nerve. All the leading European indices have finished the week with a positive performance, while Wall Street had also moved higher by the time London closed. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 73.5 points or 1.13% higher at 6577.83 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.99% to 9776.12 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.86% to 4273.96 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.61% to 16,295.78 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.29% higher at 8268.9 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.49% to 544.76 In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 36 points or 0.2% higher. On the currency markets, the pound continues to fall following the Bank of England\u2019s latest hints at interest rate cuts. It is down 0.35% at $1.326 and 0.38% down against the euro at \u20ac1.19. And on that note it\u2019s time to close for the evening and indeed the week. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. The FTSE 100 has finished up 1.13% at 6577.83, to its best level since 11 August last year. Its weekly rise of 7.21% is the best since the start of December 2011. Despite an initial fall in the first two trading days after last week\u2019s shock referendum result, the leading index has been boosted by hopes of cheaper money after the Bank of England hinted at summer rate cuts, and the prospect of the process for actually leaving the EU being delayed for months. Back with Brexit, and a majority of US companies believe it will have a neglible impact. The Institute of Supply Management, which earlier released a positive update on US manufacturing, said 61% of the businesses it surveyed saw little impact compared to just 6% who thought it would have a negative effect. European banks should not automatically have to cut dividends even if they reveal capital shortfalls in this year\u2019s stress tests, according to the banking watchdog. Reuters reports: The announcement aims to help restore investor confidence in Europe\u2019s banking sector, where valuations lag those in the United States, partly due to uncertainty over capital requirements. The European Banking Authority (EBA) is coordinating a stress test of 51 lenders from across the 28-country bloc with the results due on July 29. For the first time, there will be no pass or fail mark. The EBA sought on Friday to clear up confusion over how the tests\u2019 findings will feed into broader \u201cSREP\u201d reviews of bank capital by supervisors such as the European Central Bank. The ECB supervises the eurozone\u2019s top lenders and is looking at whether banks need extra capital under a supervisory review and evaluation process, or SREP. It considers how much extra capital a bank should hold on top of its mandatory minimum requirements, and helps to formulate \u201ccapital guidance\u201d for each bank. The EBA said on Friday that this capital guidance should be set above the combined level of mandatory minimums and add-ons. However, capital guidance does not constitute any form of binding capital requirements, and therefore is not expected to trigger automatic restrictions on payouts to investors, it added. This makes clear that it is up to the supervisor to decide if dividends should be suspended. Two members of the US Federal Reserve seem to have differing views on Brexit and the US economy, however: The UK decision to leave the European Union will be a drag on US GDP, according to S&amp;P Global Ratings, but the size and diversity of the world\u2019s biggest economy will limit its exposure. The agency said: S&amp;P Global now expects U.S. real GDP to grow by 2.0% in 2016 (was 2.3% in March) and 2.4% in 2017 (was 2.5%). The risk of recession over the next 12 months is now between 20% to 25%, up from 15% to 20% in March. The Fed will now likely stay on the sidelines until the December Federal Open Markets Committee meeting then will likely raise rates by 25 basis points to a 0.5% to 0.75% range. It will gradually raise rates next year, with now only three increases expected for 2017 and three more for 2018. The Fed will likely reach its new \u201cneutral\u201d rate by 2019. \u201cAll told, we expect the repercussions from Brexit to weigh somewhat on U.S. GDP,\u201d says US chief economist Beth Ann Bovino. \u201cCombining this with lower-than-expected first quarter growth leads to the lowering of our forecast for growth this year and next.\u201d The ISM report raises the prospect of a better than expected US non-farm payrolls number, said economist Rob Carnell at ING Bank: The US Manufacturing ISM index picked up from 51.3 to 53.2 in June - consistent with a decent, but not amazing pace of manufacturing growth. As well as a good headline index, there were encouraging signs from new orders, including new export orders. 72% of manufacturing industries now report overall growth, up from 67% in May. But the real focus of this release is probably the employment index, with the US jobs report less than a week away. This index rose to 50.4, its highest since November 2015, though admittedly, manufacturing jobs make only a small contribution to the overall employment total. Nonetheless, this is a small crumb of confidence for our above-consensus 200,000 payrolls forecast (consensus 175,000) and we will be watching the non-mfg ISM employment index and ADP surveys carefully next week for further corroboration of a return to labour market strength. With markets pricing in virtually no Fed tightening in 2016 or 2017, an above consensus number could see bond yields, which have fallen heavily since Brexit, to push higher, if only for a while in these times of heightened uncertainty. Confirmation of growth in US manufacturing in June has come in the latest ISM survey. Its manufacturing activity index came in at 53.2 in June, better than the consensus forecast of 51.4 and May\u2019s figure of 51.3. This is the highest level since February 2015. But in a separate report, US construction spending dropped unexpectedly in May, the second monthly decline in a row. According to the Commerce department spending dropped by 0.8% in May, following a revised 2% fall in April. The April drop was the largest since January 2011. Economists had expected a 0.6% rise in spending after an initial 1.8% decline in April. US manufacturing moved up in June, according to the first of the day\u2019s two surveys, but the uncertainty over Brexit could dampen growth in the coming months. The final Markit manufacturing PMI index came in at 51.3, better than the expected 51.2 but lower than the initial reading of 51.4. But it was higher than May\u2019s final level of 50.7 and hit a three month high. Markit said: U.S. manufacturers indicated a slight rebound in production volumes during June, helped by the fastest rise in new work since March. However, the latest survey signalled that growth momentum remained relatively subdued in comparison to its post-crisis trend, which contributed to cautious job hiring and further efforts to reduce inventories in June. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit added: Although the manufacturing PMI ticked higher in June, the latest reading rounds off the worst quarter for goods producers for six years. The lacklustre performance of the manufacturing economy adds to signs from the flash services PMI surveys that the underlying pace of economic growth in the second quarter remained subdued Manufacturing output after a disappointing start to the year. The upturn in the employment index suggests that firms may be expecting the recent bout of weak demand to be temporary, though hiring clearly remains subdued amid fragile business confidence. Producers are struggling in the face of the strong dollar, the energy sector decline and presidential election jitters. With companies craving certainty, heightened tensions between the UK and the European Union are likely to unsettle the global business environment further in coming months, and therefore risk dampening growth in the US and export markets. The data flow in the next two months will therefore be critical to policymakers in gauging the appropriate outlook for interest rates. American markets have edged ahead in early trading, but after recent rises the rally is not convincing. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, up nearly 800 points in the past three days, has opened around 19 points or 0.1% higher ahead of the latest US manufacturing surveys, due shortly. Business organisation the CBI has called for \u201ccalm and decisive leadership, a clear plan for the UK\u2019s future outside the EU and a framework for business and the government to work together and deliver that plan are businesses\u2019 immediate priorities as the country navigates its exit from the EU.\u201d Speaking at the Evening Standard business awards, CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn also said the government must confirm that workers from the EU who are already in the UK can stay in the country. More reaction to UK chancellor George Osborne abandoning his target to restore the public finances to surplus by 2020. Michael Izza, chief executive of chartered accountants organisation ICAEW, said: It was always going to be a struggle to meet the deficit target and in the light of the EU Referendum that job became much harder. In these uncertain times for business, it is imperative that Government devises a comprehensive strategy that minimises uncertainty and weathers any looming economic storm. Taking the global economy into account, the UK electorate knows that we still have a public finance problem as we can\u2019t continue to borrow. The challenge of the public finances remains a three-Parliament problem. Earlier the European Central Bank\u2019s chief economist Peter Praet said Brexit was a \u201cnew shock\u201d and Europe rapidly needed a roadmap on Britain\u2019s plans to leave. Speaking at a Financial Times event he said it was vital to bring clarity to the political and economic uncertainty created by the UK referendum and that an \u201corderly process\u201d was laid out for Brexit negotiations. He said red tape for firms was likely to increase as a result of the UK decision, and could weaken potential growth. He added that the challenges to the eurozone remained immense but the ECB was ready to provide liquidity. [Quotes courtesy Reuters] The pound is roughly flat against the dollar, at $1.3304, and is down 0.4% against the euro at \u20ac1.1942. Sterling has fallen almost 11% against the dollar since Britain went to the polls on 23 June to vote on EU membership. Against the euro, it is down almost 9% over the same period. The impact of the Brexit vote on the pound versus dollar: The impact of the Brexit vote on the pound versus euro: Samuel Tombs, chief economist at Pantheon Economics, makes the point that the George Osborne\u2019s target of hitting a surplus by 2020 wasn\u2019t very realistic in the first place. Even without Brexit, it was highly unlikely that the Chancellor would ever have met his goal. Last year, the structural budget deficit amounted to nearly 4% of gross domestic product. Moreover, the fiscal forecasts were based on very optimistic assumptions for the impact of fiscal tightening on growth, the likely revenues from tax avoidance measures, and the government\u2019s ability to reduce spending after six prior years of austerity. Some reaction to Osborne\u2019s speech... John McDonnell, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, welcomed the chancellor\u2019s decision to drop his targets: I welcome the Chancellor\u2019s decision to finally listen to the calls made by myself and Jeremy Corbyn over the last nine months to drop his failed surplus target. It is only a shame he was not realistic sooner, as under Jeremy Corbyn, Labour has been unequivocal in its opposition to failed Tory austerity. Lee Hopley, chief economist at manufacturing trade body EEF, also welcomed the move: This move will be viewed as a much-needed pick-me-up after a week of turmoil and bad news. The chancellor is right to scrap the government\u2019s hitherto relentless push on deficit reduction. The uncertainty that businesses are currently grappling with should be helped by politicians galvanising around the actions that can reasonably be taken to offer some policy stability - easing up on deficit reduction is one such measure. The Chancellor has been tweeting following his speech in Manchester, where he announced that he is abandoning his target of returning the public finances to surplus by 2020. He is stressing the \u201cflexible\u201d nature of his fiscal rules... Investors are feeling chirpier in afternoon trading. The FTSE 100 is now up 82 points or 1.3% at 6,586. The FTSE 250 - down earlier in the day - is now up 0.6% at 16,361. All major European indices are up: Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.7% at 9,745 France\u2019s CAC: +0.8% at 4,269 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.4% at 16,266 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +1.4% at 8,275 Here is our story on George Osborne\u2019s comments in Manchester. Quite extraordinary stuff as he essentially admits defeat on one of the central pillars of his economic policy as chancellor. A budget surplus in 2020 is no longer realistic in a post Brexit world, he suggests. The chancellor was speaking at the Greater Manchester Chambers of Commerce. Here is what he said: Now, as the governor of the Bank of England said yesterday, the referendum result is as expected likely to lead to a significant negative shock for the British economy. How we respond will determine the impact on people\u2019s jobs and on economic growth. The Bank of England can support demand. The government must provide fiscal credibility, so we will continue to be tough on the deficit but we must be realistic about achieving a surplus by the end of this decade. This is precisely the flexibility that our rules provide for. And we need to reduce uncertainty by moving as quickly as possible to a new relationship with Europe and being super competitive, open for business and free trading. That\u2019s the plan and we must set to it. George Osborne is going to abandon his target to restore the public finances to surplus by 2020, the BBC is reporting. He has been speaking in Manchester. This is what they are reporting: Chancellor George Osborne has abandoned his target to restore government finances to a surplus by 2020, the BBC has learned. It had been the chancellor\u2019s most prized goal and had been driving austerity measures in previous budgets. However, the Chancellor said the UK must be \u201crealistic about achieving a surplus by the end of the decade\u201d. The UK economy is showing \u201cclear signs\u201d of shock in the aftermath of the vote to leave the European Union, he said. Even before that vote, there were questions over whether Mr Osborne would be able to balance the budget by 2020. Time for a market update. The FTSE 100 is holding on to gains, up 23 points, but it\u2019s a mixed bag in Europe now and the FTSE 250 is down.

The Bank of England governor was met with hostility from some members of the camp when he warned the UK economy could fall into recession in the event of a Brexit decision. Andrea Leadsom, one of the candidates for the Tory leadership and a member of Vote Leave, accused the governor at the time of overstepping his remit. Now the vote is over, Michael Gove - a leading Brexit campaigner and a rival candidate for the Tory leadership - has been singing the governor\u2019s praises, paying tribute to Carney for stabilising the economy. Meanwhile George Osborne says there are \u201cclear signs of economic shock\u201d since Britain voted to leave the EU last week. The chancellor has been in Manchester, addressing business leaders. Sky News is reporting that EasyJet has opened talks with regulators in the EU about relocating its headquarters from the UK. The budget airline is currently based in Luton, where it employs about 1,000 people. Brexit fallout begins... Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, has a good take on the market volatility we\u2019ve seen seen Britain voted to leave the EU. European markets have started the day in a fairly positive fashion as we come to the end of what has been a turbulent and historic week. Having traded as low as 5,938 in the wake of last week\u2019s surprising Brexit vote the FTSE 100 looks on course to post its best week since 2011 as the weaker pound helped pull the index back above its pre Brexit vote highs by the middle of the week. While it is no doubt true that on a currency basis the FTSE100 is still down in euro and US dollar terms, the fact that it is one of the highest yielding blue chip benchmarks at over 4% could well be providing a pull factor in an era of ever decreasing interest rates. While the FTSE 100 is managing to hold its own the FTSE 250 is finding it a little more difficult slipping back 1% over concerns about the outlook for the UK economy over the rest of the year. James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis, tells Bloomberg TV that Brexit shouldn\u2019t have too much of an impact on the US economy: Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector performed much better than expected in June. Activity in UK factories grew at the fastest pace in five months according to the Markit/CIPS PMI. Crucially though, the survey was conducted almost entirely before last weeks referendum on EU membership. What impact the decision to quit the EU will have on the sector - and the wider economy - remains to be seen. The headline index on the PMI - combining output, orders and employment - rose to 52.1 in June from 50.4 in May. Anything above 50 is growth territory, and economists were forecasting 49.9 - a contraction in activity. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit: With 99% of survey responses received before the end of 23rd June, the latest PMI signalled that the manufacturing sector had started to move out of its early year sluggishness in the lead up to the UK\u2019s EU referendum. Whether this growth recovery can be sustained will depend heavily on whether the current financial and political volatility spills over to the real economy. While the Bank of England remains poised to act if needed and the UK\u2019s trading relationships are unchanged during the two-year negotiation period, there\u2019s a clear risk that ongoing uncertainty will have at least some short term impact on manufacturing during the coming quarters. The big question is whether any negative impact from uncertainty can be partly offset by a boost to exports resulting from the fall in the pound. Activity in factories in most of the eurozone\u2019s biggest economies grew in June. Both output and new orders grew at a faster pace, driving the headline index on the Markit eurozone manufacturing PMI up to 52.8 from 51.5 in May. Anything above 50 signals growth. France was the only country where the sector shrank last month - with strike action dampening activity - while manufacturing growth in Germany was the strongest in more than two years. Germany: 54.5 Austria: 54.5 Italy: 53.5 Ireland: 53 Spain: 52.2 Netherlands: 52 GreeceL 50.4 France: 48.3 Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit said it was positive news from the eurozone but issued a Brexit health warning: The data were collected prior to the UK EU referendum result, so any Brexit impact is yet to be seen in the PMI. The PMI would have likely been even higher had it not been for strikes in France, which look to have disrupted business activity in many cases. With Greece enjoying a welcome return to growth, France was the only country to see a deterioration in manufacturing conditions in June. All other countries saw faster rates of expansion except the Netherlands. Given the uncertainty caused by the prospect of Brexit, it seems likely that business and consumer spending will be adversely affected across the euro area in the short term at least, pulling growth down in coming months. Mark Carney\u2019s speech on Thursday send the yield on one UK gilt - maturing in March 2018 - negative. It was a first for the UK, with a yield of -0.04% meaning that investors were willing to pay to take on government debt - despite extreme political and economic uncertainty. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said it was a \u201clandmark\u201d moment for the UK. Anyone who buys this gilt is paying the UK government for the privilege of lending it money, and this is despite the fact the ratings agencies have downgraded UK government debt in light of the Brexit vote. The UK now joins Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Denmark, Switzerland and Japan in the club of countries where gilt yields have turned negative. The ultra-low interest rate environment paints a depressing picture of our economic prospects, though the gilt market has been so heavily tainted by central bank interference, it\u2019s hard to know how reliable an indicator it is. Such low interest rates are great for borrowers, but awful for cash savers, and for banks. Cash savers have already suffered 7 years of ultra-low interest rates, and on current expectations it looks like they will comfortably see out a decade without getting a half-decent return on their deposits. UK 10-year bonds yields: The yield on benchmark 10-year government bonds has fallen to a record low of 0.831%, putting it on course for its biggest weekly fall since November 2011. Investors often turn to bonds during times of market volatility as they are considered lower risk compared with other assets. The lower the yield, the cheaper it is for the government to borrow money. The latest snapshot of the state of the manufacturing sector across the eurozone, the UK and the US will be delivered today by the PMI surveys for June. Overnight, an official survey in China showed the manufacturing sector in the world\u2019s largest economy effectively stalled in June. Output hit a 12-month high, but all other measures showed signs of weakening. The survey is likely to add to expectations that Beijing will inject more stimulus into the economy. The pound is little changed this morning, after falling sharply on Thursday afternoon in response to Mark Carney\u2019s suggestion that more stimulus is on the way to try and counter the negative impact of the Brexit vote. It is down 0.1% against the dollar at $1.3287, and pretty much flat against the euro at \u20ac1.1980. Elsewhere in Europe, markets are seeing stronger gains: Germany\u2019s Dax: +0.8% at 9,753 France\u2019s CAC: +0.7% at 4,266 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +1.1% at 16,383 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +1.1% at 8,256 Investors are once again shaking off Brexit concerns with shares rising modestly. In the UK, FTSE 100 is up 4 points or 0.1% at 6,506. The FTSE 250 is up 0.3% at 16,321. As it stands, the FTSE is on course to post its biggest weekly gain since December 2011. Good morning. This time last week Britain was waking up to the news that it had voted to leave the European Union. The outcome sent shockwaves through global markets, with shares plunging last Friday. But markets have since bounced back, with the FTSE 100 yesterday hitting its highest level since August. Investors around the world were cheered by the reassuring words of Mark Carney, Bank of England governor, who indicated the central bank stood ready to pump fresh stimulus into the UK economy as the impact of Brexit weighs on growth and confidence. Our story on Carney\u2019s speech is here: Economists believe the Bank might act in August, to coincide with its quarterly inflation report which includes updated economic forecasts. Options on the table include cutting interest rates to zero from 0.5%, as well as more quantitative easing. Markets around the world liked the message, with Wall Street closing up and shares rising in Asia. The Hang Seng rose 1.75% to 20,794.37, while the Nikkei rose 0.7% at 15,6825.48. European markets have just opened higher.",

So in some senses it is business as usual for the moment, and the City tends to take a rather short-term view of events.</p> <p>On top of that, the falls in the immediate aftermath of the vote convinced many investors there were bargains to be had.</p> <p>The increases have been seen almost across the board, from safer shares such as utilities which have regular income streams, to mining groups and food and drink businesses.</p> <h2><strong>But the pound has been plunging. Surely that\u2019s bad news?</strong></h2> <p>For holidaymakers, yes. But for the FTSE 100 it helps those companies who have large overseas earnings, and these account for about 77% of the index. As the pound falls against the dollar and euro, exporters find their goods are cheaper for overseas customers to buy which boosts their sales and profits. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/30/interest-rate-cut-likely-brexit-bank-of-england-mark-carney\">Thursday\u2019s comments from the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, hinting at further interest rate cuts in the summer</a><strong>,</strong> have put more pressure on the pound, and conversely given the FTSE 100 another boost.</p> <p>With interest rates so low, the dividend yield on the FTSE 100 at about 3.5% also makes investing in the market an attractive option rather than relying on keeping cash in the bank.</p> <h2><strong>What about gilts? They are a safe bet, surely?</strong></h2> <p>Gilts \u2013 UK government bonds \u2013 have indeed been rising, but this has meant the yield or dividend payment has been falling. Ten-year gilt yields are below 1% for the first time and the two-year gilt yield is in negative territory, unprecedented for the UK. </p> <p>That effectively means anyone who buys this gilt is paying the UK government for lending it money, even though credit rating agencies downgraded UK debt after the Brexit vote.</p> <h2><strong>But generally, everything looks rosy in the circumstances?</strong></h2> <p>Not exactly. The FTSE 100 might appear to have shrugged off Brexit, but in dollar and euro terms it is still underperforming following the fall in sterling.</p> <p>And not everything is gaining ground. Housebuilders and UK banks have been among the hardest hit on fears of a UK recession and falling consumer spending.</p> <h2><strong>What\u2019s happening elsewhere?</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s bit of a different picture. The FTSE 250 mid-cap index \u2013 the next biggest listed UK companies below the leading index \u2013 is struggling. It is still 5% below the level it had reached on the day of the referendum.</p> <p>The companies in the mid-cap index are far more exposed to the domestic UK economy than those in the FTSE 100. And so with predictions of possible recession following the Brexit vote \u2013 one of the reasons for Carney\u2019s rate cut hints \u2013 they are under pressure. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/27/property-and-financial-shares-slide-as-referendum-fallout-hits-stock-markets\">As ratings agency Fitch said when it cut the UK\u2019s credit rating from AA+ to AA earlier this week</a>, the decision to leave the EU would have \u201ca negative impact on the UK economy, public finances and political continuity\u201d.

                "bodyText":"The US real estate market could get a boost in the coming months, some analysts are predicting, thanks to the UK\u2019s vote to leave the European Union. The news could add further fire to the already overheated property markets in some of the US\u2019s biggest cities. Uncertainty about UK\u2019s future and its economy could put real estate market on pause, especially in London, and sending international investors in search of another safe-haven property market. Most experts agree the US is likely to see increased demand. The Brexit fallout could especially affect areas and industries that depend on the UK\u2019s immigrant population. Analysts already have started to speculate that firms in the financial and tech sector are most likely to leave the UK if Article 50 \u2013 the grounds for the UK\u2019s EU divorce \u2013 is activated. BlackRock\u2019s real estate analysts have calculated that UK commercial property values could drop by as much as 10% over the next year thanks to declines in London. Mike Prew, an analyst with Jefferies LLC, estimated that international business could move as many as 100,000 jobs out of the UK and that London office rents could fall 18% within two years of Article 50 being activated. \u201cHouse prices over the medium-term could easily drop by a fifth or more from those peaks as confidence weakens, the economy slows and lenders and investors become more cautious,\u201d said Michael Ball, professor of Urban and Property Economics at Henley Business School in UK. According to him, the prospects for private rented sectors are poor, especially outside London, where immigrants have been an important source of demand. Lower interest rates are the \u201conly great thing\u201d about Brexit, according to Leonard Steinberg, broker and a president of Compass, a US residential real estate brokerage firm.

                "bodyText":"Britain\u2019s builders had their worst performance in seven years last month as a collapse in new orders clobbered firms in the run-up to the EU referendum. One economist described the outlook for the industry as dire after the prospect of a vote to leave the EU sent property investors scurrying for the exit door. Housing market jitters were blamed for much of the fall in activity, which forced housebuilders across the country to down tools and mothball projects. Shares in Britain\u2019s biggest property developers and builders tumbled on Monday as investors digested the bleak implications for revenues and profits of a freeze in new homes being built after the latest batch of projects reaches completion. British Land was the biggest faller, sinking more than 7% to 564p, while Persimmon, Taylor Wimpey, Barratt Developments and Berkeley Group Holdings slumped 6%. Berkeley, which made \u00a3531 profits last year and paid its chairman, Tony Pidgley, a 42% pay rise to \u00a323m, recently reported a 20% fall in reservations. Shares began their slide on 24 June immediately after the EU referendum result emerged as it became clear that investors were withdrawing funds designated for new developments. The exodus of funds prompted industry representatives and unions to call on the government to step in and bolstered infrastructure spending and support for new homes. The Markit survey is the first to show that a broad slowdown has turned into a rout, knocking hundreds of millions of pounds off the value of major property firms. Indicating that all parts of the industry were being hit, office and factory building was almost as badly hit while business confidence was at its lowest for three years. The Markit Cips construction purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) tumbled to 46 in June, down from 51.2 in May. It was the first time since April 2013 that it was below the 50 threshold which separates growth from contraction. The speed of the contraction in June took the industry back into recessionary territory but fell short of the frantic tumble in activity last seen in the post-financial crash era in 2009. Markit said the figures were overwhelmingly linked to deteriorating order books that meant firms lacked new work to replace completed projects. \u201cA number of firms commented on reluctance among clients to commence new contracts in the run-up to the EU referendum, alongside ongoing uncertainty about the general economic outlook. Incoming new work has now fallen for two months running, and the latest reduction was the steepest since December 2012,\u201d it said. Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \u201cThis is an absolutely dire survey that fuels serious concern over the construction sector. \u201cFurthermore, the survey was 80% completed before the UK voted to leave the EU. The survey can only intensify concern as to just how much the construction sector will be hampered by the Brexit vote.\u201d Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, said: \u201cConstruction firms are at the sharp end of domestic economic uncertainty and jolts to investor sentiment, so trading conditions were always going to be challenging in the run-up to the EU referendum. \u201cHowever, the extent and speed of the downturn in the face of political and economic uncertainty is a clear warning flag for the wider post-Brexit economic outlook.\u201d Brian Berry, chief executive of the Federation of Master Builders, said there was growing concern that situation would worsen as uncertainty increased. \u201cConstruction is an industry that is particularly vulnerable to dips in confidence and it appears that many clients were hesitant to commit to new projects as they were unsure of what the future held.

Some real estate investment trusts have fallen by 20%.</p> <p>Coggan explains why <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jul/04/stimulus-hopes-markets-ftse-100-construction-business-live?page=with:block-577a912be4b0243071e32bea#block-577a912be4b0243071e32bea\">the decision to suspend redemptions from Standard Life\u2019s \u00a32.7bn property fund</a> matters:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The big question is how this news will affect retail investors elsewhere. The risk is of a run; if buyers fear they will lose access to their money, they will rush to withdraw their savings, triggering the event they dread. Property mutual funds have a liquidity mismatch; savers can withdraw their money every day but property takes months to sell. Funds tend to run with high levels of cash in order to meet this eventuality; Aberdeen says its fund has a cash level of 18% of assets. But Standard Life clearly felt it had to take action.</p> <p>Regulators worried last year about the possibility of systemic risk in the mutual fund sector, although then their concern was about corporate bonds, rather than property. The good news is that this is not like the money market fund crisis of 2008; few people will be keeping their spare cash in a property fund and most will realise that they can lose, as well as make, money. Nevertheless, this is the first real sign of post-Brexit financial stress.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/econbuttonwood/status/750009295551533056\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Our news story on the Standard Life property fund suspension <a href=\"https://t.co/d8UA3SReaT\">https://t.co/d8UA3SReaT</a></p>&mdash; Philip Coggan (@econbuttonwood) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/econbuttonwood/status/750009295551533056\">July 4, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-07-04T17:28:18.431Z\">at 6.28pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-577a9845e4b05db362ab7631\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-04T17:11:17.050Z\">6.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Laith Khalaf, Senior Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, has emailed his thoughts about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jul/04/stimulus-hopes-markets-ftse-100-construction-business-live?page=with:block-577a912be4b0243071e32bea#block-577a912be4b0243071e32bea\">Standard Life\u2019s decision to lock down its property fund tonight</a>:</strong></p> <p>He explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Property funds are clearly under pressure as a result of the Brexit vote, and we could now see a new wave of investors being unable to liquidate their property funds quickly, which we last witnessed during the financial crisis.</p> <p>This is part of the problem with investing in open-ended property funds, and one of the reasons we don\u2019t recommend them to investors. Property does offer diversification, and a reasonable yield compared to government bonds, but investors must be willing to accept high costs, and a lack of liquidity when the market turns down.</p> <p>Closed-ended property funds at least provide investors the chance to sell out during market upheaval, though widespread selling serves to depress share prices and widen discounts in times of stress. Indeed there are currently a number of closed-ended property trusts trading at discount in excess of 10%. However, being closed-ended does at least means the manager does not have to liquidate properties at a time when everyone else is looking to do the same.</p> <p>Given the outflows the sector seems to be experiencing, this could well put downward pressure on commercial property prices. The risk is this creates a vicious circle, and prompts more investors to dump property, until such time as sentiment stabilises.</p> <p>Continued low interest rates in theory provide support for commercial property, because as prices fall, yields become even more attractive. However at the moment, investors appear to be leaving the sector, rather than buying in.\u2019</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-577a9710e4b0243071e32c0a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-04T17:05:26.267Z\">6.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>City experts are tweeting their concern about Standard Life\u2019s decision to suspend trading in its real estate fund:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/dsquareddigest/status/750004360076206081\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So, FTSE100 down 0.8%, 250 down 2%.

                "bodyText":"And finally.... here\u2019s our news story about Standard Life\u2019s move: Goodnight! GW But ITV business editor Joel Hills flags up that Standard Life last locked down its property fund eight years ago, when the financial crisis was raging: That was also the last time that the UK economy went into recession. Property valuations are usually an early casualty of a downturn. Estate Gazette point out that Standard Life cut the value of its portfolio by 5% as part of a \u201cfair value adjustment\u201d, but this was not enough to prevent investors wanting to take out their cash. They add, uncheerily, that: The move mirrors that made by fund managers in 2008 following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which resulted in some funds being closed for years as those managing funds struggled to return capital when faced with depressed asset values. Property expert Henry Pryor reckons this might be a significant event.... Aime Williams of the Financial Times has a good take on the Standard Life news: Standard Life has been forced to stop retail investors selling out of one of the UK\u2019s largest property funds after rapid cash outflows were sparked by fears over falling real estate values in the week after the Brexit vote. The \u00a32.9bn commercial property fund will need to sell real estate to raise cash before any money can be redeemed. The last property crash in the UK in 2007 was preceded by a wave of similar forced gatings by funds struggling to meet investor demands for cash, which led to firesales of property that added to the pressure on an already falling market.... More here: The Economist\u2019s Buttonwood columnist, Philip Coggan, says Standard Life has highlighted the stress building up in the financial system following the Brexit vote. He writes that some fund managers have already reassessed the value of their property assets, downwards, since the referendum. Some real estate investment trusts have fallen by 20%. Coggan explains why the decision to suspend redemptions from Standard Life\u2019s \u00a32.7bn property fund matters: The big question is how this news will affect retail investors elsewhere. The risk is of a run; if buyers fear they will lose access to their money, they will rush to withdraw their savings, triggering the event they dread. Property mutual funds have a liquidity mismatch; savers can withdraw their money every day but property takes months to sell. Funds tend to run with high levels of cash in order to meet this eventuality; Aberdeen says its fund has a cash level of 18% of assets. But Standard Life clearly felt it had to take action. Regulators worried last year about the possibility of systemic risk in the mutual fund sector, although then their concern was about corporate bonds, rather than property. The good news is that this is not like the money market fund crisis of 2008; few people will be keeping their spare cash in a property fund and most will realise that they can lose, as well as make, money. Nevertheless, this is the first real sign of post-Brexit financial stress. Laith Khalaf, Senior Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, has emailed his thoughts about Standard Life\u2019s decision to lock down its property fund tonight: He explains: Property funds are clearly under pressure as a result of the Brexit vote, and we could now see a new wave of investors being unable to liquidate their property funds quickly, which we last witnessed during the financial crisis. This is part of the problem with investing in open-ended property funds, and one of the reasons we don\u2019t recommend them to investors. Property does offer diversification, and a reasonable yield compared to government bonds, but investors must be willing to accept high costs, and a lack of liquidity when the market turns down. Closed-ended property funds at least provide investors the chance to sell out during market upheaval, though widespread selling serves to depress share prices and widen discounts in times of stress. Indeed there are currently a number of closed-ended property trusts trading at discount in excess of 10%. However, being closed-ended does at least means the manager does not have to liquidate properties at a time when everyone else is looking to do the same. Given the outflows the sector seems to be experiencing, this could well put downward pressure on commercial property prices. The risk is this creates a vicious circle, and prompts more investors to dump property, until such time as sentiment stabilises. Continued low interest rates in theory provide support for commercial property, because as prices fall, yields become even more attractive. However at the moment, investors appear to be leaving the sector, rather than buying in.\u2019 City experts are tweeting their concern about Standard Life\u2019s decision to suspend trading in its real estate fund: Big news tonight... Standard Life, one of Britain\u2019s biggest investment funds, has suspended trading in one of its UK property funds. This means customers will not be able to pull money out of the fund, which invests in UK property assets such as offices, shops and industrial sites. Standard Life took the decision after receiving a surge in applications to withdraw from the fund, following the Brexit vote. By locking investors down, they hope to avoid being forced into fire sales to generate funds for clients who want out. They say: Due to exceptional market circumstances, Standard Life Investments has taken the decision to suspend all trading in the Standard Life Investments UK Real Estate Fund (and its associated Feeder Funds) from 12:00 noon on 4 July 2016. The decision was taken following an increase in redemption requests as a result of uncertainty for the UK commercial real estate market following the EU referendum result. The suspension was requested to protect the interests of all investors in the fund and to avoid compromising investment returns from the range, mix and quality of assets within the portfolio. They will review the decision in a month. Here\u2019s the full statement: I\u2019ll find some reaction now.... The London stock market closed down 55 points tonight, or almost 1%, after the shock fall in construction output dampened the mood in the City. Property firms remained the big fallers, with British Land losing 7.1% and Persimmon down 6.9%. With Wall Street shut for Independence Day, trading petered out across Europe. Britain\u2019s FTSE 250 index had another weak day, dropping 2%. Italian banks came under more pressure as investors wonder if prime minister Matteo Renzi will defy Brussels and bail the sector out of its bad debt crisis. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: In the absence of US markets it\u2019s been a fairly quiet day for European markets which have slipped back in the absence of any significant positive drivers, and very thin trading. The ripple out effects of last month\u2019s Brexit vote continue to dominate sentiment after S&amp;P Global Ratings downgraded economic growth forecasts for both the UK and the Euro area, with the UK feeling the main brunt of some of the negative effect. Once again it\u2019s been house builders and banks that have driven today\u2019s losses, with the Italian FTSEMib sliding the most as its banking sector gets clobbered again. Before I nip off....unions are urged the government to boost infrastructure spending to help the construction industry. Frances O\u2019Grady, General Secretary of the TUC, says: \u201cThe Brexit vote is likely to further damage the confidence of investors in the construction sector. The government must respond quickly with an emergency programme of public investment to stop the UK economy taking a nose-dive. \u201cThe TUC has published a plan of action to keep the economy moving. The government must give the go-ahead for a third runway at Heathrow, bring forward major new infrastructure projects like high-speed rail and announce a big expansion in housebuilding.\u201d The Brexit vote appears to have triggered a change of heart in government circles about spending. On Friday, chancellor George Osborne revealed he is abandoning his deficit reduction plan. And today, leadership contender Stephen Crabb proposed borrowing \u00a3100bn to boost capital spending. It\u2019s quite a u-turn..... A quick recap of the main points. Britain\u2019s construction industry has suffered its worst month since the aftermath of the financial crisis in 2009, in a clear signal that the EU referendum has hurt the economy. Data firm Markit found that activity shrank sharply in June, with firms reporting a big drop in new orders. Many clients were unwilling to commit to projects before the referendum on 23rd June. Economists say the data is \u2018dire\u2019. They fear that the slowdown will continue this month. Shares in property companies and construction firms have been hit. British Land, the UK\u2019s largest commercial propert firm, has shed 7% . This dragged the FTSE 100 back into the red, after it hit a 10-month high this morning Brexit fears have also hit the eurozone, with investor confidence hitting an 18-month low. IMF chief Christine Lagarde has warned that Brexit could take a 4.5% chunk out of the UK economy by 2019. In other news.... three former Barclay traders have been found guilty of rigging Libor London Stock Exchange shareholders have approved its merger with Deutsche Bourse Spanish unemployment has shown a welcome fall, hitting the lowest total since 2009 But concern is growing over Italy\u2019s banking sector, as its government considers defying the EU and launching a taxpayer bailout. I\u2019ll be back later with the European stock market close.... The FTSE 100 has now fallen back from its 10-month high, and is now 30 points in the red (down 0.5%). Property firms and builders are the biggest fallers on the index, as investors react to the news that the UK construction industry is shrinking at its fastest pace since 2009. The FTSE 250 index, which contains firms who aren\u2019t big enough for the Footsie 100, is down 1.7%. Andrew Edwards, CEO of ETX Capital, says today\u2019s slump in construction activity is proof that the Brexit vote will have a material impact on the UK economy. He calls it \u201ca wake-up call for whoever is taking the country into negotiations for leaving the EU\u201d, and predicts it will spur that Bank of England to ease monetary policy this month. He adds: The rally in the FTSE 100 is not a good guide \u2013 the weighting towards international companies does not represent the UK economy as a whole. Defensive stocks and miners remain in vogue while builders and others in the property sector are getting hammered again.\u201d Hat-tip to Stephanie Flanders of JP Morgan for showing that the FTSE 100 index has actually been the best-performing asset class since the Brexit vote (in local currency terms, anyway). The worst asset? The British pound (closely followed by the Italian stock market, due to those bank fears we mentioned earlier). Just in... the London Stock Exchange\u2019s shareholders have overwhelmingly voted to approve the proposed takeover by Germany\u2019s Deutsche Bank. Some 99.89% of LSE shareholders backed the plan at a vote this lunchtime. That\u2019s one hurdle cleared. But the Brexit vote has created a new layer of uncertainty about the \u00a321bn deal. My colleague Sean Farrell explained earlier: Germany\u2019s markets regulator BaFin said last week the plan to base the combined company in London would not work if the UK was outside the EU. BaFin said it was difficult to imagine the most important exchange in the eurozone being run from outside the EU. BaFin cannot veto the deal but Deutsche B\u00f6rse will have to respond to the regulator\u2019s concerns along with the German state of Hesse, where the company is based and which has a veto power. Several German politicians called for the combined company\u2019s base to be in Frankfurt, while Thorsten Sch\u00e4fer-G\u00fcmbel, a leading SPD politician, said the deal was dead. Christine Lagarde, the head of the IMF, has told Le Monde that UK GDP could lose between 1.5% and 4.5% by 2019 because of Brexit, depending on what type of trade deal is struck. Lagarde said there was a \u201creal uncertainty\u201d surrounding what conditions there would be for trade deals with the EU after a Brexit. She said a Norway-style agreement would be the \u201cfavourable\u201d and \u201ceconomically reasonable\u201d choice but she said this choice would be \u201cpolitically difficult, because the country would have all the obligations of an EU member, notably free movement, but no rights.\u201d She said the worst scenario for Britain would be a as non-EU country along World Trade Organisation rules. She said in that case, British GDP could lose between 1.5% and 4.5% by 2019, compared to what it would have been if it had stayed in the EU. But she added.... \u201cBut we don\u2019t have the slightest idea of the timeframe, nor the result of negotiations between London and the EU. Uncertainty will be the key word for a certain time.\u201d Over in the courts, three ex-Barclays traders have been found guilty of fixing the Libor rate \u2013 the benchmark measure of borrowing costs between banks. Bloomberg have created a nice graphic, showing how the City has a dominant position in the \u2018clearing market\u2019 for financial securities denominated in euros. Those huge operations could potentially be moved out of the City, if Britain can\u2019t reached a Brexit deal that grants full access to the EU financial services market. The European Central Bank recently tried, and failed, to get euro clearing moved into the eurozone. But Britain\u2019s referendum means the idea is being reconsidered. France, in particular, fancies a slice of the euro clearing market. Economy minister Emmanuel Macron declared yesterday that: \u201cOn clearing, we will have a full discussion on a series of issues We have many more players now in Paris than in Frankfurt, and a much deeper market place.\u201d However, financial firms will be reluctant to shift the complex euro clearing operations from London to another country. And if there\u2019s no choice, they might scatter jobs across several cities, rather than simply shifting everything to one site. Shares in Moneysupermarket, the price comparison website with the irritating adverts*, have slumped by 11% today to a 16-month low. And again, the Brexit vote is to blame. The selloff was sparked by Barclays, who warned that Moneysupermarket will suffer badly if Britain slides into recession. Barclays analyst Andrew Ross slashed his recommendation on the stock to \u2018equal weight\u2019, from \u2018overweight\u2019, and declared: The outcome of the UK referendum and a forthcoming expected recession in the UK is now a new concern, and one uncertainty too many for us. We do see clear risks to consensus for next year if a recession bites. * - actually, most of them have irritating adverts, although those Meerkats are quite cute... German thinktank Sentix has also sounded the alarm about the impact of Brexit on Europe\u2019s economy. Sentix\u2019s index of investor confidence across the eurozone has slumped to 18-month low, down from 9.9 in June to just 1.7 this morning. That indicates that investors and analysts fear that Britain\u2019s vote last month to leave the European Union will have serious economic consequences. Sentix fears that the European recovery is now faltering. \u201cInvestors are clearly differentiating and in addition to Switzerland, they see the euro zone as mostly affected.\u201d Therefore the euro zone economy is dangerously close to stagnation.\u201d The FTSE 250 index of medium-sized companies is sliding deeper into the red, following the construction data shocker. It\u2019s now shed 1.7%, or 279 points. Estate agent Rightmove (-5.8%) and building firm Bellway (-4.2%) are among the fallers. Dan Davies of Frontline Analysts isn\u2019t impressed: Here\u2019s our news story about the construction industry\u2019s problems: The early rally on the London stock market has been snuffed out. Investors aren\u2019t pleased by the news that UK construction suffered its biggest slump in almost seven years in June. British Land and Land Securities, two of Britain\u2019s largest property firms, have both fallen by 3.7%. Housebuilding firms are also among the top fallers, with Persimmon, Taylor Wimpey and Barratt Developments all shedding at least 3%. Joshua Raymond of IG explains why..... UK construction is truly in the doldrums, if today\u2019s PMI reading is anything to go by. A seven-year low for the construction PMI reading highlights the fact that many firms have seen investment ground to a halt both before and after the Brexit vote. With around 80% of responses within this PMI survey coming prior to the referendum result, there is reason to believe that this will look even worse in a month\u2019s time. Considering that we were looking at PMI readings approaching 65 less than two years ago, it is clear that construction has gone from boom to bust in no time at all. Upon enacting Article 50, the government will ignite another two years of uncertainty, which will most likely result in further suffering for UK industry as investment goes elsewhere. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says today\u2019s construction industry report is \u201cabsolutely dire\u201d. It will fuel serious concern that Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU will hurt building firms badly, if clients lose confidence in new projects. He adds: The government will be particularly worried to see housebuilding contract at the fastest rate since December 2012 and the second fastest rate since April 2009 - given that it is looking to address the UK\u2019s acute housing shortage There was also substantial weakness in commercial activity, which contracted at the fastest rate since February 2013 and at the second fastest rate since December 2009. Civil engineering activity was essentially stagnant. The downturn in the construction sector will put more pressure on the Bank of England, Tom Moore adds: \u201cThe vast majority of June\u2019s survey responses were received ahead of the EU referendum, so the worry is that the ensuing political turmoil will hit construction spending decisions for some time to come. As a result, the latest figures raise the likelihood that the Bank of England will inject additional stimulus this summer in an attempt to dampen the short-term impact of Brexit uncertainty on the real economy.\u201d The rapid tumble in UK construction work last month is a \u201cclear warning flag\u201d of the dangers facing Britain\u2019s economy. So argues Tim Moore, economist at Markit: \u201cWidespread delays to investment decisions and housing market jitters saw the UK construction sector experience its worst month for seven years in June. Construction firms are at the sharp end of domestic economic uncertainty and jolts to investor sentiment, so trading conditions were always going to be challenging in the run-up to the EU referendum. However, the extent and speed of the downturn in the face of political and economic uncertainty is a clear warning flag for the wider post- Brexit economic outlook. David Noble, CEO at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, says the \u201cambiguity and indecision\u201d around Brexit caused the shocking slump in building activity last month. \u201cGloom and fragility descended on the sector with the steepest drop in new orders since December 2012. Caused by the continuing insecurities in both the global and UK economies and the hesitancy shown by clients to commit to projects before the EU referendum, overall activity was at its frailest for seven years. This chart shows how construction contracted last month, with housebuilding (in blue) particularly badly hit. Breaking: Britain\u2019s building sector has suffered its biggest slump in activity in seven years. It\u2019s a clear sign that the EU referendum has hurt the economy. Data firm Markit reports that residential house building suffered a \u201csteep decline\u201d in June, while commercial construction activity shrank for the first time since May 2013. Markit says that many building firms saw their new work dry up last month, as the Brexit campaign reached its climax: Lower levels of activity were overwhelmingly linked to deteriorating order books and a corresponding lack of new work to replace completed projects. A number of firms commented on reluctance among clients to commence new contracts in the run-up to the EU referendum, alongside ongoing uncertainty about the general economic outlook This dragged Markit\u2019s construction PMI down to 46.0 in June, down from 51.2 in May. Any reading below 50 shows a contraction, and 46.0 is the lowest reading since September 2009. Most of the survey was conducted before the results was known, on June 24. More details and reaction shortly.... Conner Campbell of City firm SpreadEx sums up the morning: Once again the best performing index the FTSE rose another 10-20 points after the bell, briefly pushing it above the 6600 mark for the first time since last August (i.e. just before Black Monday). Investors seem to be dining out on the promise of stimulus from the Bank of England (and, likely, the ECB), news of which gave the markets another shot in the arm just when their recovery could have begun to flag. Understandably the pound hasn\u2019t been equally as excited about this development, though its 0.2% rise this Monday has seen cable briefly graze $1.33. Italy is battling to prevent its banking sector becoming a casualty of the Brexit crisis. Shares in Italy\u2019s main lenders are all down, again, today, in a fog of confusion over their prospects. Britain\u2019s EU referendum vote has piled more pressure on Italian banks. If the eurozone economy weakens, their bad debts could be even harder to service. Prime minister Matteo Renzi is reportedly planning to step in and bailout the sector with government cash. That would be a clear breach of new European rules which make creditors, not taxpayers, take the hit when a bank fails. As the FT reports, Rome is considering going it alone: We are willing to do whatever is necessary [to defend the banks], and do not rule out acting unilaterally, although that would only be as a last resort.\u201d But such a move would seriously undermine Europe\u2019s new banking regime. Economists at Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s have issued a new warning about Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU. S&amp;P, which downgraded the UK last week (just as Iceland\u2019s footballers were downgrading the England team) has warned that Brexit uncertainty will wipe 0.8% off eurozone growth. They say: We think the U.K. will barely escape a full-fledged recession caused by Brexit, but the downside risks are numerous. Brexit will produce a drag on U.K. GDP of 1.2% in 2017 and 1% in 2018. For the eurozone, we don\u2019t expect the recovery will stall, but estimate a 0.8% hit to GDP over 2017 and 2018. We assume the Bank of England will slash its policy rate to zero by the very end of 2016 and restart its quantitative easing program in 2017, despite a pickup in inflation caused by the weaker pound. European stock markets are fairly flat this morning, as traders look to central banks to do more.... International companies with large overseas earnings are leading the stock market risers in London this morning. That\u2019s because they will benefit from the weak pound; it will make exports more competitive, and mean any dollars earned abroad are worth more when converted back to sterling. But British housebuilders are under pressure, as fears of a Brexit-induced recession swirl. In an encouraging sign for the eurozone, the number of people out of work in Spain has fallen to its lowest levels since September 2009. The jobless total fell by 124,349 people in June, according to new data, the second largest drop on record. This pulled the number of unemployed people down to 3,767,054, the lowest since September 2009. Seasonal factors will have played a big part, as the tourism season is now underway. More here. The British pound has crept a little higher this morning, up 0.2% to $1.3283. That\u2019s still around 9% lower than its pre-referendum levels, due to the historic plunge once the UK voted to leave the EU. The weakening pound is a big factor behind the FTSE 100\u2019s rally, as it makes UK shares more attractive to US investors. The FTSE 250 index, which contains more UK companies than the FTSE 100, has dropped by 0.5% this morning. It\u2019s being dragged down by shipping firm Clarkson, which has plunged by 22% after issuing a profit warning. It blamed \u2018global economic uncertainty\u2019, and the oversupply in the shipping industry. The FTSE 100 has hit a new 10-month high at the start of trading. London\u2019s blue-chip index has jumped by 32 points, or 0.3%, to 6612. That\u2019s the highest level since late last August, before stock markets were gripped by worries over China\u2019s economy. It\u2019s important to note that the FTSE 100 is priced in sterling; the slump in the pound means the index is still worth less than 2 weeks ago. Mining stocks are leading the rally in London, with silver miner Fresnillo jumping by 7%. Royal Bank of Scotland, though, is among the fallers again -- losing 2.2p to 167p. The government\u2019s break-even point of 502p, where it could sell the taxpayers stake at a profit, is getting further away..... Asian stock markets have made a decent start to the week. Shares are higher from Toyko to Delhi, as investors shake off their fears about Brexit. Mizuho Bank says investors are expecting the Bank of England, and the European Central Bank, to keep monetary policy extra-loose: \u201cProspects that central banks (BoE and ECB) will unleash fresh stimulus in coming months are providing some relief in markets.\u201d \u201cIt is also perceived that the Fed [US Federal Reserve] will either delay its rate hike to Q3/Q4 or no hike policy rate at all this year.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s 10 day since Britain voted to leave the European Union. Back then, amid the resignations, recriminations and celebrations, there were fears that the London stock markets might crash. But instead, the FTSE 100 has been bouncing back - and could hit a new 10-month high this morning [measured in sterling, anyway]. Once again, central bankers have managed to calm the crisis (for the moment...). Bank of England governor Mark Carney\u2019s promise last week of fresh stimulus measure - such as interest rate cut - is still cheering investors. Chinese policymakers are also expected to act soon, after factory data last Friday showed its manufacturing sector softening again. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says investors will be looking to central banks to do more. Today is almost certainly going to remain about the continued fallout from Brexit as we move into the second full week, further digesting and re-pricing for the new financial, economic and political landscape, the latter being the most entertaining if you are watching the chaos and antics over in Westminster. Any more hints from central banks about stimulus could also help keep the ball in the air, helping markets shrug off the Brexit impact and push on with their recoverie Monetary policy has its limits of course, it might buy us some time but it won\u2019t fix the problems in the global economy. The consequences of Brexit will dominate the political world too. Conservative MPs are racing to choose a new prime minister, while Labour are stuck in their own leadership tussle. And in a new wounding blow to irony, Leave campaigner Boris Johnson is cross that no-one\u2019s written a plan to handle Brexit: Also coming up today.... There\u2019s some economic data this morning, which may show the impact of EU referendum uncertainty. The latest report on the UK construction sector at 9.30am BST, Sentix releases its eurozone investor confidence report at 10am BST. LSE shareholders are voting on whether to approve the takeover by Germany\u2019s Deutsche Bank. But it could be a quiet afternoon, as America is celebrating Independence Day.",

And employment rose at the slowest rate since August 2013. </p> <p>It\u2019s the latest sign that Brexit uncertainty has hurt the economy, even before the vote itself (89% of the survey was conducted before June 24)</p> <p>Markit reports:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Growth over the second quarter as a whole was the weakest since the first quarter of 2013 when the current upturn began. Moreover, the 12-month outlook was the darkest since December 2012.</p> <p>Companies often reported that uncertainty linked to the EU referendum had weighed on workloads and incoming new business. </p> </blockquote> <p>This dragged the service sector PMI down to 52.3 in June, down from 53.5 in May. That matches April\u2019s 38-month low and signals a relatively weak rate of growth in UK services output. </p> <p>On the upside, it\u2019s still above the 50-point figure that splits expansion from contraction (yesterday, the construction PMI plunged to just 46)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44169a6c46cca4ecd82eae5455758a9d6afdb1f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44169a6c46cca4ecd82eae5455758a9d6afdb1f3/0_0_632_485/500.jpg\" alt=\"UK service sector PMI\" width=\"500\" height=\"384\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>But....it suggests Britain\u2019s economy weakened in the last three months.

Here\u2019s a flavour: The fallout from the Brexit vote reverberated through the markets on Tuesday as two more City property funds barred investors from withdrawing their cash and the Bank of England warned that risks to the financial system had begun to \u201ccrystallise\u201d. City watchers warned that further property funds would be forced to bar withdrawals as investors race for the door amid fears of a plunge in the values of office blocks and shopping centres in post Brexit Britain. The suspensions came on another day of drama on the financial markets, 11 days after the vote to leave the EU wrong-footed investors and sparked political turmoil. Developments included: The pound plunging to a new 31-year low against the dollar, falling 2% to $1.30 at one point. A closely watched survey of the services sector coming in worse than expected, indicating a sharp slowdown in the wider economy. The Bank of England easing regulations on banks to allow them to release up to \u00a3150bn worth of loans to households and businesses. Chancellor George Osborne held a summit with the heads of the major high street banks, who pledged to avoid a new credit crisis by making loans available.

GW Although the UK property sector is undoubtedly in a serious situation, it doesn\u2019t look like we\u2019re careering into a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. Jason Holland, managing director of City advisers Tilney Bestinvest, explains that it\u2019s different this time, partly because the Bank of England has been so proactive: The uncertainty around Brexit is undoubtedly a challenge for the property sector but this is not a post Lehman Brothers style moment when the whole financial system faced collapse and the supply of credit - key to property transactions - was in doubt. The Bank of England has set out its readiness to provide vast amounts of liquidity and interest rates look set to be cut. Talk is moving decisively in favour of a pro-growth rather than a tax hiking Budget. The stock market has weathered Brexit bettered than many predicted and successful corporate bond issues this week from British American Tobacco and Brown Forman (the producers of Jack Daniels) suggest the Sterling credit market remains open for business. The Brexit crisis has been causing angst across the global economy, with investors worried that it could hurt world economic growth.

There she goes! The pound has just slid to the $1.300 mark for the first time in over three decades, having shed 2% today. Here\u2019s a list of the biggest property funds in the UK, kindly provided by Laith Khalaf of Hargreaves Lansdown: M&amp;G Property Portfolio \u00a34255.0m *REDEMPTIONS SUSPENDED TODAY* Henderson UK Property \u00a33477.2m Aberdeen UK Property \u00a33424.2m Standard Life UK Real Estate \u00a32911m *REDEMPTIONS SUSPENDED YESTERDAY* Legal &amp; General UK Property \u00a32494.7m Aviva Investment Property Trust \u00a31842.4m *REDEMPTIONS SUSPENDED TODAY* BlackRock Global Property Securities Equity Tracker \u00a31053.7m Schroder Global Real Estate Securities \u00a3588.3m Kames Sterling Property Income \u00a3500.8m Royal London Property \u00a3402m Laith adds a word of caution: some of these funds invest in shares of property companies, which are obviously easier to sell than actual offices and shops. The pound is now hitting fresh 31-year lows.... and getting close to the $1.3000 mark for the first time since 1985. So, what happens next? Well, one hedge fund expert has tweeted that investors will now be anxiously wondering which funds might be frozen next, and getting their money out: Sometimes, though, it can be best to sit and wait: FOHF = fund of hedge funds, an investment vehicle which puts money into various hedge funds. It\u2019s been another grim day in the markets.... unless you\u2019re the FTSE 100, which has closed 0.3% higher. A good reminder that the Footsie, which is packed with international companies, is not the best barometer of the UK economy. M&amp;G\u2019s property fund owns an office block near Heathrow airport, several shopping centres, and a bunch of warehouses in Northampton. NEWSFLASH: M&amp;G has now suspended its property fund after experiencing a surge of withdrawal requests. And like Standard Life and Aviva, M&amp;G blames the Brexit uncertainty for driving investors to the exits (which are now locked) This is significant, as M&amp;G\u2019s is the biggest property fund in the UK. Here\u2019s the statement from M&amp;G, which is part of Prudential: M&amp;G SUSPENDS TRADING IN M&amp;G PROPERTY PORTFOLIO AMID BREXIT UNCERTAINTY London, 5th July 2016 - M&amp;G Investments (M&amp;G) announces a temporary suspension of trading in the shares of the M&amp;G Property Portfolio and its feeder fund. Investor redemptions in the Fund have risen markedly because of the high levels of uncertainty in the UK commercial property market since the outcome of the European Union referendum. Redemptions have now reached a point where M&amp;G believes it can best protect the interests of the funds\u2019 shareholders by seeking a temporary suspension in trading. This will allow the fund manager time to raise cash levels in a controlled manner, ensuring that any asset disposals are achieved at reasonable values. The decision to suspend was taken in agreement with the Fund\u2019s Depositary and the Financial Conduct Authority has been informed. Orders placed after 12pm on 4th July 2016 will not be processed until the suspension is lifted. M&amp;G will review the suspension every 28 days. The Property Portfolio is a broadly diversified fund which invests in 178 UK commercial properties across retail, industrial and office sectors on behalf of UK retail investors. The Fund, which managed assets of \u00a34.4 billion as at 30 June 2016, has no borrowings. To help anyone just tuning in, here\u2019s a quick recap of the key points today: Aviva, the UK investment group, has become the second company to suspend withdrawals from its property fund, following the Brexit vote. Aviva followed Standard Life, which shuttered its fund last night after experiencing a wave of redemption requests from nervous investors. It\u2019s the latest signal that last month\u2019s EU referendum result is now hitting confidence in the UK economy. An Aviva spokesperson blamed \u201cextraordinary market circumstances\u201d, adding that freezing the fund will protect all investors. Suspension of dealing will give Aviva Investors greater control in managing cashflows and conducting orderly asset sales in order to meet our obligations to investors wishing to redeem their holdings.\u201d Otherwise, it would have been forced to start selling its assets (which include supermarkets and offices across the UK) to raise funds. Analysts believe other funds will come under pressure too, if investors begin to worry that commercial property values are going to tumble in the aftermath of Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU. The move came just a couple of hours after the Bank of England took new steps to tackle the consequences of the Brexit vote. Britain\u2019s central bank relaxed the capital rules imposed on UK lenders, meaning firms and households will get access to an extra \u00a3150bn of potential credit. Banks, who met with chancellor George Osborne today, have just announced that they will make the extra capital available to the real economy. But Bank governor Mark Carney also issued a warning that the risks around Brexit are now \u2018starting to crystallise\u2019, \u201cThe UK has entered a period of uncertainty and significant economic adjustment. The efforts of the Bank of England will not be able fully and immediately to offset the market and economic volatility that can be expected while this adjustment proceeds.\u201d Carney also urged borrowers to be prudent, and warned that Britain\u2019s current account deficit with the rest of the world was a key risk in the post-Brexit world, as foreign investors may lose faith in the UK. Earlier, new economic data showed that UK service sector growth slowed last month. Fresh fears over Brexit are gripping the markets again. The pound has been rocked, hitting a new 31-year low around $1.305 against the US dollar. And the FTSE 250 index, which includes many small UK firms, is currently down 2.1% today. My colleague Jill Treanor has rattled out a Q&amp;A about Aviva and Standard Chartered\u2019s decision to block investors from cashing out of their property trusts. Here\u2019s a flavour: What are commercial property funds? They are funds that allow people to invest in commercial property developments such as office blocks and shopping centres \u2013 projects that normally rely on money from major professional investors. How much money is invested in them? Around \u00a335bn, around 7% of the total investment in UK commercial property, is invested in these property funds. Could this affect the residential property market? It is not immediately clear how this this feeds through into residential properties, although a hit to sentiment in the commercial property industry can quickly feed through to homebuyers, who might decide to pull out of transactions. The Bank of England is concerned that if these funds all seize up at once that it could amplify any fall in commercial property prices.... Could this affect the broader UK economy? Around75% of small businesses use commercial property as collateral for loans so they could face problems with their banks if prices fall too sharply. Banks also use commercial property to count towards their capital buffers; around 55% of their core capital \u2013 their main safety net in a crisis -\u2013 at the end of 2015 was based on commercial property.... More here: Earlier today, JP Morgan gave a pithy warning of the dangers of Brexit: Investors are bailing out of Britain\u2019s building and property companies today, as evidence mounts that Brexit fears are now hitting the sector. Housebuilders Barratt, Taylor Wimpey and Berkeley Group are leading the fallers on the blue-chip FTSE 100 index, down around 6% each. The FTSE 100 is still up a bit, thanks to the plunge in the pound (which helps big exporters). But Mark Carney told us this morning to watch the smaller FTSE 250 index instead, to see what the City really thinks about the UK economy. And that index has fallen by 2.5% this morning. Two challenger banks, Shawbrook and Virgin Money, have tumbled by 12% each. they are both acutely sensitive to UK consumer confidence, and spending. According to investment site Trustnet, the Aviva Property Trust holds commercial property assets across the UK. Roughly a third of its assets were in London and the South East (as of 31 May), including offices in the centre of the capital. It also owns shopping centres in Edinburgh, Manchester and Exeter, and offices in Birmingham. It will also have invested in shares of UK property companies, which have fallen sharply since the referendum. Here\u2019s our news story about Aviva locking down its UK property fund to prevent investors selling up, after the Brexit vote. Other property funds will probably come under pressure to follow Aviva and Standard Life\u2019s lead, if their customers decide to pull money out. Emma Bewley, head of funds at Connection Capital in London, told Bloomberg that: The potential impact of a high-profile liquid fund suspending redemptions shouldn\u2019t be underestimated, particularly given the uncertain environment. While asset managers will seek to avoid suspending redemptions, they may have to use additional liquidity facilities. Aviva has suspended redemptions from its property fund just three hours after the Bank of England spelt out the potential implications of such funds to the overall market. In its half-yearly assessment of risks to the financial markets, the Bank flagged up that: \u201cSince the referendum, share prices of UK real estate investment trust have fallen sharply, highlighting the risk of future adjustments in commercial retail estate prices. It then warned that: \u201cAny adjustment in commercial real estate markets could be amplified by the behaviour of leveraged investors and investors in open-ended commercial property funds. Any such amplification of market adjustments could affect economic activity by reducing the ability of companies that use commercial real state as collateral to access finance\u201d These funds account for 7% - or around \u00a335bn - of the investment in commercial property, and had already experienced significant outflows before the referendum. Commercial property prices matter because around 55% of their core capital bases are aligned to the loans in the sector and 75% of small businesses use commercial property as collateral for loans. It is the smaller banks which have greater exposure, the Bank said, after the major players reduced their exposure after the 2008 crisis. The Bank pointed out it had conducted stress tests in 2014 and 2015 on the major lenders to assume a 30% fall in property prices. Its own staff have calculated that for every 10% fall in commercial property prices there is a 1% fall in wider economic investment. The Financial Times has some good early reaction to Aviva\u2019s move: Mike Prew, analyst at Jefferies, the investment bank, said it was \u201cinevitable\u201d that further funds would halt redemptions in a \u201cvicious circle of value destruction\u201d that would also affect listed real estate investment trusts. A fund manager who monitors flows across the market said that outflows since the vote had been driven by discretionary wealth managers moving large chunks of investors\u2019 money into other asset classes. More here: Aviva becomes second UK property fund to halt redemptions Aviva and Standard Life are trying to protect the interests of all investors in their property funds by refusing to allow clients to take money out. Otherwise, they would be forced to sell property assets at firesale prices to fund redemption requests. That would drive down the value of the fund, encouraging more investors to cash out, creating a vicious circle. Instead, people with money in these funds must now sit and wait. The pound hasn\u2019t been this weak since September 1985: It has shed almost 2 cents today. Global traders are baulking at the news that two UK property trusts (so far) are now refusing to allow investors to pull their money out: Hat-tip to Giles Wilkes of the FT for the chart skills. Correction... the pound has actually fallen through $1.31 (so i\u2019ve updated that last entry). Aviva\u2019s decision to suspend its property trust has sent the pound reeling to a new 31-year low. Sterling slumped to $1.3098 against the US dollar, down 1.8 cents, to a level not seen since 1985. NEWSFLASH: Aviva, the savings and investment group, has suspended redemptions from its \u00a31.8bn property fund. It took the decision following the Brexit vote, which triggered a surge of requests from investors to pull their money out of its UK Property Trust. That\u2019s because the EU referendum could hurt the property sector, driving down the value of office blocks, supermarkets and factories. Aviva blamed \u201cextraordinary market circumstances\u201d, a day after Standard Life became the first firm to freeze its property fund. An Aviva spokesperson said: \u201cWe have acted to safeguard the interests of all our investors by suspending dealing in the fund with immediate effect. \u201cSuspension of dealing will give Aviva Investors greater control in managing cashflows and conducting orderly asset sales in order to meet our obligations to investors wishing to redeem their holdings.\u201d Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at City firm Hargreaves Lansdown, reckons more investment firms will freeze redemptions soon. \u2018The dominos are starting to fall in the UK commercial property market, as yet another fund locks its doors on the back of outflows precipitated by the Brexit vote. It\u2019s probably only a matter of time before we see other funds follow suit. George Osborne has repeated his support for Mark Carney\u2019s decision to ease the funding rules, allowing banks to lend more. He\u2019s told Sky News that the government\u2019s financial reforms, making the banks \u2018part of the solution in the UK economy, not part of the problem\u2019 are paying off. Economics professor David Blanchflower, a former Bank of England policymaker, has given Mark Carney full marks for today\u2019s performance: Resigning from high office (or not-so-high office) is in fashion this summer. So it\u2019s nice to see one senior official actually knuckling down and doing his job. Today\u2019s press conference had one key message \u2013 Britain\u2019s economy is suffering from the Brexit vote (as predicted), and its central bankers are on the case. 1) Bank of England governor Mark Carney has warned that the risks posed by the UK\u2019s referendum on EU membership have \u201cbegun to crystallise\u201d, and posing new dangers to the economy. Presenting the BoE\u2019s latest financial stability report, Carney said: The UK has entered a period of uncertainty and significant economic adjustment. The efforts of the Bank of England will not be able fully and immediately to offset the market and economic volatility that can be expected while this adjustment proceeds.\u201d 2) The BoE isn\u2019t sitting on its hands. Slashing the \u2018counter-cyclical capital reserves\u2019 will help banks to pump \u00a3150bn of extra lending into the economy. But Carney also warned that this will only work if businesses and individuals actually want to borrow. And despite the slide in the pound (which could help exporters), there are clear signs that the the economy is slowing. 3) Prudence used to be a Gordon Brown favourite, before the former chancellor and PM was engulfed by the financial crisis of 2007-08. But she has a new friend today. Asked for his advice to the UK, Carney declared that people must remain prudent: If you are taking out a mortgage, at some stage, during the life of that mortgage, conditions will be difficult. So you want to be sure, as a household or an individual, that you can repay that mortgage - you don\u2019t want to lose your house or flat. 4) The bank is watching closely for signs that Britain\u2019s most indebted households are struggling post-Brexit vote. There could be casualties out there... We have been concerned for some time about these issues,the interplay between high levels of household indebtedness and the housing market and the possibility that there will be more vulnerable households.\u201d 5) Carney reiterated that Britain\u2019s financial sector is in much better shape than before the financial crisis, so we should avoid another credit crunch. The core of this system is very strong, we may see some volatility, we may see things move around, but the system is going to be there for someone who wants to buy a house or a business person with a viable plan.\u201d 6) ....but the same can\u2019t be said of the current account deficit, which has widened to record levels. Carney warned that a weaker pound won\u2019t magically solve Britain\u2019s balance of payments woes (the fact we import more than we export). The danger is that overseas investors now shun the UK. In the governor\u2019s words: In and of itself, the movement in sterling should be beneficial for the current account. But... the pace of investment will also be quite important in terms of where the balance is going over time. 7) Carney has little time for those who point to the recovery in the FTSE 100 index (now above its pre-vote levels). It\u2019s better to look at the index of smaller firms, the FTSE 250 index, he says: \u201cIn terms of the equity markets I would focus a little bit more on the domestically-focused stock, the FTSE 250 or the component of FTSE 100 that is principally serving this economy. 8) Politics is for politicians. Carney was long rumoured to fancy a shift to Canadian politics, before a certain Justin Trudeau took the Liberal party to victory. Today he faces criticism from Leave campaigners, who will have their hands on (or at least near) the levers of power in the UK. But the governor brushed them aside, saying the Bank will keep doing its job and work with whoever is in power. Last question goes to my colleague Nils Pratley. He asks Mark Carney about the criticism piled on the Bank from Leave campaigners such as Andrea Leadsom (now in the running to become prime minister). Carney replies that \u201cwe\u2019re not asking people to make our lives easier\u201d This is a technocratic institution. We\u2019ll work with whoever is in government. In short, the Bank will keep sticking to its remit, publishing the reports expected under its remit. And that includes flagging up threats to the UK economy. That\u2019s the end of the press conference. Q: Could the Bank of England really ease monetary policy much lower - some economists suggest new quantitative easing (buying bonds with new money) wouldn\u2019t have much impact? Carney declines to comment on monetary policy \u2013 as today\u2019s meeting is about financial stability. Q: Is the Bank of England worried about the prospect of Scotland breaking away from the UK? That\u2019s a double hypothetical, Carney says - there\u2019s no 2nd referendum yet, let alone a decision. Back to the Bank of England press conference: Q: What discussions have you had with other central banks about the referendum? We have had close contact with them, Carney replies, especially in the run-up to the vote. This was effective in building mutual understanding of the risks posed by Brexit, he says. He points to the \u2018currency swaps\u2019 which allows central banks to share dollars, euros, pounds, yen etc with each other. And the global economy faces \u2018notable\u2019 spillovers, he adds. UK chancellor George Osborne has welcomed the BoE\u2019s decision to ease bank capital rules. He also reveals that major bank bosses are heading to his offices this morning, to discuss the crisis The decision to cut the counter-cyclical capital buffers is one of several Brexit u-turns, tweets The Sun\u2019s political editor: Hang on, though, didn\u2019t The Sun back Brexit??!! Some key points from Mark Carney\u2019s briefing: Q: Does the Bank of England actually have the capacity to handle Britain\u2019s exit from the EU? Mark Carney insists that yes, the BoE has the staff capacity to cope once Article 50 is triggered. But until that actually happens, the financial rules do not change. Q: How worried is the Bank about Standard Life\u2019s decision to lock down its property fund last night? (to prevent investors bailing out) Andrew Bailey, the next head of the FCA (the city watchdog), says Standard Life has taken a \u2018sensible move\u2019 to suspend redemptions. It prevents a stampede of money out of property funds while the underlying assets are revalued (which can take time). It would be wrong for investors at the front of the queue to get their money back, while those at the back lose out, Bailey says. The FCA is also in \u201cvery close touch\u201d with firms in the sector, he reveals. Q: How low could the Bank of England cut interest rates (they\u2019re currently 0.5%)? Carney declines to speculate much, as the Monetary Policy Committee is due to take a decision next week. Any measure to stimulate the economy must be well-aimed and focus on the domestic economy. We must also consider \u2018unintended consequences\u2019, he adds. [ultra-low interest rates make it hard for banks to achieve profitability, for example] Q: What impact will the slump in the pound have on the UK economy? Mark Carney says that it should help with Britain\u2019s current account deficit (reminder, it\u2019s worryingly high) Q: What is your advice to people who are wondering about taking out a loan or mortgage, asks our Jill Treanor? We are advising people to be prudent, governor Carney smiles. If you are taking out a mortgage, at some stage, during the life of that mortgage, conditions will be difficult. So you want to be sure, as a household or an individual, that you can repay that mortgage - you don\u2019t want to lose your house or flat. But this is classic central bank advice, he adds. We\u2019d tell you to be prudent if we were in the 10th year of a boom (whenever THAT happens) Carney says the Bank wants to avoid a repeat of the 2007-2008 conditions, when it was out of question to seek credit. Q: Do you regret allowing banks to pay dividends in the run-up to June\u2019s referendum? Mark Carney insists that UK banks are financially stable. Q: How many UK households are vulnerable to an economic slowdown? Carney flips this question to deputy governor Jon Cunliffe. Cunliffe says the Bank are watching the \u2018cohort\u2019 of vulnerable households closely. Households who are highly indebted tend to cut their consumption drastically, when hit by an interest rate shock or earnings shock, Cunliffe says. But the Bank did restrict the availability of high loan-to-value mortgages in 2014, to limit the number of highly vulnerable households, he adds. Q: Is the Bank worried about a crash in the buy-to-let market? Carney says the Bank is watching the buy-to-let sector carefully. He points out that the bank included a housing crash in its latest Stress Tests -- and the current environment is not a serious as modelled in those tests. The core of the UK financial system is very strong, and it will be there for home-buyers and businesses, he insists. Q: Is the Bank seeing signs of a slowdown in credit demand? Carney says this is a crucial point -- the credit market will be driven by demand, not supply. We are seeing signs that the environment is becoming more \u2018risk averse\u2019, he says. And that\u2019s why the Bank has decided to relax credit rules, to encourage banks to lend. But demand for credit will be governed by the level of uncertainty over Britain\u2019s future, and its relationship with the EU. Q: The Monetary Policy Committee warned that Britain might fall into recession after a Brexit vote, but might the fall in the pound actually be a stimulus? Carney replies that there is \u201cgrowing evidence\u201d that the economy was slowing, even before the referendum. And it is probably experiencing a \u201cmaterial slowing\u201d, despite the foreign exchange moves. Onto questions Q: The FTSE 100 has recovered its early post-Brexit falls and the pound has stabilised, so aren\u2019t markets less stressed than feared? Mark Carney replies that markets are functioning \u201cpretty well\u201d, although sterling volatility did hit a record high. He says sterling has moved in the way that was \u201cnecessary\u201d to allow the economic adjustment that is needed. [by which he means that a cheaper pound should help exporters and cut imports, in theory.....] Governor Carney adds that the FTSE 250 index gives a sense of investor expectations on the direction of the economy. [The FTSE 250, which contains smaller companies, has fallen much more than the FTSE 100, and is down 2.6% today] Mark Carney says there will be no immediate changes to UK financial regulations, until Britain has actually left the EU. The law is the law, and the rules are the rules. He is pledging to take whatever action is needed ensure monetary stability, and support the real economy. But the Bank can only do so much..... Mark Carney confirms that the Bank of England has decided to cut the \u2018counter-cyclical capital buffer\u2019 on UK banks. This means banks need to keep less capital on their books, and can pump up to \u00a3150bn more into the economy. This will \u201cimmediately\u201d give banks greater flexibility to lend to UK businesses and households, declares the BoE governor. He adds: Those businesses and households who want to seize viable opportunities in the post-Brexit world can be confident that they will be supported by the financial sector. Carney also declares that regulators will make sure that banks don\u2019t use this flexibility to boost bonus payments, or dividends. Mark Carney begins his press conference by reminding us that the Bank identified the referendum as the biggest threat to the UK economy. That warning is now being borne out, the governor says, pointing to the plunge in the pound since June 23rd. He singles out UK\u2019s current account deficit (as mentioned a few minutes ago). There is growing evidence that the referendum has delayed major investment decisions, Carney adds. But on the upside, financial markets have responded well to the volatility after the referendum result, rather than adding to stress. And banks are much better capitalised than before the Lehman crisis. The Financial Stability Report press conference is beginning now. We\u2019ve added a live feed to the top of this blog - you might need to refresh to see it. Alternatively, It\u2019s also being livestreamed here (right-click to open in a new tab). You can see the report yourself, here: Financial Stability Report, July 2016 More snap reaction: The Bank of England is also concerned about the United Kingdom\u2019s large current account deficit, following the Brexit vote. This deficit, between what Britain imports and exports, is \u201chigh by historical and international standards\u201d, says the Bank. Indeed.... --&gt; The Bank is worried that the flow of capital into the UK could now slow, making this deficit even bigger.... The financing of the deficit is reliant on continuing material inflows of portfolio and foreign direct investment, which have been used to finance the public sector deficit and corporate investment, including in commercial real estate. A sudden shift in the supply of foreign capital and in the current account deficit would be associated with a sharp increase in risk premia and adjustment in sterling. The BoE also points out the pound suffered a record fall after the referendum vote: . The Bank of England has also warned Britain\u2019s banks not to splurge cash on payments to shareholders, or bonuses to staff: Newsflash from London: Britain\u2019s central bank has warned that the risks posed by the Brexit vote are \u201cstarting to crystallise\u201d. In it latest financial stability report, just released, the Bank of England warns that: \u201cThere is evidence that some risks have begun to crystallise. The current outlook for UK financial stability is challenging,\u201d The BoE has also taken action to fight the looming threat of recession, by relaxing the capital control rules on UK banks. That is meant to encourage lenders to keep providing credit to the UK economy. Back in March, the BoE has announced that the so-called counter-cyclical capital buffer would rise to 0.5%. It has now reversed that decision, potentially freeing up an extra \u00a3150bn for lending, the BoE said. And the Bank also pledged to do more to help the economy, saying: \u201cThe Financial Policy Committee stands ready to take actions that will ensure that capital and liquidity buffers can be drawn on as needed, to support the supply of credit and in support of market functioning.\u201d We\u2019ll hear more from governor Mark Carney at 11am. In five minutes, the Bank of England will publish its latest Financial Stability report...and may just announce some measures to prop up the UK economy (as explained earlier) Mark Priest of ETX Capital says Standard Life\u2019s decision to freeze its property fund last night has spooked the City, and helped to drive down the pound. Standard Life\u2019s decision to close redemptions on its open-ended property fund is vitally important and shows just how precarious the situation is right now. This seems to have precipitated some pretty big selling in property stocks and asset managers, with Legal &amp; General and Aberdeen Asset Management suffering nasty falls this morning. Barratt Developments and Taylor Wimpey are down 5% again. Investors are getting very nervous now as they fear Standard Life may not be the only fund that will close its doors. The last time we saw this kind of action was in the financial crisis. Bad news for British holidaymakers....sterling has also hit a two-and-a-half-year low against the euro, at \u20ac1.1787. The last time the pound was this low, in 1985, David Bowie and Mick Jagger were topping the charts with Dancing In The Streets. If the pound loses another cent, we\u2019ll be back to 1984 levels, when Frankie Goes To Hollywood were encouraging the nation to Relax. Click on this tweet to see more.... Boom! The pound just hit a new 31-year low against the US dollar. Sterling slumped by 1.5 cents to $1.3113 following the news that UK service sector growth was hit by Brexit angst last month. That\u2019s below the levels hit after the referendum vote, and back to the sterling crisis of the mid-1980s. Analysts are concerned that growth in Britain\u2019s dominant services sector slowed last month, but relieved that it didn\u2019t actually contract: Economist Rupert Seggins has helpfully put the service sector report into context: Breaking! Growth in Britain\u2019s service sector has hit a joint-38-month low, indicating that economic growth has slowed. Data firm Markit reports the UK\u2019s services companies suffered a fall in new business last month. And employment rose at the slowest rate since August 2013. It\u2019s the latest sign that Brexit uncertainty has hurt the economy, even before the vote itself (89% of the survey was conducted before June 24) Markit reports: Growth over the second quarter as a whole was the weakest since the first quarter of 2013 when the current upturn began. Moreover, the 12-month outlook was the darkest since December 2012. Companies often reported that uncertainty linked to the EU referendum had weighed on workloads and incoming new business. This dragged the service sector PMI down to 52.3 in June, down from 53.5 in May. That matches April\u2019s 38-month low and signals a relatively weak rate of growth in UK services output. On the upside, it\u2019s still above the 50-point figure that splits expansion from contraction (yesterday, the construction PMI plunged to just 46) But....it suggests Britain\u2019s economy weakened in the last three months. And there could be worse to come. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, explains: \u201cThe PMI surveys indicate that the pace of UK economic growth slowed to just 0.2% in the second quarter, with a further loss of momentum in June as Brexit anxiety intensified. \u201cHiring has also clearly been hit as firms lack clarity on the economic outlook. Business optimism in the vast service sector is down to a three-and-a-half-year low. \u201cA further slowing, and possible contraction, looks highly likely in coming months as a result of the uncertainty created by the EU referendum. Shares in UK property firms are sliding this morning. Investors are racing for the hills, after Standard Life froze redemptions from its \u00a32.9bn property fund last night following a surge of redemption requests after the Brexit vote. Building firms Taylor Wimpey, Berkeley Group and Barratt Developments are all down 6%. Persimmon are close behind (-5.7%) despite telling the City this morning that it is still confidence about its prospects. Land Securities, one of the UK\u2019s largest commercial property owners, has fallen 5%. Kit Juckes of French bank Societe Generale says \u201cthe mood has soured again\u201d. The announcement that fund manager Standard Life had stopped retail investors from pulling out of one of the largest UK property funds is one catalyst for the downturn in sentiment, though not the only one. Concerns about Italian banks are growing, too. Just in....growth in Europe\u2019s service sector slowed last month, as firms watched Britain head to the polls in the EU referendum. The eurozone services PMI, which measures activity across the sector, has fallen to 52.8 in June, down from 53.3 in May. That\u2019s the lowest reading since January 2015. Germany had another good month, with its services sector PMI rising to 53.7 from 53.2. Italy\u2019s service sector returned to growth, with the PMI jumping to 51.9 from 49.8. But France\u2019s private sector contracted again. And if you factor in the latest manufacturing data, you see that growth has dropped to its weakest level since the last quarter of 2014: Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, fears the eurozone economy is faltering. \u201cThe eurozone economy failed to gain momentum in June, rounding off a disappointing second quarter. Faster manufacturing growth was countered by a slowdown in the service sector, leaving the overall pace of expansion of business activity unchanged since May. \u201cThe survey is signalling GDP growth of just 0.3%, similar to the sluggish trend recorded over the past year. The data suggest that the strong upturn seen in the official GDP data at the start of the year will have overstated the underlying health of the economy, and that growth will have slowed in the second quarter. And that\u2019s before the Brexit shock.... Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency trading firm World First, agrees that Mark Carney is likely to relax capital rules today, following the Brexit vote. But he also fears that banks might not lend more to customers. Here\u2019s why: Mark Carney\u2019s Bank of England is expected to flex the muscles of their newest counter-cyclical capital buffer today and lower the levels of capital banks are forced to hold in their coffers. This should allow banks to increase the volume of loans they\u2019re extending to the private sector as they look to put the capital to work which, in turn, supports the credit markets and small businesses reliant on bank funding. However, history isn\u2019t particularly supportive of this theory. Mervyn King\u2019s Bank of England had a torrid time trying to get UK banks to issue credit for one key reason \u2013 the demand for loans simply wasn\u2019t there. In times of political and economic uncertainty, appetite for credit among SMEs falls through the floor, and understandably so. Dan Davies of Frontline Analysts reckons the markets look pretty edgy, given the drops on the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250. Nervous investors are piling into the Swiss government debt this morning, in their search for a safe haven. They have driven prices to record highs. And amazingly, the yield on 50-year Swiss debt is now negative -- meaning investors are paying for the chance to lend to Bern until 2066! All is not well out there..... European stock markets are falling in early trading, as investors fret about the global economy. The French and German indices are both down around 1%. London\u2019s FTSE 100 is only down 0.3%, thanks to the weakening pound (which helps internationally-focused firms). But the smaller FTSE 250 has lost 1.8% in early trading, following a 2% slide yesterday. Confidence among British businesses fell sharply following the vote to leave the European Union, according to a new survey. Almost 50% of firms are now pessimistic about the UK economy, the survey by YouGov and the Centre for Economics and Business Research found. That\u2019s up from 25% before the referendum. It suggests that Britain has suffered \u201ca significant shock reaction (to Brexit),\u201d according to Scott Corfe, director at Cebr. He adds: \u201cNot only are businesses feeling much more pessimistic in general about the state of the economy, but their own expectations for domestic sales, exports and investments over the next 12 months have gone off a cliff.\u201d This will alarm the Bank of England, and encourage policymakers to consider measure to prevent the UK falling into recession. The pound is dropping in early trading, as investors await the Bank of England\u2019s financial stability report. Sterling has dropped by over one cent, to $1.3174 against the US dollar. That\u2019s not far from the 31-year low plumbed after the Brexit vote ($1.3118 is the magic number). In theory, a weak pound is good for exporters -- but only if demand for their products isn\u2019t dented by a global downturn. And it won\u2019t fix the UK economy\u2019s underlying weaknesses.... Cometh the hour, cometh the man, again?.... With Brexit fears gripping Britain\u2019s economy, the public and the City are crying out for guidance and help. So as Westminster is rather pre-occupied by leadership contests, the responsibility will fall to Bank of England governor Mark Carney today. The BoE will released its latest Financial Stability report at 10.30am this morning, assessing the state of the UK\u2019s economy. It looks rather more unstable than two weeks ago, of course, since the EU referendum vote turned politics on its head, and put business confidence on its knees. Then at 11am, Carney will hold a press conference to explain the Bank\u2019s thinking, and any new measures it is taking to tackle the crisis. This will be Carney\u2019s second set piece event in a week; last Thursday, he all-but promised interest rate cuts and more stimulus measures this summer. So what could he do today? The Bank could choose to relax the capital rules imposed on banks, to give them more leeway to handle the fallout from Brexit. That would be a symbolic move to ease pressures on the City; it\u2019s only six months since the BoE tightened those rules, which are meant to protect us from a financial crisis. Carney could also signal that more credit will be thrown at the economy, by beefing up the existing Funding for Lending. That would also help to prevent a credit crunch clogging up the economy. Here\u2019s our preview: There are already signs that last month\u2019s referendum is having a damaging impact on the economy. As we liveblogged last night, Standard Life has been forced to stop investors withdrawing from its real estate fund, after being deluged by redemption requests. That may herald some nasty times in the property sector.... Also coming up today.... We get a flurry of economic data today, showing how service sector companies in the UK, the eurozone and America performed in June. Analysts will be looking for signs that the Brexit crisis hit growth, after some shockingly weak construction data yesterday 9am BST: Eurozone service sector PMI 9.30am BST: UK services sector PMI 2.45pm BST: US ISM service sector report 3pm BST: US factory orders. And in the City, building firm Persimmon and brewery chain Young &amp; Co are reporting results.",

The Fed slashed rates, in vain, and by 1985 drastic action was needed. The US, the UK, France, West Germany and Japan agreed to intervene in the markets to weaken the US dollar - creating <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaza_Accord\">the Plaza Accord</a>. </p> <p>That plan worked, sending the pound back up against the US dollar.</p> <p>But while America benefitted from a more competitive exchange rate, other nations suffered.

                "bodyText":"A quick mini-recap: The Brexit crisis has driven the pound down below $1.30 to levels last seen in 1985. Three more commercial property funds have suspended trading, after a rush of redemptions requests following the referendum. They are Columbia Threadneedle, Canada Life and Henderson. That takes the total to six, and means half of Britain\u2019s \u00a325bn property fund sector is now on ice. Analysts believe investors won\u2019t be able to get their money back for months. Stock markets have fallen again, hit by fears that the EU referendum is now hitting the UK economy, and beyond. Britain\u2019s FTSE 250 has lost some 10% of its value since the referendum. Concerns are also growing over Italy\u2019s bank sector, whose shares have tumbled by a third since the Eu referendum. Banca Monte Dei Paschi Di Siena has until Friday to devise a plan to deal with its bad banks. Accountancy firm KPMG has warned that the Brexit vote has hit M&amp;A activity: And the latest minutes of the Federal Reserve\u2019s June meeting show that US central bank policymakers were worried about the consequences of last month\u2019s referendum. That\u2019s all for tonight, we reckon. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Newsflash: The US central bank cited the Brexit vote as a reason to hold interest rates unchanged last month. Minutes of the Federal Reserve\u2019s meeting in mid-June showed that policymakers wanted to hold off until Britain had held its EU referendum, a week later. The minutes state that: \u201cMembers generally agreed that, before assessing whether another step in removing monetary accommodation was warranted, it was prudent to wait for additional data on the consequences of the U.K. vote.\u201d They also cited the surprisingly weak US jobs figures as another reason that they held fire on a rate hike. Britain\u2019s decision to vote to leave the EU means many economists now expect the Fed to leave rates on hold until the end of this year. Bank shares have been under pressure again today - as recorded in an earlier post - and a couple of analysts have looked at the exposure of the major lenders to the property sector, which was a headache for many of them in 2008 crisis. At Bernstein, analysts have calculated the bailed out banks Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group are the most exposed - with aroudn \u00a319bn and \u00a313bn of loans respectively. The banking sector\u2019s exposure is already down from \u00a3150bn to \u00a386bn according to Bank of England data. \u201cBanks haven\u2019t really played the asset class in the last five years - it\u2019s mostly been the shadow banking sector,\u201d said the Bernstein analysts. Raul Sinha, analyst at JP Morgan, says the major UK lenders have \u00a369bn of the loans and the smaller banks and building societies some \u00a317bn (which is also at the riskier end). Sinha\u2019s view is that: \u201cRisks for the major UK banks are manageable, small lenders in focus\u201d. RBS\u2019 exposure is 66% of its tangible net asset value, according to Sinha. The annual report of RBS shows that the proportion of the loan book with loan to values of more than 75% has fallen and the deals where the value of the property is less than the loan are largely loans from the past. Canada Life has sent over a statement, confirming that it has suspended redemptions from its commercial property funds. It blamed \u201congoing uncertainty around the pricing of commercial property assets\u201d following the vote to leave the European Union, and the recent rise in requests to withdraw (or switch) from the property fund . A spokesperson from Canada Life explained: \u201cFollowing last month\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, a combination of uncertainty around the pricing of commercial property assets and the recent rise in requests to withdraw from property funds, has meant Canada Life taking the decision to immediately defer requests for withdrawals. Deferring requests to withdraw allows us to protect the interests of all investors in the property fund, including those who plan to remain invested for the medium to long term.\u201d The pound is ending the day where it began it, at its lowest levels since 1985 against the US dollar. Sterling is hovering around $1.294 tonight. The rush of property fund freezes has not helped the mood in the City. And with the Bank of England likely to cut interest rates soon, analysts are predicting more pain for the pound. A correction: Columbia Threadneedle actually suspended redemptions at noon today, not 11am as I wrote earlier. Sorry for any confusion. Shaun Port, CIO of investment group Nutmeg, predicts that Britain\u2019s property fund will soon all be gated, and remain locked until the end of 2016. He says: This is a stark reminder that low volatility does not mean low risk. \u201cInvestors tend to invest on the understanding that they can sell their investment at any time, but the underlying assets - large buildings - are themselves very hard to sell at short notice. They require weeks or months to sell. Worse, some properties under development cannot be sold until development work is completed.\u201d This chart shows how a downturn in commercial real estate (CRE) would hurt Britain\u2019s banks: Brexit fears have hit shares across Europe again today. The FTSE 100 index has closed down 81 points, or 1.25%, at 6463. Tesco (-8%) and Morrisons (-7%) were the biggest fallers, due to the price war fears we covered earlier. The FTSE 250 index of smaller, UK-focused, companies closed down 0.4% at 15669, so almost 10% below its pre-referendum levels. Germany\u2019s DAX stock index shed 1.7%, while Spain\u2019s IBEX fell 1.9%. Financial shares have had another bad day; the Stoxx 600 bank share index closed at its lowest level since November 2011 (the peak of the eurozone debt crisis, when Greece and Italy\u2019s governments were toppled). Joshua Mahony of IG says investors are fleeing into safe assets, because of the dangers created by the Brexit vote. Global markets are on the back foot once more today, as the fears that seemed to fade over the last week reappear once more. Despite the rallying cries of Boris Johnson, markets are not waving away the implications of the referendum result by focusing in on last week\u2019s FTSE 100 remarkable recovery. Instead, a focus upon the continued deterioration in the pound and euro highlights the negative economic consequences of that vote. In a world where around $10 trillion of global government credit has yields at or below zero, it is clear that investors are desperately seeking for safety wherever it can be found. Today\u2019s 27-month high in gold and Monday\u2019s near two-year high for silver highlights the underlying rush to havens in an increasingly uncertain future. Canada Life have now confirmed that they have indeed frozen trading in their UK property fund. More than half the UK\u2019s \u00a325bn property investment sector has now been suspended this week, as Brexit fears hit the economy. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, predicts that Aviva, Standard Life, M&amp;G, Columbia, Henderson and (apparently) Canada Life will leave their funds frozen for months. Here\u2019s his take: \u201cOver half of the property fund sector is now on ice, and will remain so until managers raise enough cash to meet redemptions. To do that they need to sell properties, and as any homeowner knows, that is not a quick or painless procedure. These funds are therefore likely to be closed for weeks and months rather than simply a matter of days. Clearly there has been a knee-jerk reaction to Brexit in the commercial property sector, which may moderate over time. Investors in commercial property funds should not make decisions in a panic. Granted the Brexit vote may have the potential to negatively affect the commercial property market in the short run, but long term investors should be willing to ride out periods of weakness, particularly when there has been such a sharp decline in fund prices without much evidence of a slowdown in the underlying property market.\u201d There\u2019s a rumour that Canada Life have also frozen redemptions in their property fund... #unconfirmed Here\u2019s another consequence of Brexit angst: investors now expect UK interest rates to remain at ultra-low levels for the rest of the decade: The Bank of England is due to announce its next interest rate decision next Thursday. Another one! Columbia Threadneedle has announced that it has suspended dealings in its \u00a31.4bn property fund, as of noon today (11am GMT) *CORRECTED*. It blames uncertainty following the EU referendum, and predicts that retail outflows will continue for some time. The British Chamber of Commerce in Germany (BCCG) has warned companies trading between the two countries that they should prepare for a worst-case scenario where Britain ends up trading with the European Union \u201con the same terms as Panama\u201d. At a press conference in Berlin on Wednesday, BCCG council member Stefan Kraus said it was \u201chard to imagine that a trade deal between Britain and the EU would be passed unanimously by all 38 parliaments who have a veto\u201d and there was therefore \u201ca risk that there won\u2019t be an agreement after two years\u201d and trade relations would revert back WTO rules. Referring to the stalling negotiations over the CETA trade deal between the EU and Canada, Kraus said: \u201cWe are currently experiencing how difficult it is to close trade deals. A trade between the EU and Great Britain would be probably be as far-reaching as CETA.\u201d Kraus called on companies involved in trade between Britain and Germany to do \u201cBrexit due diligence\u201d over the course of the next two or three months: \u201cThose who wait for two years to make a decision will find it is too late to react if no deal materialises\u201d. Henderson\u2019s property fund is valued at around \u00a33.9bn. So there is now around \u00a313bn of savers\u2019 money now locked up in commercial property funds. For how long, who knows? Henderson, along with Aviva, Standard Life and M&amp;G had all bought property assets such as supermarkets, office blocks, warehouses. Investors knew that could try to leave these \u2018open-ended\u2019 funds at any time, but they also knew that the company\u2019s could freeze them if too many redemption requests were made at once. Here\u2019s Henderson\u2019s statement: Breaking: Investment fund Henderson has just announced that it is suspending trading in its property fund. This means investors will not be able to redeem their money right now, and must wait for the company to ungate the fund, sometime in the future. Henderson took the move after seeing a surge of requests, after the EU referendum - just like Aviva, Standard Life and M&amp;G earlier this week. The US services sector grew in June, with new business expanding at the fastest rate since January. The headline index on the Markit PMI edged up slightly to 51.4 from 51.3 in May, where anything above 50 indicates growth. However, business expectations weakened, and jobs in the sector were created at the slowest pace in 17 months. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit: Rebound, what rebound? The final PMI numbers confirm the earlier flash PMI signal that the pace of US economic growth remained subdued in the second quarter. While volatile official GDP numbers are widely expected to show a rebound from a lacklustre start to the year, the PMIs suggest the underlying malaise has not gone away. The surveys point to an annualized pace of economic growth of just 1% in the second quarter. Service sector confidence has slumped to the lowest since 2009 alongside ongoing woes in the energy and manufacturing sectors, as well as worries about the outlook amid presidential election uncertainty. Hiring has also slowed, though remains surprisingly upbeat. The surveys signal non-farm payroll growth of 150,000 in June, suggesting many companies expect the slowdown to be short-lived.\u201d US markets have opened down, as the Brexit gloom enveloping European investors ripples across the Atlantic. Dow Jones: -0.3% at 17,796 S&amp;P 500: -0.3% at 2,082 Nasdaq: -0.5% at 4,798 Tesco is the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 on the back of speculation that a vicious supermarket price war is about to break out, hurting profits in the sector. Tesco is down 9% at 160p while Morrisons shares are down 6.6% at 174p. Sainsbury\u2019s is down 3.6% at 215p. It followed a note by HSBC analyst David McCarthy, who highlighted comments made by David Cheesewright, the head of international operations at Walmart, the US retail giant and Asda owner. Cheesewright told shareholders that he would prioritise sales volume over profit, McCarthy said, signalling that Asda will slash prices in an attempt to keep customers coming through its doors. McCarthy said: If Asda does reposition fundamentally, then it could seriously damage sector profitability. If Asda decided to invest half its margin into price, a competitor reaction could wipe out almost all industry profitability and would force an industry restructure. Our full story here: Sir Howard Davies, chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland, was on the radio this morning admitting that it would be difficult to overlook the bank\u2019s share price when making decisions about selling off the 73% stake the taxpayer still owns. Just a few hours later, the prospects appear to have diminished even further: the bank\u2019s shares have slumped to 148p, the lowest price at which they have traded since January 2009. That month is significant: January 2009 was one of the grimmest moments of the banking crisis - at least when it comes to the share prices of Britain\u2019s banks. On January 20th that year RBS sunk to 103p (on January 20). These days the concern is more about the ability of RBS to generate revenue and make distributions to shareholders rather than whether it can survive. Even so, the share price is well below the 502p average price at which taxpayers bought their stake in the bank and below the 250p it was trading at before the referendum result was known. The other bailed out bank - Lloyds Banking Group - is also sinking. Its shares are below 50p - compared with a breakeven price of 73.6p. Not everyone is gloomy about the UK economy post-Brexit vote. Mark Price, the UK trade and investment minister and former Waitrose boss, is very upbeat about Britain\u2019s future. Speaking on an official visit to Hong Kong and China, Lord Price said the outcome of the referendum handed the UK and rest of the world the opportunity \u201cto create a second Elizabethan Golden Age\u201d of trade and investment. A fresh start gives a unique opportunity to shape a bright future for the UK as a global trading nation and open economy. The key message is that we have a strong economy: we remain a fantastic place to invest, and have plenty of innovative, successful businesses. I have every confidence we will make this work. I\u2019m optimistic about the future: particularly in helping create a second Elizabethan Golden Age. The first Golden Age was based on peace, prosperity, new trading markets and a flourishing of the arts. The prize that now awaits us is a continued close trading relationship with Europe... There\u2019s also a prospect for striking new deals with Canada, New Zealand and Australia which could form the beginning of a Commonwealth trading pact. The exciting prospect of continuing trading relations with Europe and enhancing trading relationships East and West provides the UK with an opportunity to be a super connected trading hub. Reinforcing democracy, British rule of law, and tolerance through these enhanced business connections is how we will build trust which in turn leads to peace and prosperity. I am optimistic that we can seize the opportunity to create a second Elizabethan Golden Age. Turning to commercial property, the central London office market is most exposed to waning demand from tenants post-Brexit vote according economists at Capital Economics. And dwindling demand for space means falling office rents. Given that the UK\u2019s post- Brexit arrangement is subject to massive uncertainty, leasing activity is likely to be subdued in the short-term. We cut our forecasts for City and West End rental values at the end of 2017 by 5% and 3% respectively. They say capital values in the central London office market might drop anywhere between 3% and 10% over the next four years. The French Prime Minister has told the country\u2019s finance industry that France will be more attractive for companies following Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU. Parking his tank on the City of London\u2019s lawn, Manuel Valls said he wanted Paris to be Europe\u2019s top financial centre. The sharp drop in the value of the pound will not necessarily mean higher prices in store according to Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury\u2019s. There has been lots of speculation that prices will rise following the Brexit vote, mainly because a weaker pound makes imports into the country more expensive, and Britain is a net importer. But speaking at Sainsbury\u2019s annual meeting, Coupe told the supermarket\u2019s shareholders: It is not certain we will see inflationary pressures passed on to customers. It is difficult to judge how it will play out. Things may change in the future, commodity prices could come down, exchange rates could change. Europe\u2019s stock markets are suffering a chunky selloff, as the sight of the pound falling through $1.30 this morning spooks investors. Every index is now down, including the FTSE 100 \u2013 despite the boost which weak sterling gives to international companies. Here\u2019s the damage: In London, supermarket chain Tesco has now lost 7% as analysts predict a new price war. Morrisons are down 6%, and Sainsbury are off 5%. IAG, the airline group that owns British Airways, is down 6.5% after analysts at Barclays predicted that companies will cut back on premium travel. And the building firms are still in the red too. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: After a poor start the markets looked increasingly uglier as Wednesday progressed, the widespread losses once again driven by the pound. Down over half a percent against both the dollar and the euro sterling is continuing to feel the post-Brexit pinch this morning, falling far enough that even the FTSE 100, previously buoyed by the prospect of cheaper exports, is starting to suffer. Having crept 0.3% higher soon after the bell the UK index has now fallen nearly 1%, pushed lower by the banking and housing stocks. The sudden closure of Aviva, Standard Life and M&amp;G\u2019s property funds this week have been a painful lesson for some investors. All three were \u2018open-ended\u2019 funds, which allow investors to take out their money at short notice (rather than only during fixed windows). So, the fund managers need to keep plenty of cash to hand to cover redemptions, and can be forced to lock the gates if many investors try to cash in at once. As happened this week. Naomi Heaton of asset management firm LCP explains how open-ended funds can become a \u201cliquidity trap\u201d \u201cWhilst open-ended funds, such as Aviva, purport to offer liquidity, in a falling market these funds suspend redemptions when investors rush to withdraw money, with disastrous consequences. Closed-end funds do not have this problem as investors come in with a medium term horizon and do not bank on a speedy exit.\u201d An alternative option is a \u201creal estate investment trust; a company which owns property assets. Readers may feel that we\u2019ve been reporting new 31-year lows for the pound for weeks. And they\u2019d be right. As this chart shows, sterling has slumped to a series of three-decade lows since the referendum vote. Every fresh weakness has taken us back to levels last seen in early 1985. At the end of February 1985, the pound hit $1.052 against the US dollar. So, if we go through that level, it\u2019s a record low. The sterling crisis of the mid-1980s was one of the key economic moments of the Thatcher government. Chancellor Geoffrey Howe started the ball rolling in 1979 when he relaxed capital controls (after many years in which the Treasury tried to keep the pound stronger than the markets liked). With the economy in recession, Howe cut interest rates (and also hiked taxes in the famous/notorious 1981 budget). Investors voted with their feet, and by 1984 the pound was ploughing towards parity with the US dollar for the first time ever. Quite a reversal, given one pound was worth more than four dollars during the Gold Standard years (Winston Churchill blundered by putting the UK back onto the Standard at the old rate after World War One). The chart shows the pound/dollar rate over the last two centuries: But the sterling crisis of 1985 wasn\u2019t all down to the UK. Over in America, the Federal Reserve had hiked interest rates as Fed chair Paul Volcker tried to tame inflation. He succeeded, perhaps too well, sending the dollar soaring against other currencies. The Fed slashed rates, in vain, and by 1985 drastic action was needed. The US, the UK, France, West Germany and Japan agreed to intervene in the markets to weaken the US dollar - creating the Plaza Accord. That plan worked, sending the pound back up against the US dollar. But while America benefitted from a more competitive exchange rate, other nations suffered. So two years later the five countries plus Canada met at the Louvre in Paris to agree to push the US dollar up again. This chart, from Zerohedge, has more info (click here for a large version) Another Brexit job opportunity.... Tough gig. But perhaps a perfect role for Boris Johnson, now he doesn\u2019t have to run the country after all.... Accountancy firm KPMG has appointed its first ever \u201cHead of Brexit\u201d, after seeing several big deals frozen following the referendum result. Karen Briggs, a KPMG partner, is planning to build a dedicated team to help clients navigate through the stormy waters ahead, in the short and long term. Briggs explains that some clients are hoping to profit from the Brexit vote: We have been advising our clients to consider the next two weeks, two months and two years to assess the path ahead. Looking at our 2:2:2 model, many of our clients have been seeking advice on their immediate risks. However, we are now seeing clients look further ahead to what opportunities might lie ahead in the next two years \u2013 whether these are bolstering trading relationships with China or out-manoeuvring competitors. We are also engaging international clients and are observing, interestingly, predatory intentions from other European nations considering what competitive advantage a Brexit might mean for them. Briggs also reports that Brexit has already forced some mergers to be suspended. We are the largest M&amp;A adviser by volume and we have seen half a dozen deals we are working on put on hold in the wake of the vote outcome. Whether this is a short-term wobble or has more lasting ramifications remains to be seen at this stage.\u201d Britain\u2019s FTSE 250 index has now fallen by 1.1% today, or 177 points to 15,557, as investors continue to bail out of UK companies. That means the 250 index has now shed more than 10% of its value since the vote on June 23rd. Bank of England governor Mark Carney said yesterday that the FTSE 250 is a good gauge of market sentiment towards the UK, so the recent slump in valuations is a concern. The index slumped by 13% in the two days after the vote, before bounding back. But it\u2019s been sliding all week, as Brexit gloom has deepened. The biggest fallers today include new \u2018challenger banks\u2019, Metro and Aldermore, who will suffer if Britain falls into recession. DFS, the furniture group, have fallen by 7%. Its sales could suffer if nervous consumers decide to spend and borrow less. CLS Holdings, a property management firm, is also under the cosh, reflecting worries that Britain\u2019s commercial property market is being hit by Brexit fears. It\u2019s such a contrast with the internationally focused FTSE 100, which is actually up since the referendum (because the weak pound has boosted companies who sell overseas) The drop in UK car sales in June is worrying, says Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight. He fears that consumers are going to rein in their spending, despite the Bank of England encouraging banks to boost their lending. While fleet sales were resilient in June, there will be the worry for the car sector that fleet operators could increasingly delay and reduce replacement of their existing cars in a more uncertain and weaker economic environment. Meanwhile, the car sector must have serious concerns that consumers will cut back on buying new cars as a more uncertain environment hits confidence and undermines willingness to make big ticket purchases. There is widespread suspicion \u2013 including at the Bank of England - that heightened uncertainty following the vote to leave the European Union will particularly hit sales of big-ticket items such as cars and houses.There is also the significant possibly that the fundamentals for consumers will deteriorate appreciable over the coming months. This chart from Bloomberg shows how the pound suffered significant tumbles against other currencies since the referendum on June 23rd. Here\u2019s our updated news story on the pound\u2019s latest tumble against the US dollar, by Angela Monaghan: UK car sales fell last month, for only the second time in four years. New figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Trades shows that 255,766 new vehicles were registered in June, 0.8% fewer than in June 2015. It may signal that consumers become more cautious about big spending decisions around the time of the referendum, or that the economy was slowing anyway. It\u2019s the first monthly fall since last October, and the first fall in any June since 2011. Mike Hawes, SMMT Chief Executive, wants the government to take action to support the industry: \u201cIt is far too soon to determine whether the referendum result has had an impact on the new car market. The first six months saw strong demand at record levels but the market undoubtedly cooled over the second quarter. It\u2019s important government takes every measure to restore business and economic confidence to avoid the market contracting in the coming months. City economists are concerned by sterling\u2019s wobble overnight, and fear there is worse to come in next few months. Andrew Edwards, CEO of trading firm ETX Capital, says investors are reacting to M&amp;G Investments, Aviva and Standard Life freezing their UK property funds. Investors are now nervously casting their eyes around for other funds that may shutter. The negative effect on sentiment in the investment market will underpin sterling weakness. Pessimistic predictions for sterling are coming true. The pound is the chief proxy for the post-Brexit mood in the markets. Sterling is bearing the brunt of market stress, in sharp contrast to the FTSE 100, which is holding firm because 75% or so of earnings comes from overseas and because of heavy weighting towards the big international groups on the index. The question is: how long can this last if more funds start pulling the plug?\u201d Andy Scott of currency firm HiFX fears that political instability will hurt the pound: \u201cThe fears over Brexit are quickly being realised with an initial heavy selloff following the shock result, followed by this second wave of investors who held their nerve initially, but are now deciding that they\u2019d rather accept the losses so far than risk losing more. Clearly Mark Carney and George Osborne believe there are very rough times ahead for the UK economy as they begin rolling out a number of measures to cushion the potential impact. The Pound is now clearly seen as a high risk asset and when market sentiment becomes very risk averse, it will come under pressure as seen over the past two days. Sweden\u2019s central bank has been forced to tear up its plans to raise interest rates this year, thanks to the UK\u2019s EU referendum. The Riksbank just announced that future rate hikes have been \u201cpostponed\u201d, as it must now focus on protecting the Swedish economy from Brexit fallout. There is considerable uncertainty over economic developments abroad and this has increased as a consequence of the result of the British referendum on the EU. A highly expansionary monetary policy is needed to provide support to the Swedish economy and rising inflation. Fears of a property slowdown following the Brexit vote are hitting the shares of British banks and building firms again. The big fallers on the FTSE 100 include many construction firms and financial stocks, as investors worry that the UK economy could suffer a recession. Supermarket firms are also down, after new data showed food prices fell again last month (good for consumers, but bad for profits). The FTSE 100 itself is actually up 20 points, or 0.3%, thanks to international companies such as miners (whose earnings are often in dollars). But the smaller FTSE 250 index, which is more UK-focused, has shed 0.4% this morning. It\u2019s already lost 9% since the EU referendum. Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct says: It\u2019s an uneasy start in London with the waning pound no longer seemingly sufficient to deliver any meaningful upside for stocks. GBP/USD is now below 1.30 as expectations build that we\u2019ll see a rate cut from the Bank of England. The pound\u2019s latest slump came hours after Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned that the risks of Brexit were beginning to crystallise.... On the night of the EU referendum, the pound hit the giddy heights of $1.50 against the dollar. Now, though, most economists reckon it will languish below $1.30 for the rest of the year. Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s share price has taken a battering since the referendum, losing more than 30% to just 155p. That\u2019s far below the 502p at which taxpayers would break even on their 73% stake, acquired during the 2008 crisis. Sir Howard Davies, the bank\u2019s chairman, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme this morning that that \u201crealistically\u201d this means the government it not going to be able to sell off the rest any time soon. \u201cOne can deduce it will be later than sooner,\u201d Davies said, admitting \u201cyou cannot ignore the share price\u201d. Chancellor George Osborne had set himself a goal to sell off most the stake by the end his parliament \u2013 2020 \u2013 but as Davies said, this is something for the new government to decide. He explained the share price by saying: \u201cif you are a major UK bank you can\u2019t ignore what\u2019s going in the UK economy\u201d. Davies was among those bank bossed called to see Chancellor George Osborne yesterday, who asked them about the conditions they were experiencing in their branches. He said it was \u201cnot so bad\u201d but that there had been a slowdown in property. Like others, Davies is trying to get across that banks are open for business, not as they were in 2008 when banks had to hunker down and amass capital to try to survive the turmoil. This is what governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney had said yesterday and Davies said he agreed his view that it was an issue of demand for credit rather than supply. The value of the pound could also affect RBS as it expecting a huge penalty from the US authorities for the way it packaged up bonds during the subprime mortgage crisis almost 10 years ago. Davies appeared to admit that RBS had taken some protection in the currency markets in anticipation of the fine. It was not clear how much protection RBS had bought but some analysts have said this penalty could reach up to \u00a38bn. Brexit worries hits the Asian stock markets overnight. Japan\u2019s Nikkei led the selloff, down almost 2%. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets say: The Brexit fall-out continues to weigh on global markets. Most stock markets in Asia were down substantially. What caused the pound to slide below $1.30? Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit blames Aviva, M&amp;G and Standard Life for freezing their property funds. They all blocked redemptions, after a surge of investors tried to pull their money out following the Brexit vote. We\u2019ll be watching to see if other funds follow today.... Britain\u2019s national prestige has taken a knock, thanks to the weakening pound. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Brexit fears continue to rampage through the markets. While most of us were sleeping, the pound slumped to fresh 31-year lows in Asian trading, toppling to just $1.28 against the US dollar. The rout came after another day of drama yesterday, with three UK property funds refusing to allow investors to take their money out. Wall Street bank Goldman added to the pressure by predicting that the pound would keep weakening through the summer: And fears of a Brexit-induced recession have hit the share prices of UK companies hard. CMC Market\u2019s Michael Hewson sums up the mood: The pound has continued to come under pressure in the past couple of days sinking to new 31 year lows around the 1.2800 level against the US dollar and multi-year lows against the yen and the euro as well. The suspension of commercial property fund redemptions by a number of big players has precipitated a broader sell off in the UK property sector including house builders and other asset managers. Combined with a warning that some Brexit effects were already starting to crystallise and this week\u2019s slowdown in recent economic data we\u2019ve seen a bit of a domino effect in locally exposed sterling assets, as well as risky assets generally across the world. While some have speculated that some \u201cLeave\u201d voters may have undergone some form of buyer\u2019s remorse in the wake of the volatility of the UK Brexit vote outcome, it would seem that the same could also be said of the investors who took part in last week\u2019s stock market rebound in the aftermath of the said vote. So it could be another dramatic day. Here\u2019s some things to watch out for: 8:00 BST: ECB president Mario Draghi speaks in Frankfurt (opening a statistics conference) 9.00 BST: Latest UK car sales figures 3pm BST: US service sector PMI report",

                "bodyText":"Time for a recap, after another busy day of financial twists and turns. Britain has been threatened with the spectre of the pound falling towards parity with the US dollar. Mohamed El-Erian of investment giant Allianz warned that sterling could hit record lows, unless politicians get their act together and negotiate a new agreement with the EU. He told Reuters that: The future value of sterling is a function of how and how quickly the structural uncertainty is resolved \u2013 if Plan B is delayed and/or it doesn\u2019t involve much of a free trade setup with the EU, it is not inconceivable for sterling to head to parity with the US dollar. Three investment banks have warned that the pound will fall to $1.20, or lower, this year. Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF, has also weighed in. She fears Britain\u2019s economy will suffer long-term damage if the uncertainty following last month\u2019s EU referendum isn\u2019t resolved soon. Senior bosses at the world\u2019s largest banks have promised to help London retain its place as a global financial hub.... ...But the boss of JP Morgan has reiterated that thousands of London-based jobs will be lost if the City loses its \u2018passport\u2019 into the UK. UK consumers have been warned that the slump in the pound will soon hit their purses and wallets: Cocoa prices are at a 39-year high, when priced in sterling, which could make chocolate more expensive Lenovo, the IT firm, has said it might raise prices There are also several signs that the UK economy is weakening: The NIESR thinktank has reported that the economy contracted in June Barclays has predicted that UK GDP will shrink by 0.4% during 2017 Three commercial property funds, F&amp;C, L&amp;G and CPPA, have cut the value of their assets. Up to \u00a35bn of real estate is now on sale, possibly at bargain prices, as fund managers try to cash in illiquid assets to pay investors It\u2019s been a better day in the market, though. The pound clawed its way above $1.30, although it has now dipped back towards yesterday\u2019s 31-year lows. And Europe\u2019s stock markets have just closed with gains across the board. In London, the FTSE 100 index has jumped by 1.1% to 6533, a gain of 70 points. The smaller FTSE 250 rose by 1.66%. That\u2019s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. Goodnight. GW Worrying signs from Germany: Analysts at Barclays have slashed their growth forecast for next year, predicting that the Brexit vote will cause \u201cprolonged uncertainty and financial stress.\u201d They now expect the UK economy to contact by 0.4% next year, down from growth of 1.8% previously. They also cut their euro area growth forecast to 0.6%, down from 1.7%. Barclays also see several flashpoints in the months ahead which could even put the future of the eurozone in doubt again: For example, the UK-EU exit negotiations could turn rancorous. And market upheaval could be even greater if an EMU country were to actively question EU membership; redenomination risk could return. Hence, investors are likely to pay close attention to the October referendum on constitutional reforms in Italy, as well as the general elections in the Netherlands, France and Germany in 2017. Any outcome that helps anti-EU political parties would likely be poorly received by markets Newsflash: The British economy appears to have contracted last month. New figures from the National Institute Of Economic and Social Research indicate that the economy was weakening, even before Britons headed to the polls. NIESR estimates that the economy grew by 0.6% in the April-June quarter, up from 0.4% in January-March. So far so good.... But before anyone gets the bunting out, NIERS also estimate that strong growth in April fizzled out in May, leading to the economy shrinking in June. Jack Meaning, Research Fellow at NIESR, explains: \u201cAt first glance this represents a robust rate of quarterly growth for the UK economy. However, the quarterly figure masks an important within-quarter pattern. Our monthly estimates suggest that April saw a large expansion in GDP, which then stagnated in May. The estimate for June is one of an intensifying contraction across the board, but this is not enough to offset the very strong April numbers. What it does suggest is that when April drops out of the 3 month calculation we should see a quick deterioration of growth, especially if the estimated contraction in June persists or accelerates into July and beyond.\u201d Fancy buying a supermarket or an office block? It could be your lucky day. Somewhere between \u00a33bn to \u00a35bn of direct real estate is now up for sale, as commercial real estate funds try to generate cash to pay redemptions to investors. And as it is a buyers market, some assets could be sold pretty cheaply. Investment bank Jefferies is scathing about the \u2018open-ended\u2019 funds which have invested in property on the way up. Six funds have now locked the exit doors this week; Standard Life, Aviva, M&amp;S, Columbia, Canada Life and Henderson. Jefferies accuses them of selling \u201csnake oil\u201d to retail investors, by guaranteeing liquidity while investing in a notoriously illiquid asset class. You can\u2019t just sell a tower block in a few days, which is why redemptions are now frozen. Jefferies analysts predict more pain ahead: Now the virtuous cycle is turning into a vicious circle of redemptions, REIT sales, gating, discounted asset sales, lower fund valuations, and Major (Ret\u2019d) &amp; Mrs Smith complaining in the Sunday Times Money Section that they never read the small print and then more redemptions etc. etc. [REIT = real estate investment trusts; companies who generate an income from owning commercial property ] Newsflash: Another investment fund has cut the value of its property funds, following L&amp;G and Foreign &amp; Colonial. This time it\u2019s CCLA, which invests money for a range of charities, religious groups and the public sector. It has lopped 4.5% off the value of its funds, which were worth \u00a31.3bn. In another sign of Brexit tensions, rating agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s has revised down its opinion of several UK banks. It has cut Barclays\u2019 outlook to negative, from stable, and also lowered Royal Bank of Scotland to stable, from positive. It blames \u201cpotential economic deterioration\u201d following the EU vote, and says the UK is \u201centering a correction phase\u201d, in which consumer confidence will suffer. There are fresh rumblings in the UK commercial property market, where the Brexit vote continues to alarm investors. Two more funds have announced that the value of their shopping centres, office blocks and suchlike has fallen sharply in the last two weeks. Legal &amp; General cut the value of its \u00a32.3bn property fund by 10% \u2013 following a 5% cut last week \u2013 while Foreign &amp; Colonial cut the value of its \u00a3290m fund by 5%. L&amp;G also warned that it\u2019s too early to know the full impact of the EU referendum vote. Just in: The latest US employment survey has beaten expectations. Some 172,000 new private sector jobs were created in June, some 13,000 more than expected. We get the main US jobs report tomorrow, the Non-Farm Payroll, and that will show if Brexit worries had any impact on hiring last month. Christine Lagarde also warned that the global economy could suffer if Britain enters a limbo state where it delays the process of leaving the EU. Do we have a forecast and scenario with prolonged uncertainty, total lack of clarity, no triggering of Article 50 [the official notification required to leave the EU], things staying in limbo for a long period of time? No. We don\u2019t have that. We doubt that it would be sustainable politically, geopolitically. More here: Lagarde warns Trump-style protectionism would hit world economy Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, has called on Britain to resolve its relationship with the European Union quickly, to limit the economic damage of Brexit. She\u2019s echoing Mohamed El-Erian\u2019s warning that uncertainty will hurt the UK economy. In an interview with the Financial Times, Lagarde says: \u201cWe want to see clarity sooner rather than later because we think that a lack of clarity feeds uncertainty, which itself undermines investment appetites and decision making. The IMF believes could UK cushion the impact of leaving the EU by agreeing a Norway-style agreement (basically getting access to the single market, but also agreeing to EU laws and freedom of movement). That would only cut 1.5% off GDP growth by 2019 However, if the UK clatters out of the EU without a new trade deal, it will revert to standard WTO tariffs - meaning the economy would be 4.5% smaller than otherwise by the end of the decade. The boss of the WTO has already warned that this would cost consumers \u00a39bn per year. It\u2019s not clear when the UK can deliver the clarity which Lagarde is seeking. This morning, foreign secretary Philip Hammond told MPs that the government simply isn\u2019t in a position to start \u2018substantive negotiations\u2019 with Brussels. The pound has broken back over the $1.30 mark, away from yesterday\u2019s 31-year low of $1.28 (and further away from dollar parity, of course). It appears that some calm has returned to the markets, after some wild days. But analysts are expecting sterling to keep dropping. fastFT have the details: Deutsche Bank believes that sterling is in line to fall as far as $1.15, while HSBC has set $1.20 as its target for the end of the year. Goldman Sachs has a three-month target of $1.20. Five top executives from the biggest international banks based in London have pledged to work together to protect the City following the Brexit vote Bosses from Goldman Sachs, Standard Chartered, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan issued the promise, after a meeting with chancellor George Osborne. They cite Britain\u2019s \u201cbrilliant workforce\u201d and \u201cstable legal systems\u201d as key assets. Here\u2019s the statement: Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU clearly presents economic challenges which we are determined to work together to meet. We will also work together to identify the new opportunities that may now become available so that Britain remains one of the most attractive places in the world to do business. One of Britain\u2019s key economic strengths is that it is a world leading financial centre. It has one of the most stable legal systems in the world, a brilliant workforce and deep, liquid capital markets unmatched anywhere else in Europe, all of which are underpinned by world class regulators. In recent years it has established itself as a global hub for renminbi, rupee, Islamic finance and green finance, as well as leading in new markets such as FinTech. Today we met and agreed that we would work together to build on all this with a common aim to help London retain its position as the leading international financial centre. It\u2019s signed by: Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne Mr Bill Winters, CBE, (Group Chief Executive, Standard Chartered) Mr Michael Sherwood, (Vice Chairman and co-CEO, Goldman Sachs International) Mr Alex Wilmot-Sitwell, (President (Europe and Emerging markets excl. Asia), Bank of America Merrill Lynch) Mr Robert Rooney, (CEO, Morgan Stanley International) Mr Viswas Raghavan, (Deputy CEO and Head of Investment Banking (EMEA), JP Morgan) According to the financial markets, there\u2019s a high chance that the Bank of England will cut interest rates to new record lows next week. Ben Brettell of investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown has drilled down into the interest-rate swaps traded in the City, and reports that they imply: 78% chance of a cut next week [the decision is due on Thursday] 86% chance of a cut by August, with a 27% chance rates will be 0% by then 89% chance of a cut by December, with a 34% chance rates will be 0% and an 8% chance rates will be negative by then He explains: Initially August had looked more likely, but with economic data deteriorating and markets still nervous, it now looks probable the Monetary Policy Committee will adjudge that immediate action is warranted. Mohamed El-Erian\u2019s warning that the pound could fall to parity with the dollar unless UK politicians urgently devise a Brexit plan has sent ripples through the City today. Andrew Edwards, CEO of ETX Capital, report: \u201cThe chatter on forex desks is that the pound could hit parity with the dollar. Although not impossible, this seems a little far-fetched as sterling would have to drop considerably from where it is now. Parity would represent an all-time low for the pound. Deutsche Bank is pessimistic with its forecast of $1.15 for cable \u2013 the consensus is $1.20. It all depends what the Bank of England does next week -- a rate cut (to a new alltime low) could easily send the pound tumbling. But Mark Carney and colleagues could vote to leave borrowing costs unchanged, which Edwards reckons would be \u201cthe sensible move\u201d. Increasing credit supply doesn\u2019t achieve much if there is no demand and it\u2019s the demand side that matters most. A firm vote to hold rates where they are would send a clear signal to investors that the Bank is confident the UK can weather this storm and that it doesn\u2019t want the pound to drop further. Keeping its powder dry would mean it has ammunition for another day, should financial conditions get a lot worse. The boss of investment bank JP Morgan has warned that he may move thousands of jobs out of the City, if Britain loses full access to the single market. Jamie Dimon told Bloomberg that it\u2019s crucial that firms in London retain the ability to \u2018passport\u2019 into other EU countries and sell financial services there. If that passporting rule is broken, then JP Morgan staff will be packing their bags. Dimon explained: \u201cIf we have that passport after Brexit, we likely would not have to make any change at all. \u201cBut I think the European Union will not accept that. It will put more conditions on the U.K. and might force banks to become smaller in London.\u201d Those with memories of the financial crisis might welcome an exodus of bankers. One problem, though, they do provide a lot of tax receipts: The OECD, which urged Britain to stay in the EU ahead of the referendum, has warned that Brexit would \u201crepresents a cloud over the UK\u2019s recent ability to create jobs.\u201d There was a potential impact on wages, too, it said. The UK had suffered from \u201cdisappointing\u201d growth in real wages, partly reflecting weak labour productivity growth of only 2% from 2010 to 2015, the smallest increase in the OECD after Hungary, Italy and Greece. In a briefing on the UK, the OECD says: \u201cAny decline in foreign direct investment in the UK that may result from Brexit could further worsen this poor productivity performance.\u201d The OECD has also warned today that unemployment is still too high in many EU countries: Even in countries where labour market slack has been absorbed, low quality jobs and a high level of labour market inequality are of concern. Many of the workers who lost their jobs during the Great Recession are now back in work, but wage growth remains subdued and job stress is common. More on that later.... The chocolate bar in your pocket may soon cost more, following the sharp falls in the pound. The price of cocoa in sterling terms has hit its highest level since 1977, at \u00a32,487 per tonne. Cocoa\u2019s a key ingredient in chocolate, of course, and the Financial Times reckons we\u2019ll soon see the impact on the shelves. They warn: If the collapse of sterling was not depressing enough, the price of chocolate for UK buyers could get higher as cocoa, the key ingredient hit a 39-year high. Here\u2019s more reaction to Andrea Leadsom\u2019s claims that Britain has a bright economic future after Brexit, and that a weak pound isn\u2019t a problem.... Andrea Leadsom, one of the contenders to be Britain\u2019s next prime minister, has heeded Mohamed El-Erian\u2019s warning that the UK needs to arrange a workable trade deal with Europe. A free trade deal with the EU is vital, Leadsom says, as she outlines her economic platform. She told supporters that \u201cno-one needs to fear\u201d Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union, as the government will move carefully. Trade must be the top priority, she says, adding: Britain must get continued tariff-free trade with the EU and continued free trade with other countries as at present, plus agreements with other fast-growing economies. However, she doesn\u2019t give any details about how she\u2019ll negotiate this happy outcome. Our Politics liveblog has all the details: Leadsom was also remarkably upbeat about the financial consequences of the Brexit vote. She claims that the slump in the pound is partly because the markets called the result wrong \u2013 ignoring the fact that economists - correctly - predicted sterling would tumble to current levels. She also argues that lower sterling is good for exports, makes inward investment more attractive, and means Britons will import less and buy more at home. Yes, but it also means goods are going to cost more.... Leadsom also loses marks for declaring that the FTSE 100 is now higher than two weeks ago, without explaining it\u2019s mainly due to the weak pound. Analysts at Deutsche Bank have predicted that the pound will keep falling, and hit $1.15 by the end of 2016. Or worse.... It feels like ancient history now... but new figures show that British industry was growing at its fastest pace in six-years before the EU referendum. UK industrial output jumped by 1.9% in the three months to May compared with the previous three months, which is the strongest increase since May 2010. Output did drop by 0.5% in May, but that\u2019s less than the 1% economists expected. So, broadly encouraging -- but we don\u2019t know what impact the referendum result, or the weaker pound, has had yet.... Chinese computer maker Lenovo has warned that it will probably hike its prices following the Brexit vote. The recent slump in the pound\u2019s value means that Lenovo\u2019s UK earnings are now worth around 10% less than before the referendum. Chief financial officer Wai Ming Wong told reporters earlier today price increases are one option being considered, saying: \u201cTo the extent that we need to pass things on to the customer, we will\u201d More here. Mohamed El-Erian\u2019s warning about the pound isn\u2019t causing much angst in the City yet. Most shares on the FTSE 100 are up this morning, led by financial stocks and builders such as Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey. Conner Campbell of trading firm SpreadEx says: Strong recoveries from the previously battered banking and property stocks provided the thrust of the early growth, helping cable steady itself around $1.295. Construction firms need some relief; they\u2019ve been badly hit by the fallout from the EU vote, losing around a third of the value due to fears of a UK recession. Brexit uncertainty is also casting shadows over Sports Direct, the retail chain that has faced criticism over its working practices. Sports Direct buys many of its products overseas, so the slump in the pound since the Brexit vote is having an immediate impact on current profitability. It also reported this morning that pre-tax earnings fell by 8.4% in the last financial year; meaning the staff bonus scheme won\u2019t pay out. And CEO Dave Forsey warned that consumer confidence will be hit by the \u201ccurrent political uncertainty\u201d. Shares are up 11% this morning, though, suggesting it has done better than the City expected. Shares in Marks &amp; Spencer have fallen by 1.7% after the high street chain reported its biggest slump in clothing sales in a decade. Clothing sales at M&amp;S slumped by almost 9% in the last quarter, a jaw-dropping decline, Newish CEO Steve Rose isn\u2019t panicking, saying it\u2019s all part of his plan to cut promotions and offer cheaper prices. But he also admitted that consumer confidence did take a hit in the run-up to the EU referendum. Just in: UK house prices rose by 1.3% in June, according to the Halifax building society. That means the prices grew by 8.4%, year-on-year, in the last quarter. That\u2019s a slight slowdown, but higher than the 7.7% which the City expected. It\u2019s probably too early to see the impact of the Brexit vote on the property market, but July\u2019s figures could be interesting.... The pound is actually quite calm this morning. It\u2019s hovering near 31-year lows against the US dollar and three-year lows against the euro. The pound could fall closer to parity with the US dollar if the Bank of England cuts interest rates closer to zero. Banking analyst Sandy Chen of Cenkos Securities believes the BoE should resist slashing borrowing costs from 0.5% to zero. He argues it would send sterling slumping to new 31-year lows. He writes: There is talk of a 50 basis point rate cut next week. Note to Mark Carney: Please don\u2019t. A 50bp cut won\u2019t boost borrowing, but it will almost certainly lead to another drop in cable (the pound/US dollar exchange rate). In our opinion, if rates were kept on hold, then investors (including those overseas UK commercial property investors who are now on the sidelines according the BOE\u2019s own Financial Stability Report) might be tempted to do some bottom-fishing. The London stock market has opened higher this morning, after yesterday\u2019s selloff. The FTSE 100 index, which benefits from a weak pound, has by 80 points or 1.2% to 6543. Commercial property companies are leading the rally, reversing some of their heavy losses this week. The UK-focused FTSE 250 index is also up, gaining 1.1% or 175 points to 15844. Investors are in cheery mood, because Amercia\u2019s central bank released some surprisingly dovish minute last night. That means US interest rates are expected to remain unchanged for many months. George Magnus, senior economic adviser to UBS, also believes that the pound could easily hit parity with the US dollar \u201cif the economy really shudders\u201d He also disputes the idea a weak pound is a great boost for UK exporters In a blog post, Magnus argues that a weak currency is only really useful when there is solid overseas demand for a country\u2019s goods. Today, though, world trade is stagnating and emerging markets growth is slowing.... You should note that the Pound has been falling since it reached $1.71 in July 2014, and yet the UK\u2019s trade and external payments position has gotten steadily worse. In the first quarter of 2016, the UK\u2019s trade deficit was the biggest recorded since 2008. So don\u2019t let anybody tell you that a cheaper currency, plain and simple, is a good thing for the economy. It depends. The British pound could slump to parity with the US dollar unless UK politicians get their act together over the Brexit vote, a top financial figure has warned. Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser to investment giant Allianz, says the UK government urgently needs to start developing a credible \u201cPlan B\u201d to European Union membership, that gives British firms a free trade agreement with the bloc. Speaking to Reuters, El-Erian warned that sterling is very vulnerable, as: \u201cAfter the Brexit referendum, the UK has to urgently get its political act together, including a new Prime Minister who can negotiate effectively with the EU. Plan B depends on the politicians in London and across the Channel, but so far they have not stepped up to their economic governance responsibilities.\u201d UK negotiations with Brussels are effectively in limbo now, while the Conservative Party choose a new leader to replace prime minister David Cameron. Yesterday, the pound hit a 31-year low of $1.2798 against the US dollar. Traders around the globe are watching nervously to see how Britain\u2019s relationship with the EU changes following last month\u2019s referendum. As El-Erian puts it to Reuters\u2019 Guy Faulconbridge: The future value of sterling is a function of how and how quickly the structural uncertainty is resolved \u2013 if Plan B is delayed and/or it doesn\u2019t involve much of a free trade setup with the EU, it is not inconceivable for sterling to head to parity with the US dollar. The pound\u2019s record low was $1.05, in late February 1985. However, if a deal is reached to give access to the EU single market, the pound could rally back to pre-vote levels. Many EU leaders have warned that access to the single market means accepting the four freedoms of movement - for goods, services, capital and people. Some Leave campaigners, though, argue that Britain could get access and also impose some restrictions on migration. More here: Allianz\u2019s El-Erian says UK must urgently get its act together or dollar parity could beckon Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Coming up today... we\u2019ll be looking at the impact that Britain\u2019s Brexit vote is having on the UK\u2019s economy, and beyond. Last night, Aberdeen Fund Managers sent a shiver through the City by cutting the value of a property fund by 17% percent and briefly halting redemptions. That came after six commercial property funds froze trading, to prevent a stampede of nervous investors. Could more funds follow today? Financial jitters have hit Australia too, with Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s lowering the country\u2019s credit rating outlook overnight: There\u2019s a flurry of corporate news this morning, including UK retailer Sports Direct and Marks &amp; Spencer. They may be seeing the impact of the EU referendum on their results.

The Fed was also concerned about the number of part-time workers. \u201cThe share of workers employed part time for economic reasons rose noticeably in May,\u201d according to the notes from June\u2019s meeting. The number of those who wanted full-time jobs but were only able to find part-time jobs was 5.8m in June, down from 6.4m in May, just barely offsetting the increase in involuntary part-time labor the month prior. \u201cAlthough the rate of private-sector job openings remained elevated, the rate of hires declined in both March and April and the rate of quits was unchanged.\u201d A high number of Americans leaving their jobs means that they are confident they can find a new job and are optimistic about the US jobs market: The number of people quitting their jobs was 828,000 in June, slightly up from 796,000 in May. The job growth rebound recorded in June might be enough to assuage the Fed\u2019s fears about the weakening job market, according to Jim O\u2019Sullivan, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics. \u201cToday\u2019s report helps the case for more Fed tightening before too long \u2013 if strength is sustained \u2013 although officials are being ultra cautious amidst turmoil in global markets,\u201d he said on Friday. \u201cThe Fed will almost certainly remain on hold at the 26 to 27 July meeting.\u201d Despite the positive job growth, Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon, advised caution in the coming months. The June report reflected pre-Brexit vote data, he noted. The UK\u2019s decision to leave the European Union \u201cwill hurt manufacturing exporters\u201d, he said, adding that the jobs report had a margin of error of more than 100,000 jobs and \u201ccould be revised down substantially\u201d next month.",

                "bodyText":"Markets are up on both sides of the Atlantic as investors breathed a collective sigh of relief when the better-than-expected US jobs report was published. In Europe, earlier gains have accelerated: FTSE 100: +1% at 6,596 FTSE 250: +1.8% at 16,178 Germany\u2019s DAX: +1.9% at 9,600 France\u2019s CAC: +1.5% at 4,180 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +3.6% at 15,989 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +2% at 8,167 The pound has held fairly steady against the dollar all day, and is now up 0.4% at $1.2953. We have had warnings from the IMF and Moody\u2019s that one of the biggest risks posed by the Brexit risk is political contagion in the rest of the EU. There were underwhelming figures from the UK, where the trade in goods deficit widened. Meanwhile Germany reported a shock fall in exports. And with Brexit jobs all the rage, Goldman Sachs has hired Jose Manuel Barroso, the former head of the European Commission, to advise on the subject. That\u2019s it for today, thank you for joining us. Have a great weekend. AM Wall Street has opened higher after non-farm payrolls jumped by 287,000 in June, the most in eight months. And the Dow Jones has now recovered all of the losses following the Brexit vote: Dow Jones: +0.7% at 18,022 S&amp;P 500: +0.6% at 2,111 Nasdaq: +0.6% at 4,905 Goldman Sachs has drafted in Jose Manuel Barroso, the former head of the European Commission, as an advisor as the impact of the Brexit vote unfolds. Barroso was president of the EC for a decade between 2004 and 2014. In a statement issued by GS, Michael Sherwood and Richard Gnodde, co-CEOs of Goldman Sachs International, commented on the high-profile appointment: Jos\u00e9 Manuel brings immense insights and experience to Goldman Sachs, including a deep understanding of Europe. We look forward to working with him as we continue to help our clients navigate the challenging and uncertain economic and market environment. Barroso also comments on his new role in an FT piece running online. He says he will do what he can to \u201cmitigate the negative effects\u201d of Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU. Of course I know the EU well, I also know relatively well the UK environment. If my advice can be helpful in this circumstance I\u2019m ready to contribute, of course. The Guardian\u2019s Katie Allen reports: The International Monetary Fund has cut its growth outlook for the eurozone on the back of the Brexit vote, warning that a new climate of uncertainty across the single currency bloc will dent confidence, fan financial market volatility and spill over into other economies. The Fund used a regular healthcheck on the eurozone to warn it would suffer an economic slowdown and more political uncertainty as a result of last month\u2019s referendum result. It is the latest body to warn that fresh cracks could emerge in the region as it grapples with the fallout of the UK\u2019s decision to depart the EU. GDP in the eurozone is now expected to grow 1.6% this year and just 1.4% in 2017, a slowdown from a 1.7% expansion last year, \u201cmainly due to the negative impact of the UK referendum\u201d, the IMF said. That compares with IMF forecasts before the June vote of 1.7% growth for the eurozone this year and next. The IMF had repeatedly warned before the referendum of dire economic consequences from Brexit, much to the anger of leave campaigners. The IMF said: \u201cLooking ahead, the risks to the outlook remain firmly on the downside and are mainly political. Uncertainty will persist as long as the UK\u2019s new status vis-\u00e0-vis the EU is not clear. \u201cThe recommendation in the staff report that collective actions should be taken to improve the governance of the economic union and make it more cohesive remains valid, and has now taken on greater urgency.\u201d Full story here: The far stronger-than-expected non-farm payrolls were boosted in particular by job creation in leisure and hospitality, health care and social assistance, as well the financial sector. On the downside, the Labor Department figures showed the unemployment rose to 4.9% in June from 4.7% in May. So the non-farm payrolls were a major surprise on the upside. But as it turns out, last month payrolls were up just 11,000! And everyone thought the original estimate of 38,000 jobs was a shocker. Payrolls summed up nicely: US payrolls were far stronger than expected in June, rising by 287,000. It a huge leap compared with May, when 11,000 jobs were created (revised down from 38,000) and more than the 175,000 forecast by economists. More soon. Five minutes to go until non-farm payrolls. European markets are up ahead of the key US data. The FTSE 100 was down earlier but is now up 0.2% or 16 points at 6,549. Hargreaves Lansdown has commented on property funds, and the move by so many this week to block withdrawals as investors panic about the potential impact of Brexit on the property market. Laith Khalaf at Hargreaves Lansdown suggests the negative view of property in the current climate might be overdone. It\u2019s been a hectic week for property funds, but as yet we don\u2019t know how deep the fault lines run. The mark down in asset prices is really an educated guess, and it may not be borne out by real world transactions, for better or worse, though with such sharp adjustments there appears to be a lot of bad news in the price. Open-ended funds investing in property clearly have limitations, but long term investors in any market should be willing to tolerate periods of weakness. Selling out when prices have fallen sharply is usually a bad idea, particularly if the decision is a knee-jerk reaction. The fundamental trends that led to the popularity of property as an asset class are still in place, with interest rates still low and gilt prices still high. Economic uncertainty casts a shadow over the sector for sure, but as yet we lack real data on what the full impact of Brexit will be. The Greek government is poised to sell \u20ac625m of three-month treasury bills on 3 July to refinance maturing debt, the country\u2019s debt agency PDMA said. The pound is up 0.6% against the dollar at $1.2984. It is also up 0.6% against the euro, at \u20ac1.1732. Barack Obama has written a piece in today\u2019s FT entitled \u201cAmerica\u2019s alliance with Britain and Europe\u201d. The US President uses the piece to say the \u201cspecial relationship between the US and the UK will endure\u201d. As he seeks to provides reassurance, his latest comments on the post-Brexit world are far more upbeat than in the run-up to the referendum, when he said the UK would be at the back of the queue for a trade deal with America. As difficult as it will be, I am confident that the UK and the EU will be able to agree on an orderly transition to a new relationship, as all our countries stay focused on ensuring financial stability and growing the global economy. And, while the relationship between the UK and the EU will change, it is worth remembering what will not change. The special relationship between the US and the UK will endure... Likewise, the US will continue to have an indispensable partner in the EU. The US and the EU have the largest trade and investment relationship in the world and our co-operation will be essential to stimulating global growth and reducing inequality through public investments so that globalisation delivers opportunity for all people, not just those at the top. Europe will remain a cornerstone of America\u2019s engagement with the world. Moreover, while Brexit creates some uncertainty, our shared prosperity will continue to rest on the rock-solid foundation of Nato. Business secretary Sajid Javid is in Mumbai to meet the boss of Tata about the group\u2019s plans for its UK steel business. It is though Tata could announce that it is putting on hold its plans for a sale of the UK business. Tata announced plans to sell its UK steel operation in late March, putting 11,000 jobs at risk, including 4,000 at the strip products business in Port Talbot, south Wales. It blamed cheap Chinese imports, the depressed price of steel and high energy costs for the decision to sell the business it bought in 2007. European markets are looking a little mixed now ahead of those US payroll numbers at 1.30pm (UK time). The FTSE 100 is slightly down, while the FTSE 250 is up 1.2% at 16,092. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets says investors are hanging on to see what the jobs report brings There appears to be little incentive this morning to drive markets strongly one way or the other ahead of this afternoon\u2019s US payrolls report. We do have a slightly firmer tone with the FTSE100 underperforming somewhat due to a weaker oil price, but overall we appear to be in a holding pattern at the end of what has been a fairly turbulent week. More on the the risk of political contagion posed by the Brexit vote. Any signs of political contagion could trigger a \u201cwild\u201d reaction among investors according to NN Investments. There is no guarantee that investors\u2019 emotions will not turn wild again if signs of political contagion from the UK into mainland Europe becomes more visible, or if the needed recapitalisation of the Italian banking system remains unresolved, or if headline-grabbing newsflow of suspensions of real estate funds intensifies.

Some gloomy observations this morning from Moody\u2019s, which is warning that Brexit could topple the whole EU project. The ratings agency says that a weaker UK and EU economy in the wake of the Brexit vote is not the key risk to the global economy. Rather it is political contagion. The downside risks to global growth stem not from the possibility of a recession in the UK, but from the possibility that developments in the UK may give rise to increased political risk elsewhere in the EU. In the long run, the potential strengthening of nationalistic and protectionist movements could have a detrimental effect on the EU, even threatening its existence. The fragmentation of the trade bloc could also encourage protectionist tendencies in other countries, potentially halting the past few decades of increasing globalisation. This in turn would damage the long-term growth prospects of individual economies. The EU economy represents roughly a quarter of global GDP, making it systemically important to the world economy and the US. Therefore, if the negative risks in the EU materialize, it would have a significant consequences for global trade and growth. Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics, is underwhelmed by the UK trade performance, describing it as \u201cdisappointing\u201d. He makes the point that very little progress is being made towards rebalancing the economy - a long-held ambition of George Osborne - away from domestic consumer spending and towards exports. May\u2019s UK trade figures are a further sign of the unbalanced nature of the economic recovery. Looking ahead, the 10% or so fall in trade-weighted sterling since the referendum should help to boost exports in time. Although any improvement is likely to be slow against a background of fairly sluggish global growth and uncertainty about future trade relationships between the UK and other countries. The reason behind the rise in the UK\u2019s goods deficit is that exports fell more sharply than imports in May. Exports fell by \u00a32.1bn to \u00a323.7bn in May, while imports fell by 1.6bn to \u00a333.5bn according to the Over a three-month period however, the trade deficit narrowed by \u00a32.5bn to \u00a38.2bn. Britain\u2019s trade position with the EU improved slightly over the three months, narrowing by \u00a3100m to \u00a322.5bn as exports increased by more than imports. Outside the EU, things also looked better, with a 6.8% increase in exports pushing the deficit down \u00a32.6bn to \u00a38.2bn. The hope is that the weaker pound will drive exports higher because British-made goods will be cheaper abroad. But on the flip side, it makes imports more expensive, which could lead to a rise in prices in UK shops. The UK trade in goods deficit widened slightly in May, to \u00a39.9bn from \u00a39.4bn in April. The figure for April was a downward revision from an earlier estimate of a \u00a310.5bn goods deficit. Connor Campbell, analyst at Spreadex, has a take on the markets this morning: It was a fairly typical start to a non-farm Friday for the European indices, which have little to occupy themselves with until this afternoon\u2019s US data dump. At most rising by 10 points the FTSE continued to hover around the 6550 mark this morning, that level having become the UK index\u2019s safe space for much of the week. The pound was similarly settled (it\u2019s all relative) at the start of Friday, trading just above $1.29 against dollar and \u20ac1.165 against the euro. UK trade data is coming up. The goods deficit with the rest of the world is expected to widen slightly to \u00a310.65bn in May from \u00a310.52bn in April. The figures should be out at 9.30. German exports fell at the sharpest rate in nine months in May. It was an unexpected drop, and a weaker than expected rise in exports was another sign that demand is slowing in Europe\u2019s largest economy. Exports fell by 1.8% over the month, following a 0.1% rise in April. Imports increased by 0.1%, so Germany\u2019s trade balance narrowed to \u20ac22.1bn from \u20ac24.1bn in April. Carsten Brzeski, economist at ING, says it tops off a bad week for Germany, both in economic and footballing terms... Another indicator signalling that Germany\u2019s performance is currently not champion-like. Today\u2019s trade data mark the end of a disappointing week for the German industry. All May data point to a sharp slowdown of the German industry. Probably the entire batch of industrial data will not get the attention it deserves. Germany will be mainly busy digesting and analysing its own exit; the exit from the Euro2016, the European Soccer Championships. However, to offer some solace: if there is any economic impact from soccer, last night\u2019s result was the best possible outcome for the eurozone: stimulus and psychological support for France, while at the same time Germany can still feel superior. Markets are steady this morning, with no big lurches in the pound or equities. But European shares are on track for their worst week in five months. Following a rebound in the week immediately after the Brexit vote, investors appear to have taken a step back this week. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says that some harsh realities have been sinking in: It\u2019s been a strange week for equity markets with heavy falls for European markets reversing a lot of the gains that we saw in the week post Brexit, though US markets and the FTSE100 have stood out as outperforming, and managing to hang on to a good proportion of their gains thus far this week. Having got caught up in the euphoria of the prospect of lower for a lot longer interest rates, investors forgot about the vulnerability of the European banking system and its sclerotic banks and soon saw the error of their ways, smashing the Italian banking sector, as well as Swiss giants UBS and Credit Suisse and German giant Deutsche Bank to new record all-time lows. Markets are not exactly off to a flying start this morning, as investors await the main event of the day from the US at 1.30pm (UK time), when the June payrolls report will be published. The FTSE 100 is up 8 points. FTSE 100: +0.1% at 6,542 FTSE 250: +0.03% at 15,9047 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.1% at 9,409 France\u2019s CAC: -0.1% at 4,112 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: 0.4% at 15,506 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.04% at 8,005 A report published overnight shows consumer sentiment has taken a hammering in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. GfK\u2019s long-running index of consumer confidence dropped eight points to -9 in a special report to measure sentiment after the vote. It was the sharpest drop in 21 years. A breakdown of responses showed that people who voted to remain in the EU were feeling the least confident, at -13, while leavers were less pessimistic at -5. GfK noted a fall across all the survey\u2019s key indicators, including the outlook for household finances and people\u2019s appetite for splashing out on major purchases. Joe Staton, head of market dynamics at GfK: In these extraordinary times this one-off Brexit special gauges the temperature of consumer confidence right now. During this period of uncertainty, we\u2019ve seen a very significant drop in confidence, as is clear from the fact that every one of our key measures has fallen, with the biggest decrease occurring in the outlook for the general economic situation in the next 12 months. Read our full story on the report here: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The main focus of the day is the US payrolls report for June. The report has particular significance this month following an absolute shocker last month, when it emerged the number of jobs added in May was just 38,000. Economists were expecting a 164,000 increase in jobs... It was the weakest growth in jobs since September 2010, and the numbers for March and April were also revised down. Investors will be looking for improvement in today\u2019s numbers, and hoping the sharp slowdown in May was just a blip. Economists polled by Reuters are forecasting a 175,000 increase in payrolls in June. If the number comes in strong, the expectation will be that the Federal Reserve will raise rates sooner rather than later, possibly in September. Another shockingly weak number would raise concerns that a worrying trend is emerging in the US labour market, putting a rate rise off the table for the time being. The Fed is, of course, weighing up other factors, not least what impact Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU will have on the US economy. Meanwhile the pound is settled at the moment, hovering around $1.29 and currently at $1.2934. Also coming up today we have UK trade data for May. Although it covers the period before the referendum on 23 June, it will serve as a timely reminder of Britain\u2019s current trade position with the rest of the world. The IMF will publish its latest take on the eurozone at 2pm UK time. We will bring you all the latest developments as they happen.",

                "bodyText":"Britain\u2019s surprise decision to quit the European Union at the 23 June referendum sent shockwaves across global markets, triggered a political crisis in the UK, and pushed the economy into uncharted waters. Here are six key charts that show the immediate impact of the Brexit vote: 1 The pound has fallen sharply against the dollar As markets woke up on 24 June to news of the British vote to leave the EU, the pound fell to a 31-year low against the dollar. In the following days sterling slipped further against the US currency as fears about Britain\u2019s economic outlook intensified and traders bet on lower UK interest rates. Ending last week at around $1.29, the pound still has some way to go to hit its 1985 low of $1.05. However, some commentators have warned sterling could yet slump to parity with the dollar. Among them, Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser to the investment company Allianz, who said sterling\u2019s fate depended on the British government developing a credible plan B. \u201cThe future value of sterling is a function of how quickly the structural uncertainty is resolved \u2013 if plan B is delayed and/or it doesn\u2019t involve much of a free trade setup with the EU, it is not inconceivable for sterling to head to parity with the US dollar,\u201d he told Reuters. 2 Sterling has also tumbled against the euro It\u2019s bad news for holidaymakers heading to the eurozone this summer, with the pound down more than 10% against the euro since the Brexit vote. On the day of the referendum \u00a31 was worth \u20ac1.30 \u2013 now it is worth \u20ac1.17. It is not just holidaymakers hurt by a weaker pound against the euro. Although it makes UK exporters\u2019 products and services more competitive a weaker pound makes imports from the single currency bloc more expensive and that could stoke UK inflation. 3 The FTSE 100 initially fell but later recovered The FTSE 100 had rallied ahead of the referendum on bets that Britons would vote to remain. When the leave result was confirmed the index initially slumped. Losses were tempered, however, by reassuring words from the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney. His heavy hints that interest rates will be cut helped the index of the biggest London-listed companies recover in days following the vote. The FTSE 100 is now at around 6,556, compared with a close of 6,338.10 on the day of the referendum. The index has also had significant support from shares in those companies that report a large chunk of earnings in dollars. As the pound falls against the dollar their earnings have been flattered. Mining firms too have been bolstered by a rise in the gold price, seen as a safe haven for investors in times of trouble. Other sectors on the index have fared far worse. Shares in housebuilders and most banks \u2013 all seen as particularly vulnerable to a Brexit-related downturn \u2013 are down markedly since the referendum. 4 The FTSE 250 fell and is still below its pre-Brexit vote level The FTSE 250 index of midcap firms is seen as a better reflection of UK prospects. The index, more domestically focused than the FTSE 100, slumped 7% on the day the referendum outcome was confirmed. Unlike the FTSE 100, this index of smaller firms has not recovered all its Brexit-related losses. On Friday it rose to 16,130, still down 7% from 17,334 on the day of the referendum. 5 Gilt yields have dropped to record lows as investors seek safer assets Government bonds in the the UK and elsewhere have been in demand since the referendum as investors ditch assets like shares and seek out safer investments amid worries about the impact of Brexit on an already fragile global economy. As a result, yields \u2013 which move inversely to prices of bonds \u2013 have fallen. The yields on UK government bonds, also known as gilts, have set record lows in the wake of the referendum. The yield on 10-year gilts now stands at 0.778%, having almost halved from 1.376% on 23 June. 6. Banking shares took a hammering on sector health fears Investors have been offloading shares in UK and other European banks on worries about the economic outlook and their likely profitably in uncertain times. The FTSE 350 index of bank shares is down 11% since the referendum. The prospect of official interest rates falling even further from their record lows is bad news for banks. Low interest rates make it harder for banks to make a profit on the difference between the rates that are paid on savings and the rates that can be charged on loans. At the same time, there are concerns banks could come under strain from a rise in bad debts if the housing market slows markedly or unemployment rises, making it difficult for customers to maintain their loan repayments. Banks also face the prospect of losses on their loans to commercial property developers. The sector has come under scrutiny following the Brexit vote on fears commercial property prices could fall. Banks also use commercial property to count towards their capital buffers; at the end of 2015 around 55% of their core capital \u2013 their main safety net in a crisis \u2013 was based on commercial property.",

But, after several years of bumper plane orders, analysts reckon the atmosphere among captains of the aero industry and their sales executives will be relatively muted as worries grow about the state of the global economy in the wake of the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU.</p> <p>One analyst said: \u201cA sudden ripple has gone through the market after Brexit. We\u2019ve got no idea about the impact of Brexit at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>Industry sources expect Branson to attend this week\u2019s show to sign the Airbus deal. It is thought Virgin wants to buy eight A350-1000 jetliners and take purchase options on a further four to replace its remaining Boeing 747s. Craig Kreeger, chief executive of Virgin Atlantic, last month said that a decision on the new jets was \u201cimminent\u201d. The deal might enable Virgin to cancel its now-unwanted order for Airbus\u2019s A380 superjumbo.</p> <p>Several other airlines are in the final stages of choosing between the A350 and its rival, Boeing\u2019s 787 Dreamliner, including Emirates and Oman Air.</p> <p>European airlines are expected to have a quiet show. The uncertainty that has enveloped the EU since Britain voted to leave has already sparked profit warnings from British carriers such as easyJet and International Airlines Group, owner of British Airways. In addition, a low oil price has not only eased the financial burden on carriers, but has also curbed their need to buy new fuel-efficient planes to replace ageing fleets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b088565b6bddec6a2fcc7008e5fe6434d89ba1ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b088565b6bddec6a2fcc7008e5fe6434d89ba1ac/152_5_3933_2361/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Boeing 787 Dreamliner belonging to the Polish airline LOT.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Boeing 787 Dreamliner belonging to the Polish airline LOT.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: East News/REX Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tom Enders, chief executive of Airbus, has warned the EU vote was \u201ca lose-lose result\u201d for Britain and Europe. His view matters because Airbus makes all of its wings at Broughton in north Wales.</p> <p>\u201cBritain will suffer, but I\u2019m sure it will focus even more now on the competitiveness of its economy vis-a-vis the EU and the world at large,\u201d Enders said, warning: \u201cBut of course we will review our UK investment strategy, like everybody else will.\u201d</p> <p>Airbus goes into this week\u2019s show lagging behind its arch-rival, after ending the first half of the year with 227 aircraft orders, or 183 after deducting cancellations. Boeing sold 309 aircraft, or 276 after cancellations.</p> <p>The figures clearly show demand for aircraft falling compared with the first half of last year, which included the Paris air show, held every other year in June. In 2015, Airbus booked 1,036 net commercial plane orders, down from 1,456 a year earlier, but it outsold Boeing, which booked 768 net orders last year.</p> <p>Boeing has lost ground to its European rival in the giant market for short-haul planes. There is talk that the US company is honing designs for a mid-range plane seating between 200 and 270 people to whisk passengers from London to New York, Sydney to Shanghai or Dubai to Oslo. The mid-market jetliner would fill the gap between Boeing\u2019s largest single-aisle model, the 737, and its smallest wide-body, the 787. It is a relatively untapped market but one where Airbus is starting to extend its reach.</p> <p>Mike Delaney, general manager of aircraft development at Boeing, recently said it was a case of \u201cwhen\u201d, not \u201cif\u201d, regarding the prospects for a new plane. He is confident Boeing is on the verge of a breakthrough, following discussions with 36 carriers about a replacement for the out-of-production 757.</p> <p>The aircraft would cost at least $10bn to produce and Boeing\u2019s top brass want to ensure the economics stack up before giving it the green light. They are keen to avoid a repeat of the mistakes made with the Dreamliner, its last major new design. Boeing racked up nearly $30bn in deferred costs on the 787, which was plagued with production problems.</p>",

But, after several years of bumper plane orders, analysts reckon the atmosphere among captains of the aero industry and their sales executives will be relatively muted as worries grow about the state of the global economy in the wake of the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU. One analyst said: \u201cA sudden ripple has gone through the market after Brexit. We\u2019ve got no idea about the impact of Brexit at the moment.\u201d Industry sources expect Branson to attend this week\u2019s show to sign the Airbus deal. It is thought Virgin wants to buy eight A350-1000 jetliners and take purchase options on a further four to replace its remaining Boeing 747s. Craig Kreeger, chief executive of Virgin Atlantic, last month said that a decision on the new jets was \u201cimminent\u201d. The deal might enable Virgin to cancel its now-unwanted order for Airbus\u2019s A380 superjumbo. Several other airlines are in the final stages of choosing between the A350 and its rival, Boeing\u2019s 787 Dreamliner, including Emirates and Oman Air. European airlines are expected to have a quiet show. The uncertainty that has enveloped the EU since Britain voted to leave has already sparked profit warnings from British carriers such as easyJet and International Airlines Group, owner of British Airways. In addition, a low oil price has not only eased the financial burden on carriers, but has also curbed their need to buy new fuel-efficient planes to replace ageing fleets. Tom Enders, chief executive of Airbus, has warned the EU vote was \u201ca lose-lose result\u201d for Britain and Europe. His view matters because Airbus makes all of its wings at Broughton in north Wales. \u201cBritain will suffer, but I\u2019m sure it will focus even more now on the competitiveness of its economy vis-a-vis the EU and the world at large,\u201d Enders said, warning: \u201cBut of course we will review our UK investment strategy, like everybody else will.\u201d Airbus goes into this week\u2019s show lagging behind its arch-rival, after ending the first half of the year with 227 aircraft orders, or 183 after deducting cancellations. Boeing sold 309 aircraft, or 276 after cancellations. The figures clearly show demand for aircraft falling compared with the first half of last year, which included the Paris air show, held every other year in June. In 2015, Airbus booked 1,036 net commercial plane orders, down from 1,456 a year earlier, but it outsold Boeing, which booked 768 net orders last year. Boeing has lost ground to its European rival in the giant market for short-haul planes. There is talk that the US company is honing designs for a mid-range plane seating between 200 and 270 people to whisk passengers from London to New York, Sydney to Shanghai or Dubai to Oslo. The mid-market jetliner would fill the gap between Boeing\u2019s largest single-aisle model, the 737, and its smallest wide-body, the 787. It is a relatively untapped market but one where Airbus is starting to extend its reach. Mike Delaney, general manager of aircraft development at Boeing, recently said it was a case of \u201cwhen\u201d, not \u201cif\u201d, regarding the prospects for a new plane. He is confident Boeing is on the verge of a breakthrough, following discussions with 36 carriers about a replacement for the out-of-production 757. The aircraft would cost at least $10bn to produce and Boeing\u2019s top brass want to ensure the economics stack up before giving it the green light. They are keen to avoid a repeat of the mistakes made with the Dreamliner, its last major new design. Boeing racked up nearly $30bn in deferred costs on the 787, which was plagued with production problems.",

There are those who want our exit from the EU to signal that we should now turn our back on the world, resist the free-market forces of globalization and become a more insular, less tolerant place.

We are each other\u2019s largest investors, with almost $1 trillion invested in each other\u2019s economies.

                "bodyText":"That\u2019s all for tonight (although I might pop back and add some front pages later). Here\u2019s our latest news story about the markets: Goodnight and thanks for reading and commenting! GW And finally tonight.... America\u2019s stock market has hit a new alltime high, as global markets continue their relief rally. The S&amp;P 500 index closed 7 points higher, or 0.33%, at 2,136.95 points. That narrowly breaches the previous high set in May 2015. Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, reckons that traders are feeling more optimistic about the global economy (after last Friday\u2019s decent US employment report). Paulsen says: \u201cYou have Brexit and global stagnation, but underneath that we keep getting really good economic numbers and that is forcing the (stock) market to new highs.\u201d The tantalising scent of fresh stimulus packages in Britain and Japan soon also worked its usual magic, of course. So, record highs on Wall Street. The London stock market back in bull market territory (thanks to the weak pound) and even Europe shaking off its Brexit fears. Not a bad day, but also not a reason to think the Brexit crisis is over. This chart of the FTSE 250 index of smaller UK companies this year shows how it has scrambled back from the Brexit shock last month (red for down, green for up): Ken Odeluga, market analyst at trading firm City Index, says companies most focused on the UK got the biggest boost today from Theresa May\u2019s rise to the top. We believe \u2018pure-play\u2019 UK equities have rallied on relief that the more pragmatic, less conspicuously ideological and more experienced candidate has emerged as Britain\u2019s next Prime Minster, ahead of difficult and multi-faceted discussions with a wounded and potentially vengeful EU. Investors were pleased to focus on political developments, rather than the Bank of England\u2019s promises to cushion the impact of Brexit. As Odeluga puts it: We note markets shrugged off revolving doors in the Conservative leadership contest and Labour\u2019s failure to open a trapdoor under its own chief. It has taken the withdrawal of the last right-leaning Eurosceptic standing, Andrea Leadsom, to raise an unmistakably positive reaction in the City. There\u2019s real anticipation in the City tonight about whether the Bank of England will cut interest rates to fresh record lows on Thursday. The BoE has already hinted that more stimulus will be needed this summer to help the economy. But given the inflationary impact of a weak pound, it may be reluctant to lower borrowing costs (and weaken sterling further). Kallum Pickering says the Bank could decide to leave its powder dry until August, when governor Mark Carney will present the new quarterly inflation report. He writes: We see a 60% chance that the nine member MPC votes to cut the bank rate, if so, probably by 25 basis points. However, there is a chance that the MPC holds for now, and instead opts to send a dovish signal that the bank will ease monetary policy three weeks later at the August Inflation Report when it is due to publish its revised economic forecasts. The pound is getting a late lift tonight, as Theresa May prepares to become Britain\u2019s next prime minister, on Wednesday afternoon. Sterling is hovering just below $1.30, up half a cent today. Chris Saint, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Currency Service, says: Markets will be hopeful that the prospect of Theresa May becoming Prime Minister will soon bring some clarity to the UK political landscape as well as a more conciliatory approach towards Europe. May has already insisted, though, that \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d, so she\u2019s not hinting at a referendum u-turn... European stock markets have also enjoyed a May-bounce. The STOXX Europe 600 .STOXX closed up 1.6% at 332.72, its highest close since June 23. However it is still 4% below its pre-referendum levels, due to concerns that Brexit will hurt the European economy. The news that Theresa May would replace David Cameron on Wednesday seemed to bring relief to European trading floors. Ankit Gheedia, equity and derivative strategist at BNP Paribas, reckoned that May was a safer pair of hands than Andrea Leadsom (who stepped down from the leadership race today) \u201cThe difference between Theresa May and her counterpart was that she has a disciplined approach and a proper strategy for Brexit. The alternative was uncertain. \u201cWe know she has experience, and is a bit more strategic, so the market is relieved on the back of that.\u201d (Thanks to Reuters for the quotes) Some late newsflashes from Brussels, where eurozone finance ministers have been meeting. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, head of the Eurogroup, says the Brexit vote is hurting eurozone confidence: And European commissioner Pierre Moscovici has revealed that the EC is dialling down its growth forecasts for the UK and the eurozone next year: The global rally in shares today has sent America\u2019s S&amp;P 500 index to a record high today: Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, believes the S&amp;P 500 will keep climbing: So, the S&amp;P 500 is rallying to fresh unchartered territories today. Where do we go from here? Well, the monthly chart suggests onwards and upwards. America\u2019s tech index has hit its highest level of the year: The FTSE 100 burst into Bull Market territory moments before Theresa May was crowned as the new leader of the Conservative Party. May will become prime minister on Wednesday, and investors have welcomed this sudden outbreak of certainty in UK politics. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says shares are also benefiting from expectations of an interest rate cut on Thursday. Here\u2019s his take: \u2018The Footsie has been tipped into a bull market by the emergence of Theresa May as Prime Minister, though the whiff of some loose monetary policy coming from the Bank of England this Thursday probably helped the index over the line too. The role played by the commodity behemoths should not be under-estimated either, these stocks are now trading at much higher prices than in the depths of the market in February. The Tories may be starting to get their house in order, but the stock market has hardly followed in the mould of the one-nation conservatism espoused by the party. There have been very divergent fortunes amongst the big blue chips, with some airlines, house builders and banks being left behind by the rest of the market. Here\u2019s the top risers and fallers on the FTSE 100 tonight: The FTSE 250 used to be the ugly duckling of the City, full of companies not big enough to make the Footsie 100. Now, though, it\u2019s blossomed into everyone\u2019s favourite stock market index (or so it feels, anyway). It\u2019s official! Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index is back in bull market territory. The blue-chip index of the largest firms listed on the London stock market has just closed 92 points higher tonight, at 6682, a gain of 1.4% today. That means the Footsie has risen by over 20% since 11 February, when global investors were fretting about China\u2019s slowing economy tipping the world into recession. That was a simpler time, before Brexit became the word on everyone\u2019s lips and British politics entered a period of remarkable upheaval (which ain\u2019t over yet, judging by events in the Labour party today). Mining firm Anglo American is the biggest gainer, closing 8.5% higher, followed by building supply firm Travis Perkins (up 7.8%). However, this does not mean that Britain\u2019s economy is suddenly rosy. Remember... Most of the FTSE 100 constituents are international companies, so they\u2019re not a good gauge of the UK economy The weak pound drives up their earnings (as the dollars, yen and euros they collect as profits are worth more in sterling terms). The value of these firms has been hit hard by the 10% slump in the value of the pound. The smaller FTSE 250 is still below its pre-referendum levels (despite jumping by over 2% today). Two surveys today have shown that investor confidence has been hit very hard by the Brexit vote (see Moody\u2019s warning here....and also Hargreaves Lansdown\u2019s alarming survey here..). But still, investors will be relieved to see the index up, not down. Chris Beauchamp of IG explains that events in Westminster have boosted confidence in the City. UK politics continues to provide the most compelling TV viewing of the year so far, as Teresa May\u2019s last opponent abandons the field. The bounce in UK mid-caps is more than partly due to hopes that, with Remainer May as PM, talks with Europe may be smoother, while the disappearance of a summer leadership contest has helped clear road ahead for UK equities. Shares in many smaller UK companies are also strongly higher today. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains why: The FTSE250 has also enjoyed a decent bounce, up nearly 3% hitting its highest levels since its plunge from its 23rd June peaks. This removal of one element from the mix of political uncertainty is likely to bring into sharp relief the next stage of the \u201cBrexit\u201d process and in particular the timings of when Article 50 is likely to get triggered. However, the FTSE 250 index is still below its pre-referendum levels, unlike the FTSE 100 (which gets that weak pound boost) Here\u2019s another sign that the Brexit vote has hurt the European economy. A new survey by Moody\u2019s Analytics reports that: Global business confidence has slumped in the wake of the Brexit vote in late June. European sentiment continues to sink and is now consistent with an economy that is on the verge of stalling out. More than one-fourth of the survey responses by European businesses are negative, the highest that has been on a consistent basis since the European debt crisis. Encouragingly, sentiment in the United States and Pacific Rim haven\u2019t been materially impacted by British exit vote. Weak business confidence often leads to lower investment, and less new hiring, so it could be quite damaging.... City traders are pleased that at least some of the political uncertainty sitting over Britain like a heavy fog is lifting. Connor Campbell of Spreadex explains: Theresa May is clearly the market\u2019s preferred choice for Britain\u2019s top job, as evidenced by the reaction that greeted Leadsom\u2019s stand-down statement. May\u2019s lack of interest in rushing to activate Article 50 and her relatively less contentious relationship with the EU when compared to her (now long gone) rivals, as well as the general cheer at the mere fact of the UK once again having a PM, is arguably responsible for the rise from the FTSE and pound, both of which improved on their morning performances. The former jumped by nearly 1%, sitting firmly at 2016 (and indeed 11 month) highs; the latter, meanwhile, managed to climb away from its earlier lows, even if the currency remains haunted by the spectre of a Bank of England rate cut on Thursday. The chancellor is watching events unfold from across the Atlantic, and tweets: The FT reckons that foreign secretary Phillip Hammond could become finance minister in Theresa May\u2019s government.... London shares have extended their gains this afternoon, as Wall Street opened strongly on the back of Friday\u2019s forecast-busting non-farm payrolls. The S&amp;P 500 set a record high, while the Dow was up 92 points, or 0.5 percent, to 18,240 within the first half hour of trading, with banks leading the charge. \u201cReaching a new high may see money moving from the sidelines of safety trades, like Treasury bonds and gold, back into the equity markets,\u201d Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth, told Reuters. \u201cThe emphasis of the markets will be how fast and how long the S&amp;P remains above the record today.\u201d By 3pm, the FTSE 100 had extended its gains to just over 70 points, or 1.1%, at 6664 points. A quick recap: Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index is poised to smash into bull market territory, after being boosted by the weakness of the pound since the Brexit referendum. It has jumped 1% today, meaning it is 20% higher than in February. The smaller FTSE 250 index is also romping higher, on expectations that UK interest rates will be cut to fresh record lows on Thursday. But the pound has been volatile today, as Theresa May moved to the brink of becoming UK prime minister. May has called for a new clampdown on executive pay and predatory capitalism, getting a \u2018better late than never\u2019 welcome from the unions. Film studio Pinewood has declared that it should benefit from the weak pound, as Britain will become a more attractive place to make films. Chancellor George Osborne has landed in America, in an attempt to reassure US investors that they should still invest in Britain. In non-Brexit news: Shares in Nintendo have surged, on the back of the Pokemon Go craze Burberry has ended Chris Bailey\u2019s tenure as CEO, and hired a senior fashion chief Some non-Brexit news.... Fashion chain Burberry have just announced a new chief executive. It\u2019s Marco Gobbetti, currently CEO of fashion chain C\u00e9line. This means that Christopher Bailey, Burberry\u2019s creative mastermind, is moving to become president, after two years as CEO. He\u2019ll be chief creative officer too - but effectively he\u2019s losing day-to-day control of the company It\u2019s not a great surprise; City investors were concerned that Bailey couldn\u2019t do both jobs, especially as trading has deteriorated in recent months. Burberry shares have jumped 6%... Chancellor George Osborne has now landed New York, for his mission to reassure America that Britain is still open for business despite the Brexit vote (as we covered earlier). He\u2019ll be on US TV shortly, in an early-morning treat for America..... Enjoy the pound\u2019s rally while it lasts, says Jake Trask, currency analyst at UKForex. He predicts that sterling will soon weaken again, possibly later this week when the Bank of England announces its interest rate decision \u201cSterling pushed higher today as pro-Brexit candidate Angela Leadsom pulled out of the contest to be the next prime minister. The pound pushed up through $1.30 against the US dollar on the news, but the rally is likely to be short-lived, as Mark Carney is expected to cut interest rates to a record low of 0.25% this Thursday. \u201cShould he decide to cut rates to zero, we will likely see another multi-year low for sterling as we head towards a probable recession in the second half of the year.\u201d Almost every company on the FTSE 250 index of medium-sized UK companies has risen today. Property companies are leading the rally, driving the FTSE 250 up by 2.7% right now. Investment group St. Modwen Properties has jumped 9%, and British housebuilding company Crest Nicholson are up 7.6%. Earlier today, Theresa May identified housebuilding as a key priority if she became prime minister (which now seems an imminent prospect). This graph shows how shares in big companies on the FTSE 100 (red line) have roared back since the referendum, thanks to the slump in the pound. Smaller UK companies are shown on the blue line (the FTSE 250), and Germany\u2019s DAX is the pink line. In exquisite timing, confidence among small investors has hit its lowest level since the heights of the eurozone crisis in 2012 - just as shares keep rallying. Hargreaves Lansdown, the financial services firms, reports that its Investor Confidence Index has suffered its sharpest monthly fall in 5 years. The survey of retail investors took place on 30 June, a week after the EU referendum result, and asked them to give their view of the UK stock market over the next three years. The index fell from 92 points in May to 67 in June; the biggest one month percentage fall since June 2011. The index now stands at a four year low - in May 2012 it stood at a level of 61, as Greece looked like it might be on the brink of leaving the eurozone. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says confidence appears to have \u201ccollapsed\u201d after the Brexit vote, among investors, consumers and businesses. The dwindling faith in the UK\u2019s future financial prospects has the potential to become a self-fulfilling prophecy, if companies and individuals start to assume a bunker mentality, and delay or cancel spending and investment. Investors are naturally twitchy about what Brexit means for the future of the stock market in the coming months and years. However continued low interest rates will remain supportive of shares, not least because there is really nowhere else for investors to go for income. Commercial property is one other option, though we have seen problems that can arise for investors in that market over the last week or so. The pound just put its nose back over the $1.30 mark, on the prospect of Theresa May becoming Britain\u2019s next PM sooner than expected. Britain\u2019s blue-chip FTSE 100 index is smashing into Bull Market territory. The Footsie has jumped by 60 points to 6650, a new 11-month high, as Andrea Leadsom confirms that she is withdrawing from the Tory party leadership battle. Crucially, more than 20% above the 5,537 level hit in mid-February, when markets had been driven down by fears over the global economy. So if it closes there tonight, the Footsie will be in bull market territory. Mining stocks are leading today\u2019s rally, with Anglo American up 5%. UK building companies are also sharply higher; Taylor Wimpey and Persimmon have both gained 6%. The usual provisos apply; the FTSE 100 is priced in sterling (which is worth 10% less than last month). And it is dominated by international firms, not UK ones. The smaller FTSE 250 is still 5% below its pre-referendum levels, following a 2% jump this morning. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says investors are expecting the Bank of England to ease monetary policy on Thursday. Last Friday\u2019s upbeat US employment report is also cheering the City. Mahony adds: Amid a sea of green in the FTSE, it is interesting to see the housebuilders and banks gaining heavily, in what has become a proxy for risk appetite across financial markets. There is no doubt that the housebuilders and banks are currently a risky play, given the severity of their recent devaluation. However, in days when the market is in the green, the performance of these sectors will reflect how far reaching that optimism really is. The pound is suddenly jumping, clawing back most of today\u2019s losses, as rumours sweep Westminster that Andrea Leadsom is about to quit the Tory leadership race. Caution is needed, as it\u2019s only at a three-hour high.... Maybe traders aren\u2019t sure what happens next. And they\u2019re not alone... Our politics liveblog have full coverage of Theresa May\u2019s speech: Theresa May, one of the two candidates to replace Cameron, is preaching a progressive message this morning. May is arguing that ordinary families need more help. Wages have only grown slowly, energy bills have rocketed, and monetary stimulus measures have helped those on the property ladder - but not those who can\u2019t [who wrote this speech, Ed Miliband?]. May is also promising a crackdown on executive pay, giving workers more power, and improving UK productivity. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says it\u2019s better late than never.... \u201cThe TUC has long argued for workers to be given seats on company boards and remuneration committees. Workers have a clear interest in the long-term success of their companies and deserve a bigger say. \u201cThis move would inject a much-needed dose of reality into boardrooms, as well as putting the brakes on the multi-million pay and bonus packages which have done so much to damage the reputation of corporate Britain. \u201cIf politicians are serious about making chief executives more accountable this is a common sense approach. I stand ready to meet Theresa May to discuss these proposals.\u201d David Cameron also told the Farnborough Airshow that it is in Britain\u2019s \u201cfundamental interest\u201d to remain very close to the EU. Prime minister David Cameron is urging Britain to use the Brexit vote to tackle the country\u2019s productivity problems. Speaking at the Farnborough Air Show, Cameron calls for a \u201cmassive national effort\u201d to build a strong dynamic economy.. He points out that output per hour in the UK is lower than US, Germany or France, and cites high speed rail, superfast broadband and housebuilding as key infrastructure areas to work on. Now we are leaving the EU, Britain must rapidly explore all possible supply-side reforms, such as tax reforms, Cameron continues. And he\u2019s singling out pharmaceuticals, life sciences, technology, and fintech as important areas where Britain can lead the world. One problem, of course... Cameron won\u2019t be in power in two month\u2019s time. So for all his talk about the \u201cground work\u201d being underway, his successor must actually do the heavy lifting.... The AFP newswire have a good take on George Osborne\u2019s trip to America: British finance minister George Osborne was Monday holding talks with Wall Street investors, kicking-off a series of visits to leading international financial centres to build post-Brexit economic ties. \u201cVital work will begin today on building stronger economic and trade relationships with the UK\u2019s closest trading partners,\u201d the Treasury said in a statement as Chancellor of the Exchequer Osborne headed to New York to meet investors on Wall Street. And Osborne will next week lead a trade mission to Singapore and China after Britain last month voted in a referendum to exit the European Union, the Treasury added. \u201cWhile Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU clearly presents economic challenges, we now have to do everything we can to make the UK the most attractive place in the world to do business,\u201d Osborne, who voted for Britain to remain in the EU, said in the statement. \u201cWe will continue to be a beacon for free trade, democracy and security, more open to that world than ever.\u201d They also point out that the UK is considering easing the tax bill on companies: Following the Brexit vote, Osborne is planning to slash corporation tax over fears of an exodus by big business. According to the Treasury, he could extend planned cuts to Britain\u2019s levy on company profits to under 15 percent. Prior to the vote, the tax rate on corporate profits was already set to be cut from 20 percent to 19 next year and to 17 percent in 2020. Britain\u2019s business minister Sajid Javid on Friday held post-Brexit talks on the country\u2019s future trade relationship with India, the first of many such discussions he plans with world powers. Britain is left with the huge task of forging fresh trade agreements with individual countries as a non-bloc member. Javid has said that the British government, which will soon be led by a new prime minister after the post-Brexit vote resignation of David Cameron, plans to have up to 300 specialist staff by the end of the year to aid in the new trade negotiations. The jump in the FTSE 100 doesn\u2019t tell us much about the UK economy, except that it may trigger bonus payments to chief executives.... Japanese bank Nomura are predicting that sterling could hit a new 31-year low by Friday: The pound may be losing its shock value... Neil Wilson, markets analyst at ETX Capital, confirms that the prospect of fresh stimulus from the Bank of England is driving shares up (and the pound down) The prospect of looser monetary will help equities but it\u2019s another nail in sterling\u2019s coffin. Homebuilders, which rallied on Friday after a turbulent week, are on the up again today. Miners are also rising again as investors price in an interest rate cut. Encouragingly for UK firms, the FTSE 250 is trading up 1%, beating the FTSE 100\u2019s 0.5% rise. European markets are up across the board as they react to Friday\u2019s upbeat jobs report from the US, which spurred the Dow to a 1% gain and saw the S&amp;P 500 close within one point of its record high. Asian stock markets have now closed at one-month highs. Traders are betting that Japanese PM Shinzo Abe can now implement new structural reforms to make the economy more productive, having won a key election victory over the weekend. British film studio Pinewood has emerged as one of the winners from the Brexit vote. The company told shareholders this morning that the 10% tumble in the pound since the referendum was good for business. It said: The result of the UK\u2019s referendum on membership of the EU is now known. In the context of our business, the decline in the \u00a3sterling exchange rate is undoubtedly positive for our international customers. We will continue to monitor sentiment around the issue going forward. Pinewood has played a vital role in the UK film industry for decades. Everything from the Carry On and Pink Panther series to James Bond and the later Harry Potter films were produced at its sites. Maybe they\u2019ll make Brexit, The Movie one day too (rating PG). There were astonishing scenes on the Tokyo stock market today, as shares in console maker Nintendo surged by 25% following the runaway success of the new Pok\u00e9mon Go game. It\u2019s particularly notable, as Nintento is only indirectly linked to the game (which has sent users racing around, squinting into their phones, looking for the monsters) Sterling is weakening this morning, down over half a percent against the US dollar at $1.288. That underlines how the City expect a UK interest rate cut this week. Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit is confident that the Bank of England will do something this week: City investors are expecting the Bank of England to cut interest rates to fresh record lows on Thursday, to fight the dangers of recession following the Brexit vote. Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct says this is helping to drive shares up in London today: London\u2019s FTSE-100 is starting the week with some solid gains as Friday\u2019s upbeat unemployment data from the US and hopes of further stimulus measures out of Japan continue to buoy sentiment. There\u2019s also the spectre of a rate cut and further QE being unveiled at the Bank of England later in the week which is again delivering some cause for cheer and gains are eye-catchingly broad-based as a result. European stock markets have jumped in early trading, as last Friday\u2019s knockout US jobs report continues to cheer the City. In London, the FTSE 100 has risen by 45 points, or +0.7%, at 6636. That\u2019s the highest level since mid-August. Mining companies, banks, and UK housebuilders are the top risers, suggesting trader are less worried about the global economy and a UK recession. The FTSE 100 isn\u2019t the best gauge of the UK economy, as it is full of international companies whose overseas earnings are boosted by the weak pound. And also... the index is valued in sterling (so it\u2019s not at an 11-month high in US dollar terms). Encouragingly, the FTSE 250 index is up 0.7% this morning too. It contains more UK companies than the blue-chip FTSE 100. Top risers include retail chain Sports Direct and bank Virgin Money. Other European markets are also in the green: George Osborne may get a rough ride as he tries to woo America\u2019s top politicians and financiers this week: Bloomberg\u2019s reckons he faces a \u2018tall order\u2019 to persuade the US that all is well in the UK: He\u2019ll be mounting a public relations exercise at a time when the pound has slumped to a 31-year low against the U.S. dollar and real-estate funds are beingfrozen to avoid fire sales. Further undermining sentiment in the country is the two-month wait to discover the identity of the next prime minister, and discord gripping the opposition Labour Party. There\u2019s also no guarantee that Osborne will have high office once his close ally, David Cameron, has been replaced by either Theresa May or Andrea Leadsom. UK chancellor George Osborne is urging international investors not to give up on Britain, as the fallout from the EU referendum continues to hit the global economy. Osborne is flying to New York today, to meet with top Wall Street bankers. And his message is that Britain is not \u201cquitting the world\u201d, even though it has voted to leave the European Union. He has set the scene with an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal this morning, arguing that Britain will still play a key role on the world stage. Quitting the EU (something Osborne campaigned in vain against) must mean closer links with the rest of the world, starting with America. He writes: \u200eThe question now is not what Britain is leaving; it is what Britain will become. There are those who want our exit from the EU to signal that we should now turn our back on the world, resist the free-market forces of globalization and become a more insular, less tolerant place. Similar forces are at work in other Western nations. We must not be afraid to confront them head-on. I am determined that \u2014 on the contrary \u2014 we now set out to build a more outward-looking, global-facing Britain, with stronger links with its friends and allies around the world. That must start with a closer economic relationship with North America. President Obama had warned that Britain would be at the \u2018back of the queue\u2019 for a trade deal. Osborne, though, hopes we can squeeze our way to the front. For first time in 40 years, the U.K. will be setting its own trade terms. So we should begin the conversation now with the U.S., and with the members of the North American Free Trade Agreement, about how we can deliver even closer economic ties. I have spoken to House Speaker Paul Ryan several times in the past two weeks about a stronger trading relationship\u2014and this week I will welcome Treasury Secretary Jack Lew to London to see what more we can do together. It is now in the overwhelming interest of both countries to do so. We are each other\u2019s largest investors, with almost $1 trillion invested in each other\u2019s economies. U.S. investment in the U.K. is around 10 times U.S. investment in China; British investment in the U.S. is around 50 times Chinese investment in the U.S. And that \u2018special relationship\u2019 with the US needs strengthening: Our economic trade ties with North America must now become stronger. My message is simple: Britain may be leaving the EU, but we are not withdrawing from the world. Britain will be a beacon for free trade, democracy and security, more open to that world than ever. Here\u2019s the full piece: WSJ: Britain Is Open for Business Osborne\u2019s mission makes sense; this would be an awful time for US companies to pull investment out of the UK. But he\u2019d better expect some tough questions about Britain\u2019s plans for Brexit, the Tory leadership battle, and the prospects for the pound.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. At first glance, all looks calm this morning. Asia\u2019s stock markets have hit a one-month high overnight after Japan\u2019s prime minister romped to election victory, potentially paving the way for constitutional changes and perhaps more stimulus measures. Investors are still feeling a warm glow after last Friday\u2019s US employment report, which showed many more jobs were created last month than expected. But beneath the surface, nasty things are lurking. The Brexit vote continues to dominate the UK, although we could be in limbo until Conservative Party members have appointed our next prime minister. And worries are mounting about Italy\u2019s banks, after Deutsche Bank AG\u2019s chief economist predicted that the sector may need a \u20ac150bn bailout. David Folkerts-Landau told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper that: \u201cEurope is extremely sick and must start dealing with its problems extremely quickly, or else there may be an accident. I\u2019m no doomsday prophet, I am a realist.\u201d Also coming up today.... UK chancellor George Osborne is meeting with US financial chiefs on Wall Street Eurozone finance ministers will hold a eurogroup meeting in Brussels this afternoon It\u2019s the Farnborough Airshow We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

Michael Connolly, a senior statistician at the Central Statistics Office, said: \u201cWhat happens here is that an entire balance sheet of a company relocating to Ireland from somewhere else is included in our capital stocks or our international investment position. \u201cThe very dramatic increase has increased the capacity for production in the economy and impacts the accounts for 2015 in the increase of exports and imports.\u201d Earlier this year, the US president, Barack Obama, called on Congress to close down inversion deals, describing them as \u201cone of the most insidious tax loopholes out there\u201d. \u201cWhen companies exploit loopholes like this, it makes it harder to invest in the things that are going to keep America\u2019s economy going strong for future generations,\u201d he said in response to a deal by drugs maker Pfizer intended to redomicile from its headquarters in New York to Ireland by purchasing Allergan, which was later abandoned.",

                "bodyText":"That\u2019s it for today, thank you for joining us. We\u2019ll be back again in the morning. AM US markets are up in early trading. Dow Jones: +0.4% at 18,295 S&amp;P 500: +0.4% at 2,146 Nasdaq: +0.6% at 5,018 Ireland\u2019s economy grew by a massive 26.3% in 2015, following a surge in foreign investment. A major boost came from foreign companies that switched their base to Ireland, increasing the value of the country\u2019s corporate sector. Michael Connolly, a senior statistician at Ireland\u2019s Central Statistics Office, said: What happens here is that an entire balance sheet of a company relocating to Ireland from somewhere else is included in our capital stocks or our international investment position. The very dramatic increase has increased the capacity for production in the economy and impacts the accounts for 2015 in the increase of exports and imports. Read our full story on the figures here: German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has been speaking in Brussels, where he joined other EU finance ministers for the latest Ecofin meeting. He called for Britain to be clear about its Brexit decision as soon as possible to limit long-term uncertainty. Speaking separately in Berlin, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel said her government\u2019s goal is to ensure Brexit does not have an impact in Germany. The FTSE 100 has risen above 6,700 for the first time since 11 August. Investors continue to be cheered by the swifter-than-expected conclusion to the Conservative Party leadership contest, with Theresa May confirmed on Tuesday as the UK\u2019s new PM. The FTSE is up 0.3% or 18 points at 6,701. The pound is up 1.2% against the dollar, at $1.3152. It is up 0.9% against the euro at \u20ac1.1850. Back in the wider world, European markets are higher. The FTSE 250 is up 0.6% at 16,803. Mark Carney came under considerable pressure from MPs, who quizzed him on the Bank\u2019s position in the lead up to the referendum on 23 June. It was the governor\u2019s first appearance in front of the Treasury Committee. Key points from the session: Carney said that by highlighting potential risks associated with Brexit he was representing the Bank\u2019s independent view, and not that of David Cameron or George Osborne. There was no political bias, he insisted. There was no discussion with the chancellor about any particular Brexit \u201cline\u201d to be taken by the Bank, the governor said. He said the move to relax the rules on how much capital banks must hold was not expected to be a \u201csilver bullet\u201d, addressing all the risks posed by the Brexit vote. But it would help to send a message to businesses and households that banks had money to lend. There will be no repeat of the credit crunch of 2008/2009. Consumers are also in a better position than they were before the crisis, with fewer debts. The Bank of England did not intervene in America\u2019s response to the HSBC files. A report in the US suggests the Department of Justice did not want to see legal proceedings against the bank because of the risks to financial stability. The Bank has the tools to ensure both monetary and financial stability, Carney said. He added the UK\u2019s exposure to the troubled Italian banking system was modest. The weaker pound could reduce Britain\u2019s current account deficit by about a third. Will the Brexit decision be negative for foreign direct investment over the long term, Tyrie asks Richard Sharp, an external member of the FPC? In the short to medium term yes, Sharp answers, in the longer term it will depend on policies and agreements struck. And that concludes the session. Full story and summary to follow. The governor says a weaker pound should improve the current account deficit, making it smaller. If maintained, the drop in the pound since the referendum would reduce the current account deficit by about a third, Carney estimates. Turning to the downsides of the Brexit vote for the current account, Carney includes the reduction in foreign investment in UK commercial property, and the \u201cmodest increase\u201d in risk premium associated with UK assets. When institutions try to bluff their way through risks, sweeping them under the carpet it is \u201cexactly the wrong thing to do\u201d, Carney says. Carney turns to the fall in the pound since the referendum. The exchange rate move can help the UK adjust to the post-Brexit environment, including the change in trade terms that will follow, the governor says. FPC member Donald Kohn says that if you are going to make a major decision to build a factory or open a new office in the UK, you would want to know what the terms of trading would be with other countries. Andrew Tyrie follows up by saying the Bank\u2019s MPC and FPC would have come in for considerable criticism had they not commented on the potential consequences of Brexit in the run up to the referendum. Deputy governor Cunliffe says the Bank\u2019s reputation would have been damaged if it had not warned of Brexit risks before the vote. Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg is up. He clashed with Carney in the run-up to the referendum, accusing the governor of being in the pocket of the chancellor on the remain side of the campaign. Rees-Mogg asks whether the Bank must be like Caesar\u2019s wife, \u201cabove suspicion\u201d? The MP is pressing on with the idea that Carney showed political bias in the run-up to the referendum by arguing that being a member of the EU would be net beneficial for the UK economy. Carney rejects the idea. The Conservative MP is now taking Carney to task on his comment pre-referendum that UK rates could go either up or down in the event of a Brexit vote. Was it ever likely that policy would be tightened, Rees-Mogg asks, or did it just suit the chancellor\u2019s argument? Carney says the statement was a balanced view, reflecting the views of the MPC as a whole. The governor is keeping a fairly cool head in the face of some hostile questioning by Rees-Mogg. Carney gets the last word, suggesting those questioning whether the Bank was biased \u201cshould consider their [own] motivations their judgements?\u201d Markets are hedging \u201cdownside risk\u201d according to Carney, which is why we have seen record low bond yields. Low bond yields do not give an accurate signal of the future of the UK economy. \u201cThe financial system can withstand huge shocks. There will be growth\u201d. Carney is talking about the ultra low rates environment we are currently in. The governor suggests that the Bank still has tools up its sleeve should it need them. We have the tools to meet our responsibilities for both monetary and financial stability. Carney continues to sound the same reassuring note he has adopted since the Brexit result was known on 24 June. Economists believe the Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee will announce fresh measures to stimulate the UK economy - possibly as early as Thursday when it announces its monthly policy decision. The MPC could further cut interest rates (from 0.5%) or extend quantitative easing (from \u00a3375bn), or both. FPC member Donald Kohn says the most likely scenario of a rise in UK interest rates is a strong economy. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be all bad news.\u201d Sir Jon Cunliffe, the Bank\u2019s deputy governor for financial stability, says we have seen the beginning of financial markets putting a risk premium on UK assets. However, his FPC colleague Donald Kohn says this is limited, because the banks are better capitalised than they were in the run-up to the financial crisis. Carney says consumers are in a better position than they were in the run-up the crisis, less indebted. So households indebtedness now poses a smaller risk to financial stability. Labour\u2019s Mann asks the governor how the Bank might deal with the short term risks posed by a potential second referendum on Scottish independence. He says the issue of UK bank headquarters should be addressed well before any future decision on independence. Now to Italian banks. Carney says there is a macroeconomic risk posed by Italian banks and their bad loans and the Italian authorities are looking at it. The UK\u2019s exposure is \u201cmodest,\u201d the governor says. Labour MP John Mann is bringing Carney to task on property funds, and the fact the FPC was aware that investors were likely to withdraw large sums of money in the event of a Brexit vote. Why didn\u2019t the FPC do anything? Carney says that markets have created funds with daily liquidity that invest in illiquid assets (i.e. property). He says the FCA were aware and were looking at the issue. Tyrie now asks Donald Kohn about a Republican party report in the US that claims the Department of Justice did not want to see legal proceedings against the HSBC because of risks to financial stability. Should we be taking this seriously? Kohn says he has no specific knowledge of this situation. I wouldn\u2019t pass judgment until I heard the other side of the story. Tyrie to Carney: \u201cDid you discuss the matter with the chancellor? The allegation here is that UK authorities have been meddling.\u201d Carney says he was not involved in or aware of any alleged intervention on the HSBC case. (A reminder of the HSBC files here.) There will be no \u201ccredit crunch\u201d, unlike 2008/2009, according to the governor, because banks will have funds available to lend. Credit supply (lack of it) will not constrain the economy. Reeves says she worries that the relaxing of rules on bank\u2019s capital requirements are not going to be enough to save the economy post-Brexit. Carney says it\u2019s just one element of a bigger story: We would not represent this as a single silver bullet. It is part of a series of measures. Reeves says she is still worried about whether there will be a reduction in lending. Carney says that demand, not credit availability, is more likely to wane. We really want to make it as clear as possible to businesses and individuals that credit should be available for the right ideas, for the right transactions, be it a mortgage or a new business. Rachel Reeves, Labour MP, says the Bank was right to warn on Brexit risks before she moves on to the issue of counter-cyclical buffers. Carney says that by relaxing the rules for banks he wanted to \u201ctake off the table\u201d concerns about credit supply. \u201cThe banks are well capitalised.\u201d Now Tyrie is asking whether Carney would agree to the publication of records of any discussions the governor had with Osborne on the matter, in order to ease any fears of political bias the public might have. The governor says that he is prepared to look at how that can be done as long as it is within the public interest. Tyrie quips that lead Brexiteer Boris Johnson has credited Carney with doing a good job since the vote. Returning to serious mode, Carney says things are different in the current era, much more transparent. We don\u2019t keep things under wraps. The governor now has the chance to defend himself against the allegations. He describes the allegations as \u201cextraordinary\u201d. The chair [of the FPC] does not guide conclusions. The views of the FPC are the views of the FPC. What was in the March record are the views of the FPC, they are not pre-judged or pre-decided. Tyrie asks whether the Chancellor sought from Carney guidance on the likely \u201clines\u201d the Bank would take on the referendum. Carney says he didn\u2019t, that\u2019s not the way it works. David Kohn, an external member of the Bank\u2019s Financial Policy Committee, says the committee were in agreement on Brexit risks, and that there was no pressure on policymaker to take one view or another. We looked at the potential risks that might emerge from a leave vote. All of us agreed it was the biggest near term risk to financial stability The statement we put out at the end of March was a consensus opinion. Tyrie says he wants to address the allegation in the run-up to the referendum that the Bank attempted to scare voters about Brexit for political motives. Tyrie runs through the allegations, made by various politicians on the Leave side of the campaign. They claimed the governor was working in the interests of David Cameron and George Osborne, calling into question the independence of the Bank of England. Tyrie: That\u2019s a very serious allegation. Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury Committee, makes the point that this is a significant moment, as it is the first opportunity for MP\u2019s to quiz the governor since the Brexit vote. Here we go. The governor and Bank colleagues take their seats. The Treasury Committee is late starting, we will be bringing you updates once it\u2019s underway... The full story on the FPC minutes from the Guardian\u2019s Jill Treanor: Quick note before the governor starts... This from Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets on the relief among investors... The confirmation of a new UK Prime Minister has offered some welcome certainty in uncertain times. Theresa May as PM has produced no Mayday calls in markets. The \u201csafe hands\u201d of Mrs May at the helm has actually reduced distress signals. The pound has risen over 1% against the dollar today, adding to yesterday\u2019s gains when Andrea Leadsom ended her campaign to become the Tory party leader. The certainty of Theresa May stepping into the top job in UK politics ahead of schedule has had the perhaps unintuitive effect of weighing on UK stocks. It was the drop in sterling that cushioned the \u2018Brexit blow\u2019 because of its positive effect on UK company foreign earnings. Subsequently, the rebound in the pound is weighing on the FTSE 100, notably the big multinationals including Vodafone, GlaxoSmithKline and Diageo. Next up: Mark Carney appears at the Treasury Select Committee. Will there be fireworks as he faces his adversary Jacob Rees-Mogg, the MP and Brexit supporter ? The minutes from the Financial Policy Committee also reveal that policymakers were unanimous in the decision to cut banks\u2019 capital requirements following the EU referendum. Last week the FPC lowered a capital requirement for banks, affording them greater flexibility to absorb potential Brexit-related shocks. Bank of England was warned that investors were likely to pull large amounts of money out of commercial property funds following the Brexit vote. Minutes from the meeting of the Bank\u2019s Financial Policy Committee on 28 June and 1 July (published here) reveal that policymakers were warned by the City regulator that funds might be suspended, which is exactly what happened. Since 4 July, seven funds have made moves to stop withdrawals either by suspending trading or reducing the value of the fund. The minutes reveal: The FPC was briefed by the Financial Conduct Authority on the extent of outflows from these funds and on the possibility that funds could suspend redemptions in the near term. The Bank also published two paragraphs that were redacted from the minutes of an earlier FPC meeting in March. The pars related to contingency planning in the run-up to the 23 June referendum and were deemed at the time to be against the public interest. Here are the paragraphs: Supervisors were engaging with banks, insurers and central counterparties on their contingency plans for risks related to the referendum, including for managing funding and liquidity risks in sterling and foreign currency. Several firms had reported that they were conducting stress tests with referendum related strategies of varying severity. UBS boss warns about potential job moves from the UK following the Brexit vote... Nintendo shares are up more than 50% in the three trading days since its Pok\u00e9mon Go game was launched. Nintendo\u2019s shares rose 12.8% to \u00a522,860 in Tokyo on Tuesday, taking total gains in the past three days to 53%. It means the market value of the company has jumped by \u00a37bn since the latest version of its 21-year-old game was made available on 7 July. Pok\u00e9mon Go is the first edition of the game for mobile phones and and lets players face the monsters in the real world using their smartphone cameras. Figures published overnight showed consumer spending slowed to recession levels in the run up to the EU referendum. High street and online sales were up 0.2% in June compared with the same month a year earlier according to the survey from the British Retail Consortium and KPMG. But sales were down 0.5% on a like-for-like basis, which strips out the impact of sales at shops open for less than a year. Over the second quarter, sales were up 0.5% on the first quarter and 1.2% up on an annual basis. The BRC said this was the weakest performance since May 2009, when the economy was contracting during its longest and deepest postwar recessions. Economists have commented that consumers are likely to delay spending on big items while economic uncertainty reigns following the Brexit decision. Meanwhile the yen hit more than a two-week low against the dollar as investors factored in more monetary stimulus following the the election victory by Japan\u2019s ruling coalition. The dollar rose 0.8% to 103.64 yen, its strongest since 24 June when the Brexit vote was revealed. The pound is rising this morning, currently up 1% against the dollar at $1.3130. As it stands, the pound is on track for its biggest one-day gain since before the EU referendum. Sterling is also up 0.6% against the euro at \u20ac1.1813. Markets have edged higher in early trading, following the FTSE 100\u2019s move into a bull market on Monday. The FTSE 100 is trailing however, down four points. Investors have found comfort from the sooner-than-expected end to the Conservative Party leadership contest. Theresa May\u2019s confirmation as the next Prime Minister removes the uncertainty that investors were expecting to run for another couple of month. May is expected to move into Number 10 on Wednesday, when firm plans for Brexit and life outside the EU can get underway.

The Bank of England is in focus this morning. At 9.30am the Bank will publish the minutes of the Financial Policy Committee meeting held on 28 July and 1 July. Then at 10am the Bank\u2019s governor Mark Carney will be questioned by MPs on the Treasury Select Committee about the Financial Stability Report published by the Bank last week. Here is our story on the report: Today\u2019s session will give Carney the opportunity to provide his latest view on the fallout from the Brexit vote, in this fast-changing environment.

                "bodyText":"Asian shares came within reach of testing their 2016 peak on Wednesday as solid US growth prospects and the anointing of a new prime minister in Britain appeared to fuel a recovery in investors\u2019 risk appetite after the uncertainty caused by Brexit. A rebound in equity markets led investors to reduce their holdings of safe-haven assets like Japan\u2019s yen, which had surged in the aftermath of Britain\u2019s shock vote to leave the European Union. In Japan the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, ordered a new round of fiscal stimulus spending after an election victory. His meeting on Tuesday with the former US Federal Reserve chair Ben Bernanke, a proponent of \u201chelicopter money\u201d policies \u2013 printing money and directly handing it to the private sector to stimulate the economy \u2013 fuelled speculation Abe\u2019s stimulus could be funded by the Bank of Japan\u2019s easing. Such expectations pushed down the yen 4% over the last two days. Abe has told his economy minister to compile an economic stimulus package by the end of this month to revive a flagging economy. MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had risen by 0.4% to 427.83 at one point, just below its year-to-date high of 428.22 hit on April 21.

But now the UK looks set to have a new prime minister and negotiations may begin earlier. That is soothing investor sentiment,\u201d said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. Britain\u2019s home secretary, Theresa May, is set to take over as Britain\u2019s prime minister on Wednesday. The British pound traded at $1.327 at one point after surging almost 2% on Tuesday, pulling away from a 31-year low of $1.2798 struck late in June, as investors bought back the currency on May\u2019s appointment as prime minister. The euro was little changed at $1.1060. The Bank of England makes its policy announcement on Thursday, with some analysts expecting a rate cut. The European Central Bank is also widely expected to take a dovish stance when it holds its policy review a week later.

If the government keeps counting the \u201czombie measures\u201d, then it should not expect the credit agencies to believe the path to surplus is real. The lack of movement has caused more than a few commentators to debate whether or not losing AAA credit rating actually matters. Even those who are most strident on the importance of the AAA rating suggest a fall to AA+ would result in little more than a 10-20 basis points increase in the yield \u2013 and the big impacts come when you start getting into B-grade territory. The worry is that because the government\u2019s bonds are the standard by which Australian company bonds are priced, any downgrade will be felt more sharply by the corporate sector \u2013 especially the banks \u2013 than by the government. But given the small increase that may be felt, the likely response would be for the RBA to cut the cash rate and for banks to not pass on the full amount. For the moment, there has been no change to the banks\u2019 short-term funding costs: But because the banks\u2019 net-interest margin is currently as low as it was during the depths of the financial crisis, it means they don\u2019t have as much of a buffer as they did should the world economy again head into a downspin. While it is always good to have the \u201cwhat if the worst happens\u201d considerations at hand, the seeming lack of market interest at our possible downgrade does again bring to the fore the question of whether the government should be making use of the cheap debt while the opportunity presents itself. In relation to Canada, last month the IMF said it \u201cwelcomes the stimulus measures in the 2016 federal budget that sharply boosts spending on a raft of initiatives from infrastructure projects to social benefits\u201d \u2013 even though this meant ditching the plan to balance the Canadian government\u2019s budget.

Green has set out a robust defence of his stewardship of BHS in a letter to MPs, claiming that he invested \u00a3421m into the group during his 15 years at the helm. It is clear that we invested substantially in the business,\u201d he said. The amount of capital investment highlighted by Green during his tenure almost exactly matches the \u00a3423m paid in dividends to his family and other BHS shareholders between 2000 and 2004. It is part of the more than \u00a3580m, including rental payments and interest, extracted from the company throughout Green\u2019s time in charge. The collapse of BHS has put 11,000 jobs at risk and left a \u00a3571m pension deficit. Green sold BHS for \u00a31 in March 2015 to a consortium led by Chappell, a serial bankrupt. The retailer failed 13 months later. Al Mana Group, based in Doha, bought BHS\u2019s 70 overseas stores and its online business in June, but it is thought that administrator Duff &amp; Phelps will now be forced to sell off the group\u2019s 164 UK outlets piecemeal. MPs are hoping to publish their report on BHS within weeks. The Labour MP Frank Field, who chairs the work and pensions select committee, one of the two parliamentary groups investigating BHS, has said Green\u2019s credibility rests on coming up with a generous settlement for pensioners, following a bad-tempered evidence session with the retail tycoon last month. Green previously admitted mistakes in the handling of the pension fund, but has pledged to \u201csort it\u201d. When giving evidence to MPs, Green said he had not been sufficiently involved in the fund\u2019s dealings, but letters from the former chair of the BHS pension fund trustees indicate that Green was involved in meetings as early as 2002. In his letter to MPs, Green said: \u201cIt is clear that we invested substantially in the business, we lent substantial sums to the business and we gave Retail Acquisitions [Chappell\u2019s consortium] every chance with a solid platform to take the business forward.\u201d Letters from Green\u2019s legal advisers, Linklaters, claim that Chappell broke the terms of a sale agreement by failing to invest his own money in BHS, and paying out proceeds from property sales to fund loans, and payments to himself and advisers. Retail Acquisitions borrowed \u00a35m, secured against BHS\u2019s warehouse in Atherstone, Warwickshire, to provide half of a promised equity investment agreed as part of his deal with Green. Linklaters wrote to law firm Olswang in June, saying that raising the money against BHS\u2019s Atherstone warehouse was \u201ccontrary to the clear commercial understanding\u201d that a \u00a35m upfront investment should be new equity. Sources close to Green say he is \u201cdeeply angry\u201d at Olswang and its role in the scandal. Evidence from Eddie Parladorio, one of Chappell\u2019s key lieutenants, indicated that Chappell was still trying to raise a personal loan to fund his promised investment in the retailer 48 hours before he agreed a takeover deal. Parladorio said a loan was agreed with Retail Acquisitions, rather than Chappell personally, at the very last moment. He also told MPs that he had voted against a plan for Retail Acquisitions to lend \u00a31.5m to the company that owns Chappell\u2019s father\u2019s house, as \u201cI did not consider this loan to be the business of RAL\u201d. Chappell declined to comment.",

Hammond, Buxton said, had \u201cwalked into one of the most unusual economic environments I have known in my 30-year investment career\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cI am pretty sure that the government will, in the autumn statement, do some fiscal weakening, such as reducing stamp duty on housing transactions, cutting petrol taxes to offset the increase that will come from the weaker currency,\u201d Buxton said. </p> <p>\u201cThe bigger question is: are they bolder? Do they go \u2018right, well we are in a different world; if we can borrow at a ludicrously low rates through extensive debt issuance, then let\u2019s do so, specifically to invest either directly or alongside private investors in infrastructure projects\u2019.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe could resurface [the] M1 [motorway], we have a clear need for more gas-fired electricity generational plants. The private sector is not stepping up and doing any of this, unsurprisingly, so lets do some funding, some guarantees, make things attractive. </p> <p>\u201cIt will be interesting whether they do that.

                "bodyText":"One of the leading money managers in the City of London has said the fallout from Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU will be \u201chorrible\u201d and that the Square Mile is still \u201cslightly stunned\u201d by the result. Richard Buxton, the chief executive and head of UK equities at Old Mutual Global Investors (OMGI), which manages \u00a326bn of funds on behalf of individual investors and institutions, said warnings from the pro-EU campaign about the impact of Brexit before the referendum were well placed. \u201cI don\u2019t think there was doom-mongering, because it is absolutely going to be horrible,\u201d he said. \u201cMark Carney\u2019s speech [in which he warned of dangers of Brexit] was absolutely spot on. This is just really bad news. \u201cYou can criticise the Brexit team for a) an utterly mendacious campaign and b) not expecting that they would really win, so never having a plan. I mean the whole thing is literally unbelievable. It is extraordinary how we have ended up where we are.\u201d Buxton has worked in investments for 31 years and is regarded as the City\u2019s leading stock picker, alongside his rival Neil Woodford. Funds worth more than \u00a31bn left Schroders and went into Old Mutual when Buxton moved between the two companies in 2013. He said Brexit is not as immediately dangerous as the financial crisis in 2008, when cashpoints were 30 minutes away from running out of money. However, he remains concerned. \u201cUnlike an election result, where \u2018OK, it\u2019s not great, but in five years\u2019 time it can be reversed\u2019, this is stupendously final,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t always agree with Martin Wolf [the Financial Times columnist], but when he wrote the day after that this is probably the single worst event in British postwar history, yeah, I don\u2019t disagree. \u201cIn terms of the markets, you have seen this massive polarisation, literally 60-70% share price differential within days, between British American Tobacco [which went up due to the weakness of sterling against the dollar] and a housebuilder [that went down]. That is without precedent.\u201d Buxton said workers in the City and at OMGI were still coming to terms with the vote. \u201cI think people are still slightly stunned,\u201d he said. \u201cComing to terms with this is that classic cycle that you go through in terms of shock, grief, anger, all of that. We are very early into this. \u201cOur mood here is we\u2019re \u2018glass half full\u2019 people. We have pulled together. A lot of people have come in without being called; they were in early from that Friday [24 June] onwards. People have come together when they have needed to in terms of queries from regulators on liquidity and flows, and so on.\u201d The threat of redemptions \u2013 investors withdrawing their money from funds \u2013 is serious in the city. Several property funds blocked investors from taking out their money amid panic that the uncertainty caused by the referendum result could cause property prices to fall. Buxton admitted that OMGI had seen \u201cmodest outflows\u201d, but said a major overseas client had pumped more money into its funds because it believed that the fall in the value of sterling and tumbling share price provided a buying opportunity. \u201cWe are OK, but clearly we have got to accept that over the next six months we will have to work with our clients. At the moment, we are even struggling to get appointments with people because they are just head down, in the bunker, don\u2019t want to know, don\u2019t want to talk anyone and don\u2019t want to think about doing anything. That will fade over time, but it\u2019s how can we get out to people and say \u2018look, we do still think there are some amazing investment opportunities here\u2019.\u201d Buxton said the stock market had already priced in a \u201cpretty significant recession\u201d for the UK, with falls in the value of housebuilders, commercial property companies and financial institutions. \u201cNow I think the economy is going to judder to a halt [or] have a mild recession, but I don\u2019t think it is going to be as severe as some of these shares are pricing in,\u201d he said. \u201cThat said, there is no mad rush to add to or buy into some of those stocks, because the real economy is only going to gradually emerge over the next three to six months.\u201d The OMGI chief executive also warned of continued volatility in trading for the near term, because of the uncertainty surrounding the deal that Britain would negotiate with the EU. With Theresa May in place as prime minister and Philip Hammond as chancellor, the City is focusing on what policies the new government might pursue. Hammond, Buxton said, had \u201cwalked into one of the most unusual economic environments I have known in my 30-year investment career\u201d. \u201cI am pretty sure that the government will, in the autumn statement, do some fiscal weakening, such as reducing stamp duty on housing transactions, cutting petrol taxes to offset the increase that will come from the weaker currency,\u201d Buxton said. \u201cThe bigger question is: are they bolder? Do they go \u2018right, well we are in a different world; if we can borrow at a ludicrously low rates through extensive debt issuance, then let\u2019s do so, specifically to invest either directly or alongside private investors in infrastructure projects\u2019. \u201cWe could resurface [the] M1 [motorway], we have a clear need for more gas-fired electricity generational plants. The private sector is not stepping up and doing any of this, unsurprisingly, so lets do some funding, some guarantees, make things attractive. \u201cIt will be interesting whether they do that. But clearly, even just the former measures, let alone the latter, mean the budget deficit is going to be swinging out again. Now, that, to my way of thinking, is why sterling is weak and could weaken further, to be honest. Already it [the deficit] wasn\u2019t coming in quick enough, but it is going to start expanding.\u201d As for the response of his company, Buxton said OMGI would open a new office in Dublin if it needed to, but predicted that there was unlikely to be any \u201cclarity\u201d for two years as the UK negotiated to leave the EU. \u201cFor now, the UK is still a member of Europe [the EU] and we can still do everything that we were doing,\u201d he said.",

Assuming the bid price, Softbank is paying over 25% less in yen terms compared to over a year ago to acquire this crown jewel of UK, and indeed global, intellectual property. The devaluation of sterling will continue to provide interesting investment opportunities for overseas investors to buy UK assets, including central London property, at a discount. </p> <p>The repercussions of the Brexit decision have yet to be felt. Over the next six to nine months we will see not only the direct effect on growth in the UK and Europe of this blow to business confidence, but also the impact it has on the political landscape. We should take some reassurance from recent market action as it was a high profile challenge to the resilience of the European financial system. The measures central banks have put in place to address outside \u201cshocks\u201d passed an important test, which is an endorsement of the progress made since the Eurozone crisis. Furthermore, as last week\u2019s non-European data indicated, the world economic picture still has many bright spots. The US remains highly resilient whilst the picture in emerging markets is improving. If the last two weeks has taught us anything, it is that Britain is not as important to the world as the world is to Britain, hence the importance of retaining a global perspective when making investment decisions.</p> <p>Our view prior to Brexit was that the world would \u201cmuddle through\u201d and risk takers would be rewarded for their steely nerve. Our view now is the same, but there is less margin for error and a higher level of background political risk.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-578cdcf5e4b08239dbab7cc8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-18T13:45:22.999Z\">2.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wells Fargo buys City office block development for \u00a3300m</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In another sign that Britain remains open for business, US bank Wells Fargo is to buy an 11-storey office block development in the heart of the City in one of the largest real estate deals since the Brexit vote.<br><br>It has bought the development - 33 Central at 33 King William Street - from property company HB Reavis.

The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 26.18 points or 0.39% higher at 6695.42, but that was more than accounted for by the gain in ARM (26.5 points).

Shares in the microchip company are up around 40% and if it hadn\u2019t been for this news, the day\u2019s performance would have been a whole lot more pedestrian. Hawkish comments from BoE policymaker Martin Weale have also done little to buoy sentiment for UK stocks today, although the confidence this kind of message imparts has at least managed to cheer the housebuilders. At the other end of the board, TUI is markedly lower off the back of the weekend\u2019s events in Turkey amidst fears of holidaymakers changing plans for the summer, whilst BHP Billiton is also struggling with word that a subsidiary has seen its debt rating downgraded to junk weighing here. Oil prices are now down around 2% as new data showed a hike in US crude supplies. Market data firm Genscape reported a stock build of 26,460 barrels last week at the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery hub, following a surge in US supplies of gasoline and distillate last week. Brent crude is currently down $1.03 a barrel at $46.58 while West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, is down 2.1% at $44.98 a barrel. Wall Street has edged ahead in early trading, continuing to head towards record highs but only gradually. A drop in the oil price has taken the shine off some reasonable company results, with Bank of America beating expectations with its second quarter figures. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 0.12% at 18538, compared to its lifetime high of 18557. The proposed takeover of ARM by Japan\u2019s Softbank is an illustration of the consequences of volatility in the global currency markets, says John Haynes, head of research at Investec Wealth &amp; Investment: The announcement of an agreed bid for ARM Holdings by Softbank of Japan is the clearest illustration possible of the consequences of the current global currency volatility. Assuming the bid price, Softbank is paying over 25% less in yen terms compared to over a year ago to acquire this crown jewel of UK, and indeed global, intellectual property. The devaluation of sterling will continue to provide interesting investment opportunities for overseas investors to buy UK assets, including central London property, at a discount. The repercussions of the Brexit decision have yet to be felt. Over the next six to nine months we will see not only the direct effect on growth in the UK and Europe of this blow to business confidence, but also the impact it has on the political landscape. We should take some reassurance from recent market action as it was a high profile challenge to the resilience of the European financial system. The measures central banks have put in place to address outside \u201cshocks\u201d passed an important test, which is an endorsement of the progress made since the Eurozone crisis. Furthermore, as last week\u2019s non-European data indicated, the world economic picture still has many bright spots. The US remains highly resilient whilst the picture in emerging markets is improving. If the last two weeks has taught us anything, it is that Britain is not as important to the world as the world is to Britain, hence the importance of retaining a global perspective when making investment decisions. Our view prior to Brexit was that the world would \u201cmuddle through\u201d and risk takers would be rewarded for their steely nerve. Our view now is the same, but there is less margin for error and a higher level of background political risk. In another sign that Britain remains open for business, US bank Wells Fargo is to buy an 11-storey office block development in the heart of the City in one of the largest real estate deals since the Brexit vote. It has bought the development - 33 Central at 33 King William Street - from property company HB Reavis. The deal will allow the US bank to consolidate its 850 London-based staff in a single location when construction is completed in the third quarter of 2017. Terms of the deal were not revealed but a source told Reuters it was likely to be worth around \u00a3300m. A quick recap. One of the Bank of England\u2019s top policymakers has dampened expectations that UK interest rates will be slashed to fresh record lows next month. Martin Weale argued that Britain may not need immediate reassurance from the BoE, and argued that central bankers shouldn\u2019t act as nursemaids to the markets\u2019 every whim. Weale also predicted that the Brexit vote will make the country poorer, as firms slash spending and hiring. The warning came after a flurry of data showing that the Brexit vote has hurt the economy. The EY Item Club predicted a recession next year. Deloitte reported that business confidence has suffered its worst knock in at least a decade. RightMove warned that asking price for home sales have dipped in the last month. Societe Generale predicted that house prices in some London areas could halve! Elsewhere... The UK government has thrown its backing behind Japanese corporation SoftBank\u2019s \u00a324bn takeover of the tech firm ARM Holdings. Downing Street says the deal is in the national interest, while SoftBank\u2019s CEO Masayoshi Son claims to have wowed Theresa May and Philip Hammond with his pledges to invest in the company and hire more staff. Cambridge\u2019s MP, though, is worried... Turkey\u2019s stock market has now slumped by over 5%, following last week\u2019s coup attempt. The Turkish lira has recovered some of Friday night\u2019s heavy losses, as the Erdogan government asserts control. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, predicts more lira losses: Over time, interest rates will need to be reduced significantly in order to stimulate demand in the economy. But at the same time, this will reduce the appeal of the lira as a higher yielding currency for foreign investors. So whichever way you look at it, the outlook for the Lira looks dire unfortunately. Unsurprisingly, the Adam Smith Institute thinks overseas firms shouldn\u2019t be blocked from buying UK ones. Their head of research, Ben Southwood, says it would be a blunder to consider blocking deals such as the SoftBank/ARM takeover. Here\u2019s his argument: \u201cVetting all foreign bids for British firms represents yet another step on the risky road to \u2018Italyification\u2019 of the UK economy, where inefficient national champions are propped up and those putting money into our growth are scrutinised based on their national origin. \u201cThe fact you can later sell your business to a wider pool of investors\u2014and attract capital from everywhere in the world\u2014is a major driver behind British investment. It is also the foundation of Britain\u2019s world-beating finance industry, which provides an outsized portion of UK output, and UK tax revenues. \u201cBritish economic success has been based on openness to trade and investment for hundreds of years. Theresa May must not put an end to that.\u201d Is he right? Well, ARM is hardly a failing company in need of some foreign expertise. It\u2019s already hugely successful, providing key chips for the iPhone (for example). SoftBank are paying 43% over last week\u2019s share price precisely because ARM is such a good company. Also, SoftBank\u2019s insistence that really wants ARM\u2019s technology, and will help the company grow, should allay fears in Westminster. The Labour MP for Cambridge doesn\u2019t share the Conservative government\u2019s enthusiasm for the \u00a324bn takeover of ARM \u2013 Britain\u2019s preeminent tech company. Daniel Zeichner is concerned about ARM\u2019s long-term future under Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, and isn\u2019t totally convinced by its pledge to double the UK workforce. He told ITV News that: \u201cWell of course the promises are great, but how are those promises going to be guaranteed? Do we know what will happen in 6 months or a year? Do we know much about SoftBank? And they seem to be making some pretty big deals across the world. This is a Cambridge success story upon which the future of the United Kingdom is probably depends because this is what we\u2019re good at.\u201d Holiday firm TUI is the worst-performing stock on the FSTE 100 so far today, shedding over 2%. Traders are calculating that the turmoil in Turkey is going to deter holidaymakers from jetting to its resorts; although recent terrorist attacks had already had an impact. Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct explains: TUI is also struggling with that news from Turkey likely to further disrupt travel to the country this summer, although there has been a shift in bookings by holidaymakers for some months now to resorts in the Western Mediterranean. The shock Brexit vote has taken the world\u2019s attention off other issues, such as the ongoing economic crisis in Greece. But the eurozone\u2019s most troubled member hasn\u2019t gone away. And European Comissioner Pierre Moscovici has popped to Athens today, for high-level talks about its current bailout programme. He\u2019s met with prime minister Alexis Tsipras, and discussed the labour reforms and spending cuts that Greece needs to enforce, to get its next tranche of bailout funds (worth around \u20ac2.8bn). Over in Downing Street, Theresa May\u2019s spokeswoman has told lobby reporters that SoftBank\u2019s takeover of ARM is in the national interest (that\u2019s via Reuters) SoftBank\u2019s CEO, Masayoshi Son, has denied that the Brexit vote prompted him to launch today\u2019s massive \u00a324bn takeover of UK chipmaker ARM. Speaking to reporters in London, Son says the EU referendum did not affect his decision. He says SoftBank is determined to have a big role in the development of the Internet of Things -- the next major area of technology. The FT\u2019s Arash Massoudi is tweeting the key points: Son also declared that Britain\u2019s new political masters are impressed by the deal - and his pledge to double ARM\u2019s UK workforce. Readers with expensive houses in the heart of London should take a deep breath, and stay sitting down. French bank Societe Generale has predicted that house prices in the capital could plunge by over 30%, due to the vote to leave the European Union. That\u2019s based on the idea that highly paid City workers will be forced out of London, if Britain loses access to the single market. That would end the \u2018passporting\u2019 which lets banks in the UK sell services across the EU, and mean banks have to shift overseas. SocGen analyst Marc Mozzi explains the gloomy prognosis: \u201cWhile in recent stress tests, the major U.K. banks were assessed with declines of around 30 percent in commercial real estate prices, we fear that London residential could experience an even more severe downturn. \u201cBrexit will damage the U.K. economy, and some companies will almost certainly have to relocate parts of their business to retain access to the EU single market.\u201d Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, reckons Martin Weale may decline to support an interest rate cut in August: Sky\u2019s Ed Conway isn\u2019t too surprised; Weale is one of the more hawkish MPC members. Buzzfeed\u2019s Simon Neville flags up that the rapid appointment of Theresa May as prime minister may calm the situation: Martin Weale has also warned that the Brexit vote will make the UK population poorer. The Bank of England rate-setter tells his audience in London that: My own view is that, despite any savings resulting from a lower contribution to the EU budget, the nation\u2019s income, and thus people\u2019s incomes, are likely to be reduced as a result of the choice made on 23rd June. Weale is concerned that Britain may not retain full access to the single market, which has delivered useful economies of scale. A failure to retain them would amount to a worsening of Britain\u2019s supply conditions reducing both productivity and household incomes. International competition may also have had the effect of stimulating productivity improvements in domestic firms. He also warns that everyone could suffer, if London\u2019s financial sector takes a hit (perhaps because banks are forced to move operations into the EU): Should life become harder for the financial sector then....that may fall disproportionately on London and the South-East. But, if taxable capacity declines disproportionately as a result, the effects of this on people\u2019s incomes will be spread across the country more evenly than the effects on output. He also produces these two charts, showing how UK business confidence has declined in the last few weeks. Bank of England policymaker Martin Weale has just fired a warning shot at the City, saying interest rates might not be cut in August. Speaking in London, Weale revealed that he is not convinced - yet anyway - that rates need to be slashed from 0.5% to fresh record lows to calm Brexit fears. Weale (who has previously voted to raise interest rates), says: the Bank shouldn\u2019t be worried about disappointing the markets. The Old Lady of Threadneedle Street is not a nurse to markets. People who trade in markets know that the Monetary Policy Committee sets policy month by month in the way that its members think appropriate. It does sometimes, as we did in our July meeting, give an indication of where policy may go in the future. But that is no more than the best judgement at the time and not in any sense a commitment; the public understand that. Weale also argues that the Bank doesn\u2019t need to act early to reassure households and businesses. In contrast to the experience of 2008, I do not have any sense that either consumers or businesses are panic-struck and, as I observed, there have been no material signs of financial panic. Last week, the Bank of England surprised many economists by voting to leave interest rates on hold. The minutes of the meeting showed that many members of its monetary policy committee expect to agree on a new stimulus package in August. However, that might not necessarily include a rate cut. The MPC could vote to boost quantitative easing (buying bonds from banks with newly created money), or launch new measures to encourage banks to lend to businesses and consumers. The UK will fall into a \u201cshort, shallow recession\u201d around the turn of the year as Brexit hits house prices, jobs and spending, according to forecasters at the EY Item Club. In another dose of gloom, they have slashed their 2017 growth estimate to 0.4% from 2.6%, and warned that Britain\u2019s economy will suffer permanent harm from the decision to leave the EU. The group says: \u201cThere are likely to be severe confidence effects on spending, only partially cushioned by a fall in the pound. \u201cWe would expect a permanent reduction in the level of U.K. output and productivity.\u201d Britain\u2019s new digital minister is also backing the ARM takeover, underlying that SoftBank are not going to be blocked by Westminster. \u201cInvestment\u201d is a funny way of describing a takeover bid -- surely Hancock knows that the money goes to ARM\u2019s shareholders? The government\u2019s eagerness to support the deal is also ironic, as prime minister Theresa May has pledged to protect UK firms in \u2018strategic\u2019 industries from foreign takeovers. Proof that a week really is a long time in politics... Brexit fears have now hit Britain\u2019s housing market, according to the latest data from Rightmove. UK property asking prices have dropped 0.9% over the last month, suggesting that the EU referendum is hitting demand for property. Some sellers may also be trying to get a deal before Britain\u2019s economy has deteriorated. Jeremy Duncombe, director of the Legal &amp; General Mortgage Club, reckons its not a reason to panic: \u201cGiven the uncertainty that has followed the UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU, it\u2019s not surprising that house prices have decreased month-on-month for the first time in a while. We need however to look at the annual trend and not a month in isolation. House prices are still rising faster much than inflation over a 12 month period, and a slowing of this growth is not necessarily a bad thing. Turkey\u2019s stock market has slumped by 3% in early trading, failing to match the gains in other markets. Traders at the Istanbul Stock Exchange are understandably nervous following last weekend\u2019s failed coup, which is likely to deter businesses from investing in Turkey and holidaymakers from visiting the country. There\u2019s huge trading in the Turkish lira too. It tumbled on Friday night as military officers tried to overthrow president Erdo\u011fan, falling from 2.88 lira to the $1 to 3.04. The lira has now bounced back a bit, as Turkey\u2019s government rounds up thousands of suspected coup plotters. Wolfango Piccoli of Teneo Intelligence fears Turkey faces further instability: This highlights that Erdogan is eager to exploit the event to expand his power and continue the witch-hunt, further worsening the state of Turkey\u2019s crumbling democracy. Moreover, there is a growing risk of a snap election, as the AKP might seize the opportunity to enlarge its parliamentary majority with the aim of introducing an executive presidency via a constitutional revision. With two opposition parties (the MHP and the HDP) undergoing significant internal turmoil, an early election could deliver the necessary numbers for Erdogan\u2019s dream to be fulfilled. On the external front, the already strained relationship with the US could worsen as a result of Ankara\u2019s increased determination to request the extradition of Fethullah Gulen, who has been quickly accused by the Turkish government of being behind the failed putsch. ARM\u2019s soaring share price has helped to drive the FTSE 100 towards the 11-month intraday high hit last week. The Footsie is up 45 points in early trading to 6715, while the smaller FTSE 250 has gained 1%. Other European stock markets are also up in early trading, as traders remain sanguine despite Brexit concerns and the instability in Turkey. Overnight, a top City fund manager warned that Brexit will be \u201chorrible\u201d for the UK economy. Richard Buxton, the chief executive and head of UK equities at Old Mutual Global Investors (OMGI), says the referendum vote is \u201cstupendously final.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t always agree with Martin Wolf [the Financial Times columnist], but when he wrote the day after that this is probably the single worst event in British postwar history, yeah, I don\u2019t disagree Buxton also laid into the Leave campaign for failing to have a strategy for actually leaving the EU: \u201cYou can criticise the Brexit team for a) an utterly mendacious campaign and b) not expecting that they would really win, so never having a plan. I mean the whole thing is literally unbelievable. It is extraordinary how we have ended up where we are.\u201d Shares in chipmaker ARM Holdings have surged by 45% at the start of trading, as the City reacts to SoftBank\u2019s takeover offer. They\u2019re changing hands for \u00a317.32 each, slightly over the Softbank offer of \u00a317. That suggests investors expect the deal to go through, and there may be some speculation of a rival offer (even though Softbank are paying a 43% premium). Britain\u2019s new finance minister has decided that the takeover of ARM Holdings by SoftBank is a jolly good thing. Philip Hammond argues that the deal shows that the Brexit vote hasn\u2019t hurt Britain\u2019s place in the world, saying: \u201cBritain has lost none of its allure to international investors. Britain is open for business - and open to foreign investment.\u201d He\u2019s tweeting the same message: The deal is also a reminder that the slump in the pound makes UK assets more affordable to overseas investors. The yen has surged by almost a third against the pound over the last year, including a 12% spike since the referendum. However... ARM\u2019s share price has also been boosted by the weak pound (as it earns most of its revenues in foreign currencies). British firms are slashing their spending plans in the face of uncertainty following last month\u2019s EU referendum vote. In a worrying signal, anxiety among UK bosses has hit a five year high, according to accountancy firm Deloitte. Its survey found that 82% of chief financial officers from FTSE 350 and large private companies are planning to cut capital spending in the next year. That\u2019s the biggest amount since the survey began a decade ago, up from 34 percent in the first quarter. And 83% are planning to rein in their hiring plans, in a blow to workers seeking new jobs. Alarmingly, businesses are more pessimistic than after the financial crisis in 2008. Ian Stewart, Deloitte\u2019s chief economist, sums up the situation: \u201cPerceptions of uncertainty have soared to levels last associated with the euro crisis five years ago. \u201cThe spike in uncertainty has had a toxic effect on business sentiment, with optimism dropping to the lowest level since our survey started in 2007 -- lower, even, than in the wake of the failure of Lehman in late 2008.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There are three things on the agenda in the City today. Firstly, the Brexit vote, as companies continue to chew through the implications of last month\u2019s EU referendum. Second, investors are watching the situation in Turkey closely after last weekend\u2019s failed coup attempt. President Erdo\u011fan remains in power, and is now pledging to purge the Turkish state of dissidents. But the sight of tanks on the streets may shake confidence in the country, which is already facing high inflation and a troubled tourism industry. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets explain: Following a turbulent weekend, markets are actually quite calm. The weekend\u2019s main highlight was the failed attempt to overthrow the Turkish government in a military coup d\u2019etat and the subsequent mass detentions of military and judiciary personal. And thirdly, we have some early morning takeover action. ARM Holdings, Britain\u2019s biggest technology company, is being taken over by Japan\u2019s SoftBank in a \u00a324bn deal. Encouragingly, SoftBank are promising to at least double the number of UK employees at ARM, in what looks a massive bet on the Internet of Things [the idea that every object will be linked to the web] We\u2019ll be tracking all the main developments through the day.",

                "bodyText":"Disney Princess and Frozen dolls and Star Wars action figures have continued to boost sales for US toymaker Hasbro. Revenues rose 10% to $879m (\u00a3663m), beating analysts\u2019 expectations, in the three months to 26 June as sales of partner brands such as Disney rose 15%. Excluding the impact of changes in currency exchange rates, revenues were up 12%. The strongest growth came from products aimed at girls \u2013 up 39% \u2013 such as dolls based on Elsa, the heroine of Frozen, and new Disney Princess toys deriving from the likes of Cinderella and Snow White. Hasbro took over the global rights to make these dolls from rival Mattel from 1 January 2016 under a licensing deal with Disney. Chief executive Brian Goldner said the sales performance of the dolls had been better than expected. However, shares in Hasbro slumped 7.5% in New York on worries about the future for the boys market as the company prepares to start delivering toys linked to Rogue One: A Star Wars Story in the run-up to Christmas. Analysts believe Hasbro is unlikely to get the same boost to sales as that generated by the previous film in the franchise \u2013 The Force Awakens \u2013 one of the highest grossing movies of all time. Sales of toys aimed at boys, the group\u2019s biggest market, and accounting for 40% of the business, rose just 6% at constant currency rates compared with double-digit rises in the previous quarter. Without help from new film releases this year, Transformers toy sales slid by 20% and items related to dinosaur franchise Jurassic Park fell by more than that. Goldner said Hasbro would stop selling Jurassic Park toys from the end of 2017 after failing to come up with a \u201cmutually beneficial financial arrangement\u201d to do so. He said demand for Star Wars-related items remained \u201cvery strong\u201d. But he admitted that total sales for the year were likely to be the same as last year, at $500m, as the toys would hit shelves in late September, almost a month later in the year than those linked to the previous Star Wars film in 2015. Jefferies analyst Trevor Young said the slowdown in the boys category was \u201csomewhat worrisome\u201d. On a positive note, Goldner said the company had not seen any negative impact on business in the UK since the country\u2019s decision to leave the European Union despite the \u201cnear-term uncertainty\u201d created by the referendum result. Europe was the fastest-growing region in the quarter, with sales up 24%, excluding exchange rate fluctuations, which included a 25% rise in the UK. Goldner said Hasbro continued to enjoy \u201cpositive momentum\u201d in the UK and Europe as a whole. Another source of growth is mobile gaming. Fans spent 80% more on Hasbro\u2019s branded mobile games in the first half of 2016 compared with the first half of last year.

                "bodyText":"Sterling rose and the City\u2019s leading share index closed at its highest level for 11 months after a Bank of England policymaker said a lack of panic since Britain\u2019s shock Brexit vote called into question the need for a knee-jerk cut in interest rates. Speculation that next month\u2019s meeting of Threadneedle Street\u2019s monetary policy committee would unanimously back a comprehensive package of measures to boost growth was called into question when Martin Weale, one of its nine members, voiced doubts about the need for cheaper borrowing. Weale, who has been one of the hawkish members of the MPC, said he wanted to weigh up the impact of Brexit on the economy before making up his mind on how to vote. His remarks made in his last speech as an MPC member came ahead of an expected rise in the annual rate of inflation on Tuesday and as a flurry of reports provided a mixed picture about the prospects for the economy in the aftermath of last month\u2019s referendum. Weale said the Bank would have to balance the likely reduction in demand against upward pressure on inflation when it makes its decision. He said: \u201cFor there to be a case for easing policy I will need to expect weakness in output to be large enough to compensate for any overshoot in inflation on the assumption that policy is unchanged in the near term.\u201d Sterling rose after Weale\u2019s remarks at a conference in London, since they were seen as less supportive of action to underpin growth than interventions last week by two other MPC members \u2013 Andy Haldane and Gertjan Vlieghe.

Management has been fortunate to be able to reiterate 2016 production guidance thanks to limited weather impact, operational efficiencies and ramp-ups/roll-outs, however, its pledges of compelling and consistent returns are falling on deaf ears.</p> <p>This is because investors are focusing on a strong US dollar hindering a the commodity space recovery as the US Fed looks to hike rates and peers look to do quite the opposite.

                "bodyText":"Leading shares have paused for breath amid continuing geopolitical concerns, after Monday\u2019s boost from the proposed \u00a324bn takeover of ARM by Japan\u2019s Softbank. As UK inflation came in higher than expected, giving a lift to the pound, the FTSE 100 has slipped 24.18 points to 6671.24. But Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling is heading the risers, up 36p to \u00a315.57 as analysts at JP Morgan raised their recommendation from neutral to overweight and their price target from \u00a315 to \u00a318. The bank said Coca-Cola was well placed in a low inflation world, with the soft drinks market likely to be resilient to economic volatility. It expected Coca-Cola to have strengthened its balance sheet within a year, leaving it free to return cash to shareholders or take part in merger and acquisition activity. Sky has also been boosted by a broker upgrade, 16.5p better at 896.5p as RBC lifted its target from \u00a310 to \u00a311 and moving from underperform to outperform. The bank said: Our view reflects (1) the lower share price; (2) de-risking of rights renewal in Germany; (3) upside from mobile rollout. The rise in price target is partly driven by our forecasts for higher outer year earnings in pound terms from Germany and Italy. Miners are among the biggest fallers after a disappointing update from Rio Tinto, down 97.5p at \u00a323.65. Anglo American has fallen 29.2p to 802.8p while BHP Billiton is 31.2p lower at 945.6p. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets said: The FTSE\u2019s mining contingent is on the back foot this morning, holding the UK blue-chip index back after Rio\u2019s second quarter production report delivered iron-ore shipments below analyst expectations, albeit still higher than both the first quarter of 2016 and the second quarter of 2015. Management has been fortunate to be able to reiterate 2016 production guidance thanks to limited weather impact, operational efficiencies and ramp-ups/roll-outs, however, its pledges of compelling and consistent returns are falling on deaf ears. This is because investors are focusing on a strong US dollar hindering a the commodity space recovery as the US Fed looks to hike rates and peers look to do quite the opposite. Low/negative interest rates and the prospect of more monetary and fiscal stimulus from major central banks (Oz and NZ on top of BoE, ECB, BoJ) suggests flagging faith in a growth revival to counter a slowing China and a potential race to the bottom generating another round of currency wars that simply serves to send the dollar even higher.

The June consumer confidence survey - which showed modest slippage - had been completed before the UK vote on 23 June.</p> <p>There may be an element of relief that July\u2019s drop in Eurozone consumer confidence was not greater and it may alleviate some of the deepest concerns about how much Eurozone growth will be negatively impacted by the Brexit vote.</p> <p>Nevertheless the clear dip in Eurozone consumer confidence in July reinforces belief that the Brexit vote will have some dampening impact on Eurozone economic activity - particularly as the consumer has been a key growth driver for the Eurozone, notably in the first quarter of this year.</p> <p>On the positive side, for now at least, the fundamentals still look pretty solid for consumers in the Eurozone with negligible inflation supporting purchasing power and labour markets significantly improved overall.</p> </blockquote> <p>Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said these figures could mark the low point:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Consumer confidence in the EU had already dropped in the lead up to the Brexit vote and, in the uncertain aftermath, it\u2019s no real surprise that the mood has worsened.</p> <p>In the UK, consumer confidence has actually come through robustly, which may be an indicator as to how the rest of EU consumers will respond.</p> <p>Suddenly the euro doesn\u2019t look so shaky next to the falling pound, so there\u2019s every chance we could be looking at a consumer confidence nadir in today\u2019s numbers.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-578f84f2e4b0378a304b1ec1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-20T14:12:45.273Z\">3.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">European Union consumer confidence drops after Brexit</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In the wake of the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU, consumer confidence in the area fell sharply, new data shows.</p> <p>According to a flash estimate by the European Commission, consumer confidence in the EU as a whole dropped by \u201ca marked\u201d 1.8 points to -7.6 in July.

                "bodyText":"With Wall Street hitting new record highs, global markets were in relatively buoyant mood, as global jitters faded for the moment. Rising oil prices helped, following a reduction in US crude stocks last week, as did the continuing trend of better than expected US company results, with Microsoft and Morgan Stanley both pleasing investors. In the UK the FTSE 100 finished above 6700 for the first time since last August. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct said: Having come close for the last two days, London\u2019s FTSE-100 is finally finishing above the 6,700 level, with fresh record highs on Wall Street helping shape sentiment in the latter part of the session. Financial stocks are leading the charge with better than expected unemployment readings adding further weight to the idea that a rate cut may not be all that imminent, whilst it\u2019s the miners that are the day\u2019s laggards. Anglo American has followed Rio Tinto in posting some lacklustre numbers and this is casting a shadow over the sector as a whole. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 31.62 points or 0.47% at 6728.99 Germany\u2019s Dax added 1.61% to 10,142.01 France\u2019s Cac climbed 1.15% higher to 4379.76 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.54% to 16,763.82 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.06% better at 8575.5 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.06% to 569.74 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 38 points or 0.21% higher. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow for, among other things, the latest meeting of the European Central Bank. Meanwhile UK prime minister Theresa May has flown to Berlin to meet German chancellor Angela Merkel, with Brexit very much on everyone\u2019s mind. For the latest developments, see our political live blog: No surprise really, but S&amp;P has cut Turkey\u2019s credit rating from BB+ to BB and its outlook from stable to negative following the recent coup attempt. The agency said it expected a period of heightened unpredictability which could constrain capital flowing into Turkey\u2019s economy. Oil prices continue to recover after the US Energy Information Administration reported a 2.3m barrel fall in crude inventories, and have moved back into positive territory for the day. West Texas Intermediate is now up 0.67% at $44.95 a barrel having fallen as low as $43.69. While the FTSE 100 has been regaining ground since the shock Brexit vote and is now sitting at an 11 month high, the more UK focused FTSE 250 has yet to recover the level it reached ahead of the June 23 vote. But the mid-cap index is getting there, and a rise of 1% to its current 17,080 leaves it only 250 points shy of its pre-referendum level. Investors appear to have been comforted by the fact that the worst predictions of disaster following a leave vote have yet to be realised, with even the IMF this week rowing back from its talk of a UK recession in the wake of Brexit. US crude stocks fell last week much in line with expectations, with a draw of 2.34m barrels compared to a forecast 2.1m. But gasoline stocks rose unexpectedly, compared to expectations of no change: So crude prices remain lower but recovering from their worst levels, with West Texas Intermediate now down 0.9%, while gasoline future have hit their lowest since early March. The consumer confidence figures, while not as bad as they could be, still show that Brexit could have an effect on EU economic activity, says economist Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight: While there are no details available, there can be little doubt that a second successive drop in Eurozone consumer confidence to a three-month low in July is largely the consequence of heightened concerns over the economic and political outlook following the UK\u2019s vote to leave the European Union. The June consumer confidence survey - which showed modest slippage - had been completed before the UK vote on 23 June. There may be an element of relief that July\u2019s drop in Eurozone consumer confidence was not greater and it may alleviate some of the deepest concerns about how much Eurozone growth will be negatively impacted by the Brexit vote. Nevertheless the clear dip in Eurozone consumer confidence in July reinforces belief that the Brexit vote will have some dampening impact on Eurozone economic activity - particularly as the consumer has been a key growth driver for the Eurozone, notably in the first quarter of this year. On the positive side, for now at least, the fundamentals still look pretty solid for consumers in the Eurozone with negligible inflation supporting purchasing power and labour markets significantly improved overall. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said these figures could mark the low point: Consumer confidence in the EU had already dropped in the lead up to the Brexit vote and, in the uncertain aftermath, it\u2019s no real surprise that the mood has worsened. In the UK, consumer confidence has actually come through robustly, which may be an indicator as to how the rest of EU consumers will respond. Suddenly the euro doesn\u2019t look so shaky next to the falling pound, so there\u2019s every chance we could be looking at a consumer confidence nadir in today\u2019s numbers.\u201d In the wake of the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU, consumer confidence in the area fell sharply, new data shows. According to a flash estimate by the European Commission, consumer confidence in the EU as a whole dropped by \u201ca marked\u201d 1.8 points to -7.6 in July. This is the worst level for two years. In the eurozone, confidence fell by 0.7 points to -7.9, slightly better than the -8 figure expected by economists polled by Reuters. The June figure of -7.2 was revised up from the initial -7.3. Oil is on the slide again ahead of US inventory figures, with West Texas Intermediate down 1.8% at $43.84, a two month low. The fall reflects continuing strength in the US dollar as well as concerns about a supply glut. US markets continue to move ahead, as Microsoft and Morgan Stanley continue the trend of companies reporting better than expected results. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up around 13 points or 0.06% at 18572 having earlier hit a new peak of 18618. The S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.26% and Nasdaq 0.48%. The world\u2019s largest companies saw their revenues fall last year for the first time since 2010, according to the latest Fortune Global 500 list. Total revenues dropped 11.5% to $27.6trn from $31.2trn in 2014, with profits down 11.2% to $1.48trn. Fortune says: There are plenty of reasons for the reversal. A slowdown in China\u2019s once-booming economy has affected companies worldwide. Growth in the U.S. and Europe remains modest at best. And sustained low oil prices have erased billions in sales for giant petroleum producers like Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell, and Sinopec. But one macroeconomic trend looms largest of all: the explosive comeback of the U.S. dollar and the wide-ranging impact of its renewed strength on global trade. The US had 134 companies on this year\u2019s list, the highest number of any country, followed by China with 103 and 52 from Japan. The US added 6 new companies from the previous year, China added 5, and Japan lost 2, says Fortune. Chinese, Japanese and the US companies together accounted for 58% of the list. China only had 19 companies a decade ago. Britain currently has 26 Fortune Global 500 companies with 17 of them based in London (before any impact from Brexit of course.) Walmart is top of the list, as it has been eleven times since 1995. Apple appears in the top ten for the first time: 1. Walmart Stores (U.S.) 2. State Grid (China) 3. China National Petroleum (China) 4. Sinopec Group (China) 5. Royal Dutch Shell (Netherlands) 6. Exxon Mobil (U.S.) 7. Volkswagen (Germany) 8. Toyota Motor (Japan) 9. Apple (U.S.) 10. BP (Britain) The full list and more details are here. Here\u2019s link to the Moody\u2019s report on UK banks (see 13.49): US markets are expected to open higher following better-than-expected results from Microsoft and Morgan Stanley: Moody\u2019s has downgraded its outlook for the UK banking system to negative from stable because of the Brexit vote. Carlos Suarez Duarte, senior vice president at Moody\u2019s: Increased uncertainty about the UK\u2019s future trade relationship with the EU will likely lead to reduced confidence and lower investment and consumer spending in the UK. This will, in turn, pressure revenues, asset quality and profitability metrics for all banks in the UK, though some are more resilient to these pressures than others. Philip Hammond has had a dream start as chancellor according to Larry Elliott, the Guardian\u2019s economics editor: The Bank of England says there are no signs of a general slowing in activity. Consumers are still spending in the shops. The International Monetary Fund says the economy will slow sharply but will avoid a recession. It is still early days, of course. The full effects of the Brexit vote on the economy will only become apparent over months and years rather than in the four weeks that have so far passed since 23 June. As the Bank\u2019s agents made clear in their monthly report, many companies were so stunned by the result they have yet to work out what to do next. The IMF made a similar point in its updated World Economic Outlook. It noted that Brexit was still unfolding, which is obviously true. That said, Hammond has not had the baptism of fire that many predicted. Forecasts from the remain camp \u2013 of which the new chancellor was a member \u2013 came thick and fast in the run-up to the referendum. All of them warned of severe and immediate consequences if the leave side won. Read the full article here: Debbie Abrahams, Labour\u2019s shadow work and pensions secretary, has commented on the earlier labour market figures. She says wage growth remains too weak. (It was 2.3% in the three months to May, or 2.2% excluding bonuses.) It is welcome that there has been a fall in unemployment. However, under the Tories long term pay growth continues to be sluggish and our economy is over-reliant on low paid insecure work. If Theresa May is serious about supporting working people we need to see serious action on tackling low pay and investing in the high-skilled high-wage jobs our economy needs. MPs on the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee will publish their report on employment practices at Sports Direct on Friday... The Guardian understands the official investigation into Sports Direct\u2019s failure to pay its warehouse workers the national minimum wage has been widened to include the sportswear chain\u2019s 13,000 retail workers. Here is the full update from Simon Goodley: Returning to the labour market data, the number of people claiming jobless benefits rose by 400 in June to almost 760,000. It was far smaller than the 3,500 increase predicted by economists but the figure for May was heavily revised to show a 12,200 jump over the month, compared with the 400 fall the ONS previously estimated. As we move into afternoon trading European markets are up. Investors are cheered by evidence from the Bank of England that so far, the Brexit vote does not appear to have triggered a slowdown. Wolfgang Schaeuble, Germany\u2019s no nonsense finance minister, will meet the new UK chancellor Philip Hammond on Saturday on the sidelines of the G20 meeting in China. As well as bilateral talks between the two men, G20 finance ministers will discuss the aftermath of Brexit and how policymakers can ease concerns. The TUC has a different take on the unemployment report, arguing that it\u2019s not all good news. Specifically it points to the sharp rise in self-employment, which has increased by 300,000 people over the past year and now represents 15.1% of the workforce (4.8 million). TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says: While it\u2019s good to see more people in work, the huge increase in self-employment raises questions about the nature of these jobs. These newly self-employed workers are not all budding entrepreneurs. Many don\u2019t choose self-employment, being forced onto contracts with fewer rights, less pay and no job security. We need more decent jobs. Not working conditions like those exposed at the courier firm Hermes these week, where workers were pushed on to self-employed contracts with fewer rights. Economists at Capital Economics still expect the Bank of England to inject fresh stimulus into the economy in August, despite the better-than-expected UK jobs figures. Paul Hollingsworth at Capital Economics: Despite the relatively upbeat assessment of the labour market overall, we still expect the Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee to follow through with its (loose) commitment to ease policy at its next meeting on 4th August. After all, the vote to leave the EU will almost certainly now cause some firms to put hiring decisions on hold or cut back headcounts altogether. Indeed, we expect the unemployment rate to drift up over the coming quarters. He adds however that comments from the Bank\u2019s regional agents support his view that the short-term impact of the Brexit vote will be less severe than many think. Today\u2019s Bank of England agents\u2019 report showed that a majority of firms did not expect a near-term impact from the referendum outcome on their investment or hiring plans. Accordingly, for now we remain content with our view that the damage to the economy in the short term will be rather less severe than many others are anticipating. Not everyone agrees that the fallout from Brexit is limited so far. UK households think the outlook for their finances is the worst in two-and-a-half years following the decision to leave the UK. The indicator dropped to 47 in July from 49.3 in June according to Markit\u2019s latest survey. Anything below 50 signals a deterioration. People are also becoming more concerned about their jobs, Markit said. Philip Leake, economist at Markit: The survey suggests that the Brexit vote has badly affected households\u2019 views on their finances. With future prospects clouded by uncertainty, July data pointed to the worst financial outlook in two-and-a-half years. Household concerns also intensified as workplace activity fell for the first time since May 2012, with employers awaiting a clearer picture following the Brexit vote. The comments from the Bank of England agents - as well as the better-than expected employment data - are supporting the pound. It was down against the dollar before the two reports were published but is now up 0.6% at $1.3193. James Smith, economist at ING, says there may be trouble ahead, despite the upbeat tone struck by the Bank\u2019s agents: The latest update from the Bank of England\u2019s Agents suggests that there is little evidence of a knee-jerk reaction from businesses post-Brexit, but the medium/long-term outlook is more uncertain. The main message was that firms, for the time being, were seeking to maintain \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d and this suggests that it may be a while before we see any material Brexit impact show up in UK data. Further down the road, the outlook appears to be less certain. On investment, approximately a third expected some negative impact over the next 12 months, echoing the sentiment of recent surveys. There is \u201cno clear evidence\u201d that a UK slowdown is underway since the Brexit vote, according to the Bank of England\u2019s network of regional agents. Bank agents talk to businesses around the country to gain clues about how the economy is really doing, and the July report is the first since the 23 June referendum. The agents reported that while business uncertainty had \u201crisen markedly\u201d, there was little evidence that consumers were spending less. A majority of firms spoken with did not expect a near-term impact from the result on their investment or staff hiring plans. But around a third of contacts thought there would be some negative impact on those plans over the net 12 months. As yet there was no clear evidence of a sharp general slowing in activity. The jobs figures suggest employers were not rattled enough in the run-up to the EU referendum to freeze hiring or cut jobs on a major scale. The big question is whether that will change following the Brexit vote. The UK unemployment rate has fallen to 4.9% in the three months ending May, from 5%. The last time it was as low as that was 2005. These better-than-expected jobs figures are a gift to the new chancellor, Philip Hammond, who wasted no time commenting on them: Today\u2019s employment and wage figures are proof that the fundamentals of the British economy are strong. In the months before the referendum, employment in the UK reached a new record high, unemployment fell to its lowest in a decade and wages continued to rise. As the economy adjusts to the effect of the referendum decision, it is doing so from a position of economic strength. While the decision to leave the European Union marks the beginning of a new phase for our economy, the message we take to the world is this: our country remains open for business and we are the same outward-looking, globally-minded, big-thinking country we have always been. The pound rose back above $1.31 after better-than-expected figures from the UK jobs market. The headline figures: Unemployment rate falls unexpectedly to 4.9% in the three months ending May from 5%. It was the lowest since 2005. The number of people out of work falls by 54,000 to 1.65m. People claiming jobless benefits rises by a much smaller than expected 400 to 759,100 Employment rises by 176,000 to 31.7m Record employment rate of 74.4% Earnings increase by 2.3%, as expected The Bank of England will shortly publish its agents\u2019 summary of business conditions for July. It will provide the first snapshot of how businesses around the UK have responded to Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU following the 23 June referendum. Figures published later today are expected to show consumer confidence weakened in the eurozone in July, following the Brexit vote. The \u2018flash\u2019 indicator from the European Commission is expected to fall to -8 from -7.3 in June. Nintendo has lost some of the gains made since the release of its hugely successful Pokemon Go game. Shares were down almost 15% at one point on Wednesday following reports the release of the game might be delayed in Japan. Nintendo\u2019s market value had doubled since the launch of the game - which combines the virtual world with the real one - earlier this month. Asian markets were mixed on Wednesday. Nikkei: -0.3% at 16,682 Hang Seng: +0.9% at 21,857 The FTSE 100 is up 19 points or 0.3% at 6,716 in early trading. The FTSE 250 is roughly flat at 16,902. Most other major European markets are up. Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.5% at 10,027 France\u2019s CAC: +0.4% at 4,348 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.1% at 16,660 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.4% at 8,515 The pound has dipped below $1.31. It is currently down 0.2% at $1.3085. The euro is down against both the pound and the dollar. It is down 0.3% against the pound at 83.93p, and hit a two-and-a-half-week low against the dollar of $1.0985. The dollar is rising partly on the back of expectations that the Fed will raise interest rates before the end of 2016 following positive data from the US economy (including jobs and the housing market). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. At 9.30 the Office for National Statistics will publish latest figures from the UK jobs market. The figures are expected to show the number of people claiming unemployment benefit rose by 3,500 in June, following a drop of 400 in May. The headline unemployment rate will cover the three months to the end of May and is expected to be unchanged at 5%. Wage growth including bonuses is expected to pick up to 2.3% from 2%. Excluding bonuses growth is expected to be unchanged at 2.3%. The figures should provide some clues about how confident employers were feeling in the run-up to the 23 June referendum. Any shock to the downside would undoubtedly trigger a few alarm bells about the outlook for UK jobs in the aftermath of the Brexit vote.",

                "bodyText":"A senior HSBC banker has been arrested by the FBI as he attempted to board a transatlantic flight and charged him with fraudulently rigging a multibillion-dollar currency exchange deal. Mark Johnson, a British citizen and HSBC\u2019s global head of foreign exchange trading, and a colleague are accused of \u201cdefrauding clients\u201d and alleged to have \u201ccorruptly manipulated the foreign exchange market to benefit themselves and their bank\u201d. He was arrested on Tuesday night shortly before he was due to fly to London from New York\u2019s JFK airport, and was due to be formally charged by a judge at Brooklyn federal court later on Wednesday. He was later released on bail. A second Briton, Stuart Scott, who was HSBC\u2019s European head of foreign exchange trading in London until December 2014, is accused of the same crimes. A warrant was issued for Scott\u2019s arrest. They are the first people to be charged in connection with the US government\u2019s long-running investigation into bankers\u2019 alleged rigging of the $5.3tn (\u00a34tn) per day forex market. \u201cThe defendants allegedly betrayed their client\u2019s confidence, and corruptly manipulated the foreign exchange market to benefit themselves and their bank,\u201d said the US assistant attorney general Leslie Caldwell. \u201cThis case demonstrates the [US Department of Justice\u2019s] criminal division\u2019s commitment to hold corporate executives, including at the world\u2019s largest and most sophisticated institutions, responsible for their crimes.\u201d Johnson, 50, who lives in both London and New York, and Scott, 43, who lives in London, are alleged to have \u201cplaced personal profits ahead of their duties of trust and confidentiality owed to their client, and in doing so, defrauded their client of millions of dollars\u201d. The men are accused of making $3m profit by fraudulently trading currencies in advance of a client buying $3.4bn of pounds sterling in 2011, according to the complaint. They are accused of buying sterling in advance of the client\u2019s transaction in a manner \u201cdesigned to spike the price\u201d to the benefit of HSBC \u201cand at the expense of their client\u201d. They also billed their client for $5m in fees for their work. Johnson and Scott are accused of weaving a \u201cweb of lies\u201d when the client questioned them about the higher price they were forced to pay to bring back proceeds from an overseas transaction to the UK. \u201cWhen questioned by their client about the higher price paid for their significant transaction, the defendants wove a web of lies designed to conceal the truth and divert attention away from their fraudulent trades,\u201d said the US attorney Robert Capers. \u201cThe charges and arrest announced today reflect our steadfast commitment to hold accountable corporate executives and licensed professionals who use their positions to fraudulently enrich themselves.\u201d Paul Abbate, the FBI\u2019s top official in Washington, said: \u201cThese individuals are accused of defrauding clients by misusing confidential information to manipulate currency prices for the benefit of the bank and themselves. The FBI will continue to work aggressively with our partners to prevent, investigate and prosecute criminal fraud in the financial markets.\u201d Rob Sherman, a spokesman for HSBC, said: \u201cHSBC has been and continues to cooperate with the DOJ\u2019s FX investigation.\u201d The justice department is conducting a criminal investigation into some global banks\u2019 alleged currency manipulation, and more than two dozen traders have been suspended by their employers. Last year, four banks pleaded guilty to conspiracy to rig the forex market and fines totalling $5.6bn were handed down to six banks. HSBC was not included in the settlement deal. The banks who agreed the settlement - Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, Citigroup and JP Morgan Chase - described themselves as \u201cthe Cartel\u201d and used secret chatrooms and coded language to manipulate benchmark exchange rates to make huge profits. The FBI said the scheme was criminal \u201con a massive scale\u201d. According to transcripts of the chatroom, published by the New York department of financial services (DFS), one Barclays trader in 2010 wrote: \u201cIf you aint cheating, you aint trying.\u201d Last year, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) fined five banks \u00a31.1bn \u2013 the biggest penalty in the history of the City of London \u2013 for failing to stop their traders manipulating the market. \u201cToday\u2019s record fines mark the gravity of the failings we found, and firms need to take responsibility for putting it right,\u201d the FCA CEO, Martin Wheatley, said at the time. In March, the UK Serious Fraud Office said that after reviewing more than half a million documents, it had concluded there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction. At the time, the fraud-busting agency said it was continuing to liaise with the US Department of Justice over its investigation, which had involved help from a number of regulatory bodies, including the FCA and the Competition and Markets Authority, as well as the City of London police. The SFO had not identified the firms or individuals it had investigated. It was revealed earlier this month that George Osborne, the former chancellor, intervened to persuade the US government not to pursue criminal charges against HSBC for allowing terrorists and Mexican drug dealers to launder millions of dollars. A congressional report published letters and emails from Osborne and Financial Services Authority (FSA) officials to their US counterparts warning that launching criminal action against HSBC in 2012 could have sparked a \u201cfinancial calamity\u201d. The House financial services committee report said the UK interventions \u201cplayed a significant role in ultimately persuading the DoJ [Department of Justice] not to prosecute HSBC\u201d. Instead of pursuing a prosecution, the bank agreed to pay a record $1.92bn (\u00a31.4bn) fine.",

                "bodyText":"That\u2019s a good moment to wrap up for the day, and indeed the week. Here\u2019s our full news story about the worrying slide in UK business confidence, activity and new orders this month: We\u2019ll be back next week with more rolling coverage of the twists and turns in the economy, the financial markets and more. Thanks, and have a good weekend. GW Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, fears that the UK economy might be in even worse shape than the PMI show. That\u2019s because today\u2019s \u2018flash\u2019 survey doesn\u2019t include the construction industry, which has probably also taken a Brexit hit. The full PMIs, released in a couple of weeks, will give a fuller picture. Larry adds: The abrupt and large fall in both orders and output reported by IHS Markit and the CIPS clearly makes a recession in the second half of 2016 a real risk. Similar results for August and September would suggest a 0.4% contraction in the economy in the third quarter. It only takes two successive quarters of contraction to constitute a technical recession. More here: Newsflash from America: The US manufacturing sector has grown at its fastest pace in a year, suggesting the Brexit vote has not caused any problems. The US manufacturing PMI has jumped to 52.9, from 51.3 in June, the highest figure since last October (any figure over 5o shows growth). Quite a contrast with the UK\u2019s manufacturing PMI, which dived from 52.1 in June to just 49.1 this month. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll all score full marks on our new Brexit quiz..... It\u2019s now a month since the UK\u2019s EU referendum, so my colleague Martin Belam has taken a look at the economic, financial and social impact of that historic vote: And Ben Chu of the Independent has calculated that the taxpayer\u2019s stake in two British banks has shrunk by \u00a36bn: Shadow chancellor John McDonnell says the government needs to take action now to combat the slowdown gripping the UK economy. Speaking on Sky News, McDonnell says Philip Hammond shouldn\u2019t wait until the autumn statement to scrap the government\u2019s fiscal plans. I think he needs to get back here now, scrap the fiscal framework that is failing at the moment, and start the investment that is needed. Right now, government departments are pausing investment decisions and implementing austerity measures, at a time when the economy needs more help, McDonnell adds. And finally... Oops, Faisal hadn\u2019t finished explaining the wonders of the PMI report.... Back to the grim UK PMI report... and Faisal Islam of Sky News has tweeted why this survey is worth taking seriously: It\u2019s also worth noting that Markit survey purchasing managers at over 1,200 UK firms each month; this is a serious report. Christine Lagarde\u2019s lawyer says she is confident of proving her innocence over the Tapie case. Breaking news from France: The head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, has lost her final attempt to avoid appearing in court over a long-running financial scandal. Reuters has the details: France\u2019s highest appeals court ruled on Friday that IMF chief Christine Lagarde must stand trial for her role in a \u20ac400m payout as French finance minister in 2008 to businessman Bernard Tapie. The court rejected her appeal against a judge\u2019s order in December for her to stand trial at the Cour de Justice de la Repulique, a special court that tries ministers for crimes in office. Here\u2019s some background on the Tapie affair: Some mild optimism from the Resolution Group\u2019s Duncan Weldon: Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at City firm Monex Europe, also fears that Britain is heading into recession. Here\u2019s his take on this morning\u2019s PMI survey: \u201cThe report makes for grim reading and suggests that the shock to the economy will be severe compared to others on record. Composite Output and New Orders, which include data for other sectors of the economy, registered their steepest ever recorded falls. Although an increase in manufacturing export business offers a ray of hope, it\u2019s difficult to see how this report points to anything other than a recession in the immediate future. \u201cThe question now is just how deep and sustained this slump in output will prove. With services activity and new orders falling at their quickest rate in seven years the risk of businesses delaying investment and hiring is very significant. If the slump is extended or worsens into August and July, even the reduced forecasts we\u2019ve recently seen for growth in 2016 will start to look optimistic. Sky News\u2019s economics editor Ed Conway has collared chancellor Philip Hammond in China, and got him to comment on today\u2019s PMI survey. Hammond says the PMI shows that business sentiment has suffered from the Brexit vote. It tells us that people\u2019s confidence, businesses\u2019 confidence has been dented. They\u2019re not sure, there\u2019re in a position of uncertainty now. Our job is to restore as much certainty as we can, as quickly as we can. That means reaching agreements with European partners, and also striking deals with other countries such as China, the chancellor says. [reminder: He\u2019s hoping to drum up some investment opportunities during his trip to Beijing, before arriving at the G20 meeting of finance ministers and central bankers this weekend]. Philip Hammond also repeated that he could \u201creset fiscal policy\u201d in the autumn statement later this year, once the government has a clearer picture of the UK economy after the Brexit vote. We are clear that we are going to support the economy over this period, so we can take advantage of the opportunities that the referendum gives us in the medium and long term. The pound is sliding deeper into the red, as investors digest the news that Britain\u2019s companies have suffered their worst month since the financial crisis. Sterling is now down 1% against the US dollar at $1.31, down from $1.323 overnight. Some traders are pricing in a cut in UK interest rates in August, and perhaps a wide-ranging stimulus package to help the economy. Encouragingly, Markit also found that companies become less gloomy as July unfolded. The rapid political changes that saw Theresa May installed as prime minister last week may have reassure business leaders, according to Markit\u2019s Chris Williamson. The slump in the UK PMI, from 52.4 to just 47.7, shows that UK businesses are gripped by Brexit uncertainty. Zach Witton, deputy chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, says Westminster needs to take action, fast. \u201cThe very sharp pause in activity indicates that manufacturers have reacted to the shock of the referendum result by adopting a wait-and-see approach. A key question is how long this will be sustained, as a failure to restart activity will have implications for their appetite for investment and recruitment, and thus have an implication for the real economy. The uncertainty surrounding the outlook for manufacturing highlights that there is potential for the Government to shore up confidence in the coming months.\u201d It\u2019s not ALL bad news, though. UK manufacturers have reported the biggest jump in new exports in two years, Markit says. That suggests the slump in the pound since the referendum is providing a boost, making exports more competitive: Perhaps the most alarming part of today\u2019s survey is that service sector companies are extremely downbeat about economic prospects. Markit\u2019s business expectations index has slumped by its largest amount on record, back to levels last seen during the financial crisis: This implies service sector firms will be cautious about taking on new staff or launching new projects in the coming months. Today\u2019s report is vindication for those Remain campaigners who warned against Brexit, argues journalist Sunny Hundal: Markit\u2019s PMI surveys have undermined the notion that the rest of Europe would suffer as badly as the UK from the Brexit vote. While Britain appears to be shrinking, France\u2019s economy was quite resilient and German private sector growth hit its highest level of the year (see earlier post). Ferdinando Giugliano of the La Republica newspaper tweets the key numbers: Joshua Mahony, Market Analyst at IG, reckons Europe is actually benefitting from the uncertainty: Today has shown a stark contrast between Eurozone and UK economic fortunes in the wake of the EU referendum, with the negative impact felt after the vote largely isolated to the UK. There is perhaps a feeling amongst the likes of France and German that the vote is a case of the UK shooting itself in the foot, with a significant amount of business expected to leave the UK in favour of Frankfurt, Paris and Dublin. There is no surprise that the eurozone services PMI readings have shown particular strength, with the French services sector taking on extra staff to the greatest extent since 2008 as UK based firms look to become less London centric. Jake Trask, currency analyst at UKForex, also fears that Britain is heading into recession. \u201cThe first clear evidence of the economic damage done by the UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU was shown today. The Flash UK Services PMI missed the target by some distance, posting a worrying 47.4 \u2013 far lower than the 49 expected by economists. \u201cThe figure was the worst since April 2009, when the country was still shaken by the fallout from the global financial crisis. Chris Leslie MP, a former shadow chancellor, has called for MPs on both sides of the House of Commons to pay attention to the PMI survey: This chart shows just how quickly the UK economy has gone into reverse this month; in the biggest one-month fall ever: (50 is the cut-off point between growth and contraction) Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says the UK PMI survey is \u201ctruly abysmal\u201d, and suggests that the EU referendum vote has - as feared - hit the economy. \u201cToday\u2019s super-weak PMI is the first hard evidence that Brexit has already had an impact on the UK economy. There was a sharp fall in activity in July and it now looks like the Bank of England has the data it needs to launch fresh easing at its next meeting at the start of August. Quite simply, the UK economy contracted at the fastest pace since the start of 2009, when the global financial crisis plunged us into recession. The readings suggest we are heading for a recession again and it is almost certain the BoE will pull the trigger on aggressive stimulus to boost aggregate demand. Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics says today\u2019s PMI report is \u2018woeful\u2019, and should prompt the Bank of England to cut interest rates. Rupert Harrison of investment management group Blackrock is also concerned (Harrison is a former advisor to chancellor George Osborne) Reuters\u2019 Jamie McGeever says Britain appears to be heading into recession: The pound has fallen by over half a cent against the US dollar, as traders react to the news that Britain\u2019s economy appears to be shrinking. It\u2019s dropped from $1.323 to $1.317. David Noble, CEO at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, says Markit\u2019s report paints a pretty worrying picture. He also warns that the weak pound has driven up the cost of imported materials: \u201cThe UK economy has suffered sharp falls in output and new orders following the EU referendum as uncertainty has taken hold. The overall pace of decline was the strongest since early-2009. \u201cWeaker sterling has driven a steep rise in input prices for manufacturers but there is a glimmer of positivity with the new exchange rate encouraging a rise in export orders. However, with a subdued global economy, it is not yet clear whether these opportunities will materialise in the long term. This chart shows how British services and manufacturing have both suffered a plunge in output this month: Breaking: Britain\u2019s economy is shrinking at the fastest pace since the financial crisis, as the Brexit vote hits confidence and spending. Data firm Markit reports that services and manufacturing sectors have both suffered a big hit this month. They are contracting at the fastest pace since 2009, as output and new orders fall across the sector. Many firms blamed uncertainty caused by June\u2019s EU referendum. It suggests that the UK economy is shrinking, at a quarterly rate of 0.4%. Markit economist Chris Williamson says: \u201cJuly saw a dramatic deterioration in the economy, with business activity slumping at the fastest rate since the height of the global financial crisis in early-2009. \u201cThe downturn, whether manifesting itself in order book cancellations, a lack of new orders or the postponement or halting of projects, was most commonly attributed in one way or another to \u2018Brexit\u2019. Here\u2019s the details (any reading below 50 shows a contraction): Flash UK PMI Composite Output Index at 47.7 (52.4 in June). 87-month low. Flash UK Services PMI Activity Index at 47.4 (52.3 in June). 88-month low. Flash UK Manufacturing PMI at 49.1 (52.1 in June). 41-month low. Flash UK Manufacturing PMI Output Index at 49.1 (52.9 in June). 40-month low. Reaction to follow.... The City is on tenterhooks, as we await Markit\u2019s first healthcheck on the UK economy since the Brexit vote.... Despite Germany\u2019s robust performance, eurozone growth has edged down to its lowest in one-and-a-half year low in July. That\u2019s the verdict from Markit\u2019s \u2018flash\u2019 assessment of the euro economy, which has dropped to 52.9 this month from 53.1 in June. That still shows growth, but at the slowest rate since January 2015. Markit\u2019s Chris Williamson says the eurozone was \u201csurprisingly resilient\u201d, but is concerned that the Brexit vote has caused some damage: Business confidence about the outlook in the service sector has deteriorated to the worst for just over one-and-a-half years, linked primarily to the political and economic instability induced by the UK referendum, pointing to near-term downside risks for an already-lacklustre eurozone economy. \u201cPolicymakers will be reassured by the resilience of the PMI in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote, but the fragility of the recovery leaves plenty of room for speculation about further stimulus later in the year.\u201d Economist Rupert Seggins shows the key points: UK property company shares are sliding this morning. Upmarket London estate agent Foxtons have shed almost 5%, and rival real estate firm Countrywide have tumbled almost 8%. That\u2019s partly due to LSL Property\u2019s Brexit-induced profit warning this morning. But it\u2019s also triggered by a survey from Hometrack, showing that London will bear the brunt of the property slowdown. Back in the UK.... supermarket chain Sainsbury has been given the green light to take control of the Argos chain. Here\u2019s an audio clip of chancellor Philip Hammond revealing that he might \u2018reset\u2019 UK fiscal policy this autumn. Thanks to my colleague Matthew Weaver, who is running our Politics Live blog today: This morning\u2019s economic data is a case of \u2018so far, so good\u2019, with Germany\u2019s private sector growing at its fastest pace this year. Germany\u2019s private sector has shrugged off the Brexit shock. Market\u2019s German PMI reports, just released, show that manufacturers and service companies kept growing this month - faster than expected. Ouch! Shares in UK property firm LSL have slumped by a fifth after it warned that the Brexit vote will hit its profits this year. LSL, which owns the Your Move chain, has told the City that trading slowed in the run-up to the referendum, and has worsened since as consumer uncertainty has increased. It no longer expects to hit its targets this year, and warns that full year group operating profit will be \u201csignificantly lower\u201d than previously expected. Shares have tumbled by 21% in early trading. The first of today\u2019s PMI surveys are out...and they show that France\u2019s private sector was flat this month, after shrinking a little in June. The French composite PMI rose to 50.0in July - the point separating expansion and contraction - up from 49.6 in June. Markit chief economist Chris Williamson says it\u2019s a decent figure, given everything France has been through recently: \u201cIn the face of the terrorist attack [in Nice] and the Brexit vote, to have the index coming up to 50.0 in a stable economy is perhaps a good result.\u201d Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics fears that today\u2019s UK PMIs will show Britain\u2019s economy is contracting this month. IMF chief Christine Lagarde has called for the uncertainty surrounding Britain\u2019s Brexit vote to be removed as soon as possible. Speaking to reporters after meeting China\u2019s Premier Li Keqiang, Lagarde also blamed the EU referendum for making the IMF downgrade its global growth forecasts this week. Chancellor Philip Hammond has dropped a clear hint that he\u2019ll tear up his predecessor\u2019s tax and spending plans. During his first overseas visit since becoming Britain\u2019s finance minister, Hammond said that he might have to \u201creset\u201d fiscal policy when he delivers the autumn statement later this year. The scale of such a \u2018reset\u2019 will depend on how Britain\u2019s economy responds to the Brexit vote. George Osborne\u2019s goal of a budget surplus by the end of the parliament already appears doomed. Hammond is planning to use his China trip to promote British business opportunities, especially the City. He\u2019ll be telling his hosts that Britain is still open for business. We\u2019ll get the first clear glimpse of how Britain\u2019s economy has fared since the EU referendum this morning. Markit\u2019s Purchasing Managers Index survey, due at 9.30am, will show if UK manufacturers, construction firms and services companies expanded or contracted in the last few weeks. The PMI measures activity, output and employment levels, and economists fear they will show the UK economy took a hit after the surprise win for the Leave campaign. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets explains: Markit is releasing a special one-off \u2018flash\u2019 version of the July UK PMIs today based on ~70% of the normal responses. The UK PMIs were already drifting lower even ahead of the referendum. Now they are expected to dip below the breakeven level of 50. In the case of services, that would be the first contractionary reading since late 2012. But...the initial response may evolve as respondents get more political certainty. We will need to see the August PMI surveys in early September to get a more definitive view of the impact on UK activity. Ipek Ozkardeskaya of London Capital Group warns that the pound could take a hit, if he PMIs are disappointing: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s lots on the agenda to keep us busy today. First up, MPs have delivered a withering verdict on Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct empire, warning that conditions are more suited to a Victorian workhouse than a 21st century retail chain. Eight months after a Guardian investigation, the business, innovation and skills (BIS) select committee concluded that Ashley treated his workers like commodities, not human beings. They condemned the company\u2019s \u2018six strikes and you\u2019re out\u2019 policy, and the use of thousands of zero-hour contracts which left staff in a precarious state. It\u2019s a pretty devastating verdict on Ashley, who admitted to MPs last month that Sports Direct had failed to pay the minimum wage due to searching staff in their own time. Luke Primarolo, the regional officer at Unite, says other companies have lessons to learn too: \u201cSports Direct is by no means the only company to engage people on such terms. What this highlights is a wider issue of real work today. The government needs to seriously consider what legislation needs to be put in place to protect people from exploitation.\u201d Here\u2019s the full story: Second, finance ministers and central bankers have headed to China for a G20 meeting. Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union will be high on the agenda. Philip Hammond, the UK\u2019s new chancellor, is holding meetings with his Chinese counterparts right now. Thirdly, we get new PMI surveys showing the state of the European economy this month. Excitingly, this will include a rare \u2018flash\u2019 assessment of Britain\u2019s private sector in the first few weeks after the Brexit vote. Here\u2019s the timings: 8am: French flash PMI for July 9.30am: German flash PMI for July 9am: Eurozone flash PMI for July 9.30am: UK flash PMI for July European markets are expected to take a breather, as investors ponder whether central banks will deliver more stimulus to fight a downturn.",

It\u2019s possible that shoppers have realised that, regardless of the signs hanging from the ceiling and the posters in the windows, everything still costs exactly what it did just under a month ago.</p> <p>I spend a mind-numbingly dull shift folding towels to help maintain the illusion that the place is still a fully functioning department store, rather than a shambolic jumble sale. While there appears to be an abundance of goods, many of our popular lines are almost sold out and the gaps are filled with items of dubious appeal that have been languishing unsold elsewhere in the building for months or even years. Damaged items have started appearing on the shelves, as well as other interesting storeroom discoveries, such as toilet brushes without brushes, handles or lids. These have not proved a big seller. <br></p> <h2><strong>Wednesday 29 June</strong></h2> <p>Everything in the lighting department is now for sale at 50% of its actual original value. I spend four hours alone in the menswear department, unpacking boxes of garish shorts and placing them on hangers. It is a new low point.</p> <p>Since the company collapsed, the administrators have cut day-to-day running costs by, among other things, no longer paying the royalty fees required to play music over the shop speakers. The deafening silence somehow makes what is already a fairly depressing atmosphere considerably worse. It was previously possible to gauge, to some extent, the financial health of BHS through the music that was played in its stores. When I first started in late 2007, it was a mix of contemporary chart stuff along with golden oldies. Shortly before the first wave of rumours began circulating that Green was looking to offload the company, the playlist switched to almost entirely forgotten 80s pop songs (Howard Jones, anyone?). I surmised that they were all songs over 30 years old upon which the copyright had probably expired. This continued until Chappell took over. The big-name chart songs returned to the playlist for a while, only to be replaced shortly before we went into administration with amateurish atrocities performed by people who I would imagine describe themselves as \u201csemi-professional musicians\u201d.</p> <p>Now, in the silence, I listen to customers moan that they can\u2019t find anything they want to buy or that everything\u2019s overpriced, while in the same breath saying how sad they are that we\u2019re closing down....</p> <p>Here\u2019s the full piece:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DanMilmo/status/757580543127121922\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Diary of a BHS worker: \u2018If there were a Dignitas for department stores, I would make the call\u2019 <a href=\"https://t.co/IEs4o2cySY\">https://t.co/IEs4o2cySY</a></p>&mdash; Dan Milmo (@DanMilmo) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DanMilmo/status/757580543127121922\">July 25, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-579619abe4b0f04cc9866dc4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-25T14:07:06.764Z\">3.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Petition to remove Green's knighthood hits 50,000 signatures</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>A petition calling for the removal of Sir Philip Green\u2019s knighthood is gaining support fast.</strong></p> <p>More than 50,000 people have now signed up, almost all today, with around 450 people joining each minute.</p> <p><a href=\"https://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/strip-philip-green-of-his-knighthood\">The petition, hosted by the 38 Degrees campaign site</a>, calls on the Honours Committee to act unless Green returns all the money he made from BHS.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a896b0891e44568acdafb9d00bf14249a7c03004\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a896b0891e44568acdafb9d00bf14249a7c03004/0_0_699_596/500.jpg\" alt=\"Online petition calling for Sir Philip Green to lose his knighthood\" width=\"500\" height=\"426\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Spokesman Luke Ilott of 38 Degrees says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cPhilip Green got rich at the expense of thousands of people working on the shop floor - but now thousands of BHS staff have had their pension pot wiped out and face an uncertain future.</p> <p>\u201cWhen Britain decorates people like Philip Green with awards and honours, it says to the world that they\u2019re someone worthy of respect.

                "bodyText":"That\u2019s a good moment to wrap up for the day. Here\u2019s a brief reminder of the key points. Sir Philip Green is under mounting pressures after a parliamentary report into the collapse of BHS was released. MPS accused him of \u2018systematically\u2019 taking money out of the company, failing to address its pension deficit, and generally acting in a way incompatible with a man with a knighthood for services to retail. Frank Field, who co-chaired the inquiry, raised the stakes by claiming that Green was more egregious than Robert Maxwell, who raided the Mirror Group pension fund more than two decades ago. Field told the Today Programme that: Unlike Maxwell, who was bankrupt when he threw himself off his boat [in 1991], this person [Green] has wealth beyond the dreams of avarice, and he should act. Field also compared Green to Napoleon, saying he ignored advice from colleagues and advisers and is most culpable for the collapse of BHS (which he sold last year). Theresa May, Britain\u2019s new prime minister, has signalled that she wants to reform capitalism and stamp out irresponsible corporate behaviour after the scandal. Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron and Labour leadership candidate Owen Smith have both called for Green to lose his knighthood. Bookmaker Paddy Power reckon Green is odds-on to lose his knighthood by the end of 2017. A petition calling for it to be revoked is attracting hundreds of new signatures per minute (57k and counting...). But Green isn\u2019t the only one under fire. Dominic Chappell, who bought BHS last year, was accused of having his hands in the till by MPs. The Institute of Directors has weighed in, criticising City grandee Lord Grabiner for his failings as chairman to Green\u2019s Arcadia Group. And in other news.... Business optimism in the UK has slumped by the most since 2009, as manufacturers are hit by uncertainty over the EU referendum. The TUC union has urged the government to act immediately, before workers lose their jobs in a wave of Brexit worries. And the main corporate news is that Yahoo\u2019s long decline has ended in a takeover by Verizon: Here\u2019s the rest of the day\u2019s key developments: A BHS worker has lifted the lid on conditions at the retail chain since it fell into administration last month. It\u2019s a pretty depressing tale of plummeting morale, gnawing uncertainty, dwindling stocks and some baffling products emerging from the company\u2019s stores as its decline continues. Here\u2019s a couple of highlights: Friday 17 June The store is much busier than it was a few months go, but the initial buzz that followed BHS falling into administration in April has died down. It\u2019s possible that shoppers have realised that, regardless of the signs hanging from the ceiling and the posters in the windows, everything still costs exactly what it did just under a month ago. I spend a mind-numbingly dull shift folding towels to help maintain the illusion that the place is still a fully functioning department store, rather than a shambolic jumble sale. While there appears to be an abundance of goods, many of our popular lines are almost sold out and the gaps are filled with items of dubious appeal that have been languishing unsold elsewhere in the building for months or even years. Damaged items have started appearing on the shelves, as well as other interesting storeroom discoveries, such as toilet brushes without brushes, handles or lids. These have not proved a big seller. Wednesday 29 June Everything in the lighting department is now for sale at 50% of its actual original value. I spend four hours alone in the menswear department, unpacking boxes of garish shorts and placing them on hangers. It is a new low point. Since the company collapsed, the administrators have cut day-to-day running costs by, among other things, no longer paying the royalty fees required to play music over the shop speakers. The deafening silence somehow makes what is already a fairly depressing atmosphere considerably worse. It was previously possible to gauge, to some extent, the financial health of BHS through the music that was played in its stores. When I first started in late 2007, it was a mix of contemporary chart stuff along with golden oldies. Shortly before the first wave of rumours began circulating that Green was looking to offload the company, the playlist switched to almost entirely forgotten 80s pop songs (Howard Jones, anyone?). I surmised that they were all songs over 30 years old upon which the copyright had probably expired. This continued until Chappell took over. The big-name chart songs returned to the playlist for a while, only to be replaced shortly before we went into administration with amateurish atrocities performed by people who I would imagine describe themselves as \u201csemi-professional musicians\u201d. Now, in the silence, I listen to customers moan that they can\u2019t find anything they want to buy or that everything\u2019s overpriced, while in the same breath saying how sad they are that we\u2019re closing down.... Here\u2019s the full piece: A petition calling for the removal of Sir Philip Green\u2019s knighthood is gaining support fast. More than 50,000 people have now signed up, almost all today, with around 450 people joining each minute. The petition, hosted by the 38 Degrees campaign site, calls on the Honours Committee to act unless Green returns all the money he made from BHS. Spokesman Luke Ilott of 38 Degrees says: \u201cPhilip Green got rich at the expense of thousands of people working on the shop floor - but now thousands of BHS staff have had their pension pot wiped out and face an uncertain future. \u201cWhen Britain decorates people like Philip Green with awards and honours, it says to the world that they\u2019re someone worthy of respect. This petition shows that thousands of people think raiding thousands of pension pots is not worthy of a knighthood. It\u2019s time the government listened.\u201d Reminder: the MPs who investigated the BHS collapse found \u201clittle to support the reputation for retail business acumen for which he received his knighthood\u201d.... Lord Kerslake, who chaired the Honours Forfeiture Committee when it stripped banker Fred Goodwin of his knighthood in 2012, has said Sir Philip\u2019s Green honour is now at risk. Asked about the situation on BBC Radio 4\u2019s World At One, he said (via PA): \u201cMy personal view is that there is a case to be answered here. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t prejudge the outcome of the process, but I think there is enough on the record now about what has happened in the case of BHS to justify the issue being examined.\u201d A disgraced business chief and his knighthood are soon parted, as we saw with Sir Fred Goodwin after the banking crisis. And Paddy Power, the bookmaker, reckon Sir Philip Green is odds-on to lose his honour within 18 months, following the criticism in today\u2019s report. They also see little chance that the Arcadia chief will put his hand into his pocket to fully cover the pension black hole. Here\u2019s their latest odds: 4/6 To have his knighthood revoked by end of 2017 8/1 To buy a new yacht for over \u00a3100m in 2017 12/1 To sell his yacht, Lionheart, by the end of 2017 12/1 To cover BHS\u2019 \u00a3571million pensions black hole by paying personal funds to PPF by end of 2017 66/1 To be bankrupt by end of 2017 Sir Philip Green isn\u2019t entirely without support today.... The Institute of Directors has singled out Arcadia\u2019s board for particular criticism, for failing to keep Philip Green in hand. Oliver Parry, Head of Corporate Governance at the Institute of Directors, said: Green\u2019s swashbuckling spirit may have helped him build a large retail empire but, once he reached the top, he does not seem to have taken to heart what responsibility for this number of staff, and pensioners, means. \u201cThis made the failure of his board, and the Chairman, Lord Grabiner, all the more disappointing. Non-executive directors are there to rein in the excesses of executives and protect the company\u2019s long-term sustainability, including its reputation. In this light, the board\u2019s lack of oversight of the sale of BHS to Dominic Chappel is staggering. Grabiner is an experienced barrister and a senior City figure. But today\u2019s report is unsparing, saying he was \u201ccomplacent\u201d, and had failed to provide the independent challenge and oversight needed. This slump in UK business confidence is the second piece of worrying economy news since the EU referendum. Last Friday, data firm Markit reported that businesses were suffering falling output and orders, suggesting the economy is shrinking at the fastest rate since 2009. Danielle Haralambous of the Economist Intelligence Unit has mapped both surveys onto one graph; it\u2019s pretty worrying: The TUC is alarmed by this morning\u2019s slump in business confidence (details here). General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says the government needs to take action now, to protect workers from the impact of June\u2019s referendum: \u201cThe TUC has published an action plan to secure jobs and investment. The government must give the go-ahead for a third runway at Heathrow, bring forward major new infrastructure projects like high-speed rail and announce a big expansion in housebuilding.\u201d It\u2019s official.... US telecoms group Verizon has snapped up Yahoo\u2019s internet business for just $4.8bn. It\u2019s the end of a 21-year saga, which once saw Yahoo valued at more than $125bn in 2000 (just before the dot-com bubble spectacularly imploded). CEO Marissa Mayer says he\u2019s planning to say at the company. Her four-year tenure at Yahoo can\u2019t really be described as a success, although turning the one-time Web pioneer around was always a massive task. Labour MP Jon Trickett argues that the BHS scandal goes well beyond Sir Philip Green. (but agrees that he should lose his gong). \u201cThe Select Committee\u2019s damning report shows how Phillip Green extracted millions from BHS over 15 years and then sold it to a bankruptee who went on to receive further millions from the company. \u201cBut a range of well-known accountancy, banking and other companies who had a duty to provide professional independent advice failed to prevent the actions described in the report. \u201cThis left 11,000 loyal hard-working people without a job and a massive pension deficit. No one should be allowed to keep a knighthood after such actions. He must also pay back the millions of pounds to the pension fund. Trickett is pushing for an \u201cimmediate and thorough review\u201d of corporate governance, including professional advisors. Today\u2019s report found that advisers were paraded as an \u201cexpensive badge of legitimacy\u201d for Dominic Chappell\u2019s RAL group, which wouldn\u2019t otherwise have passed muster. Here\u2019s the full quote from Labour\u2019s Owen Smith: \u201cThese reports expose the level of incompetence and corporate irresponsibility at the heart of BHS\u2019s leadership. \u201cSir Philip Green\u2019s greed has costs thousands of people their jobs and put tens of thousands of people\u2019s pensions at risk. Despite this, Sir Philip has shown no contrition for the damage he has done or the suffering he has caused. \u201cThe Tories should take immediate action to hold Sir Philip Green to account, starting with stripping him of his knighthood and making sure he makes a proper contributions to cover the blackhole in the current pension fund.\u201d The BHS scandal rumbles on, with Labour leadership challenger Owen Smith joining the chorus calling for Sir Philip Green to lose that knighthood: The CBI also found that manufacturers are pretty gloomy about prospects over the next few months. New orders expectations are at their lowest in over four years, and more firms expect to cut staff in the next quarter than hire more. Here\u2019s the details: Total new orders are expected to be flat (0%), the lowest balance since January 2012 (-2%). Domestic orders are also anticipated to be broadly flat (+1%) A balance of +10% expect export orders to rise (21% expect an increase, and 11% a fall) 19% of businesses anticipate a rise in output volumes, and 12% a fall, giving a rounded balance of +6% 14% expect employment to increase, and 20% expect it to decline, giving a balance of -6% More here: Manufacturing prospects muted after Brexit \u2013 CBI Here\u2019s some instant reaction to the tumble in UK business confidence: Breaking away from BHS.... a new survey has shown that confidence among UK manufacturers has slumped sharply to a six-year low. The CBIs monthly industrial trends survey found that just 5% of firms are more optimistic about the general business situation than three months ago, but 52% are less optimistic. That gives a balance of -47% -- the lowest figure since January 2009 (the depths of the financial crisis) Firms also reported that export orders have fallen this month, despite the weaker pound. The CBI says: Total order books were broadly the same as in June (-4%, from -2% in June) but export order books deteriorated (-22%, from -14% in June). Rain Newton-Smith, CBI Chief Economist, blamed uncertainty following last month\u2019s referendum: It\u2019s clear that a cloud of uncertainty is hovering over industry, post-Brexit. We see this in weak expectations for new orders, a sharp fall in optimism and a scaling back of investment plans. \u201cSo, it\u2019s important now for the new Government to steady the ship with a plan, and a clear timetable, for negotiating the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU. This, along with a renewed focus on industrial strategy, will help give firms the confidence they need to grow and create jobs. BHS\u2019s stores are a pretty depressing place right now, as hopes of a rescue deal continue to fade. These photos from the Wood Green store shows how administrators are cracking on with the closing down process; even putting mannequins up for sale: Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron has called on the Cabinet Office to speed up its review into whether Sir Philip Green should be stripped of his knighthood. He argues that Green simply doesn\u2019t deserve to be honoured: \u201cPhilip Green has exploited his way into filling his own pockets. It is clear that he tore off pieces of BHS to fund his lavish lifestyle at the expense of the business and those people who had put their lives into making the company a success. \u201c11,000 people are now significantly worse off because of one man\u2019s greed. \u201cIt cannot be acceptable for him to be sailing around in a \u00a3100m super-yacht while the workers he failed are left at the door to the job centre. It\u2019s time HMRC stepped in to ensure he pays the financial contribution he owes to BHS pensioners. \u201cKnighthoods should be saved for the brave and the brilliant. Philip Green has proved that he is neither of those and should be stripped of his title.\u201d John Mann, Labour MP for Bassetlaw, has urged the government to begin the process of removing Sir Philip Green\u2019s knighthood. He argues that prime minister Theresa May must deliver on her pledges to make Britain a fairer country: \u201cIn her first speech as Prime Minister Theresa May stated that her Government would be driven, not by the interests of the privileged few but by yours. She must now clearly show that was not just a soundbite by holding Philip Green to account for his actions and announcing the removal of his knighthood.\u201d \u201cHe left a company in dire circumstances and a pension scheme with a massive deficit of over \u00a3400 million. A very privileged few benefitted from BHS and due to their actions thousands will now be worse off through no fault of their own.\u201d \u201cTheresa May must now order the Cabinet Office and the Honours Committee to investigate Philip Green and strip him of his knighthood. The parliamentary report makes clear he is not fit to be a knight of the realm.\u201d One of the many pieces of evidence uncovered by MPs is a handwritten note, outlining BHS\u2019s balance sheet before the sale to Dominic Chappell. Signed by Chappell and Green, it shows that the company would have \u00a394.16m of working capital - just above the minimum needed \u2013 but also faced looming VAT and national insurance (NI) demands: No wonder the Daily Mail dubs it \u201ca real back of an envelope deal\u201d. My colleague Graham Ruddick reckons Green\u2019s knighthood is on the line: Today\u2019s report finds that Philip Green \u201crepeatedly resisted\u201d requests from the BHS pension trustees to put more money into the fund, to prevent it sliding into a deficit. It says: Such contributions were not charitable donations: they were the means of the employer meeting its obligations for deferred pay. Sir Philip had a responsibility to be aware of the growth of the deficit and he was aware of it. That there is a massive deficit is ultimately his responsibility. BHS isn\u2019t the only UK company facing a pensions black hole, unfortunately. Many other schemes are also in deficit, partly due to the massive rally in government bonds since the financial crisis (which drives down the interest rate you get from them). Tom McPhail, head of retirement policy at financial services Hargreaves Lansdown, says today\u2019s report highlights a wider problem: The report exposes the tensions between shareholder and pension scheme member interests, and poses some important questions about how we manage these tensions for the thousands of other schemes which continue to operate under the shadow of substantial deficits. The immediate future holds some significant threats. The possibility of an economic slowdown and increasing inflation could exacerbate an already unsustainable mismatch between the promises made to some scheme members and the ability of sponsoring employers ever to pay for those promises. There is an urgent need to take a step back and look at how best to meet the competing demands of all the parties involved. This should be an urgent priority for the new Pensions Minister. The government has admitted that more needs to be done to avoid a repeat of the collapse of BHS. A spokesman says: \u201cThis case shows why the Government is determined to tackle corporate irresponsibility and reform capitalism so it works for everyone - not just the privileged few. \u201cToday\u2019s report is very concerning, and the Insolvency Service is now carrying out an accelerated investigation. Job centres are also standing by to provide support and advice to those who were affected. But in the long run we need to do more to prevent this kind of irresponsible and reckless behaviour.\u201d Philip Green is likely to choke on his cornflakes over some of today\u2019s front-page headlines, says retail analyst Nick Bubb: \u201cThe Shaming of Sir Shifty\u201d trumpets the Daily Mail, \u201cSir Philip Green slammed in BHS Report\u201d says CityAM (with a nice photo of a shifty-looking Philip Green), \u201cGreen\u2019s reign at BJHS torn apart by MPs\u201d in the Guardian and \u201cGreen must pay for BHS plunder\u201d says the Telegraph, whilst the Committee\u2019s assertion that Philip Green is \u201cthe unacceptable face of capitalism\u201d is widely repeated. The FT, however, takes a different tack, with the headline \u201cMPs blame Goldman for lending credibility to doomed BHS deal\u201d. The Times highlights that a number of business leaders have criticised Philip Green and, in terms of editorial comment, there are plenty of suggestions that Philip Green should lose his knighthood if he doesn\u2019t make good the BHS pension deficit, eg in the Daily Mail, although there is a thoughtful Business editorial in the Times noting that everybody knew about the good and the bad side of Philip Green back in 2006 when he got his knighthood and that it would be wrong to re-write history. Frank Field agrees that many other people and organisations are also to blame for the demise of BHS. That includes Grant Thornton, Olswang and Goldman Sachs, who were all involved in the fateful sale of BHS to Dominic Chappell in 2015. It also includes City grandee Lord Grabiner who chaired Green\u2019s Arcadia Group. They are also in the dock over the BHS scandal - but \u2018not the same dock\u2019 as Green - for taking the billionaire\u2019s shilling and not speaking out, says Field. The work and pensions committee chair then reiterates his comparison with Robert Maxwell, arguing that: Unlike Maxwell, who was bankrupt when he threw himself off his boat [in 1991], this person [Green] has wealth beyond the dreams of avarice, and he should act. Sir Philip Green is \u201cworse than Robert Maxwell\u201d over his handling of the BHS pension black hole, Frank Field MP claims on the Today Programme. Q: What must Green do to sort BHS out? He keeps saying he\u2019s going to sort it out. He needs to get his chequebook out and write a cheque to cover the huge pensions deficit. Field then argues that Green is more culpable than Robert Maxwell, who famously plundered the pensions of his Mirror Group. Field argues that Green is worse than Maxwell, because he could actually fix the pension deficit. Maxwell, I\u2019ve always thought, meant to pay the money back. He was just going all over the place, borrowing money to keep his companies going. When the music stopped, he had no money. Now, the music has stopped [at BHS], and there\u2019s someone there who\u2019s managed to catapult themselves towards the top of the Sunday Times Rich List. This person has huge amounts of money, unlike Robert Maxwell. If he wishes now to make good that pension deficit to those 22,000 pensioners, he could do it. But he keeps talking about it, but not doing it. Q: So he needs to write a cheque for \u00a3571m? At least that much, Field replies. The pension deficit is still growing... so Green needs to ensure that no-one is worse off. UPDATE: Lawyers for Green later issued a letter disputing Field\u2019s statements, saying they were \u201chighly defamatory and completely false. Our client has never stolen any money from BHS, Arcadia or the pension funds.\u201d Frank Field, chair of the Work and Pensions committee, is laying into Philip Green\u2019s conduct on that Today Programme. Q: How much of this is really down to Philip Green? He took his last dividend in 2004, and BHS was still profitable in 2008 He borrowed billions against BHS and Arcadia, and a large part of that money went through his companies up to Lady Green. He has a huge responsibility here. Field questions Green\u2019s claim that he\u2019d never have sold the company to Dominic Chappell if Goldman Sachs hadn\u2019t vetted him. This was a group of companies that were run by somebody who behaves like Napoleon, who has a collection of people around him who do what he wants. There is no corporate governance, as there would be in a public company. The Financial Times is struck by the criticism of Goldman Sachs in today\u2019s report, for helping Green to sell BHS to Dominic Chappell last year: The FT says: Goldman Sachs has been blamed by MPs for lending a \u201clustre\u201d of credibility to a doomed deal to rescue BHS, the retailer formerly owned by Sir Philip Green which subsequently collapsed with the loss of 11,000 jobs in one of Britain\u2019s biggest corporate failures. The MPs said the bank had been currying favour with its billionaire client by helping Sir Philip pull off the \u201cotherwise questionable\u201d sale, which it branded the \u201cunacceptable face of capitalism\u201d. The MPs are also unimpressed that Goldman said they only offered \u2018preliminary observations\u2019, while they were actually quite closely involved in the deal. \u201cWe regret that Goldman Sachs underplayed to us the nature and extent of their role. Over in the City, shares in William Hill have surged by 11% after rival bookmaker 888 made a preliminary takeover approach. Dave Gill, national officer at the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers (USDAW) trade union, has discussed the report on Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme. Q: This report must make the grimmest of grim reading for BHS\u2019s workers? It\u2019s a damning report. The consequences of the actions of a handful of people running BHS is now being felt by 11,000 hard working, dedicated and loyal staff. Q: Is there any progress in finding a buyer for BHS? It\u2019s still ongoing. 20 stores closed last Saturday, and 30 are due to close next Saturday. We\u2019re in constant contact with the administrators, and they are still looking for buyers for another 120 stores. Q: Could the mistakes made at BHS be occurring at other UK companies? I hope not, not to the level at BHS. But I hope the government will take this report on board and learn from it. Q: Is it an acceptable quid pro quo if Green comes up with the money to fix the pension black hole and thus keeps his knighthood? Whether he keeps his knighthood or not isn\u2019t relevant from our point of view.... The issue for people who work at BHS now is the pension deficit, and their employment. The BHS scandal has tarnished the reputation of British business, according to Iain Wright, chair of the BIS committee (which co-produced the report). Writing in the Daily Mirror, Wright calls for a shake-up of ethics and accountability to avoid a repeat. Here\u2019s a flavour: Just a few weeks on from his rude, unprofessional and bad-tempered appearance at our inquiry, Sir Philip has been pictured on board his multi-million pound superyacht. Back in Britain, the demise of BHS has left a trail of destruction of job losses, squeezed pensions and uncertain futures for companies reliant on the once great retailer\u2019s supply chain. Sir Philip spent years at the helm of BHS slashing costs and selling assets, while sending handsome dividends offshore and failing to invest sufficiently in the company. He was then able to dump like rubbish the business - and with it his responsibilities to workers and pensioners \u2013 to the twice-bankrupt chancer Dominic Chappell who had no experience of retail. The BHS report is the lead story on many of Britain\u2019s newspapers today: You can read the full parliamentary report into the failure of BHS here: Leadership failures and personal greed led to collapse of BHS Here\u2019s a flavour of its damning verdict: The report documents the systematic plunder of BHS at the cost of the 11,000 jobs and 20,000 people\u2019s pensions now at risk. Sir Philip Green, Dominic Chappell and the respective directors, advisers and hangers-on who all got rich or richer are all culpable, with the only losers the ordinary employees and pensioners. The Committees say this is \u201cthe unacceptable face of capitalism\u201d and that the story of BHS begs much wider questions about the gaps in company law and pension regulation that must be addressed. The two Committees will now turn to those question in new inquiries. And turning to the Green family*, the MPs say: The headline figures that Sir Philip bought BHS for \u00a3200 million and sold it 14 years later for \u00a31 cannot disguise the true picture. He did not invest in the company and then unfortunately fail to make it succeed. Sir Philip systematically extracted hundreds of millions of pounds from BHS, paying very little tax and fantastically enriching himself and his family, leaving the company and its pension fund weakened to the point of the inevitable collapse of both. Lady Tina Green is still being paid tens of millions of pounds of tax free repayments on the loan that was engineered to sell BHS from one Green family business to another, and will be for some years to come. * - Lady Tina, Philip\u2019s wife, is the Monaco-based owner of the Green\u2019s Arcadia chain. Labour MP John Mann is leading the calls for Green to lose his knighthood: Another former Labour MP, Chris Mullin, credits the work and pension committee chair Frank Field: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The big news this morning is that Sir Philip Green has been eviscerated by MPs over his handling of the BHS retail chain, which collapsed earlier this year. A no-holds-barred report into BHS found that the Green family had systematically taken money out of the chain during their ownership, weakening it and leading to its eventual collapse. Green himself was dubbed the \u201cunacceptable face of capitalism\u201d -- harking back to Ted Heath\u2019s damning verdict on Tiny Rowland in the 1970s -- with little proof that he deserved his knighthood for retail business acumen. He has been urged to act now to patch up BHS\u2019s pension deficit, estimated at \u00a3571m, or risk being humiliatingly stripped of that gong. Frank Field, the chair of the work and pensions committee, summed up the report: \u201c[Green\u2019s] reputation as the king of retail lies in the ruins of BHS. His family took out of BHS and Arcadia a fortune beyond the dreams of avarice and he\u2019s still to make good his boast of \u2018fixing\u2019 the pension fund. What kind of man is it who can count his fortune in billions but does not know what decent behaviour is?\u201d The work and pensions select committee and the business, innovation and skills (BIS) were also unsparing in their verdict of Dominic Chappell, who bought the chain from Green a year before it folded. He had his \u2018hands in the till\u2019, they say. And they also criticise the City firms who helped engineer that takeover, including Goldman Sachs. The only group who avoided criticism are BHS\u2019s 11,000 staff, and its pensioners, who are now facing uncertainty and financial pain. Here\u2019s the full story: Also coming up today..... Global investors will be digesting last weekend\u2019s G20 meeting, where finance ministers and central bankers warned that growth is still too weak: G20 will use \u2018all policy tools\u2019 to lift growth as Brexit weighs The UK\u2019s CBI group publishes its monthly survey of business confidence and industrial trends at 11am.

Analysts at Kantar Worldpanel said the grocery market had declined by 1.1% in the four weeks to 17 July, which City analysts said was the worst month of trading for at least four years if periods affected by the timing of Easter were excluded. \u201cThe weather is having a big impact on the industry at the moment, adding further pressure on sales from deflation and responding to the growth of discounters,\u201d said Mike Watkins, UK head of retailer and business insight at analyst Nielsen.

So despite oil prices slipping back further, stock markets in Europe (mostly) ended in positive territory, lifted by positive news from the likes of BT and GKN. But banks remained in the doldrums ahead of Friday\u2019s European stress test results. Wall Street was marginally lower by the time Europe closed, as a spate of new data suggested a US rate rise could be on the cards again later in the year.

                "bodyText":"Ahead of some key central bank meetings this week, notably the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan, investors managed to hold their nerve. So despite oil prices slipping back further, stock markets in Europe (mostly) ended in positive territory, lifted by positive news from the likes of BT and GKN. But banks remained in the doldrums ahead of Friday\u2019s European stress test results. Wall Street was marginally lower by the time Europe closed, as a spate of new data suggested a US rate rise could be on the cards again later in the year. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 added 13.90 points or 0.21% to 6724.03 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.49% to 10,247.76 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.15% at 4394.77 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB edged up 0.03% to 16,697.01 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.18% at 8560.2 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.22% to 566 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 32 points or 0.18%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. In sum, the US data seems to point to a possible rate rise this year, which has not been lost on the stock market. Wall Street has now lost ground, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now down 80 points or 0.44%. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: A batch of particularly strong US data points highlighted the frustrating position [Federal Reserve chair] Janet Yellen &amp; co find themselves in, where their domestic economy warrants another interest rate hike to normalise monetary policy. However, with global headwinds blowing more from the Atlantic and less from the Pacific, the Fed appears to have her hands tied for the time being. Despite markets largely disregarding the possibility of any actions from the Fed tomorrow, today\u2019s outperformance in data spanning manufacturing, consumer confidence and new home sales seemed to raise the likeliness of a 2016 hike, spurring weakness in US stocks. More on the rise in US new home sales. Reuters reports: New U.S. single-family home sales rose more than expected in June, reaching their highest level in nearly 8-1/2 years, the latest sign that the housing market was gathering momentum. The Commerce Department said on Tuesday new home sales increased 3.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 592,000 units last month, the highest level since February 2008. May\u2019s sales pace was revised up to 572,000 units from the previously reported 551,000 units. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for about 9.6 percent of the housing market, rising to a rate of 560,000 units last month. More US data, this time fairly reasonable, and giving the Federal Reserve something to think about. The July consumer confidence index came in at 97.3, better than the expected 95.9 and little changed from the revised 97.4 figure for June (down from an initial 98). And the Richmond Fed composite manufacturing index came in at +10 in July, compared to -10 in June. Back with the housing market, single family home sales rose 3.5% in June compared to no change in May. On the services data Markit said: July data suggested that growth in the U.S. service sector remained muted, with activity rising at the weakest pace in the current five-month sequence of expansion. A slower increase in new business was also recorded. On a more positive note, the rate of job creation picked up slightly and business sentiment improved markedly from June\u2019s record low. On the price front, slower increases were registered for both input costs and output prices during the month. Andrew Harker, senior economist at Markit said: The U.S. service sector remained stuck in a low gear at the start of the third quarter of 2016, with growth of activity remaining subdued amid a slower rise in new business. This is particularly disappointing given the decent numbers posted by the manufacturing sector last week. A bit more encouraging was the rebound in business confidence following June\u2019s survey low, suggesting that a return to stronger growth will be possible once the current soft patch comes to an end. Whether this will be before the presidential election or not remains to be seen, however. Growth in the US service sector is slowing, according to an initial estimate for July. Markit\u2019s services PMI index came in at 50.9, down from the 51.4 level seen in June and below forecasts of a figure of 52. But Markit\u2019s composite index - taking in both services and manufacturing - was up from 51.2 in June to 51.5, the highest since April. US markets are marginally higher in early trading as investors keep their powder dry ahead of a host of big name companies reporting later, including Apple and Twitter, as well as Wednesday\u2019s interest rate decision from the Federal Reserve. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up just 11 points or 0.06%. Oil continues to come under pressure on persistent concerns about a supply glut at the same time as demand weakens along with the global economy. Brent crude is currently dow 0.36% at $44.56 a barrel, having earlier fallen as low as $44.14, a level not seen since the middle of May. Over to the US, and as the Federal Reserve meets to decide its latest move on interest rates, there is a spate of economic data coming out for them to consider. Markets are not expecting the US central bank to change rates, although there is a growing school of thought that it may raise borrowing costs before the end of the year if the economic picture seems to be heading in the right direction. Larry Hatheway, chief economist at asset management firm GAM, said: The Federal Reserve is unlikely to announce a change in its target Fed Funds rate at the conclusion of this week\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. A hallmark of the Yellen Fed, and its predecessors, is clear communication regarding policy decisions, avoiding surprises. Given the uncertainties the Fed had cited around \u2018Brexit\u2019 as well as the weakness of the May employment report, the Fed is widely believed to be \u2018on hold\u2019, a view it will almost certainly confirm this week. That said, the FOMC statement is also likely to recognise that the much discussed concerns for capital markets, the world economy and \u2013 by extension \u2013 the US economy stemming from the UK \u2018Leave\u2019 result have not, for the most part, manifested themselves. Without saying so directly, the Fed is likely to conclude that the primary economic consequences of \u2018Brexit\u2019 will be felt in the UK, with little impact on US economic conditions. So the latest data is likely to be scoured for signs of how the US economy is performing. First off the block is some housing data, which shows prices rising less than expected but still indicating a fairly strong marke.t The S&amp;P Case-Schiller index rose 5.2% in May year on year, below the 5.4% figure in the previous month and the 5.5% forecast by economists polled by Reuters. David M. Blitzer of the S&amp;P index committee said: Overall, housing is doing quite well...In addition to strong prices, sales of existing homes reached the highest monthly level since 2007 as construction of new homes showed continuing gains. Assuming Martin Weale is a bellwether, what might the Bank of England do next week to stimulate the economy? Jeremy Cook of World First predicts an interest rate cut, a new bout of quantitative easing (QE; buying bonds with new money), and new measures to encourage banks to lend. He says: We are maintaining our call for a Bank of England interest rate cut by 25bps and an increase in QE by somewhere between \u00a350bn and \u00a375bn. Within the announcement we are also looking for something similar to the ECB\u2019s TLTRO \u2013 Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operation \u2013 that allows banks to borrow at negative rates i.e. get paid for borrowing. This would be a subsidy to British banks that should insulate the financial system from the unwanted effects of negative deposit rates should the Bank see the need. This is the kind of financial policy engineering that may allow for a near term pick-up in inflation expectations and, maybe more importantly, a calming of fears around financial stability. But other economists are split over the chances of more quantitative easing, on top of the \u00a3375bn of bonds already held by the BoE. Danielle Haralambous of the Economist Intelligence Unit points out that the Bank doesn\u2019t have many conventional tools left.... We should have worn special hats today, as apparently it\u2019s Mario Draghi Day. No, the European Central Bank president hasn\u2019t been honoured with his own holiday (yet). Instead, it\u2019s the fourth anniversary of his pledge to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the euro. That surprise promise, made in London in 2012, paved the way towards various initiatives to fight the eurozone\u2019s slide into deflation. Draghi\u2019s pledge to buy unlimited quantities of bonds from struggling nations helped to drive down eurozone bond yields. And thanks to the splurge of quantitative easing, the ECB\u2019s balance sheet has swollen dramatically. However, but inflation remains worryingly low, growth is still quite weak and inflation too high. Maybe we\u2019ll have more to celebrate next year. In the meantime, check out the FT\u2019s collection of graphs to show how the last four years have developed. After a quiet morning in the City, BT is still the best-performing stock on the FTSE 100. Its shares have now jumped by almost 5%, showing investors\u2019 verdict on Ofcom\u2019s decision not to split the company. This table shows how significant Openreach is to BT\u2019s financial performance: Britain\u2019s banks have turned up their noses at the latest offer of cheap cash from the Bank of England. The BoE has allocated just \u00a375m of liquidity in its latest weekly auction since the Brexit vote. This gives banks a chance to swap assets for ready cash, in case they are facing a funding squeeze. Clearly they are not - \u00a375m is the lowest take-up since the EU crisis began, down from \u00a3250m last week. The Federation of Small Businesses is deeply alarmed about the prospect that firms could be charged negative interest rates by their banks. Mike Cherry, the FSB\u2019s national chairman, has urged the Bank of England to fully consider the consequences of cutting rates to fresh record low: Today\u2019s warning from Natwest and RBS will be deeply concerning to small firms. FSB\u2019s latest research shows small business confidence is already at a four year low. Firms are less optimistic, cutting headcount and curbing investment intentions. \u201cWhen the Monetary Policy Committee meets next week to decide on interest rates, we would call on them to do everything possible to consider the implications of changing interest rates for smaller firms and the self-employed looking to maintain or grow their business. \u201cIt is now vital that all finance providers holding deposits from small businesses do everything they can to update customers concerned about any changes to their Business Current Account (BCA) during this uncertain economic period. Martin Weale\u2019s new enthusiasm for a fresh stimulus package raises the prospect that UK interest rates are slashed to almost zero next week. A interest rate cut would present challenges for the banking sector, as rates are already just 0.5%. The Guardian revealed last night that NatWest is already warning business customers that it could impose negative interest rates \u2013 meaning they would be charged to leave money at the bank. Clive Lewis, head of enterprise at the ICAEW, says businesses need to prepare for negative interest rates. He fears that it could encourage firms to take money out of the bank, raising the risk of theft. Lewis says: \u201cIt is vital that all customers, but especially small business customers, check all communications from their bank and monitor their accounts. Banks are well within their rights to do this, but for small businesses where cash flow is tight, this could cause significant problems if they are not prepared. \u201cThe danger is that this could have a distorting effect by incentivising customers not to keep their money in the bank \u2013 either prompting unwarranted spending or causing them to store money in ways that are less safe\u201d Lending to UK business and housebuyers has fallen, highlighting nervousness created by the EU referendum. Mortgage approvals fell to 40,103 in June, down from 41,842 [corrected] in May, according to the British Bankers Association. That\u2019s the fewest mortgage approvals since March 2015, although more money was loaned than a year ago. The BBA also reports that business lending fell in June for the first time this year, indicating that businesses delayed big projects before June\u2019s Brexit vote. BBA chief economist Rebecca Harding says we can\u2019t read too much into this, though: \u201cOverall, business confidence was clearly fragile in anticipation of the outcome of the vote, but these results are not a verdict on the health of the economy post-Brexit,\u201d The pound has weakened against all other major currencies this morning, after Martin Weale threw his weight behind a new stimulus package for the UK economy. Sterling is still down half a cent against the US dollar at $1.309. It\u2019s down a similar amount against the euro too, at \u20ac1.192. Traders are calculating that Weale\u2019s change of heart is significant, as other policymakers may also be spurred into action by the latest economic data. UK hedge fund manager Man Group has warned that the EU referendum is casting a shadow over the City. Man posted a 3% drop in funds under management today. CEO Manny Roman says customers could be spooked by the Brexit vote: The outlook, particularly cross border post Brexit, remains uncertain and accordingly the risk appetite of our clients has the potential to impact flows. Oil giant BP has warned that economic conditions are tough, after missing City forecasts in the last quarter. BP made an underlying replacement cost profit of $720m in the second quarter of 2016, down from $1.3bn last year, as the low oil price continued to hit revenues. BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley sounded cautious, telling shareholders that: \u201cAs we look forward we expect the external environment to remain challenging,\u201d BP shares are down 1.7% this morning. Next week\u2019s Bank of England monetary policy committee meeting is Martin Weale\u2019s last chance to influence monetary policy, as he steps down later in August. He has a somewhat spotty record too \u2013 having voted to raise borrowing costs several times since the financial crisis due to (unwarranted?) worries over inflation. Kit Juckes of French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale comments: He has attended 71 MPC meetings so far (if my maths is right) and has voted to leave rates unchanged 59 times and to hike 12 times. The MPC has never moved rates over that period but perhaps this time, he\u2019ll be a bellwether. Martin Weale\u2019s warning about the weakening UK economy shows that the Bank of England is close to launching a stimulus package, say analysts. Here\u2019s Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct: Although the Bank of England meet again to discuss rates next week, it had initially been thought that meaningful action would have to wait until we had a full quarter\u2019s worth of post-Brexit data on the table, but opinions here may now be shifting. Jeremy Cook of World First agrees: With Weale now expected to vote for a policy cut in what will be his last meeting as a member of the Monetary Policy Committee it is now almost a guarantee that the majority will plump for a stimulatory increase in monetary accommodation. The exact make-up of that policy still remains in doubt. Reuters\u2019 Jamie McGeever is struck by Weale\u2019s sudden change of view: Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron has also blasted Ofcom for not splitting BT up, given the steady criticism over the telco\u2019s broadband service. He argues that the regulator has proved to be toothless, even though today\u2019s ruling forces Openreach to work more closely with other service providers: \u201cIt provides a poor service to customers and has been starved of investment. Giving more powers and investment to Openreach is better than nothing but the crucial thing is it will leave millions of customers with poor quality broadband. That is unacceptable in the modern age when the government claims to be creating a digital economy. \u201cIf a watchdog yet again fails to bark, perhaps it is time to put it down.\u201d John Fingleton, the former head of Britain\u2019s Office for Fair Trading, reckons Ofcom have blundered by not completing separating BT\u2019s network arm from the retail side of the company. BT\u2019s bosses may be breathing a sigh of relief this morning after regulator Ofcom resisted pressure to formally split the company. Shares in BT have jumped by 3% after Ofcom recommended that Openreach, its broadband network provider, should become a legally separate company. Some BT critics had argued that Openreach should be completely split off, to prevent the company from failing to invest enough in the country\u2019s telecoms infrastructure. Those calls have not been heeded by the regulator, though, as my colleague Angela Monaghan explains: BT will not have to sell off its Openreach broadband division despite concerns that it has been starved of investment and provides a poor quality of service. The media regulator, Ofcom, has instead ordered BT to give more independence and investment powers to Openreach. Ofcom said Openreach should be run as a legally separate company within BT Group, with its own board and its own brand. \u201cThis model would provide Openreach with the greatest degree of independence from BT Group that is possible without incurring the costs and disruption \u2013 to industry and consumers \u2013 associated with separating the companies entirely,\u201d Ofcom said, announcing the decision. Shares in London are rising in early trading, partly thanks to the weakening pound: Martin Weale\u2019s decision to back fresh stimulus measures next week has caused a stir in the City. Analysts at Royal Bank of Canada reckon that there\u2019s only one \u2018hawk\u2019 left on the committee: The Financial Times carries an interview with BoE MPC member Martin Weale that indicates he will now vote in favour of an immediate stimulus package at the August meeting. In a speech last week said he wanted to \u201cwait for firmer evidence before making any policy change\u201d but following the sharp fall in the recent \u2018flash\u2019 PMI surveys he now thinks that news will be very material for next week\u2019s decision. The business survey evidence has been a lot worse than he was expecting. Of the MPC members to have spoken on the record since the referendum, that now leaves just Kristin Forbes as a hawkish outlier. However, Weale is also getting some stick for this u-turn, given he was arguing against immediate stimulus measures last week. City traders are selling the pound with gusto, following Martin Weale\u2019s hint that he\u2019ll vote for a Bank of England stimulus programme next week. Sterling has fallen by half a cent against the US dollar to $1.3092, which isn\u2019t great news for anyone heading to America on their holidays. That adds to Friday\u2019s selloff, when the pound dropped by 1.5 cents after Markit\u2019s PMI survey showed the economy shrinking at its fastest rate since 2009. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The big news this morning is that one of the Bank of England\u2019s most hawkish members has warned that the economy is worse than he expected. Martin Weale has been shaken into action by last week\u2019s grim purchasing managing index (PMI), which showed that manufacturing firms and service companies had suffered falling orders and demand in July. That report implies that the UK economy is probably shrinking this month. And it means Weale is likely to vote for a new stimulus package, which may include an interest rate cut, at next week\u2019s meeting. Weale told the FT that last Friday\u2019s PMIs were \u201ca lot worse than I had thought\u201d and showed \u201cexpectations have worsened sharply\u201d. He added: \u201cThey are the best short-term indicator we have at the moment. I certainly feel they are very material for the decision we\u2019ll be taking next week.\u201d Here\u2019s a reminder of just how sharply the PMI slumped into contraction territory: It\u2019s quite a change of stance from Weale- -- back on 18 July, he argued that we didn\u2019t have enough evidence that the economy was suffering from June\u2019s Brexit vote. Clearly a week is a long time in monetary policy.... Only one member of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee, Gertjan Vlieghe voted to cut interest rates at this month\u2019s meeting. But Weale won\u2019t be the only policymaker to have clocked the importance of the PMIs, so the next meeting on August 4 could be rather lively... Here\u2019s the FT\u2019s story: Also coming up today.... Telecoms regulator Ofcom is announcing plans to restructure BT Openreach, the telco\u2019s network arm. It will be split off into a \u2018distinct company\u2019, separate from the rest of the operation. But will it be enough to allay concerns over service levels and broadband speed? We\u2019ll be watching the BHS scandal again today too, after MPs yesterday released a damning report into the collapse of the retailer. Sir Philip Green, who came into particular criticism, is now threatening to sue MP Frank Field over comparison to Robert Maxwell. There\u2019s a flurry of company news this morning, with oil giant BP and fund manager Man Group reporting to the City: But the major corporate news won\u2019t come until late tonight, when Apple and Twitter reveal how well they performed in the last quarter. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main news through the day....",

May\u2019s initial reading of a 2.3% drop was revised downwards to a 2.8% fall.</p> <p>Rob Carnell, chief international economist at ING Bank, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The volatile durable goods orders data fell again in June by 4.0% month on month, following a 2.8% decline in May. This matters because goods orders are one of the ways we can track business investment over the quarter. With the quarter now complete, the picture for business investment in the second quarter of 2016, following 2 previous quarters of decline, remains poor. </p> <p>More accurate yardsticks for business investment than the headline orders series, are the trend series for core orders and shipments. Core (ex defence and aircraft) orders accelerated their decline on a 3-month annualised basis in June. But the equivalent figure for shipments fell at a slower pace, though remained negative. </p> <p>We think this suggests a flat business investment figure in the second quarter of 2016 - or something close to flat - and this would be a slight improvement on the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016.</p> <p>We had not expected much more than this, but nonetheless, our 2.8% quarter on quarter forecast for second quarter GDP growth might now be a couple of tenths too high, assuming we have all our other subcomponents correct.</p> <p>This would still leave second quarter 2016 GDP at about 2.5% - a marked improvement on 1.1% in the first quarter, and will help hawkish Fed members argue that the Fed should not hold its fire for too much longer before hiking rates again. The domestic economy does seem to have recovered some of its momentum since late 2015 / early 2016, and international political developments and market uncertainty are now the main deterrents to further fed tightening.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5798b3cee4b02d2223d825a8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-27T13:21:03.411Z\">2.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FTSE 250 regains all post-Brexit vote losses</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The FTSE 100 is not the only index to be boosted by the news of better than expected UK GDP figures and, perhaps more pertinently, an interest rate cut from the Bank of England next week to try and stall a post-Brexit downturn.</p> <p>The leading index is now at its highest level for more than a year - the best since 20 July 2015.</p> <p>Meanwhile the FTSE 250, which is more focused on the UK domestic economy than the 100 index, has regained all the losses it suffered since the Brexit result.</p> <p>The mid-cap index is up 1.6% at 17,354, compared to the 17,333 level it reached on the day of the referendum.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5798ae2fe4b0e0542bbb25c5\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-27T13:13:12.978Z\">2.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Lunchtime summary: Growth beats forecasts, but....</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A quick recap.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jul/27/uk-gdp-economy-growth-brexit-referendum-pound-markets-live?page=with:block-57986face4b065cfc0a5bf80#block-57986face4b065cfc0a5bf80\">Fears that Britain\u2019s economy stalled in the run-up to the EU referendum have eased a little, after growth in the second quarter of 2016 beat forecasts</a>.</strong></p> <p>UK GDO rose by 0.6% in April-June, the ONS reported, thanks to the biggest jump in industrial output since 1999.</p> <p> That beats forecasts of 0.4% growth, and means Britain\u2019s economy is 7.7% larger than before the 2008 crash.<br></p> <p>Details:</p> <ul> <li>Services: grew by 0.5%<br></li> <li>Industrial production: grew by 2.1%<br></li> <li>Manufacturing: grew by 1.8%<br></li> <li>Construction: shrank by 0.4%<br></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3d0aacf683e2d0f48ca5d684babeb760b3e1183\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3d0aacf683e2d0f48ca5d684babeb760b3e1183/0_0_763_546/500.jpg\" alt=\"Where the growth came from:\" width=\"500\" height=\"358\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Where the growth came from:</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ONS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jul/27/uk-gdp-economy-growth-brexit-referendum-pound-markets-live?page=with:block-579872e7e4b0e0542bbb24f9#block-579872e7e4b0e0542bbb24f9\">Chancellor Philip Hammond has declared that the figures show Britain\u2019s economic fundamentals are robust</a>, as it enters a world of Brexit uncertainty.

                "bodyText":"The promise of extra financial stimulus from the Japanese government set a positive tone at the start of the day, and that mostly continued into the close. Better than expected UK economic growth in the second quarter also helped lift the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 - the latter briefly regaining the level it was at before the Brexit vote. But European markets slipped back from their highs as Wall Street went into reverse after an early rise, with sentiment undermined by a sharper than expected rise in crude oil stocks. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 26.40 points or 0.39% higher at 6750.43, its best level since 5 August 2015 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.7% to 10,319.55 France\u2019s Cac climbed 1.19% to 4446.96 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was 0.99% better at 16,863.01 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.18% at 8661.4 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.56% to 569.16 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 31 points or 0.17% ahead of the US Federal Reserve interest rate decision. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Here\u2019s Reuters on the rise in US crude oil stocks: Oil prices tumbled more than 2 percent on Wednesday, hitting a two-month low, after the U.S. government reported a surprise build in crude and gasoline inventories during the peak summer driving season. The U.S. Energy Information Administration said domestic crude stockpiles rose 1.7 million barrels, against analysts\u2019 forecasts for a drawdown of 2.3 million barrels. \u201cA drop in refinery runs at the peak of summer driving season indicate refiners are dialing back amid faltering profit margins,\u201d said Matt Smith, analyst at New York-based oil cargoes tracker Clipperdata. Refinery crude runs fell 277,000 barrels per day last week as utilization rates fell 0.8 percentage point to 92.4 percent of capacity, EIA data showed. Oil prices are under pressure again after new figures showing a surprise increase in US crude stocks. The Energy Information Administration said crude oil stocks rose by 1.67m barrels last week to 521.1m, rather than the 2m fall which had been expected. US markets are off to a positive start, lifted by better than expected results from Apple and ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 56 points or 0.3%, while the S&amp;P 500 is up 0.16% and Nasdaq is 0.63% better. Earlier in the US came some evidence of economic weakness, ahead of the Federal Reserve interest rate decision. Orders for durable goods - long lasting items ranging from toasters to aircraft - fell 4% month on month in June, the biggest drop since August 2014. May\u2019s initial reading of a 2.3% drop was revised downwards to a 2.8% fall. Rob Carnell, chief international economist at ING Bank, said: The volatile durable goods orders data fell again in June by 4.0% month on month, following a 2.8% decline in May. This matters because goods orders are one of the ways we can track business investment over the quarter. With the quarter now complete, the picture for business investment in the second quarter of 2016, following 2 previous quarters of decline, remains poor. More accurate yardsticks for business investment than the headline orders series, are the trend series for core orders and shipments. Core (ex defence and aircraft) orders accelerated their decline on a 3-month annualised basis in June. But the equivalent figure for shipments fell at a slower pace, though remained negative. We think this suggests a flat business investment figure in the second quarter of 2016 - or something close to flat - and this would be a slight improvement on the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. We had not expected much more than this, but nonetheless, our 2.8% quarter on quarter forecast for second quarter GDP growth might now be a couple of tenths too high, assuming we have all our other subcomponents correct. This would still leave second quarter 2016 GDP at about 2.5% - a marked improvement on 1.1% in the first quarter, and will help hawkish Fed members argue that the Fed should not hold its fire for too much longer before hiking rates again. The domestic economy does seem to have recovered some of its momentum since late 2015 / early 2016, and international political developments and market uncertainty are now the main deterrents to further fed tightening. The FTSE 100 is not the only index to be boosted by the news of better than expected UK GDP figures and, perhaps more pertinently, an interest rate cut from the Bank of England next week to try and stall a post-Brexit downturn. The leading index is now at its highest level for more than a year - the best since 20 July 2015. Meanwhile the FTSE 250, which is more focused on the UK domestic economy than the 100 index, has regained all the losses it suffered since the Brexit result. The mid-cap index is up 1.6% at 17,354, compared to the 17,333 level it reached on the day of the referendum. A quick recap. Fears that Britain\u2019s economy stalled in the run-up to the EU referendum have eased a little, after growth in the second quarter of 2016 beat forecasts. UK GDO rose by 0.6% in April-June, the ONS reported, thanks to the biggest jump in industrial output since 1999. That beats forecasts of 0.4% growth, and means Britain\u2019s economy is 7.7% larger than before the 2008 crash. Details: Services: grew by 0.5% Industrial production: grew by 2.1% Manufacturing: grew by 1.8% Construction: shrank by 0.4% Chancellor Philip Hammond has declared that the figures show Britain\u2019s economic fundamentals are robust, as it enters a world of Brexit uncertainty. He can also point to plans to invest more than \u00a3300m in London City Airport. But many economists have warned that the economy is probably now shrinking. It could even fall into recession, if Britain gets a serious bout of Brexit blues. There\u2019s also concern that most of the growth occurred in April, before dropping off in May. The report has little detail on how the economy fared in the immediate run-up to the June 23 referendum either. Worryingly, UK retail sales have tumbled at the fastest rate since January 2012 this month. And Ireland\u2019s central bank has cut its growth forecasts for 2016 and 2017, due to the impact caused by the EU referendum vote. But City traders are in upbeat move, sending the FTSE up by 49 points to 6773 -- a new 11-month high. They\u2019re expecting a fresh bout of stimulus from the Bank of Japan soon, followed by a UK interest rate cut next week. Fast food chain McDonalds has just announced plans to hire thousands more workers in the UK; suggesting it is also confident about future prospects. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, reckons that Philip Hammond knows full well that Britain\u2019s economy is entering turbulent times: He writes: The Brexit result was unexpected and has, judging by the surveys since, affected the outlook for both the services and manufacturing sectors. Construction was the one sector that was already struggling in the buildup to the vote and is likely to face an even tougher winter than the rest of the economy. Growth is going to slow down markedly from now on. The length and depth of that slowdown will depend on how quickly businesses regain their equilibrium. The Bank of England knows that, which is why a big package of measures designed to boost confidence will be announced next week. More here: Here\u2019s more City reaction to the growth figures. Bad news: UK retail sales have fallen at the fastest pace in over four years in July this month. The latest survey, from the CBI, bolsters concerns that the economy is weakening fast - unravelling the solid growth in the last quarter. Some 24% of retailers said that sales volumes were up in July compared with a year earlier, while 38% said they were down, giving a rounded balance of -14%. That\u2019s the weakest reading since January 2012. The CBI says: Within retail, sales by grocers, and furniture and carpets stores were the main drivers of the drop in overall volumes. But some sectors bucked the trend, with non-specialised department stores and retailers of footwear and leather goods reporting higher volumes. Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics says it\u2019s worrying news: Ireland\u2019s Central Bank has downgraded its forecasts for GDP growth for 2016 and 2017 citing the adverse affect of Brexit on the economy. Britain is Ireland\u2019s biggest export partner while Ireland is Britain\u2019s fifth biggest trading partner with \u20ac1.5bn in transactions a week. The Central Bank said it believed the Irish economy, which is one of the fastest growing in Europe, would continue to grow but that Brexit was negative for the economy. It cut its projections for growth in 2016 by 0.2% to 4.9% GDP growth. It also slashed 0.6% off its 2017 growth forecasts, down to 3.6%. It said it expected a prolonged period of uncertainty while the UK was negotiating its Brexit package which would damage investor confidence. In a statement Ireland\u2019s Central Bank chief economist, Gabriel Fagan, said while the economy\u2019s reliance on the British export market had weakened over recent decades. However... \u201cSome sectors, including agri-food, clothing, footwear and tourism continue to have a relatively high dependency on exports to the UK and, consequently, could be affected disproportionately\u201d. Tourism is expected to take a particular hit because of the weakened pound. Among Ireland\u2019s top 10 exports to Britain are food and drink and packaged medicines while the UK\u2019s exports to Britain including gas, cars and pharmaceuticals. Edgar Morganrath, associate research professor at Dublin\u2019s Economic and Social Research Institute has said that custom paperwork could add three to four per cent on costs for exporters to the UK, in line with additional costs of exporting to non-EU territories including US and Canada. Here\u2019s the full report Britain\u2019s growth since the crisis is less impressive once you adjust for the increase in population: On a per-capita basis, the economy is only 1.3% bigger than in 2008, not the 7.7% headline increase report today. Matthew Whittaker of the Resolution Foundation shows how this is much worse than in previous recessions: Andy Bruce of Reuters has highlighted how April provided the bulk of the growth in the last quarter: If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s our news story on today\u2019s growth figures: Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC, fears that Britain\u2019s economy is entering a period of weak growth, despite the forecast-beating performance in the last quarter: \u201cThe pick up in growth in the UK in the second quarter is consistent with other data - for employment, retail sales and yesterday\u2019s CBI survey of manufacturers. \u201cHowever, we also know that the EU Referendum result has sent a shockwave through the business world and we should expect much slower growth this quarter - the main scenario in our latest PwC Economic Outlook suggests growth slowing to around 1.6% this year. 2017 is likely to see even more sluggish growth - our central view is for GDP to increase by just 0.6% next year. Once upon a time, Britain\u2019s chancellor would have celebrated today\u2019s growth figures by donning a florescent jacket and building a wall. But Philip Hammond doesn\u2019t shares George Osborne\u2019s love of hard hats; so he\u2019s decamped to London City Airport this morning. He\u2019s there to announce a \u00a3344m expansion programme for the airport, meaning more space for planes and an enlarged terminal to house extra passengers. Today\u2019s report shows that \u201cdire predictions\u201d that the economy would grind to a halt before the EU referendum were false, says Peter Rosenstreich of Swissquote Bank. In actuality, growth accelerated as business raced ahead of the uncertain vote (lead by industrial output). This unexpected read indicates that the UK economy was in stronger position ahead of the vote then originally forecasted. But Rosenstreich also fears Britain could now fall into recession: However, this preliminary estimate does not capture the post referendum fallout, which is likely to drive Q3 lower, possibly into recession. We remain bearish on the British pound as the UK economy will clearly go through a period of economic adjustment and likely BoE interest rate cuts.\u201d One decent quarter doesn\u2019t mean Britain\u2019s industrial sector has roared back, points out Ben Chu of the Independent: The chancellor has been tweeting: Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, also fears that the UK will contract following the Brexit vote, but might avoid a full-blown recession. He points out that today\u2019s strong growth reading is \u201calmost entirely due to the exceptional April performance\u201d [see earlier graph] That means the economy was probably weakening in June. \u201cGDP growth in Q2 looks likely to represent one last hurrah for the economy before it enters a softer and more turbulent period. The lack of momentum as the economy entered Q3 means that the chances of a negative reading for the current quarter are relatively high. However, our view remains that the extent to which the economy will slow in the second half of the year has been overplayed and that the UK may avoid a technical recession.\u201d Ben Brettell, senior economist at financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown, is encouraged by the 2.1% surge in UK industrial output: The UK economy shook off pre-referendum nerves to grow by a better-than-expected 0.6% in the second quarter, with a notably strong performance from the manufacturing sector. It\u2019s always difficult to tell where you\u2019re going by looking in the rear-view mirror, and as such today\u2019s GDP figures can\u2019t be taken as evidence of the current climate. However, what they do show is an absence of pre-Brexit concerns, meaning that if the forecast downturn does materialise, at least we start from a position of relative strength. However... Danielle Haralambous of the Economist Intelligence Unit reckons it won\u2019t last..... Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the international payments company, World First, fears that Britain\u2019s economy will shrink in the current quarter, despite a better performance than expected in the last three months. He says: Preliminary GDP figures are always heavily caveated; less than 50% of the survey data is in and will likely over-represent the beginning of the quarter compared to the end..... \u201cUnfortunately we believe the overall UK economic picture is one of recession at the moment and while it is still too early to forecast we are looking for Q3 GDP to fall by anywhere 0.1-0.4%. Today\u2019s data will limit calls that the UK was slowing into the vote however.\u201d Today\u2019s GDP report is mainly based on data from April and May, as it\u2019s too early to have a full picture of the economy in June. So if Britain did suffer a dose of Brexit angst last month, it won\u2019t appear in today\u2019s data - we\u2019ll have to wait for the second estimate of GDP in August. Simon French, chief economist of Panmure Gordon, flags up that April was a particularly strong month: Britain\u2019s carmakers and pharmaceutical firms helped to drive the economy forwards, according to Joe Grice, the Office for National Statistics\u2019 top economist. The ONS also found little sign that the EU referendum on June 23rd had hurt the economy during the last quarter. Despite the surge in industrial output last quarter, the sector is *still* smaller than before the financial crisis back in 2008. Only the services sector (which makes up 70% of the economy) is larger: Britain\u2019s economy is now 7.7% higher than the pre-economic downturn peak, in the first quarter of 2008. The 0.6% growth recorded in Q2 means the UK has been growing for the last 14 quarters: Britain\u2019s new Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, has welcomed the news that the UK growth rate has jumped to 0.6%. He says: \u201cToday\u2019s GDP figures show that the fundamentals of the British economy are strong. In the second quarter of this year our economy grew by 0.6 per cent \u2013 faster than was expected. Indeed we saw the strongest quarterly rise in production for nearly twenty years, so it is clear we enter our negotiations to leave the EU from a position of economic strength. \u201cThose negotiations will signal the beginning of a period of adjustment, but I am confident we have the tools to manage the challenges ahead, and along with the Bank of England, this government will take whatever action is necessary to support our economy and maintain business and consumer confidence. Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector has a very good quarter, according to today\u2019s GDP report. UK industrial output jumped by 2.1% during the April-June period, the strongest quarterly growth since the third quarter of 1999. However, the service sector slowed to 0.5% growth, down from 0.6% in Q1. And construction output shrank by 0.4%. On an annual basis, the UK economy grew by 2.2% over the last 12 months - up from 2.0% three months ago. Here we go: The UK economy expanded by 0.6% in the last three months, up from 0.4% in the January-March quarter. That\u2019s faster than expected. It suggests that the UK economy was in fairly robust shape before June\u2019s EU referendum. Lots more detail and reaction to follow! Tension is mounting in the City, as traders wait for the UK GDP data to drop in 10 minutes. The pound is weakening a little, down 0.1% against the US dollar at $1.3111. Ana Thaker, market economist at PhillipCapital, explains why investors are anxious: A positive figure will add to optimism that the UK economy was robust going into the vote and therefore may weather the repercussions better than previously forecasted. However, poor figures will be a blow to already fragile and worried markets, with expectations that the Brexit decision will only exacerbate problems in an already weak economy and could see weakness in Sterling as markets contemplate the prospect of an easing package from the Bank of England. London\u2019s stock market has hit a new 11-month high this morning. The FTSE 100 has risen by 20 points to 6744, a level last seen in August 2015. Shares are rallying worldwide, after Japan\u2019s prime ministers promised a stimulus package, worth around \u00a3200bn: Encouragingly, several UK companies have told shareholders this morning that they\u2019re not suffering any serious harm from the Brexit vote. Yet, anyway. Here\u2019s Housebuilder Taylor Wimpey: One month on from the EU Referendum, current trading remains in line with normal seasonal patterns. Customer interest continues to be high, with a good level of visitors both to our developments and to our website. Challenger bank Metro says: \u201cMetro Bank is in a strong position to deal with any post European Referendum uncertainty. Since the Referendum vote we have seen no change in customer behaviour or impact on business flows.\u201d Fund manager Jupiter is also upbeat: Jupiter has continued to deliver strong investment outperformance after all fees in the first half of the year. Net flows were positive despite the market backdrop and we made further targeted investments to support our strategy of diversification by product, client type and geography which continues to deliver on behalf of our clients and shareholders. Since the end of June, we have continued to see net flows into our products. It\u2019s early days, of course - Britain hasn\u2019t even triggered Article 50 to begin the formal exit from the EU. Today\u2019s second-quarter growth figures could be a \u201clast hurrah\u201d before the Brexit vote plunges the UK into recession early next year. That\u2019s according to Bloomberg\u2019s Jill Ward, who flags up that economists expect GDP to shrink slightly over the next six months:. So, even if the growth rate does rise to 0.5%, we should still brace for trouble ahead: Samuel Tombs, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, told them: \u201cThe economy had done quite well in the run-up to the referendum, but that can turn pretty quickly. \u201cWe\u2019ve already seen consumer confidence fall very sharply and all of the survey data has just collapsed over the last month.\u201d More here: British Economy\u2019s Last Hurrah Awaited Before Brexit Growth Shock And here\u2019s what a \u2018last hurrah\u2019 looks like in practice #ouch Critics often argue that GDP is a poor measure of the health of an economy. For example, it doesn\u2019t distinguish between valuable and harmful economic output, nor does it include voluntary work or unpaid activity. It also doesn\u2019t measure economic inequality, or living standards. And we have a perfect example of that today; a survey showing that UK real wages (earnings adjusted for inflation) have shrunk by 10% since the 2007 financial crisis. That dire performance is only matched by Greece, and shows why many people have felt isolated from the recovery since the crisis. Frances O\u2019Grady of the TUC (which prepared the report) says it shows the economy is still too fragile: \u201cWages fell off the cliff after the financial crisis, and have barely begun to recover,. People cannot afford another hit to their pay packets. Working people must not foot the bill for a Brexit downturn in the way they did for the bankers\u2019 crash.\u201d Phamaceuticals firm GlaxoSmithKline has given the British economy a boost, by announcing a \u00a3275m investment programme to expand its UK manufacturing sites. GSK swept aside worries about the Brexit vote, declaring that it was driven to invest the money by the UK\u2019s \u201cskilled workforce and competitive tax system\u201d. The money will be spent across three GSK sites: Barnard Castle in County Durham, Montrose in Angus, and Ware in Hertfordshire. Understandably, the UK government has hailed the news - as a sign that Britain is still open for business despite voting to leave the EU. Business and Energy Secretary, Greg Clark argues: \u201cAn investment of this scale is a clear vote of confidence in Britain and underlines our position as a global business leader. GSK\u2019s recognition of our skilled workforce, world leading scientific capabilities and competitive tax environment is further proof that there really is no place better in Europe to grow a business.\u201d Good morning. Britain\u2019s economy is centre-stage today, as we await the official UK GDP figures for the second quarter of this year. That report, due at 9.30am sharp, will show how well the British economy performed in the second quarter of this year. The City consensus is that the economy grew by 0.4% between April and June, matching the fairly modest growth recorded in January to March. But some fear that the growth rate may have slowed, perhaps to 0.3%. Today\u2019s report is particularly important as it covered the period running up to the June 23 referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the EU. It should show whether the UK economy was in decent shape as the nation headed to the polling booths, or already weakening. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, explains why the GDP report matters: \u201cIt will tell us if the referendum gave the UK economy the jitters in the lead up to the vote. \u201cThere are several indicators which have pointed to a slowdown in economic activity as the referendum approached.\u201d The report will also show how Britain\u2019s manufacturing, services, construction and agriculture all performed during the quarter. As this chart shows, Services has provided the bulk of the growth since the financial crisis - making it more dominant than ever.

Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>An unsurprisingly indecisive session in Europe has seen the likes of the FTSE largely flatlining as traders reduced their risk overnight ahead of the week\u2019s risk event from the Bank of Japan. Commodities have enjoyed a particularly volatile second half of this week, with crude continuing to tumble heavily on a global supply glut alongside evidence that fund managers are heavily shorting crude prices.</p> <p>Tonight\u2019s Bank of Japan meeting has been the focal point of the week despite yesterday\u2019s Fed announcement. One of the main reasons for the post-referendum rally has been the promise of easing from the likes of the ECB, Bank of England and Bank of Japan. With the overnight index swap markets rating the chance of a Bank of England rate cut at 100% next week, it seems like a matter of time until we see some sort of action. However, given that we have seen the post-referendum rally stall after weeks of inaction in Europe, there is a feeling that the FTSE is waiting for some form of stimulus to spark another leg higher.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-579a1633e4b00eff095cd6b2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/larryelliott\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-28T15:00:44.544Z\">4.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The IMF has been criticised for its handling of the eurozone crisis...by the IMF.

That compares to 0.2% growth in the first quarter, and analyst expectations of a 0.3% increase. Year on year, the economy grew by 1.4%. Economist Peter Vanden Houte at ING Bank said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs the negative impact of the March 22 terrorist attacks in Brussels on hotels, catering and retail trade amounted to about \u20ac180m for the first half of this year. This probably shaved off around 0.1 percentage points from second quarter GDP growth. On top of that, the second quarter saw a rather tense social climate, with several strikes, most notably in public transport. This also weighed on growth.</p> <p>While the GDP components have not been published yet, the improvement in sentiment in industry seems to point to a positive contribution from investment and export. Residential construction most likely also contributed positively. With the situation on the labour market continuing to improve, consumption has probably also expanded, though some negative impact of the terrorist attacks seems likely.</p> <p>All in all today\u2019s figure seems hopeful, as it confirms that the Belgian economy still has some underlying momentum, putting in a strong performance despite the terrorist attacks and the strikes. Certainly, with Brexit and potentially a somewhat tighter fiscal policy, there are new headwinds that might hamper growth in the second half, but we believe that even then a quarterly growth pace of around 0.2% to 0.3% should be feasible. We will await further data confirmation in the coming weeks, but on the back of today\u2019s figures we are likely to have to revise our estimate for Belgian GDP growth upwards to 1.4% (from 1.2%).</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-579a0704e4b00eff095cd670\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-28T13:30:24.728Z\">2.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Earlier, US jobless claims rose by more than expected last week, according to the Labor Department.</strong></p> <p>The number of Americans claiming unemployment benefits grew by 14,000 to 266,000, compared to expectations of an increase to 260,000.

                "bodyText":"After the Federal Reserve kept US interest rates on hold and ahead of a decision by the Bank of Japan, stock markets fell back after their recent highs. Falling oil prices and disappointing results from the likes of Royal Dutch Shell and Lloyds Banking Group also hit sentiment. Investors were nervous ahead of the European bank stress test results due on late on Friday. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 29.37 points or 0.44% at 6721.06 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.43% to 10,274.93 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.59% at 4420.58 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 2.02% to 16,522.64 on worries about the country\u2019s banks ahead of the stress tests Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 2.1% lower at 8479.2 In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.11% to 562.84 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 72 points or 0.4%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Markets are in wait and see mode ahead of the Bank of Japan rate decision later, but oil continues to fall on renewed worries about oversupply and weak demand. West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark has now fallen 20% since its June highs, indicating a bear market. Meanwhile in the UK the FTSE 100 is down just 7 points while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is 74 points lower after the Federal Reserve kept US interest rates on hold but hinted at possible rises later in the year. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: An unsurprisingly indecisive session in Europe has seen the likes of the FTSE largely flatlining as traders reduced their risk overnight ahead of the week\u2019s risk event from the Bank of Japan. Commodities have enjoyed a particularly volatile second half of this week, with crude continuing to tumble heavily on a global supply glut alongside evidence that fund managers are heavily shorting crude prices. Tonight\u2019s Bank of Japan meeting has been the focal point of the week despite yesterday\u2019s Fed announcement. One of the main reasons for the post-referendum rally has been the promise of easing from the likes of the ECB, Bank of England and Bank of Japan. With the overnight index swap markets rating the chance of a Bank of England rate cut at 100% next week, it seems like a matter of time until we see some sort of action. However, given that we have seen the post-referendum rally stall after weeks of inaction in Europe, there is a feeling that the FTSE is waiting for some form of stimulus to spark another leg higher. The IMF has been criticised for its handling of the eurozone crisis...by the IMF. Larry Elliott reports: The IMF\u2019s handling of the financial crisis in the eurozone has been criticised by the organisation\u2019s own independent watchdog in a report that says the fund failed to spot the scale of the problem, was guilty of over-optimistic forecasts and left the impression that it was treating Europe differently. While accepting that sorting out the problems of Greece, Ireland and Portugal \u201cposed extraordinary challenges\u201d, the IMF\u2019s Independent Evaluation Office (IEO) said the fund had missed the buildup of banking system risks in some countries and shared the widely held \u201cEurope is different\u201d mindset. The report looked into how the IMF handled the eurozone crisis, which began with the May 2010 bailout of Greece, but subsequently spread to Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus. It found that the \u201cIMF\u2019s pre-crisis surveillance identified the right issues but did not foresee the magnitude of the risks that would later become paramount\u201d. The full story is here: The vast majority of Irish small to medium enterprises believe Brexit is a threat to their business, writes Henry McDonald in Dublin: A survey released today by the British-Irish Chamber of Commence found that out of 400 Irish SMEs 262 of them see Brexit as a threat with far fewer envisaging the post-EU future as an opportunity The research also polled 88 British SMEs who do major business in Ireland. John McGrane, the Director General of the Chamber stressed that the Irish SME sector, which is the largest part of the Republic\u2019s economy, still see the UK as key to their business despite Britain leaving the EU. McGrane said the uncertainty within Irish SME\u2019s over what to do next after the Brexit vote required \u201cjoined up support\u201d from both the Irish and British government and their relevant agencies. He added: \u201cBusiness wants collaborative thinking and the Chamber stands ready to support its members, and Government, to continue to protect and grow the deep trade linkages between the UK and Ireland. We\u2019re ready to join up with likeminded agencies and organisations to ensure all businesses get the most joined-up supports they need to confront the uncertainties, and opportunities, ahead.\u201d The survey was conducted over the weeks following the EU referendum. The expectation of an interest rate cut by the Bank of England continues to put pressure on sterling. The pound has fallen 1% against the euro, hitting a two week low of 84.48p a euro. Against the dollar it is currently down 0.58% at $1.3142. Back with Brexit, and ratings agency S&amp;P Global says the decision to leave the European Union should have little impact on the UK\u2019s project finance initiative. It said: We analyse the effect of Brexit on our U.K. portfolio of over 50 rated transactions, in particular the potential repercussions of a higher inflationary environment, weaker economic growth, and the change in the credit quality of revenues and financial counterparties. While we believe that the risks of adverse economic developments in the U.K. have increased, we expect U.K. private finance initiative (PFI) projects will maintain their credit strength. A day after the US Federal Reserve kept interest rates on hold but suggested there could be a possible hike later this year, US stock markets have slipped lower in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 44 points or 0.22%, while the S&amp;P 500 has slipped 0.29% and Nasdaq 0.14%. Ahead of eurozone GDP figures on Friday, new data from Belgium has shown the country\u2019s economy growing by 0.5% quarter on quarter, despite terrorist attacks and strikes. That compares to 0.2% growth in the first quarter, and analyst expectations of a 0.3% increase. Year on year, the economy grew by 1.4%. Economist Peter Vanden Houte at ING Bank said: According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs the negative impact of the March 22 terrorist attacks in Brussels on hotels, catering and retail trade amounted to about \u20ac180m for the first half of this year. This probably shaved off around 0.1 percentage points from second quarter GDP growth. On top of that, the second quarter saw a rather tense social climate, with several strikes, most notably in public transport. This also weighed on growth. While the GDP components have not been published yet, the improvement in sentiment in industry seems to point to a positive contribution from investment and export. Residential construction most likely also contributed positively. With the situation on the labour market continuing to improve, consumption has probably also expanded, though some negative impact of the terrorist attacks seems likely. All in all today\u2019s figure seems hopeful, as it confirms that the Belgian economy still has some underlying momentum, putting in a strong performance despite the terrorist attacks and the strikes. Certainly, with Brexit and potentially a somewhat tighter fiscal policy, there are new headwinds that might hamper growth in the second half, but we believe that even then a quarterly growth pace of around 0.2% to 0.3% should be feasible. We will await further data confirmation in the coming weeks, but on the back of today\u2019s figures we are likely to have to revise our estimate for Belgian GDP growth upwards to 1.4% (from 1.2%). Earlier, US jobless claims rose by more than expected last week, according to the Labor Department. The number of Americans claiming unemployment benefits grew by 14,000 to 266,000, compared to expectations of an increase to 260,000. The previous week\u2019s level was revised down by 1,000 to 252,000. Weekly claims have been below 300,000, which is seen as a sign of a healthy labour market, for 73 consecutive weeks. Over in Paris, an EDF board member has resigned shortly before the energy company announce whether it will push on with plans to build a new nuclear plant at Britain\u2019s Hinkley Point. Gerard Magnin said the project was risky, and would undermine France\u2019s efforts to develop renewable energy technology. Magnin\u2019s resignation may be a sign that EDF will stick with Hinkley. An announcement is expected later today. Over in America, tech giant Oracle has swooped on cloud computing pioneer NetSuite in a $9.3bn deal. The deal should boost Oracle\u2019s web services offering; its founder, Larry Ellison, is also NetSuite\u2019s largest shareholder. Newsflash from Germany: the country\u2019s inflation rate has jumped to 0.4% this month, up from 0.2% in June. That\u2019s the highest level since January, which should pleas the European Central Bank in its battle to ward off deflation. The overall eurozone inflation reading is due at 10am BST tomorrow. Alex Stubb, Finlands\u2019s former prime minister and finance minister, has warned that it will take a long time for the Brexit drama to play out. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, Stubb said Europe was facing one of its biggest events in decades. It\u2019s a 1952 moment, when the Coal and Steel Community was created, or 1989 when the Cold War ended. This is huge for Europe, there\u2019s no denying it. Stubb, a veteran of the eurozone debt crisis, says Europe is following its usual three-stage approach to Brexit \u2013 first crisis, then chaos, and finally a sub-optimal solution. He adds: It\u2019s going to be a long, long process. What we get at the end of the day, I don\u2019t know. Eurozone companies have defied the fall in consumer confidence, and are actually a little more optimistic this month. The EC\u2019s economic sentiment indicator has risen to 104.6 in July from 104.4 in June. Anna Zabrodzka, economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, says it shows \u201cresilience\u201d to the Brexit vote. Other persistent worries such as the slowing Chinese economy, the immigration wave, and continued tensions with Russia also seem to made little impact on the confidence of consumers and businesses in the euro area. However, risks are skewed to the downside.\u201d Consumer confidence across Europe has fallen this month, driven by a sharp slump in the UK. That\u2019s according to the European Commission\u2019s monthly healthcheck on consumer morale, which fell to -7.9 this month from -7.2 in June. UK consumer confidence, which had been riding relatively high, took a real tumble: The dramatic events of the last few weeks have sent some of us staggering towards the drinks cabinet. But Diageo, the UK-based alcoholic beverages giant, is worried that the Brexit vote may hit sales of its whisky brands overseas, once Britain leaves the EU. Ivan Menezes, chief executive of Diageo, told CNBC that Scotland\u2019s whisky industry is dependent on global trade: Out of Brexit, our focus is really on ensuring that we keep Scotch whisky healthy. The trade agreements in Europe and around the world. You know, Johnnie Walker was in over 100 markets, long before Coca Cola left the shores of America.\u201d As well as Johnnie Walker, Diageo also produces Bell\u2019s whisky, plus several single malts including Talisker and Lagavulin. More Brexit gloom. JCDecaux, the French outdoor advertising group, has said it is likely to cut back its UK investment plans following the decision to leave the EU. JCDecaux, which installs those massive screens at railway stations, airports and London bus shelters, says: Given the uncertainty surrounding the impact of the Brexit decision on the UK economy and advertising revenue, we are reviewing the number of screens we are deploying until we can evaluate the economic conditions and have improved visibility. Union leaders are urging the UK government to act urgently to protect the economy from the impact of the Brexit vote. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says: \u201cThe growing expectation since the Brexit vote of an economic slowdown seems to be a factor. The government needs to act now to secure jobs and investment before thousands of working people pay the price of Brexit with the loss of their job. And Rob MacGregor of Unite is alarmed by Lloyds\u2019s decision to cut an extra 3,000 jobs: \u201cThis announcement is very bad news for workers and their families, and more widely it is a further body blow to the UK economy. \u201cThese are permanent jobs that are being lost. As a country, we can\u2019t afford to lose these jobs in a challenging post-Brexit world. As well publishing half year results which reveal job cuts and branch closures, Lloyds Banking Group has also admitted it is being investigated by the Financial Conduct Authority over the way it handles customers facing difficulty paying their mortgages. There is not much detail but in the results Lloyds said: \u201cIn May, the FCA informed the group that it was commencing an investigation in connection with the group\u2019s mortgage arrears handling. At this stage it is not possible to make an assessment of the outcome of this ongoing review\u201d. Lloyds did not take a provision for the payment protection misselling scandal. But in the first six months of the year the bank took a \u00a3460m to cover a range of so-called \u201cconduct issues\u201d. This included \u00a3215m \u201cin respect of arrears related activities on secured and unsecured retail products, \u00a370m in respect of complaints relating to packaged bank accounts and \u00a350m related to insurance products sold in Germany\u201d. In another worrying sign, a closely-watched survey of consumer confidence has hit its lowest level in three years after the Brexit vote. The monthly index conducted by YouGov and the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) has tumbled to 106.6, the lowest since July 2013, down from 111.3. That\u2019s the biggest one-month drop in six years. The survey found that the public are concerned about the impact of the June referendum, particularly on house prices (how very British!). Stephen Harmston, Head of YouGov Reports, says: \u201cThe public are still absorbing the EU referendum result but it is clear that consumer confidence has taken a significant and clear dive.\u201d Spain is celebrating the news that the country\u2019s jobless rate has hit its lowest level in six years, before the eurozone crisis began. However.... one in five adults are still out of work, and the situation could deteriorate if Europe\u2019s economy suffers from Brexit. Royal Dutch Shell is one of the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 this morning, down 3% after posting a 70% tumble in earnings. It blamed the recent tumble in crude oil prices, which have eaten into its profitability. CEO Ben van Beurden warned shareholders that \u201clower oil prices continue to be a significant challenge across the business.\u201d Inchcape, the UK car dealership, has warned that demand for new cars is weakening, due to the Brexit vote. It told shareholders this morning: Ahead of the EU referendum, the second quarter New Vehicle market growth rate moderated to 1.0% from 5.1% in the first quarter. We expect this moderation of the New Vehicle market to persist into the second half of 2016. Building society Nationwide has reported that house prices were stable in July, rising 0.5% month-on-month. The average house cost \u00a3205,715, 5.2% higher than a year ago. However.... as mortgages are approved towards the end of the process, this doesn\u2019t whether buyers have been spooked by the Brexit vote. Engineering firm Rolls-Royce is also cutting jobs, after reporting an 80% tumble in profits in the first half of 2016. Today\u2019s losses mean Countrywide has shed a third of its value since the referendum, highlighting how the UK\u2019s property sector will suffer from Brexit. It\u2019s a bleak morning in the financial sector too, as Lloyds Banking Group slashes 3,000 jobs. The bank is speeding up its cost-cutting programme, and closing 200 branches as it enters a \u201cperiod of uncertainty\u201d following the Brexit vote. Our City editor Jill Treanor explains that Lloyds is also preparing for interest rates to be slashed next week: The bank is blaming changes to customer behaviour and anticipated cuts to interest rates following the vote for Brexit last month. Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, signalled a rate cut would take place during the summer and the City now expects rates will be cut from their 0.5% historic low on 4 August. More here: And here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 take: Shares in Countrywide has dropped by almost 5% at the start of trading, following its Brexit-induced earnings warning. Britain\u2019s biggest lettings and estate agent group has issued a stark warning that parts of the country\u2019s property market are weakening, since last month\u2019s referendum, Countrywide, which runs 50 different high street brands, admitted that profits this year will be lower than in 2015. And it pins the blame firmly on the decision to leave the EU. According to Countrywide there was a clear market slowdown in May and June. And since the vote, commercial and London residential transactions have stalled, it says, with a \u201cless pronounced impact\u201d on other operations. The number of homes sold subject to contract in London fell 29% in April-June, compared to January-March. Alison Platt, Countrywide\u2019s CEO, says: As we stated in our last Trading Update on 26 April, we took a cautious view of the months leading up to the EU referendum and beyond. In the event, we saw a slowdown in our Retail and London residential businesses and, since the EU referendum result this has become more marked in London, the South East and expensive prime markets. The rest of the country has fared somewhat better and our Lettings business and mortgage trends have been largely unaffected. Countrywide also posted a 25% tumble in adjusted pretax profits for the first half of 2016, and warned of more challenges ahead. As Platt put it says: This period of uncertainty will inevitably impact the level of transactional activity in the second half of the year and, although it is too early to quantify accurately, we will not meet last year\u2019s result at the EBITDA level. Here\u2019s a round-up of Countrywide\u2019s brands: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Five weeks after the European Union referendum, we\u2019re now seeing signs that the vote to leave the EU is hitting the UK economy. Three influential surveys released overnight have shown worrying signs that Britain\u2019s car industry, retail sector and building companies are all suffering from the Brexit vote. In a worrying cocktail, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said its members were gloomy about the prospects for growth, jobs and investment; the British Retail Consortium said jobs were being shed in the months leading up to the referendum; and RICS \u2013 the body that represents chartered surveyors \u2013 said workloads for construction had weakened. It\u2019s a clear signal that the uncertainty created by June\u2019s vote is starting to hit demand, confidence and activity. The SMMT\u2019s chief executive, Mike Hawes warned that Britain\u2019s car revival has been underpinned by \u201ctariff-free access to the single market\u201d, so losing that access would be a serious blow. Here\u2019s the full story: This all rather takes the shine off yesterday\u2019s forecast-beating growth figures, which showed the UK\u2019s GDP expanded by 0.6% in the last quarter. Also coming up... Investors are pondering whether the US central bank might manage to raise interest rates soon, despite the Brexit risk. Last night, the Federal Reserve declared that the US jobs recovery had picked up momentum, and the near-term risks to the US economy had diminished. Intriguingly,the Fed also declared that: \u201cNear-term risks to the economic outlook have diminished.\u201d Perhaps a hint that the EU referendum hasn\u2019t caused as much market mayhem as feared. Over in Paris, French energy company EDF is deciding whether to give the go-ahead for an \u00a318bn nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset. The rumours are that the project will go ahead, despite concerns over cost and safety: And there\u2019s a blizzard of corporate results this morning, sending my Reuters machine into overdrive as companies clear the decks before the August lull. That include Lloyds Banking Group, BT, Countrywide, Thomas Cook, Diageo, Rolls Royce, Royal Dutch Shell, BAE and Sky. We\u2019ll pick the best bits out...",

                "bodyText":"Profits at Foxtons fell by 42% in the first six months of the year as uncertainty and confusion caused by the EU referendum led to a slump in property sales, with the estate agent warning that the downturn in London\u2019s housing market would continue at least until the end of 2016. Foxtons\u2019 pre-tax profit dropped to \u00a310.5m over the period, from \u00a318.1m a year earlier. Property sales volumes were down by 10.2%, pushing revenues 7% lower to \u00a331.3m. Lettings revenues also suffered in the run-up to the referendum on 23 June, declining by 2.7% to \u00a332.6m. Foxtons scrapped a special dividend as it said the Brexit vote had caused a prolonged period of further uncertainty. Nic Budden, the Foxtons chief executive, told analysts and investors: \u201cCertainly, interesting times in the first half ... As the EU referendum debate continued, uncertainty and confusion among customers and clients did lead to significantly weaker market conditions. \u201cWe are anticipating relatively weak market volumes through to the end of the year. We\u2019ll probably just take our foot off the pedal a little bit in 2017, naturally taking a more cautious approach to investment while the market settles down.\u201d Budden said Foxtons would scale back its aggressive expansion plans next year, after opening seven new branches this year. \u201cIt won\u2019t be seven next year and it won\u2019t be zero,\u201d he said.

Foxtons\u2019 results came a day after a profit warning from Countrywide, the UK\u2019s biggest estate agent. It said commercial and London residential transactions had stalled following the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU. However, property website Rightmove and housebuilder Taylor Wimpey have shrugged off the impact of the Brexit vote, although they also warned of increased uncertainty and said it was too early to assess the long-term impact of the referendum result. The year had started well for Foxtons. Revenues in the first quarter hit a record high as property investors rushed to complete deals before the introduction in April of additional stamp duty for buy-to-let properties and second homes.

The final figure for the previous month was 93.5. The survey\u2019s chief economist Richard Curtin said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Although confidence strengthened in late July, for the month as a whole the Sentiment Index was still below last month\u2019s level mainly due to increased concerns about economic prospects among upper income households.</p> <p>The Brexit vote was spontaneously mentioned by record numbers of households with incomes in the top third (23%), more than twice as frequently as among households with incomes in the bottom two-thirds (11%). Given the prompt rebound in stock prices as well as the tiny direct impact on U.S. trade, it is surprising that concerns about Brexit remained nearly as high in late July as immediately following the Brexit vote.</p> <p>While concerns about Brexit are likely to quickly recede, weaker prospects for the economy are likely to remain. Uncertainties surrounding global economic prospects and the presidential election will keep consumers more cautious in their expectations for future economic growth. Based on the strength in personal finances and low interest rates, real consumer spending is now expected to rise by 2.6% through mid 2017.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile the Chicago purchasing managers index has come in at 55.8 in July, better than the expected 54 but below the 56.8 recorded in June.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/spreadexfins/status/759021955320254464\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">USA Chicago PMI announcement -  Actual: 55.8, Expected: 54.0 <a href=\"https://t.co/2kaIjr8fQH\">pic.twitter.com/2kaIjr8fQH</a></p>&mdash; Spreadex (@spreadexfins) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/spreadexfins/status/759021955320254464\">July 29, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><em>On that note it\u2019s time to close for the day.

Former Anglo Irish Bank treasury official John Bowe was handed down a two year prison sentence. Denis Casey, the former Irish Life &amp; Permanent chief executive was sentence to two years in jail</p> <p>The sentences were delivered at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court on Friday by Judge Mr Martin Nolan. The judge said all the men had behaved in a \u201creprehensible manner\u201d and knew that they were doing was wrong. The trio stood accused of doctoring Anglo Irish Bank\u2019s books to make it look like it had \u20ac7.2bn in its accounts. They faced charges of moving money illegally between the Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Life&amp;Permanent.</p> <p>Judge Nolan said the case was one where \u201chonesty and integrity was sorely lacking.\u201d Addressing the role of McAteer in the illegal scheme, Judge Nolan said: \u201cIt is grossly reprehensible what he did and a great shame.\u201d</p> <p>All three men had pleaded not guilty during a trial that has lasted 89 days. During sentencing the judge also singled out the firm Ernst &amp; Young for its role in signing off Anglo Irish Bank\u2019s accounts: \u201cIt beggars belief that Ernst &amp; Young signed off on the accounts. How they signed off on the accounts as true and fair is a mystery to me.\u201d</p> <p>Judge Nolan added: \u201cThey should have known what was occurring if they were doing their job properly.\u201d</p> <p>In 2009 following the global financial crash Anglo Irish Bank was nationalised with the Irish taxpayer having to pay \u20ac30bn to rescue it. The bank was once the preferred bank of builders and property speculators. The sharp practices at the bank during the Celtic Tiger boom when it allowed Irish developers and investors to pay the global property market caused national outrage in Ireland.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-579b5960e4b09895e25092c3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jana-kasperkevic\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-29T13:26:33.586Z\">2.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s our report on the US GDP figures:</p> <blockquote> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">US economy</a> grew by just 1.2% from April to June, the US Department of Commerce announced on Friday, as cut backs by businesses wiped out a rise in consumer spending.</p> <p>The lower-than-expected figure is the latest in a series of disappointing economic numbers attributed to growing uncertainty among consumers and businesses, both of whom are keeping a tighter rein on spending. </p> <p>Economists polled by Reuters had expected the US government to report that gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 the broadest measure of the economy\u2019s health \u2013 would increase <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-idUSKCN1071IS\">at a 2.6% annual rate</a> after rising at a rate of 1.1% in the first quarter. </p> <p>The 1.1% figure was revised down to 0.8% on Friday.

With global risk appetite tentative on the back of the EU Referendum results, the global powerhouse of the US is often seen as a precursor to global performance. If these preliminary figures signify a shift on the downside for the domestic economy in the US, not only will rate hikes be unlikely this year, but the benchmark for global risk will be adversely affected in the medium term. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-579b541be4b075867609e5ee\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-29T13:05:07.552Z\">2.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JonesTheMarkets/status/759011280531234816\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Dollar taking a bit of a belated pounding now after the GDP release, two week high in gold.</p>&mdash; David Jones (@JonesTheMarkets) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JonesTheMarkets/status/759011280531234816\">July 29, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The pound is now up 0.5% against the US currency at $1.3232.

Indeed, with recent evidence tentatively suggesting that the recent shortfall in job creation was a temporary blip and inflation gradually moving in the right direction, there is fairly minimal cause for concern regarding the domestic economic picture.</p> <p>However, the Federal Reserve Open Markets Committee has got its eye firmly on \u201cglobal economic and financial developments\u201d, which we think refers to uncertainty following Brexit and forthcoming political developments in the US and Europe. Thus, whilst the domestic economic picture may be sufficiently strong for another hike, the Fed will likely maintain its current cautious (although broadly positive) stance in September and ahead of the US Presidential Election in November. That said, assuming the domestic economy continues to head in the right direction, then we think there is a strong likelihood of a rate hike in early 2017.

Managing economist Danae Kyriakopoulou said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Data released today by Eurostat showed that the pace of quarter-on-quarter GDP expansion across the Eurozone slowed to 0.3% during the second quarter of 2016.

Importantly, today\u2019s release refers to economic growth in the three months to June, ahead of the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU which is widely expected to negatively impact on the currency bloc. Cebr expects growth to weaken further over the remaining quarters of this year and next....</p> <p>We maintain our view that monetary policy has largely reached its limits in terms of the support it can provide to the recovery and that it needs to be complemented by non-monetary stimulus measures in order to succeed. In that respect, this week\u2019s decision to by-pass the rules of the Stability and Growth pact and not fine Spain and Portugal for breaching the 3% deficit threshold is a welcome move by the European Commission.

And the second quarter growth figure of 0.3% is likely to be revised, he adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After the strong growth in the first quarter (+0.6%), which was helped by some temporary factors like the mild winter weather, it was no surprise that there would be some pay-back in the second quarter.</p> <p>The disappointing 0% growth in France, largely due to a decline in inventories, was one of the culprits behind the weaker Eurozone growth performance. Bear in mind though, that in a number of big member states, comprising Germany and Italy, GDP figures still have to be published, implying that today\u2019s figure is prone to revision.</p> <p>While no demand components have been published yet, we believe that household consumption remained an important growth driver for the Eurozone, as unemployment continued to fall over the previous quarter. Looking at the European Commission\u2019s sentiment indicators, exports probably didn\u2019t play a major role in second quarter growth, though we still pencil in a positive growth contribution.</p> <p>The third quarter started on a good footing, but it is probably too soon to start downplaying the potential negative impact of Brexit on Eurozone growth.</p> <p>In a separate report the flash HICP inflation estimate was published, showing that headline inflation came out at 0.2% in July, slightly higher than expected.</p> <p>Today\u2019s set of data gives policy makers only limited comfort. The good news is that the economy still has some momentum, though there is little acceleration to be expected as long as the Brexit story continues to inject some uncertainty into the external environment. At the same time, inflation remains uncomfortably low, whilst the ECB\u2019s toolbox is getting emptier. The ECB looks set to remain in a wait-and-see mode, but we can imagine that the pressure to come up with something new will increase again, especially if growth shifts more decisively into a lower gear.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38d47b2c6c22f9c8f3a9461f38ed5ae3d36804b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38d47b2c6c22f9c8f3a9461f38ed5ae3d36804b0/0_0_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"French economy and industry minister Emmanuel Macron.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">French economy and industry minister Emmanuel Macron.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bertrand Guay/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-07-29T09:59:46.234Z\">at 10.59am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-579b20f0e4b00eff095cd845\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-29T09:28:28.631Z\">10.28am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is probably pleased that eurozone inflation is creeping up, although it is still far shy of his 2% target.

This is in line with expectations that first quarter\u2019s consumption rebound could not last without more signs of higher employment growth. Government actions to boost corporate investment seem to have been less effective in the second quarter while net exports remained the weak spot of the French economy. If employment growth fails to accelerate, the risks materializing from the Brexit shock could lead to further weaknesses in the second half of this year.</p> <p>...It should be noted that the US and the UK were large contributors to growth last year, which helped limiting the negative net export growth contribution of 2015 to -0.3%. With the Brexit risk materializing and a weaker US dollar, this position will probably deteriorate further in the second half of the year.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>After the Brexit shock, we have revised our GDP growth forecast downwards to 1.4% in 2016 after 1.2% in 2015, and to 1.1% in 2017. With no room for manoeuvre left as far as reforms are concerned, the French economy can only count upon the stimulus added by recent policies (lowering labour costs and giving investment tax breaks). We think this will not be enough to secure a stronger recovery path before the 2017 Presidential election, especially if employment growth does not accelerate strongly in the near term.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>But Spain, despite its political troubles, is performing well. ING\u2019s Geoffrey Minne says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Once again, Spanish figures remain strong and GDP growth rate of 3.2% year on year leaves Spain as a solid leader among large Eurozone countries.</p> <p>Looking at the economic situation, nearly everything seems to continue in the right direction...While the detail about GDP components is not available yet, we suspect consumption to be at the heart of the recovery, as households still benefited from the same cocktail of rising real earnings, decreasing unemployment and rebounding housing prices. The second good news of today is that the inflation rate continues to move towards the positive territory. The harmonized CPI went progressively from -1.2% year on year in April to -0.9% in June and -0.6% in July.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d07c239c3388e9ec44f10326c9ff453fd71ca8c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d07c239c3388e9ec44f10326c9ff453fd71ca8c7/0_116_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spain\u2019s acting prime minister Rajoy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spain\u2019s acting prime minister Rajoy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Juan Medina/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>Looking at the political situation, nearly everything seems to go wrong.

                "bodyText":"US consumers were less confident in July than the previous month, according to a new survey, partly due to the Brexit vote. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index came in at 90 for July, lower than the 90.5 expected but up on the preliminary reading of 89.5. The final figure for the previous month was 93.5. The survey\u2019s chief economist Richard Curtin said: Although confidence strengthened in late July, for the month as a whole the Sentiment Index was still below last month\u2019s level mainly due to increased concerns about economic prospects among upper income households. The Brexit vote was spontaneously mentioned by record numbers of households with incomes in the top third (23%), more than twice as frequently as among households with incomes in the bottom two-thirds (11%). Given the prompt rebound in stock prices as well as the tiny direct impact on U.S. trade, it is surprising that concerns about Brexit remained nearly as high in late July as immediately following the Brexit vote. While concerns about Brexit are likely to quickly recede, weaker prospects for the economy are likely to remain. Uncertainties surrounding global economic prospects and the presidential election will keep consumers more cautious in their expectations for future economic growth. Based on the strength in personal finances and low interest rates, real consumer spending is now expected to rise by 2.6% through mid 2017. Meanwhile the Chicago purchasing managers index has come in at 55.8 in July, better than the expected 54 but below the 56.8 recorded in June. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. Following the weaker than expected US GDP figures, as well as disappointing results from Exxon and Chevron, it is no surprise that US markets have opened lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 27 points or 0.15% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.08% lower. But Nasdaq edged up 0.14% after positive updates from Alphabet and Amazon. Meanwhile over in Ireland, three bankers from banks that almost bankrupted Ireland have been sent to jail today by a Dublin court, writes Ireland correspondent Henry McDonald: The trio from the now defunct Anglo Irish Bank and the taxpayer rescued Irish Life &amp; Permanent were given prison sentences for their part in a conspiracy to inflate the accounts of financial institutions by \u20ac7.2 bn. Ex-Anglo Irish Bank chief risk officer Willie McAteer has been sentenced to three and a half years. Former Anglo Irish Bank treasury official John Bowe was handed down a two year prison sentence. Denis Casey, the former Irish Life &amp; Permanent chief executive was sentence to two years in jail The sentences were delivered at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court on Friday by Judge Mr Martin Nolan. The judge said all the men had behaved in a \u201creprehensible manner\u201d and knew that they were doing was wrong. The trio stood accused of doctoring Anglo Irish Bank\u2019s books to make it look like it had \u20ac7.2bn in its accounts. They faced charges of moving money illegally between the Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Life&amp;Permanent. Judge Nolan said the case was one where \u201chonesty and integrity was sorely lacking.\u201d Addressing the role of McAteer in the illegal scheme, Judge Nolan said: \u201cIt is grossly reprehensible what he did and a great shame.\u201d All three men had pleaded not guilty during a trial that has lasted 89 days. During sentencing the judge also singled out the firm Ernst &amp; Young for its role in signing off Anglo Irish Bank\u2019s accounts: \u201cIt beggars belief that Ernst &amp; Young signed off on the accounts. How they signed off on the accounts as true and fair is a mystery to me.\u201d Judge Nolan added: \u201cThey should have known what was occurring if they were doing their job properly.\u201d In 2009 following the global financial crash Anglo Irish Bank was nationalised with the Irish taxpayer having to pay \u20ac30bn to rescue it. The bank was once the preferred bank of builders and property speculators. The sharp practices at the bank during the Celtic Tiger boom when it allowed Irish developers and investors to pay the global property market caused national outrage in Ireland. Here\u2019s our report on the US GDP figures: The US economy grew by just 1.2% from April to June, the US Department of Commerce announced on Friday, as cut backs by businesses wiped out a rise in consumer spending. The lower-than-expected figure is the latest in a series of disappointing economic numbers attributed to growing uncertainty among consumers and businesses, both of whom are keeping a tighter rein on spending. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the US government to report that gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 the broadest measure of the economy\u2019s health \u2013 would increase at a 2.6% annual rate after rising at a rate of 1.1% in the first quarter. The 1.1% figure was revised down to 0.8% on Friday. The economy has now grown at an annual rate of less than 2% for three straight quarters. The full story is here: And here\u2019s a chart showing how US GDP has been revised in the past: Alex Lydall, senior sales trader at foreign exchange business Foenix Partners, also believes a US rate rise is now unlikely this year: Janet Yellen will continue to sit on the fence with interest rates for the foreseeable future on disappointing news this afternoon that US GDP increased to a sluggish 1.2%, on preliminary figures where analysts had expectations of an uplift to 2.6%. Rhetoric from the Federal Reserve lately has been somewhat cautious, meaning the significant miss of growth figures will put the bearish committee members back in the driving seat. With global risk appetite tentative on the back of the EU Referendum results, the global powerhouse of the US is often seen as a precursor to global performance. If these preliminary figures signify a shift on the downside for the domestic economy in the US, not only will rate hikes be unlikely this year, but the benchmark for global risk will be adversely affected in the medium term. The pound is now up 0.5% against the US currency at $1.3232. The dollar has weakened against the euro to $1.1132, a level last seen on 15 July while the yen has also extended its gains against the US currency. Despite a weaker than expected US GDP number, the underlying picture is more mixed, said economist James Smith at ING Bank: The US economy grew by less than expected in the second quarter, growing by just 1.2% quarter on quarter (annualised). That said, the underlying picture is on balance slightly more encouraging than this headline suggests. Consumption in particular was very strong, increasing by 4.2% quarter on quarter(annualised) and follows some solid retail sales data over the past few months. There was also a large drag from inventories, which shaved -1.16% from the headline, which given that this in the most part is simply noise, the underlying growth picture was probably closer to 2% in the second quarter. However, business investment continues to provide some cause for concern...There were also a series of negative backward revisions to overall GDP, suggesting that trend growth has been slightly lower over the past year or so than previously thought. Overall though, this release is probably fairly neutral for the Fed, with strong consumer activity balancing out with the fall in investment. Indeed, with recent evidence tentatively suggesting that the recent shortfall in job creation was a temporary blip and inflation gradually moving in the right direction, there is fairly minimal cause for concern regarding the domestic economic picture. However, the Federal Reserve Open Markets Committee has got its eye firmly on \u201cglobal economic and financial developments\u201d, which we think refers to uncertainty following Brexit and forthcoming political developments in the US and Europe. Thus, whilst the domestic economic picture may be sufficiently strong for another hike, the Fed will likely maintain its current cautious (although broadly positive) stance in September and ahead of the US Presidential Election in November. That said, assuming the domestic economy continues to head in the right direction, then we think there is a strong likelihood of a rate hike in early 2017. We may see FOMC speakers trying to guide markets closer to this point over coming days and weeks. Pointing out the US GDP figures were subject to revision, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, said: The increase in real GDP in the second quarter reflected positive contributions from personal consumption expenditures and exports that were partly offset by negative contributions from private inventory investment, nonresidential fixed investment, residential fixed investment, and state and local government spending. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, decreased. Further mixed signals from the US economy, with second quarter annualised GDP growth coming in at 1.2%, much lower than the 2.6% expected by analysts but up from the 0.8% seen in the first quarter. The figures back up the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision not to raise interest rates this week. And they may not necessarily rule out an increase later in the year although they do seen to make it less likely. Ahead of US GDP data here are the expected openings on US markets: Back with the markets, and European shares are trying to edge higher following the eurozone GDP figures, with Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.37% and France\u2019s Cac climbing 0.07%. But the FTSE 100 has dipped 0.2%, not helped by a near 10% plunge in education group Pearson reported a bigger than expected 7% fall in half year sales and said it would cut 4,000 jobs as part of a restructuring programme. Ahead of the results of the latest European banking stress tests, one of the most troubled of a troubled Italian banking system is seeking a solution to its difficulties: An eleventh hour rescue deal has been tabled for Italy\u2019s Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS), the world\u2019s oldest bank, as investors and pensioners alike brace for the result of an official assessment of its financial health. European regulators release the results of a so-called stress test of MPS, Italy\u2019s third largest bank, and 50 other banks across the EU which are being assessed after the close of US markets on Friday. The results will be closely followed by investors around the world but particularly in Italy, where worse-than-expected news could set off a chain of events that may have drastic consequences for thousands of ordinary Italian investors who bought debt in the bank. The results of the stress tests have already been sent to the banks but will only be made public at 9pm London time. There is concern that an acute banking crisis in Italy, led by troubles at MPS but possibly other banks as well, could ignite European and global banking crises. Ahead of the stress test results, the board of the troubled Italian bank was meeting to weigh up to potential solutions: the last-minute offer received on Thursday night from the former chief executive of Intesa Sanpaolo, Corrado Passsera, and the Swiss bank UBS; and a rescue plan being co-ordinated by JP Morgan and Mediobanca. However, the MPS board is likely to reject the UBS offer, sources told Reuters. The full story is here: Domestic demand in the eurozone is likely to help offset any problems caused by the UK\u2019s Brexit vote, said economist Marco Valli at UniCredit Research: The high volatility of GDP data in the first half of the year probably mainly reflects temporary factors (supportive in the first quarter of 2016, negative in the second quarter), while the underlying growth trend seems to have remained reasonably steady, at least when looking at the most informative survey indicators. Therefore, today\u2019s data do not change the fundamental story. We expect signs of moderate slowdown to emerge in the coming months, mainly reflecting the Brexit fallout via the trade channel and, to a lesser extent, the confidence channel. However, the resilience of eurozone domestic demand on the back of improved fundamentals for consumption and investment is likely to provide a good buffer. The Centre for Economics and Business Research also expects a slowdown in the coming months and warns other measures on top of monetary policy may be needed to support the economy. Managing economist Danae Kyriakopoulou said: Data released today by Eurostat showed that the pace of quarter-on-quarter GDP expansion across the Eurozone slowed to 0.3% during the second quarter of 2016. This confirms Cebr\u2019s view back in April that first quarter\u2019s impressive 0.6% growth was yet another false dawn for the currency bloc. Importantly, today\u2019s release refers to economic growth in the three months to June, ahead of the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU which is widely expected to negatively impact on the currency bloc. Cebr expects growth to weaken further over the remaining quarters of this year and next.... We maintain our view that monetary policy has largely reached its limits in terms of the support it can provide to the recovery and that it needs to be complemented by non-monetary stimulus measures in order to succeed. In that respect, this week\u2019s decision to by-pass the rules of the Stability and Growth pact and not fine Spain and Portugal for breaching the 3% deficit threshold is a welcome move by the European Commission. Further flexibility, leniency, and initiative on other levers of economic policy, particularly among those economies that can afford it, will be key in ensuring a sustainable recovery for the Eurozone going forward. The eurozone GDP figures show the economy is still growing but inflation remains uncomfortably low, says Peter Vanden Houte at ING Bank. And the second quarter growth figure of 0.3% is likely to be revised, he adds: After the strong growth in the first quarter (+0.6%), which was helped by some temporary factors like the mild winter weather, it was no surprise that there would be some pay-back in the second quarter. The disappointing 0% growth in France, largely due to a decline in inventories, was one of the culprits behind the weaker Eurozone growth performance. Bear in mind though, that in a number of big member states, comprising Germany and Italy, GDP figures still have to be published, implying that today\u2019s figure is prone to revision. While no demand components have been published yet, we believe that household consumption remained an important growth driver for the Eurozone, as unemployment continued to fall over the previous quarter. Looking at the European Commission\u2019s sentiment indicators, exports probably didn\u2019t play a major role in second quarter growth, though we still pencil in a positive growth contribution. The third quarter started on a good footing, but it is probably too soon to start downplaying the potential negative impact of Brexit on Eurozone growth. In a separate report the flash HICP inflation estimate was published, showing that headline inflation came out at 0.2% in July, slightly higher than expected. Today\u2019s set of data gives policy makers only limited comfort. The good news is that the economy still has some momentum, though there is little acceleration to be expected as long as the Brexit story continues to inject some uncertainty into the external environment. At the same time, inflation remains uncomfortably low, whilst the ECB\u2019s toolbox is getting emptier. The ECB looks set to remain in a wait-and-see mode, but we can imagine that the pressure to come up with something new will increase again, especially if growth shifts more decisively into a lower gear. The European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is probably pleased that eurozone inflation is creeping up, although it is still far shy of his 2% target. Alex Lydall, senior sales trader at Foenix Partners, said: A subtle smile will likely creep across Mario Draghi\u2019s face this morning as an uplift in eurozone CPI figures for July (0.2%) gives an element of breathing space which perhaps market participants were not expecting. In what is now a post-Brexit era, little has been noted of the impact on the eurozone, rather focus has largely been on the UK, so solid GDP figures this morning and the inflation rise will give hope that the eurozone is (at least) starting this era on an improved status. Negative sentiment is rife and global impacts largely unknown at present, but as Draghi recently pointed out, the initial headwinds have been dealt with efficiently, and the rest remains to be unknown. One step at a time, but for now, measurable success is emanating from the eurozone. Peter Read, co-founder of trading network Pelican, said: ECB President Mario Draghi will be relieved to see the encouraging inflation data released today, which swiftly followed strong numbers from the two pillars of the eurozone, Germany and France. Yet Draghi will know that hitting his own two per cent yearly growth target for the eurozone off the back of strong German and French economies alone will be difficult. Uncertainty about the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU won\u2019t be going away anytime soon, and many observers are now casting nervous looks at the troubled Italian banking sector to see whether the positives from the rest of the continent will be overshadowed by yet another crisis. The eurozone GDP figures do not really include any effects of the Brexit vote, of course. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: After a strong first quarter for eurozone GDP it comes as little surprise that second quarter growth has slowed. The effect of the UK\u2019s Brexit vote hasn\u2019t set in yet, although many will expect numbers to continue to slide. We\u2019ve already seen the Bank of Japan underwhelm the markets this morning with just a modest expansion of its stimulus programme, and it will be the Bank of England\u2019s turn to announce its policy decision next week. These are testing times for central banks all over the world and the markets are looking for swift and strong action. There are also inflation and unemployment figures out from the European Union. Eurozone inflation came in higher than expect in July, up 0.2% from 0.1% in June according to the initial estimate from Eurostat. It said: Looking at the main components of euro area inflation, food, alcohol &amp; tobacco is expected to have the highest annual rate in July (1.4%, compared with 0.9% June), followed by services (1.2%, compared with 1.1% in June), non-energy industrial goods (0.4%, stable compared with June) and energy (-6.6%, compared with -6.4% in June). Meanwhile the eurozone unemployment rate for June came in as expected at 10.1%. Eurostat said: The euro area seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate was 10.1% in June 2016, stable compared to May 2016 and down from 11.0% in June 2015. This remains the lowest rate recorded in the euro area since July 2011. The EU28 unemployment rate was 8.6% in June 2016, stable compared to May 2016 and down from 9.5% in June 2015. This remains the lowest rate recorded in the EU28 since March 2009. In the wider European Union, the 28 member states saw GDP rise by 0.4% quarter on quarter, down from 0.5%. Year on year, EU GDP came in unchanges at 1.8%. The eurozone economy slowed in the second quarter, but performed slightly better than expected. GDP growth came in at 0.3% quarter on quarter, down from 0.6% in the first three months of the year but in line with forecasts. Year on year the rise was 1.6%, down from 1.7% but higher than the expected figure of 1.5%. Oil continues to come under pressure on worries of a supply glut and slowing demand. On Thursday West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - entered bear market territory by falling 20% below its June high. Now Brent crude has followed suit: In the weeks leading up to the EU referendum, UK mortgage approvals fell to their lowest level since May 2015. But lending to consumers rose at its fastest pace for nearly 11 years, according to new Bank of England figures. The Bank said 64,766 mortgages were approved compared with 66,722 in May, below analyst expectations of a figure of 65,650. As for consumer lending, it jumped by 10.3% year on year although this may slow down in the months following the referendum, if the latest drop in consumer confidence is any guide. German retail sales for June seemed to have held up in the run-up to the UK\u2019s referendum. Reuters reports: German retail sales fell by 0.1 percent on the month in June but a stronger-than-forecast yearly rise suggested consumer spending, which is expected to drive growth this year, remains a pillar of support for the economy as foreign trade weakens. The volatile indicator, which is often subject to revision, was in line with expectations in a Reuters poll for a 0.1 percent monthly drop, data from the Federal Statistics Office showed on Friday. The monthly data for May was revised down to a rise of 0.7 from a previously reported increase of 0.9 percent. On the year, annual retail sales in Europe\u2019s largest economy climbed by 2.7 percent in real terms - far more than the 1.3 percent increase forecast by economists in a Reuters poll. France\u2019s economy could weaken further after the Brexit vote, says ING economist Julien Manceaux: French GDP growth slowed to 0.0% in the second quarter. This is in line with expectations that first quarter\u2019s consumption rebound could not last without more signs of higher employment growth. Government actions to boost corporate investment seem to have been less effective in the second quarter while net exports remained the weak spot of the French economy. If employment growth fails to accelerate, the risks materializing from the Brexit shock could lead to further weaknesses in the second half of this year. ...It should be noted that the US and the UK were large contributors to growth last year, which helped limiting the negative net export growth contribution of 2015 to -0.3%. With the Brexit risk materializing and a weaker US dollar, this position will probably deteriorate further in the second half of the year. After the Brexit shock, we have revised our GDP growth forecast downwards to 1.4% in 2016 after 1.2% in 2015, and to 1.1% in 2017. With no room for manoeuvre left as far as reforms are concerned, the French economy can only count upon the stimulus added by recent policies (lowering labour costs and giving investment tax breaks). We think this will not be enough to secure a stronger recovery path before the 2017 Presidential election, especially if employment growth does not accelerate strongly in the near term. But Spain, despite its political troubles, is performing well. ING\u2019s Geoffrey Minne says: Once again, Spanish figures remain strong and GDP growth rate of 3.2% year on year leaves Spain as a solid leader among large Eurozone countries. Looking at the economic situation, nearly everything seems to continue in the right direction...While the detail about GDP components is not available yet, we suspect consumption to be at the heart of the recovery, as households still benefited from the same cocktail of rising real earnings, decreasing unemployment and rebounding housing prices. The second good news of today is that the inflation rate continues to move towards the positive territory. The harmonized CPI went progressively from -1.2% year on year in April to -0.9% in June and -0.6% in July. Looking at the political situation, nearly everything seems to go wrong. After two election rounds, no concrete solution is on the table and even if Rajoy would like to see a government in the beginning of August, it seems unlikely. All in all, political turmoil has barely scratched GDP growth and job creation in the first semester and Spain has appeared more resilient than expected. The effect of Brexit and national political uncertainty can still suddenly come into play but with current tailwinds, GDP growth in 2016 is set to hover around 3%. However until the end of the year, slippages are possible, caused by political events be it in Barcelona or in Madrid. The French GDP figures could be a bad omen for the forthcoming eurozone GDP figures, says Capital Economics: Another warning about the UK property market - London in particular - in the wake of the Brexit vote, this time from estate agency Foxtons. Despite a second election in six months during the second quarter, Spain\u2019s economy still managed to show steady growth. Spain\u2019s GDP rose by 0.7% quarter on quarter between April and June, in line with expectations and up 3.2% year on year. Earlier in the week, Spain avoided a fine from the European Union over its budget deficit and was given an extra two years to achieve a target for its deficit to be no more than 3% of GDP. Portugal was given similar dispensation. Contrary to expectations, the FTSE 100 has fallen in early trading, down 14 points or 0.2%. Barclays is leading the risers, up 4% after its results while British Airways owner International Airlines Group is down nearly 2% after it reported a lower than expected 4.7% rise in second quarter profit and said it no longer expected to grow 2016 profits by \u20ac900m as it had forecast in February. But Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac both opened 0.4% higher. Ahead of the eurozone GDP figures, Unicredit analysts say they expect a modest expansion in the second quarter: After a strong first quarter, GDP growth likely weakened in the second quarter of 2016: we forecast +0.3% quarter on quarter, with risks tilted to the downside. Hard data suggest that private consumption and construction investment slowed substantially, while the trade channel is unlikely to have picked up the slack. On the output side, industrial production lost traction. There are also eurozone inflation and unemployment figures due, while in the UK we get mortgage approvals for June, and in the US, second quarter GDP. Back to the French GDP numbers, and in volume terms growth was flat in the second quarter after a 0.7% rise in the previous three months. Household expenditure fell sharply from 1.2% to flat, while imports dropped by 1.3% and exports declined by 0.3%. Year on year, GDP grew by 1.4% compared to 1.3% previously but below forecasts of a 1.6% increase. And here\u2019s how the French GDP figures break down: Here are the forecasts for the European market open. Meanwhile the Nikkei is currently up 0.56% while the Hang Seng has slipped 0.86%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The eurozone economy will be in the spotlight today with growth figures for the second quarter - the run up to the UK\u2019s Brexit vote - expected to show a slowdown. But bear in mind that UK second quarter GDP ended up being better than forecasts despite the concerns about the referendum. Meanwhile the Bank of Japan has disappointed the market with its latest stimulus package, leaving interest rates at their previous negative level but slightly boosting its stimulus package. Our story is here: Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said the disappointment from the new Japanese measures could put more pressure on Bank of England governor Mark Carney. The B0E is odds on to cut interest rates next week but the scope for an underwhelming result here has increased, said Lawler: The Bank of Japan has eased policy but it hasn\u2019t impressed markets...The Japanese yen has rallied against every major currency following the BOJ announcement, taking USD/JPY down 200 pips to 103. Further declines for another test of the key 100 level appear likely. It was a missed opportunity for the BOJ to have done more at its first meeting after Prime Minister Abe was re-elected with a new mandate to expand Abenomics. Even the Japanese stock market, which is the single biggest beneficiary of the policy change saw shares drop, with the Nikkei choppy before falling nearly 1%. The shift into the yen, typically perceived as a haven asset will have repercussions on demand for risky assets including European stocks. The impact of Japan\u2019s weak monetary stimulus is being interpreted differently across Europe..... Mark Carney has boxed the Bank of England into a corner, with market expectations now 100% that it will cut interest rates in August, primarily because of his \u201cmore monetary easing by summer\u201d comment. The Bank of Japan\u2019s governor Kuroda appears to have felt compelled to act given the weight of expectation but has delivered something underwhelming. Mark Carney might be at risk of doing the same. Back with eurozone GDP and the figures will be scoured for any sign of a Brexit effect. The agenda looks like this: The figures from France are already out and show a flat performance compared to expectations of a 0.2% rise quarter on quarter: More on that in a moment. Also high on the agenda are the results of the latest European banking stress tests, with Italian banks in particular in the spotlight on concerns about their balance sheets and non-performing loans. The report is due out after the close of the US market. Speaking of banks, Barclays has just reported a 10% fall in half year underlying profit. Elsewhere there are updates from British Airways owner International Airlines Group, and there is likely to be more fallout from the last minute delay to the Hinkley Point C nuclear deal with EDF:",

It is unknown how much of each year\u2019s total might be dog or cat leather.</p> <p>The controversy over dog leather reached new heights in 2014 when an undercover investigator working for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) Asia discovered that dogs were being killed for leather production in China. According to Peta, which is calling on American consumers to forgo all leather goods in favor of vegan substitutes, employees at the facility said that 100-200 dogs were killed there a day and confirmed that the resulting leather was intended for export to and sale in the US market. The investigation shone a light on the underreported underbelly of the animal industry in China, which currently has no comprehensive animal welfare law.</p> <p>\u201cThe dog leather investigation we did, groups that are in the country with us really had no idea,\u201d said Jason Baker, Peta Asia\u2019s vice-president of international operations. \u201cWhile [the investigations] shock people internationally, they also shock people in China.\u201d</p> <p>Peta\u2019s footage of the dog slaughterhouse spurred congressional interest. In December 2015, Democratic congressman Alcee Hastings <a href=\"http://www.peta.org/blog/congress-member-alcee-l-hastings-seeks-inquiry-into-dog-leather-entering-u-s-marketplace/\">joined</a> colleagues Dina Titus and Steve Cohen in sending <a href=\"http://www.mediapeta.com/peta/PDF/121815CBPDog-LeatherLetter.pdf\">a letter</a> to the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) commissioner, R Gil Kerlikowske, calling for better regulation of leather importation to combat the use of dog leather.</p> <p>\u201cIn American culture, dogs are cherished pets and are considered a member of the family,\u201d the letter states. \u201cAccordingly, Americans would not want to hold their four-legged companion\u2019s leash with a dog-skin glove.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://alceehastings.house.gov/issues/issue/?IssueID=100680\">Hastings</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hslf.org/news/press-releases/hslf-endorses-titus.html\">Titus</a> and <a href=\"https://cohen.house.gov/press-release/congressman-cohen-receives-perfect-rating-humane-society\">Cohen</a> all have strong track records when it comes to animal welfare issues, and Titus and Hastings, in interviews, both separately described the footage as \u201cdisturbing\u201d; the <a href=\"http://investigations.peta.org/china-dog-leather/\">graphic undercover footage</a> taken by the Peta Asia investigator showed dogs being bludgeoned before having their throats cut and their skin removed, sometimes, seemingly, while still alive. </p> <p>Despite the horrors of Peta\u2019s investigation, Peter Li, associate professor of east Asian politics at University of Houston-Downtown and a China policy specialist and consultant for Humane Society International, says dog fur facilities are few and far between in China.

                "bodyText":"When American consumers shop for leather goods, it probably doesn\u2019t enter their minds that their new belts, bags or shoes could be made not from cows or pigs but from cats and dogs. But not only is it a possibility, it\u2019s hard for consumers to know what they have been sold. Almost all that dog or cat leather comes from China. Now changes in Chinese culture, more pressure from the US and an upcoming trade agreement are combining to undermine this contraband trade. The US banned the importation of dog and cat fur and skin, which is punishable by fines up to $10,000, as part of the Dog and Cat Protection Act of 2000. But distinguishing dog and cat leather from cow, sheep and pig leather is no easy matter, making it possible for unscrupulous manufacturers to pass off leather from dogs as leather from legal animals.
