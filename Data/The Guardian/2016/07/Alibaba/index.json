                "bodyText":"Less than a month after the abrupt resignation of Masayoshi Son\u2019s anointed successor raised questions about SoftBank\u2019s appetite for overseas investments, the group has made its ambitions clear with a \u00a324bn move on ARM Holdings, Britain\u2019s most successful technology company. Monday\u2019s cash deal marks the start of the mobile technology company\u2019s quest to add semiconductors to its eclectic business portfolio and be a key part of the shift towards artificial intelligence, something that Son, SoftBank\u2019s chief executive, has described as \u201cthe biggest paradigm shift in human history\u201d. While declaring his determination to devote the rest of his career to AI and the \u201cinternet of things\u201d, Son has specialised in the acquisition of things since he founded the company 35 years ago. In the years leading up to what was supposed to be his retirement, just over a year from now, he has overseen an array of overseas investments, culminating in the agreed takeover of ARM, SoftBank\u2019s biggest acquisition, on Monday. SoftBank previously acquired Vodafone\u2019s Japanese business and is attempting to transform the fortunes of the lossmaking US telecoms company Sprint, after taking a $20bn (\u00a315bn) majority stake in 2013, in what was the biggest foreign acquisition by a Japanese company at the time. \u201cThis is one of the most important acquisitions we have ever made, and I expect ARM to be a key pillar of SoftBank\u2019s growth strategy going forward,\u201d Son said. \u201cARM will be an excellent strategic fit with the SoftBank group as we invest to capture the very significant opportunities provided by the internet of things.\u201d In Japan, overseas acquisitions are a sign of weakening confidence in the outlook for the domestic economy, as the country deals with more than two decades of stagnation and faces long-term population decline. Despite a group portfolio that includes Yahoo Japan, the country\u2019s third-largest mobile carrier, and a humanoid robotics unit, Son has spoken of his hunger to explore \u201ca few more crazy ideas\u201d, funded by the $18bn war chest that SoftBank accumulated by offloading some of its assets, including part of a stake in Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba. Son took a $20m stake in Alibaba, founded by Jack Ma in 1999. The bet paid off handsomely, with the value of SoftBank\u2019s stake soaring to $65bn after Alibaba\u2019s record IPO in the US in 2014. However, as recently as last month, corporate Japan had been readying itself for his exit, as he prepared Nikesh Arora to lead the company into the next information revolution. Arora\u2019s shock resignation in June, nearly two years after he moved to SoftBank from Google, came after Son indicated that he was going to renege on an agreement to hand over the reins on his 60th birthday next year. Many consider Son, 58, born in Japan but of Korean heritage, to be a rarity in the Japanese business world: charismatic, visionary and willing to take on the establishment. With an estimated net worth of $14.9bn, Japan\u2019s second-richest man has also built a reputation as a philanthropist, having pledged to donate 10bn yen and all his salary until retirement to support victims of the country\u2019s triple disaster in March 2011. Last month, Son stood before 2,000 SoftBank shareholders, still reeling from Arora\u2019s departure, and admitted that he had been \u201csomewhat greedy\u201d in wanting to stay on for at least another five to 10 years. \u201cI asked myself whether I have run out of energy and ambition,\u201d he said.
