                "bodyText":"A tumultuous week, which started with markets continuing their post-Brexit slump, has ended on a positive note as investors regained their nerve. All the leading European indices have finished the week with a positive performance, while Wall Street had also moved higher by the time London closed. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 73.5 points or 1.13% higher at 6577.83 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.99% to 9776.12 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.86% to 4273.96 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.61% to 16,295.78 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.29% higher at 8268.9 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.49% to 544.76 In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 36 points or 0.2% higher. On the currency markets, the pound continues to fall following the Bank of England\u2019s latest hints at interest rate cuts. It is down 0.35% at $1.326 and 0.38% down against the euro at \u20ac1.19. And on that note it\u2019s time to close for the evening and indeed the week. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. The FTSE 100 has finished up 1.13% at 6577.83, to its best level since 11 August last year. Its weekly rise of 7.21% is the best since the start of December 2011. Despite an initial fall in the first two trading days after last week\u2019s shock referendum result, the leading index has been boosted by hopes of cheaper money after the Bank of England hinted at summer rate cuts, and the prospect of the process for actually leaving the EU being delayed for months. Back with Brexit, and a majority of US companies believe it will have a neglible impact. The Institute of Supply Management, which earlier released a positive update on US manufacturing, said 61% of the businesses it surveyed saw little impact compared to just 6% who thought it would have a negative effect. European banks should not automatically have to cut dividends even if they reveal capital shortfalls in this year\u2019s stress tests, according to the banking watchdog. Reuters reports: The announcement aims to help restore investor confidence in Europe\u2019s banking sector, where valuations lag those in the United States, partly due to uncertainty over capital requirements. The European Banking Authority (EBA) is coordinating a stress test of 51 lenders from across the 28-country bloc with the results due on July 29. For the first time, there will be no pass or fail mark. The EBA sought on Friday to clear up confusion over how the tests\u2019 findings will feed into broader \u201cSREP\u201d reviews of bank capital by supervisors such as the European Central Bank. The ECB supervises the eurozone\u2019s top lenders and is looking at whether banks need extra capital under a supervisory review and evaluation process, or SREP. It considers how much extra capital a bank should hold on top of its mandatory minimum requirements, and helps to formulate \u201ccapital guidance\u201d for each bank. The EBA said on Friday that this capital guidance should be set above the combined level of mandatory minimums and add-ons. However, capital guidance does not constitute any form of binding capital requirements, and therefore is not expected to trigger automatic restrictions on payouts to investors, it added. This makes clear that it is up to the supervisor to decide if dividends should be suspended. Two members of the US Federal Reserve seem to have differing views on Brexit and the US economy, however: The UK decision to leave the European Union will be a drag on US GDP, according to S&amp;P Global Ratings, but the size and diversity of the world\u2019s biggest economy will limit its exposure. The agency said: S&amp;P Global now expects U.S. real GDP to grow by 2.0% in 2016 (was 2.3% in March) and 2.4% in 2017 (was 2.5%). The risk of recession over the next 12 months is now between 20% to 25%, up from 15% to 20% in March. The Fed will now likely stay on the sidelines until the December Federal Open Markets Committee meeting then will likely raise rates by 25 basis points to a 0.5% to 0.75% range. It will gradually raise rates next year, with now only three increases expected for 2017 and three more for 2018. The Fed will likely reach its new \u201cneutral\u201d rate by 2019. \u201cAll told, we expect the repercussions from Brexit to weigh somewhat on U.S. GDP,\u201d says US chief economist Beth Ann Bovino. \u201cCombining this with lower-than-expected first quarter growth leads to the lowering of our forecast for growth this year and next.\u201d The ISM report raises the prospect of a better than expected US non-farm payrolls number, said economist Rob Carnell at ING Bank: The US Manufacturing ISM index picked up from 51.3 to 53.2 in June - consistent with a decent, but not amazing pace of manufacturing growth. As well as a good headline index, there were encouraging signs from new orders, including new export orders. 72% of manufacturing industries now report overall growth, up from 67% in May. But the real focus of this release is probably the employment index, with the US jobs report less than a week away. This index rose to 50.4, its highest since November 2015, though admittedly, manufacturing jobs make only a small contribution to the overall employment total. Nonetheless, this is a small crumb of confidence for our above-consensus 200,000 payrolls forecast (consensus 175,000) and we will be watching the non-mfg ISM employment index and ADP surveys carefully next week for further corroboration of a return to labour market strength. With markets pricing in virtually no Fed tightening in 2016 or 2017, an above consensus number could see bond yields, which have fallen heavily since Brexit, to push higher, if only for a while in these times of heightened uncertainty. Confirmation of growth in US manufacturing in June has come in the latest ISM survey. Its manufacturing activity index came in at 53.2 in June, better than the consensus forecast of 51.4 and May\u2019s figure of 51.3. This is the highest level since February 2015. But in a separate report, US construction spending dropped unexpectedly in May, the second monthly decline in a row. According to the Commerce department spending dropped by 0.8% in May, following a revised 2% fall in April. The April drop was the largest since January 2011. Economists had expected a 0.6% rise in spending after an initial 1.8% decline in April. US manufacturing moved up in June, according to the first of the day\u2019s two surveys, but the uncertainty over Brexit could dampen growth in the coming months. The final Markit manufacturing PMI index came in at 51.3, better than the expected 51.2 but lower than the initial reading of 51.4. But it was higher than May\u2019s final level of 50.7 and hit a three month high. Markit said: U.S. manufacturers indicated a slight rebound in production volumes during June, helped by the fastest rise in new work since March. However, the latest survey signalled that growth momentum remained relatively subdued in comparison to its post-crisis trend, which contributed to cautious job hiring and further efforts to reduce inventories in June. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit added: Although the manufacturing PMI ticked higher in June, the latest reading rounds off the worst quarter for goods producers for six years. The lacklustre performance of the manufacturing economy adds to signs from the flash services PMI surveys that the underlying pace of economic growth in the second quarter remained subdued Manufacturing output after a disappointing start to the year. The upturn in the employment index suggests that firms may be expecting the recent bout of weak demand to be temporary, though hiring clearly remains subdued amid fragile business confidence. Producers are struggling in the face of the strong dollar, the energy sector decline and presidential election jitters. With companies craving certainty, heightened tensions between the UK and the European Union are likely to unsettle the global business environment further in coming months, and therefore risk dampening growth in the US and export markets. The data flow in the next two months will therefore be critical to policymakers in gauging the appropriate outlook for interest rates. American markets have edged ahead in early trading, but after recent rises the rally is not convincing. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, up nearly 800 points in the past three days, has opened around 19 points or 0.1% higher ahead of the latest US manufacturing surveys, due shortly. Business organisation the CBI has called for \u201ccalm and decisive leadership, a clear plan for the UK\u2019s future outside the EU and a framework for business and the government to work together and deliver that plan are businesses\u2019 immediate priorities as the country navigates its exit from the EU.\u201d Speaking at the Evening Standard business awards, CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn also said the government must confirm that workers from the EU who are already in the UK can stay in the country. More reaction to UK chancellor George Osborne abandoning his target to restore the public finances to surplus by 2020. Michael Izza, chief executive of chartered accountants organisation ICAEW, said: It was always going to be a struggle to meet the deficit target and in the light of the EU Referendum that job became much harder. In these uncertain times for business, it is imperative that Government devises a comprehensive strategy that minimises uncertainty and weathers any looming economic storm. Taking the global economy into account, the UK electorate knows that we still have a public finance problem as we can\u2019t continue to borrow. The challenge of the public finances remains a three-Parliament problem. Earlier the European Central Bank\u2019s chief economist Peter Praet said Brexit was a \u201cnew shock\u201d and Europe rapidly needed a roadmap on Britain\u2019s plans to leave. Speaking at a Financial Times event he said it was vital to bring clarity to the political and economic uncertainty created by the UK referendum and that an \u201corderly process\u201d was laid out for Brexit negotiations. He said red tape for firms was likely to increase as a result of the UK decision, and could weaken potential growth. He added that the challenges to the eurozone remained immense but the ECB was ready to provide liquidity. [Quotes courtesy Reuters] The pound is roughly flat against the dollar, at $1.3304, and is down 0.4% against the euro at \u20ac1.1942. Sterling has fallen almost 11% against the dollar since Britain went to the polls on 23 June to vote on EU membership. Against the euro, it is down almost 9% over the same period. The impact of the Brexit vote on the pound versus dollar: The impact of the Brexit vote on the pound versus euro: Samuel Tombs, chief economist at Pantheon Economics, makes the point that the George Osborne\u2019s target of hitting a surplus by 2020 wasn\u2019t very realistic in the first place. Even without Brexit, it was highly unlikely that the Chancellor would ever have met his goal. Last year, the structural budget deficit amounted to nearly 4% of gross domestic product. Moreover, the fiscal forecasts were based on very optimistic assumptions for the impact of fiscal tightening on growth, the likely revenues from tax avoidance measures, and the government\u2019s ability to reduce spending after six prior years of austerity. Some reaction to Osborne\u2019s speech... John McDonnell, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, welcomed the chancellor\u2019s decision to drop his targets: I welcome the Chancellor\u2019s decision to finally listen to the calls made by myself and Jeremy Corbyn over the last nine months to drop his failed surplus target. It is only a shame he was not realistic sooner, as under Jeremy Corbyn, Labour has been unequivocal in its opposition to failed Tory austerity. Lee Hopley, chief economist at manufacturing trade body EEF, also welcomed the move: This move will be viewed as a much-needed pick-me-up after a week of turmoil and bad news. The chancellor is right to scrap the government\u2019s hitherto relentless push on deficit reduction. The uncertainty that businesses are currently grappling with should be helped by politicians galvanising around the actions that can reasonably be taken to offer some policy stability - easing up on deficit reduction is one such measure. The Chancellor has been tweeting following his speech in Manchester, where he announced that he is abandoning his target of returning the public finances to surplus by 2020. He is stressing the \u201cflexible\u201d nature of his fiscal rules... Investors are feeling chirpier in afternoon trading. The FTSE 100 is now up 82 points or 1.3% at 6,586. The FTSE 250 - down earlier in the day - is now up 0.6% at 16,361. All major European indices are up: Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.7% at 9,745 France\u2019s CAC: +0.8% at 4,269 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.4% at 16,266 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +1.4% at 8,275 Here is our story on George Osborne\u2019s comments in Manchester. Quite extraordinary stuff as he essentially admits defeat on one of the central pillars of his economic policy as chancellor. A budget surplus in 2020 is no longer realistic in a post Brexit world, he suggests. The chancellor was speaking at the Greater Manchester Chambers of Commerce. Here is what he said: Now, as the governor of the Bank of England said yesterday, the referendum result is as expected likely to lead to a significant negative shock for the British economy. How we respond will determine the impact on people\u2019s jobs and on economic growth. The Bank of England can support demand. The government must provide fiscal credibility, so we will continue to be tough on the deficit but we must be realistic about achieving a surplus by the end of this decade. This is precisely the flexibility that our rules provide for. And we need to reduce uncertainty by moving as quickly as possible to a new relationship with Europe and being super competitive, open for business and free trading. That\u2019s the plan and we must set to it. George Osborne is going to abandon his target to restore the public finances to surplus by 2020, the BBC is reporting. He has been speaking in Manchester. This is what they are reporting: Chancellor George Osborne has abandoned his target to restore government finances to a surplus by 2020, the BBC has learned. It had been the chancellor\u2019s most prized goal and had been driving austerity measures in previous budgets. However, the Chancellor said the UK must be \u201crealistic about achieving a surplus by the end of the decade\u201d. The UK economy is showing \u201cclear signs\u201d of shock in the aftermath of the vote to leave the European Union, he said. Even before that vote, there were questions over whether Mr Osborne would be able to balance the budget by 2020. Time for a market update. The FTSE 100 is holding on to gains, up 23 points, but it\u2019s a mixed bag in Europe now and the FTSE 250 is down. FTSE 100: +0.4% at 6,527 FTSE 250: -0.2% at 16,244 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.04% at 9,684 French CAC: -0.1% at 4,235 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.5% at 16,124 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.2% at 8,183 The Leave camp were not the biggest fans of Mark Carney in the run-up to the EU referendum. The Bank of England governor was met with hostility from some members of the camp when he warned the UK economy could fall into recession in the event of a Brexit decision. Andrea Leadsom, one of the candidates for the Tory leadership and a member of Vote Leave, accused the governor at the time of overstepping his remit. Now the vote is over, Michael Gove - a leading Brexit campaigner and a rival candidate for the Tory leadership - has been singing the governor\u2019s praises, paying tribute to Carney for stabilising the economy. Meanwhile George Osborne says there are \u201cclear signs of economic shock\u201d since Britain voted to leave the EU last week. The chancellor has been in Manchester, addressing business leaders. Sky News is reporting that EasyJet has opened talks with regulators in the EU about relocating its headquarters from the UK. The budget airline is currently based in Luton, where it employs about 1,000 people. Brexit fallout begins... Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, has a good take on the market volatility we\u2019ve seen seen Britain voted to leave the EU. European markets have started the day in a fairly positive fashion as we come to the end of what has been a turbulent and historic week. Having traded as low as 5,938 in the wake of last week\u2019s surprising Brexit vote the FTSE 100 looks on course to post its best week since 2011 as the weaker pound helped pull the index back above its pre Brexit vote highs by the middle of the week. While it is no doubt true that on a currency basis the FTSE100 is still down in euro and US dollar terms, the fact that it is one of the highest yielding blue chip benchmarks at over 4% could well be providing a pull factor in an era of ever decreasing interest rates. While the FTSE 100 is managing to hold its own the FTSE 250 is finding it a little more difficult slipping back 1% over concerns about the outlook for the UK economy over the rest of the year. James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis, tells Bloomberg TV that Brexit shouldn\u2019t have too much of an impact on the US economy: Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector performed much better than expected in June. Activity in UK factories grew at the fastest pace in five months according to the Markit/CIPS PMI. Crucially though, the survey was conducted almost entirely before last weeks referendum on EU membership. What impact the decision to quit the EU will have on the sector - and the wider economy - remains to be seen. The headline index on the PMI - combining output, orders and employment - rose to 52.1 in June from 50.4 in May. Anything above 50 is growth territory, and economists were forecasting 49.9 - a contraction in activity. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit: With 99% of survey responses received before the end of 23rd June, the latest PMI signalled that the manufacturing sector had started to move out of its early year sluggishness in the lead up to the UK\u2019s EU referendum. Whether this growth recovery can be sustained will depend heavily on whether the current financial and political volatility spills over to the real economy. While the Bank of England remains poised to act if needed and the UK\u2019s trading relationships are unchanged during the two-year negotiation period, there\u2019s a clear risk that ongoing uncertainty will have at least some short term impact on manufacturing during the coming quarters. The big question is whether any negative impact from uncertainty can be partly offset by a boost to exports resulting from the fall in the pound. Activity in factories in most of the eurozone\u2019s biggest economies grew in June. Both output and new orders grew at a faster pace, driving the headline index on the Markit eurozone manufacturing PMI up to 52.8 from 51.5 in May. Anything above 50 signals growth. France was the only country where the sector shrank last month - with strike action dampening activity - while manufacturing growth in Germany was the strongest in more than two years. Germany: 54.5 Austria: 54.5 Italy: 53.5 Ireland: 53 Spain: 52.2 Netherlands: 52 GreeceL 50.4 France: 48.3 Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit said it was positive news from the eurozone but issued a Brexit health warning: The data were collected prior to the UK EU referendum result, so any Brexit impact is yet to be seen in the PMI. The PMI would have likely been even higher had it not been for strikes in France, which look to have disrupted business activity in many cases. With Greece enjoying a welcome return to growth, France was the only country to see a deterioration in manufacturing conditions in June. All other countries saw faster rates of expansion except the Netherlands. Given the uncertainty caused by the prospect of Brexit, it seems likely that business and consumer spending will be adversely affected across the euro area in the short term at least, pulling growth down in coming months. Mark Carney\u2019s speech on Thursday send the yield on one UK gilt - maturing in March 2018 - negative. It was a first for the UK, with a yield of -0.04% meaning that investors were willing to pay to take on government debt - despite extreme political and economic uncertainty. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said it was a \u201clandmark\u201d moment for the UK. Anyone who buys this gilt is paying the UK government for the privilege of lending it money, and this is despite the fact the ratings agencies have downgraded UK government debt in light of the Brexit vote. The UK now joins Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Denmark, Switzerland and Japan in the club of countries where gilt yields have turned negative. The ultra-low interest rate environment paints a depressing picture of our economic prospects, though the gilt market has been so heavily tainted by central bank interference, it\u2019s hard to know how reliable an indicator it is. Such low interest rates are great for borrowers, but awful for cash savers, and for banks. Cash savers have already suffered 7 years of ultra-low interest rates, and on current expectations it looks like they will comfortably see out a decade without getting a half-decent return on their deposits. UK 10-year bonds yields: The yield on benchmark 10-year government bonds has fallen to a record low of 0.831%, putting it on course for its biggest weekly fall since November 2011. Investors often turn to bonds during times of market volatility as they are considered lower risk compared with other assets. The lower the yield, the cheaper it is for the government to borrow money. The latest snapshot of the state of the manufacturing sector across the eurozone, the UK and the US will be delivered today by the PMI surveys for June. Overnight, an official survey in China showed the manufacturing sector in the world\u2019s largest economy effectively stalled in June. Output hit a 12-month high, but all other measures showed signs of weakening. The survey is likely to add to expectations that Beijing will inject more stimulus into the economy. The pound is little changed this morning, after falling sharply on Thursday afternoon in response to Mark Carney\u2019s suggestion that more stimulus is on the way to try and counter the negative impact of the Brexit vote. It is down 0.1% against the dollar at $1.3287, and pretty much flat against the euro at \u20ac1.1980. Elsewhere in Europe, markets are seeing stronger gains: Germany\u2019s Dax: +0.8% at 9,753 France\u2019s CAC: +0.7% at 4,266 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +1.1% at 16,383 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +1.1% at 8,256 Investors are once again shaking off Brexit concerns with shares rising modestly. In the UK, FTSE 100 is up 4 points or 0.1% at 6,506. The FTSE 250 is up 0.3% at 16,321. As it stands, the FTSE is on course to post its biggest weekly gain since December 2011. Good morning. This time last week Britain was waking up to the news that it had voted to leave the European Union. The outcome sent shockwaves through global markets, with shares plunging last Friday. But markets have since bounced back, with the FTSE 100 yesterday hitting its highest level since August. Investors around the world were cheered by the reassuring words of Mark Carney, Bank of England governor, who indicated the central bank stood ready to pump fresh stimulus into the UK economy as the impact of Brexit weighs on growth and confidence. Our story on Carney\u2019s speech is here: Economists believe the Bank might act in August, to coincide with its quarterly inflation report which includes updated economic forecasts. Options on the table include cutting interest rates to zero from 0.5%, as well as more quantitative easing. Markets around the world liked the message, with Wall Street closing up and shares rising in Asia. The Hang Seng rose 1.75% to 20,794.37, while the Nikkei rose 0.7% at 15,6825.48. European markets have just opened higher.",

The risk is of a run; if buyers fear they will lose access to their money, they will rush to withdraw their savings, triggering the event they dread. Property mutual funds have a liquidity mismatch; savers can withdraw their money every day but property takes months to sell. Funds tend to run with high levels of cash in order to meet this eventuality; Aberdeen says its fund has a cash level of 18% of assets. But Standard Life clearly felt it had to take action.</p> <p>Regulators worried last year about the possibility of systemic risk in the mutual fund sector, although then their concern was about corporate bonds, rather than property. The good news is that this is not like the money market fund crisis of 2008; few people will be keeping their spare cash in a property fund and most will realise that they can lose, as well as make, money. Nevertheless, this is the first real sign of post-Brexit financial stress.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/econbuttonwood/status/750009295551533056\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Our news story on the Standard Life property fund suspension <a href=\"https://t.co/d8UA3SReaT\">https://t.co/d8UA3SReaT</a></p>&mdash; Philip Coggan (@econbuttonwood) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/econbuttonwood/status/750009295551533056\">July 4, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-07-04T17:28:18.431Z\">at 6.28pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-577a9845e4b05db362ab7631\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-04T17:11:17.050Z\">6.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Laith Khalaf, Senior Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, has emailed his thoughts about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jul/04/stimulus-hopes-markets-ftse-100-construction-business-live?page=with:block-577a912be4b0243071e32bea#block-577a912be4b0243071e32bea\">Standard Life\u2019s decision to lock down its property fund tonight</a>:</strong></p> <p>He explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Property funds are clearly under pressure as a result of the Brexit vote, and we could now see a new wave of investors being unable to liquidate their property funds quickly, which we last witnessed during the financial crisis.</p> <p>This is part of the problem with investing in open-ended property funds, and one of the reasons we don\u2019t recommend them to investors. Property does offer diversification, and a reasonable yield compared to government bonds, but investors must be willing to accept high costs, and a lack of liquidity when the market turns down.</p> <p>Closed-ended property funds at least provide investors the chance to sell out during market upheaval, though widespread selling serves to depress share prices and widen discounts in times of stress. Indeed there are currently a number of closed-ended property trusts trading at discount in excess of 10%. However, being closed-ended does at least means the manager does not have to liquidate properties at a time when everyone else is looking to do the same.</p> <p>Given the outflows the sector seems to be experiencing, this could well put downward pressure on commercial property prices. The risk is this creates a vicious circle, and prompts more investors to dump property, until such time as sentiment stabilises.</p> <p>Continued low interest rates in theory provide support for commercial property, because as prices fall, yields become even more attractive. However at the moment, investors appear to be leaving the sector, rather than buying in.\u2019</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-577a9710e4b0243071e32c0a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-04T17:05:26.267Z\">6.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>City experts are tweeting their concern about Standard Life\u2019s decision to suspend trading in its real estate fund:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/dsquareddigest/status/750004360076206081\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So, FTSE100 down 0.8%, 250 down 2%.

                "bodyText":"And finally.... here\u2019s our news story about Standard Life\u2019s move: Goodnight! GW But ITV business editor Joel Hills flags up that Standard Life last locked down its property fund eight years ago, when the financial crisis was raging: That was also the last time that the UK economy went into recession. Property valuations are usually an early casualty of a downturn. Estate Gazette point out that Standard Life cut the value of its portfolio by 5% as part of a \u201cfair value adjustment\u201d, but this was not enough to prevent investors wanting to take out their cash. They add, uncheerily, that: The move mirrors that made by fund managers in 2008 following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which resulted in some funds being closed for years as those managing funds struggled to return capital when faced with depressed asset values. Property expert Henry Pryor reckons this might be a significant event.... Aime Williams of the Financial Times has a good take on the Standard Life news: Standard Life has been forced to stop retail investors selling out of one of the UK\u2019s largest property funds after rapid cash outflows were sparked by fears over falling real estate values in the week after the Brexit vote. The \u00a32.9bn commercial property fund will need to sell real estate to raise cash before any money can be redeemed. The last property crash in the UK in 2007 was preceded by a wave of similar forced gatings by funds struggling to meet investor demands for cash, which led to firesales of property that added to the pressure on an already falling market.... More here: The Economist\u2019s Buttonwood columnist, Philip Coggan, says Standard Life has highlighted the stress building up in the financial system following the Brexit vote. He writes that some fund managers have already reassessed the value of their property assets, downwards, since the referendum. Some real estate investment trusts have fallen by 20%. Coggan explains why the decision to suspend redemptions from Standard Life\u2019s \u00a32.7bn property fund matters: The big question is how this news will affect retail investors elsewhere. The risk is of a run; if buyers fear they will lose access to their money, they will rush to withdraw their savings, triggering the event they dread. Property mutual funds have a liquidity mismatch; savers can withdraw their money every day but property takes months to sell. Funds tend to run with high levels of cash in order to meet this eventuality; Aberdeen says its fund has a cash level of 18% of assets. But Standard Life clearly felt it had to take action. Regulators worried last year about the possibility of systemic risk in the mutual fund sector, although then their concern was about corporate bonds, rather than property. The good news is that this is not like the money market fund crisis of 2008; few people will be keeping their spare cash in a property fund and most will realise that they can lose, as well as make, money. Nevertheless, this is the first real sign of post-Brexit financial stress. Laith Khalaf, Senior Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, has emailed his thoughts about Standard Life\u2019s decision to lock down its property fund tonight: He explains: Property funds are clearly under pressure as a result of the Brexit vote, and we could now see a new wave of investors being unable to liquidate their property funds quickly, which we last witnessed during the financial crisis. This is part of the problem with investing in open-ended property funds, and one of the reasons we don\u2019t recommend them to investors. Property does offer diversification, and a reasonable yield compared to government bonds, but investors must be willing to accept high costs, and a lack of liquidity when the market turns down. Closed-ended property funds at least provide investors the chance to sell out during market upheaval, though widespread selling serves to depress share prices and widen discounts in times of stress. Indeed there are currently a number of closed-ended property trusts trading at discount in excess of 10%. However, being closed-ended does at least means the manager does not have to liquidate properties at a time when everyone else is looking to do the same. Given the outflows the sector seems to be experiencing, this could well put downward pressure on commercial property prices. The risk is this creates a vicious circle, and prompts more investors to dump property, until such time as sentiment stabilises. Continued low interest rates in theory provide support for commercial property, because as prices fall, yields become even more attractive. However at the moment, investors appear to be leaving the sector, rather than buying in.\u2019 City experts are tweeting their concern about Standard Life\u2019s decision to suspend trading in its real estate fund: Big news tonight... Standard Life, one of Britain\u2019s biggest investment funds, has suspended trading in one of its UK property funds. This means customers will not be able to pull money out of the fund, which invests in UK property assets such as offices, shops and industrial sites. Standard Life took the decision after receiving a surge in applications to withdraw from the fund, following the Brexit vote. By locking investors down, they hope to avoid being forced into fire sales to generate funds for clients who want out. They say: Due to exceptional market circumstances, Standard Life Investments has taken the decision to suspend all trading in the Standard Life Investments UK Real Estate Fund (and its associated Feeder Funds) from 12:00 noon on 4 July 2016. The decision was taken following an increase in redemption requests as a result of uncertainty for the UK commercial real estate market following the EU referendum result. The suspension was requested to protect the interests of all investors in the fund and to avoid compromising investment returns from the range, mix and quality of assets within the portfolio. They will review the decision in a month. Here\u2019s the full statement: I\u2019ll find some reaction now.... The London stock market closed down 55 points tonight, or almost 1%, after the shock fall in construction output dampened the mood in the City. Property firms remained the big fallers, with British Land losing 7.1% and Persimmon down 6.9%. With Wall Street shut for Independence Day, trading petered out across Europe. Britain\u2019s FTSE 250 index had another weak day, dropping 2%. Italian banks came under more pressure as investors wonder if prime minister Matteo Renzi will defy Brussels and bail the sector out of its bad debt crisis. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: In the absence of US markets it\u2019s been a fairly quiet day for European markets which have slipped back in the absence of any significant positive drivers, and very thin trading. The ripple out effects of last month\u2019s Brexit vote continue to dominate sentiment after S&amp;P Global Ratings downgraded economic growth forecasts for both the UK and the Euro area, with the UK feeling the main brunt of some of the negative effect. Once again it\u2019s been house builders and banks that have driven today\u2019s losses, with the Italian FTSEMib sliding the most as its banking sector gets clobbered again. Before I nip off....unions are urged the government to boost infrastructure spending to help the construction industry. Frances O\u2019Grady, General Secretary of the TUC, says: \u201cThe Brexit vote is likely to further damage the confidence of investors in the construction sector. The government must respond quickly with an emergency programme of public investment to stop the UK economy taking a nose-dive. \u201cThe TUC has published a plan of action to keep the economy moving. The government must give the go-ahead for a third runway at Heathrow, bring forward major new infrastructure projects like high-speed rail and announce a big expansion in housebuilding.\u201d The Brexit vote appears to have triggered a change of heart in government circles about spending. On Friday, chancellor George Osborne revealed he is abandoning his deficit reduction plan. And today, leadership contender Stephen Crabb proposed borrowing \u00a3100bn to boost capital spending. It\u2019s quite a u-turn..... A quick recap of the main points. Britain\u2019s construction industry has suffered its worst month since the aftermath of the financial crisis in 2009, in a clear signal that the EU referendum has hurt the economy. Data firm Markit found that activity shrank sharply in June, with firms reporting a big drop in new orders. Many clients were unwilling to commit to projects before the referendum on 23rd June. Economists say the data is \u2018dire\u2019. They fear that the slowdown will continue this month. Shares in property companies and construction firms have been hit. British Land, the UK\u2019s largest commercial propert firm, has shed 7% . This dragged the FTSE 100 back into the red, after it hit a 10-month high this morning Brexit fears have also hit the eurozone, with investor confidence hitting an 18-month low. IMF chief Christine Lagarde has warned that Brexit could take a 4.5% chunk out of the UK economy by 2019. In other news.... three former Barclay traders have been found guilty of rigging Libor London Stock Exchange shareholders have approved its merger with Deutsche Bourse Spanish unemployment has shown a welcome fall, hitting the lowest total since 2009 But concern is growing over Italy\u2019s banking sector, as its government considers defying the EU and launching a taxpayer bailout. I\u2019ll be back later with the European stock market close.... The FTSE 100 has now fallen back from its 10-month high, and is now 30 points in the red (down 0.5%). Property firms and builders are the biggest fallers on the index, as investors react to the news that the UK construction industry is shrinking at its fastest pace since 2009. The FTSE 250 index, which contains firms who aren\u2019t big enough for the Footsie 100, is down 1.7%. Andrew Edwards, CEO of ETX Capital, says today\u2019s slump in construction activity is proof that the Brexit vote will have a material impact on the UK economy. He calls it \u201ca wake-up call for whoever is taking the country into negotiations for leaving the EU\u201d, and predicts it will spur that Bank of England to ease monetary policy this month. He adds: The rally in the FTSE 100 is not a good guide \u2013 the weighting towards international companies does not represent the UK economy as a whole. Defensive stocks and miners remain in vogue while builders and others in the property sector are getting hammered again.\u201d Hat-tip to Stephanie Flanders of JP Morgan for showing that the FTSE 100 index has actually been the best-performing asset class since the Brexit vote (in local currency terms, anyway). The worst asset? The British pound (closely followed by the Italian stock market, due to those bank fears we mentioned earlier). Just in... the London Stock Exchange\u2019s shareholders have overwhelmingly voted to approve the proposed takeover by Germany\u2019s Deutsche Bank. Some 99.89% of LSE shareholders backed the plan at a vote this lunchtime. That\u2019s one hurdle cleared. But the Brexit vote has created a new layer of uncertainty about the \u00a321bn deal. My colleague Sean Farrell explained earlier: Germany\u2019s markets regulator BaFin said last week the plan to base the combined company in London would not work if the UK was outside the EU. BaFin said it was difficult to imagine the most important exchange in the eurozone being run from outside the EU. BaFin cannot veto the deal but Deutsche B\u00f6rse will have to respond to the regulator\u2019s concerns along with the German state of Hesse, where the company is based and which has a veto power. Several German politicians called for the combined company\u2019s base to be in Frankfurt, while Thorsten Sch\u00e4fer-G\u00fcmbel, a leading SPD politician, said the deal was dead. Christine Lagarde, the head of the IMF, has told Le Monde that UK GDP could lose between 1.5% and 4.5% by 2019 because of Brexit, depending on what type of trade deal is struck. Lagarde said there was a \u201creal uncertainty\u201d surrounding what conditions there would be for trade deals with the EU after a Brexit. She said a Norway-style agreement would be the \u201cfavourable\u201d and \u201ceconomically reasonable\u201d choice but she said this choice would be \u201cpolitically difficult, because the country would have all the obligations of an EU member, notably free movement, but no rights.\u201d She said the worst scenario for Britain would be a as non-EU country along World Trade Organisation rules. She said in that case, British GDP could lose between 1.5% and 4.5% by 2019, compared to what it would have been if it had stayed in the EU. But she added.... \u201cBut we don\u2019t have the slightest idea of the timeframe, nor the result of negotiations between London and the EU. Uncertainty will be the key word for a certain time.\u201d Over in the courts, three ex-Barclays traders have been found guilty of fixing the Libor rate \u2013 the benchmark measure of borrowing costs between banks. Bloomberg have created a nice graphic, showing how the City has a dominant position in the \u2018clearing market\u2019 for financial securities denominated in euros. Those huge operations could potentially be moved out of the City, if Britain can\u2019t reached a Brexit deal that grants full access to the EU financial services market. The European Central Bank recently tried, and failed, to get euro clearing moved into the eurozone. But Britain\u2019s referendum means the idea is being reconsidered. France, in particular, fancies a slice of the euro clearing market. Economy minister Emmanuel Macron declared yesterday that: \u201cOn clearing, we will have a full discussion on a series of issues We have many more players now in Paris than in Frankfurt, and a much deeper market place.\u201d However, financial firms will be reluctant to shift the complex euro clearing operations from London to another country. And if there\u2019s no choice, they might scatter jobs across several cities, rather than simply shifting everything to one site. Shares in Moneysupermarket, the price comparison website with the irritating adverts*, have slumped by 11% today to a 16-month low. And again, the Brexit vote is to blame. The selloff was sparked by Barclays, who warned that Moneysupermarket will suffer badly if Britain slides into recession. Barclays analyst Andrew Ross slashed his recommendation on the stock to \u2018equal weight\u2019, from \u2018overweight\u2019, and declared: The outcome of the UK referendum and a forthcoming expected recession in the UK is now a new concern, and one uncertainty too many for us. We do see clear risks to consensus for next year if a recession bites. * - actually, most of them have irritating adverts, although those Meerkats are quite cute... German thinktank Sentix has also sounded the alarm about the impact of Brexit on Europe\u2019s economy. Sentix\u2019s index of investor confidence across the eurozone has slumped to 18-month low, down from 9.9 in June to just 1.7 this morning. That indicates that investors and analysts fear that Britain\u2019s vote last month to leave the European Union will have serious economic consequences. Sentix fears that the European recovery is now faltering. \u201cInvestors are clearly differentiating and in addition to Switzerland, they see the euro zone as mostly affected.\u201d Therefore the euro zone economy is dangerously close to stagnation.\u201d The FTSE 250 index of medium-sized companies is sliding deeper into the red, following the construction data shocker. It\u2019s now shed 1.7%, or 279 points. Estate agent Rightmove (-5.8%) and building firm Bellway (-4.2%) are among the fallers. Dan Davies of Frontline Analysts isn\u2019t impressed: Here\u2019s our news story about the construction industry\u2019s problems: The early rally on the London stock market has been snuffed out. Investors aren\u2019t pleased by the news that UK construction suffered its biggest slump in almost seven years in June. British Land and Land Securities, two of Britain\u2019s largest property firms, have both fallen by 3.7%. Housebuilding firms are also among the top fallers, with Persimmon, Taylor Wimpey and Barratt Developments all shedding at least 3%. Joshua Raymond of IG explains why..... UK construction is truly in the doldrums, if today\u2019s PMI reading is anything to go by. A seven-year low for the construction PMI reading highlights the fact that many firms have seen investment ground to a halt both before and after the Brexit vote. With around 80% of responses within this PMI survey coming prior to the referendum result, there is reason to believe that this will look even worse in a month\u2019s time. Considering that we were looking at PMI readings approaching 65 less than two years ago, it is clear that construction has gone from boom to bust in no time at all. Upon enacting Article 50, the government will ignite another two years of uncertainty, which will most likely result in further suffering for UK industry as investment goes elsewhere. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says today\u2019s construction industry report is \u201cabsolutely dire\u201d. It will fuel serious concern that Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU will hurt building firms badly, if clients lose confidence in new projects. He adds: The government will be particularly worried to see housebuilding contract at the fastest rate since December 2012 and the second fastest rate since April 2009 - given that it is looking to address the UK\u2019s acute housing shortage There was also substantial weakness in commercial activity, which contracted at the fastest rate since February 2013 and at the second fastest rate since December 2009. Civil engineering activity was essentially stagnant. The downturn in the construction sector will put more pressure on the Bank of England, Tom Moore adds: \u201cThe vast majority of June\u2019s survey responses were received ahead of the EU referendum, so the worry is that the ensuing political turmoil will hit construction spending decisions for some time to come. As a result, the latest figures raise the likelihood that the Bank of England will inject additional stimulus this summer in an attempt to dampen the short-term impact of Brexit uncertainty on the real economy.\u201d The rapid tumble in UK construction work last month is a \u201cclear warning flag\u201d of the dangers facing Britain\u2019s economy. So argues Tim Moore, economist at Markit: \u201cWidespread delays to investment decisions and housing market jitters saw the UK construction sector experience its worst month for seven years in June. Construction firms are at the sharp end of domestic economic uncertainty and jolts to investor sentiment, so trading conditions were always going to be challenging in the run-up to the EU referendum. However, the extent and speed of the downturn in the face of political and economic uncertainty is a clear warning flag for the wider post- Brexit economic outlook. David Noble, CEO at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, says the \u201cambiguity and indecision\u201d around Brexit caused the shocking slump in building activity last month. \u201cGloom and fragility descended on the sector with the steepest drop in new orders since December 2012. Caused by the continuing insecurities in both the global and UK economies and the hesitancy shown by clients to commit to projects before the EU referendum, overall activity was at its frailest for seven years. This chart shows how construction contracted last month, with housebuilding (in blue) particularly badly hit. Breaking: Britain\u2019s building sector has suffered its biggest slump in activity in seven years. It\u2019s a clear sign that the EU referendum has hurt the economy. Data firm Markit reports that residential house building suffered a \u201csteep decline\u201d in June, while commercial construction activity shrank for the first time since May 2013. Markit says that many building firms saw their new work dry up last month, as the Brexit campaign reached its climax: Lower levels of activity were overwhelmingly linked to deteriorating order books and a corresponding lack of new work to replace completed projects. A number of firms commented on reluctance among clients to commence new contracts in the run-up to the EU referendum, alongside ongoing uncertainty about the general economic outlook This dragged Markit\u2019s construction PMI down to 46.0 in June, down from 51.2 in May. Any reading below 50 shows a contraction, and 46.0 is the lowest reading since September 2009. Most of the survey was conducted before the results was known, on June 24. More details and reaction shortly.... Conner Campbell of City firm SpreadEx sums up the morning: Once again the best performing index the FTSE rose another 10-20 points after the bell, briefly pushing it above the 6600 mark for the first time since last August (i.e. just before Black Monday). Investors seem to be dining out on the promise of stimulus from the Bank of England (and, likely, the ECB), news of which gave the markets another shot in the arm just when their recovery could have begun to flag. Understandably the pound hasn\u2019t been equally as excited about this development, though its 0.2% rise this Monday has seen cable briefly graze $1.33. Italy is battling to prevent its banking sector becoming a casualty of the Brexit crisis. Shares in Italy\u2019s main lenders are all down, again, today, in a fog of confusion over their prospects. Britain\u2019s EU referendum vote has piled more pressure on Italian banks. If the eurozone economy weakens, their bad debts could be even harder to service. Prime minister Matteo Renzi is reportedly planning to step in and bailout the sector with government cash. That would be a clear breach of new European rules which make creditors, not taxpayers, take the hit when a bank fails. As the FT reports, Rome is considering going it alone: We are willing to do whatever is necessary [to defend the banks], and do not rule out acting unilaterally, although that would only be as a last resort.\u201d But such a move would seriously undermine Europe\u2019s new banking regime. Economists at Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s have issued a new warning about Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU. S&amp;P, which downgraded the UK last week (just as Iceland\u2019s footballers were downgrading the England team) has warned that Brexit uncertainty will wipe 0.8% off eurozone growth. They say: We think the U.K. will barely escape a full-fledged recession caused by Brexit, but the downside risks are numerous. Brexit will produce a drag on U.K. GDP of 1.2% in 2017 and 1% in 2018. For the eurozone, we don\u2019t expect the recovery will stall, but estimate a 0.8% hit to GDP over 2017 and 2018. We assume the Bank of England will slash its policy rate to zero by the very end of 2016 and restart its quantitative easing program in 2017, despite a pickup in inflation caused by the weaker pound. European stock markets are fairly flat this morning, as traders look to central banks to do more.... International companies with large overseas earnings are leading the stock market risers in London this morning. That\u2019s because they will benefit from the weak pound; it will make exports more competitive, and mean any dollars earned abroad are worth more when converted back to sterling. But British housebuilders are under pressure, as fears of a Brexit-induced recession swirl. In an encouraging sign for the eurozone, the number of people out of work in Spain has fallen to its lowest levels since September 2009. The jobless total fell by 124,349 people in June, according to new data, the second largest drop on record. This pulled the number of unemployed people down to 3,767,054, the lowest since September 2009. Seasonal factors will have played a big part, as the tourism season is now underway. More here. The British pound has crept a little higher this morning, up 0.2% to $1.3283. That\u2019s still around 9% lower than its pre-referendum levels, due to the historic plunge once the UK voted to leave the EU. The weakening pound is a big factor behind the FTSE 100\u2019s rally, as it makes UK shares more attractive to US investors. The FTSE 250 index, which contains more UK companies than the FTSE 100, has dropped by 0.5% this morning. It\u2019s being dragged down by shipping firm Clarkson, which has plunged by 22% after issuing a profit warning. It blamed \u2018global economic uncertainty\u2019, and the oversupply in the shipping industry. The FTSE 100 has hit a new 10-month high at the start of trading. London\u2019s blue-chip index has jumped by 32 points, or 0.3%, to 6612. That\u2019s the highest level since late last August, before stock markets were gripped by worries over China\u2019s economy. It\u2019s important to note that the FTSE 100 is priced in sterling; the slump in the pound means the index is still worth less than 2 weeks ago. Mining stocks are leading the rally in London, with silver miner Fresnillo jumping by 7%. Royal Bank of Scotland, though, is among the fallers again -- losing 2.2p to 167p. The government\u2019s break-even point of 502p, where it could sell the taxpayers stake at a profit, is getting further away..... Asian stock markets have made a decent start to the week. Shares are higher from Toyko to Delhi, as investors shake off their fears about Brexit. Mizuho Bank says investors are expecting the Bank of England, and the European Central Bank, to keep monetary policy extra-loose: \u201cProspects that central banks (BoE and ECB) will unleash fresh stimulus in coming months are providing some relief in markets.\u201d \u201cIt is also perceived that the Fed [US Federal Reserve] will either delay its rate hike to Q3/Q4 or no hike policy rate at all this year.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s 10 day since Britain voted to leave the European Union. Back then, amid the resignations, recriminations and celebrations, there were fears that the London stock markets might crash. But instead, the FTSE 100 has been bouncing back - and could hit a new 10-month high this morning [measured in sterling, anyway]. Once again, central bankers have managed to calm the crisis (for the moment...). Bank of England governor Mark Carney\u2019s promise last week of fresh stimulus measure - such as interest rate cut - is still cheering investors. Chinese policymakers are also expected to act soon, after factory data last Friday showed its manufacturing sector softening again. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says investors will be looking to central banks to do more. Today is almost certainly going to remain about the continued fallout from Brexit as we move into the second full week, further digesting and re-pricing for the new financial, economic and political landscape, the latter being the most entertaining if you are watching the chaos and antics over in Westminster. Any more hints from central banks about stimulus could also help keep the ball in the air, helping markets shrug off the Brexit impact and push on with their recoverie Monetary policy has its limits of course, it might buy us some time but it won\u2019t fix the problems in the global economy. The consequences of Brexit will dominate the political world too. Conservative MPs are racing to choose a new prime minister, while Labour are stuck in their own leadership tussle. And in a new wounding blow to irony, Leave campaigner Boris Johnson is cross that no-one\u2019s written a plan to handle Brexit: Also coming up today.... There\u2019s some economic data this morning, which may show the impact of EU referendum uncertainty. The latest report on the UK construction sector at 9.30am BST, Sentix releases its eurozone investor confidence report at 10am BST. LSE shareholders are voting on whether to approve the takeover by Germany\u2019s Deutsche Bank. But it could be a quiet afternoon, as America is celebrating Independence Day.",

But Harvard economist Lawrence Katz and his fellow researcher, Alan Krueger, of Princeton, have concluded that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://fusion.net/story/285543/krueger-katz-gig-economy-forthcoming-paper/\">all net job growth since 2005 has come in the form of alternative work arrangements</a> \u2013 contract or gig type hirings that aren\u2019t traditional jobs with salaries and benefits. </p> <p>More and more individuals are receiving 1099 forms documenting self-employment earnings, and a growing number file Schedule C tax forms spelling out how much they made from their personal businesses, whether renting out their spare rooms or designing greeting cards. They may also have a traditional \u201cjob,\u201d or have a part-time job on the side, or generate income through a mish-mash of traditional or gig jobs. Zen Payroll has found that in some cities \u2013 Los Angeles and Austin among them \u2013 the \u201c1099 economy\u201d now makes up <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.newgeography.com/content/004770-1099-economy-rise\">20% or more of the local workforce</a>; the percentage of workers who fall into this category has almost doubled in Seattle. </p> <p>What we can\u2019t \u2013 or don\u2019t \u2013 measure, we can\u2019t, or don\u2019t, understand. And then, just as a starting point, we have no way to know whether those traditional unemployment numbers that traders are so anxiously awaiting represent anything meaningful. The markets will respond, of course, but so what? If the gap between the reality of what that employment is and what the government statistics measures widens much further, that market reaction will be about as meaningful as celebrating the end of the Iraq war on the day that George W Bush announced in 2003 that \u201cthe United States and our allies have prevailed\u201d would have been.</p> <p>The BLS is taking belated baby steps in the right direction. Next May, it will roll out a supplement to its Current Population Survey that will cover all kinds of \u201ccontingent\u201d workers and alternative work arrangements. But that still falls short of data that would routinely capture the size and nature of this large and (arguably) fast-growing world.</p> <p>What\u2019s at stake are the working terms and conditions of the millions of Americans who are more and more likely to find themselves engaged in some part of the gig economy, as companies realize just how much it is to their financial advantage to operate in this way. Hire an independent contractor, and a company saves on: health care insurance contributions; social security contributions; pay for sick days, parental leave, vacation; contributions to retirement savings plans; Medicare; heck, even the cost of a lunch break. All of those can cost as much as a third of the total cost of employing someone \u2013 and the growth of the 1099 economymeans companies get to transfer many of those costs to the employees. </p> <p>But if you can\u2019t measure how many \u201cemployees\u201d turned gig workers/independent contracters/self-employed individuals are shouldering those new financial burdens for themselves now, then it\u2019s tough to advocate for <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/as-the-gig-economy-changes-work-so-should-rules-1449683384\">changes to labor laws recognizing the new world of work</a>. </p> <p>It\u2019s time to overhaul the monthly employment data. The first step is to stop responding to it like Pavlov\u2019s dog \u2013 that just reinforces the idea that it sends out an economically vital signal. Admittedly, it\u2019s important information, but it\u2019s also flawed and becoming more so. The less we react to it, the more we drive home the message that it\u2019s unhelpful as it stands, and (perhaps) the greater the incentive there is for someone out there to devise something that will address its many flaws.

More and more individuals are receiving 1099 forms documenting self-employment earnings, and a growing number file Schedule C tax forms spelling out how much they made from their personal businesses, whether renting out their spare rooms or designing greeting cards. They may also have a traditional \u201cjob,\u201d or have a part-time job on the side, or generate income through a mish-mash of traditional or gig jobs. Zen Payroll has found that in some cities \u2013 Los Angeles and Austin among them \u2013 the \u201c1099 economy\u201d now makes up 20% or more of the local workforce; the percentage of workers who fall into this category has almost doubled in Seattle. What we can\u2019t \u2013 or don\u2019t \u2013 measure, we can\u2019t, or don\u2019t, understand. And then, just as a starting point, we have no way to know whether those traditional unemployment numbers that traders are so anxiously awaiting represent anything meaningful. The markets will respond, of course, but so what? If the gap between the reality of what that employment is and what the government statistics measures widens much further, that market reaction will be about as meaningful as celebrating the end of the Iraq war on the day that George W Bush announced in 2003 that \u201cthe United States and our allies have prevailed\u201d would have been. The BLS is taking belated baby steps in the right direction. Next May, it will roll out a supplement to its Current Population Survey that will cover all kinds of \u201ccontingent\u201d workers and alternative work arrangements. But that still falls short of data that would routinely capture the size and nature of this large and (arguably) fast-growing world. What\u2019s at stake are the working terms and conditions of the millions of Americans who are more and more likely to find themselves engaged in some part of the gig economy, as companies realize just how much it is to their financial advantage to operate in this way. Hire an independent contractor, and a company saves on: health care insurance contributions; social security contributions; pay for sick days, parental leave, vacation; contributions to retirement savings plans; Medicare; heck, even the cost of a lunch break. All of those can cost as much as a third of the total cost of employing someone \u2013 and the growth of the 1099 economymeans companies get to transfer many of those costs to the employees. But if you can\u2019t measure how many \u201cemployees\u201d turned gig workers/independent contracters/self-employed individuals are shouldering those new financial burdens for themselves now, then it\u2019s tough to advocate for changes to labor laws recognizing the new world of work. It\u2019s time to overhaul the monthly employment data. The first step is to stop responding to it like Pavlov\u2019s dog \u2013 that just reinforces the idea that it sends out an economically vital signal. Admittedly, it\u2019s important information, but it\u2019s also flawed and becoming more so. The less we react to it, the more we drive home the message that it\u2019s unhelpful as it stands, and (perhaps) the greater the incentive there is for someone out there to devise something that will address its many flaws. Quickly, please.",

Overall sales reached $722.9m \u2013 an increase of 31% from the year before, the company announced. Smith &amp; Wesson\u2019s sales have risen more than 200% since Barack Obama was elected president. In the year to date, shares of Smith &amp; Wesson have surged 32% and those of Sturm Ruger 13%.",

The index, which measures the value of London\u2019s 100 largest listed firms, was hovering at 6591 on Friday, well above the 6338 seen before the vote.</p> <p>However, the gains mask huge falls in the share prices of banks and housebuilders, which took a beating as investors feared a post-Brexit property crash.

Many other big employers have voiced their concerns about the impact on investment of Britain moving out of the EU.</p> <p>Manufacturing output is still around 8% below its 2008 peak and employs many fewer people than before the financial crash, so it needs all the investment it can get.</p> <p>The core sectors covering aerospace, cars, pharmaceuticals and machine-tool manufacturing remain the UK\u2019s strengths, and the resurgence of activity in the eurozone this year has seen a steady rise in exports to the UK\u2019s main trading partner.</p> <p>Rob Dobson, senior economist at financial data providers Markit, said the export sector remained tough. Exports fell in May and the low pound may generate more uncertainty, especially in the eurozone, than it does extra sales.</p> <h2><strong>Construction</strong></h2> <p>Builders are wary of another property crash after almost being wiped out in 2008. This sensitivity means the industry, in any country, acts as an early warning system for an impending recession.</p> <p>For last six months firms have put new projects on hold and concentrated on those already under construction. A skills shortage across the sector has also encouraged them to batten down the hatches rather than take on extra costs. Commercial developers, which build office blocks, shopping centres and factories, followed suit believing rightly that their dependence on foreign investors meant they were more exposed to a period of recession.</p> <p>Not surprisingly construction-sector shares have been among the worst hit on the stock market since 23 June, with some firms losing a quarter of their value.</p> <p>Cast out of the EU, many firms fear the UK will suffer slower economic growth and mothballed projects will stay under wraps while immigration restrictions will make recruiting skilled staff more difficult.</p> <h2><strong>Services</strong></h2> <p>The UK\u2019s myriad service industries, which make up more than 75% of the national economy, have supplied almost all the country\u2019s growth over the last five years and helped to offset a huge deficit in the balance of trade in goods.</p> <p>The most recent figures from the Markit/CIPS purchasing managers index show activity levels at 52.3 \u2013 the lowest rating for three years \u2013 as new business weakened and firms used their spare capacity to tackle backlogs. The index indicates growth when it rises above 50.</p> <p>For the last two years economists have feared that UK businesses have relied on domestic consumers to spend their savings and borrow to fund purchases. Wage rises averaging 2% and almost zero inflation have also increased the level of disposable incomes.</p> <p>The recent fall in the pound is expected to increase inflation, bringing to an end this brief period of improving living standards. A shallow recession is expected to follow. Services companies are likely to take a small fall in national income in their stride and, like most businesses, believe that when the Conservative party elects a new leader in September (possibly earlier) and adopts a clear strategy for leaving the EU, the period of uncertainty will ease.</p> <p>El-Erian said that much depended on whether politicians were able to provide a credible and swift \u201cPlan B\u201d that included a free trade agreement with the EU.</p> <p>\u201cAfter the Brexit referendum, the UK has to urgently get its political act together,\u201d he said. \u201cPlan B depends on the politicians in London and across the Channel, but so far they have not stepped up to their economic governance responsibilities.\u201d</p>",

This was widely seen as a sign that consumers, concerned about the outcome of the referendum vote, were feeling less confident about spending money on big-ticket items. The knock for the usually buoyant car market came after UK factory output made only tentative gains in June.

Siemens, which has just opened a \u00a3310m manufacturing hub in Hull that employs 1,000 people, warned new windpower investment plans were on hold. Many other big employers have voiced their concerns about the impact on investment of Britain moving out of the EU. Manufacturing output is still around 8% below its 2008 peak and employs many fewer people than before the financial crash, so it needs all the investment it can get. The core sectors covering aerospace, cars, pharmaceuticals and machine-tool manufacturing remain the UK\u2019s strengths, and the resurgence of activity in the eurozone this year has seen a steady rise in exports to the UK\u2019s main trading partner. Rob Dobson, senior economist at financial data providers Markit, said the export sector remained tough. Exports fell in May and the low pound may generate more uncertainty, especially in the eurozone, than it does extra sales. Construction Builders are wary of another property crash after almost being wiped out in 2008. This sensitivity means the industry, in any country, acts as an early warning system for an impending recession. For last six months firms have put new projects on hold and concentrated on those already under construction. A skills shortage across the sector has also encouraged them to batten down the hatches rather than take on extra costs. Commercial developers, which build office blocks, shopping centres and factories, followed suit believing rightly that their dependence on foreign investors meant they were more exposed to a period of recession. Not surprisingly construction-sector shares have been among the worst hit on the stock market since 23 June, with some firms losing a quarter of their value. Cast out of the EU, many firms fear the UK will suffer slower economic growth and mothballed projects will stay under wraps while immigration restrictions will make recruiting skilled staff more difficult. Services The UK\u2019s myriad service industries, which make up more than 75% of the national economy, have supplied almost all the country\u2019s growth over the last five years and helped to offset a huge deficit in the balance of trade in goods. The most recent figures from the Markit/CIPS purchasing managers index show activity levels at 52.3 \u2013 the lowest rating for three years \u2013 as new business weakened and firms used their spare capacity to tackle backlogs. The index indicates growth when it rises above 50. For the last two years economists have feared that UK businesses have relied on domestic consumers to spend their savings and borrow to fund purchases. Wage rises averaging 2% and almost zero inflation have also increased the level of disposable incomes. The recent fall in the pound is expected to increase inflation, bringing to an end this brief period of improving living standards. A shallow recession is expected to follow. Services companies are likely to take a small fall in national income in their stride and, like most businesses, believe that when the Conservative party elects a new leader in September (possibly earlier) and adopts a clear strategy for leaving the EU, the period of uncertainty will ease. El-Erian said that much depended on whether politicians were able to provide a credible and swift \u201cPlan B\u201d that included a free trade agreement with the EU. \u201cAfter the Brexit referendum, the UK has to urgently get its political act together,\u201d he said. \u201cPlan B depends on the politicians in London and across the Channel, but so far they have not stepped up to their economic governance responsibilities.\u201d",

There are those who want our exit from the EU to signal that we should now turn our back on the world, resist the free-market forces of globalization and become a more insular, less tolerant place. Similar forces are at work in other Western nations.</p> <p>We must not be afraid to confront them head-on. I am determined that \u2014 on the contrary \u2014 we now set out to build a more outward-looking, global-facing Britain, with stronger links with its friends and allies around the world. That must start with a closer economic relationship with North America.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>President Obama had warned that Britain would be at the \u2018back of the queue\u2019 for a trade deal.

We are each other\u2019s largest investors, with almost $1 trillion invested in each other\u2019s economies.

                "bodyText":"That\u2019s all for tonight (although I might pop back and add some front pages later). Here\u2019s our latest news story about the markets: Goodnight and thanks for reading and commenting! GW And finally tonight.... America\u2019s stock market has hit a new alltime high, as global markets continue their relief rally. The S&amp;P 500 index closed 7 points higher, or 0.33%, at 2,136.95 points. That narrowly breaches the previous high set in May 2015. Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, reckons that traders are feeling more optimistic about the global economy (after last Friday\u2019s decent US employment report). Paulsen says: \u201cYou have Brexit and global stagnation, but underneath that we keep getting really good economic numbers and that is forcing the (stock) market to new highs.\u201d The tantalising scent of fresh stimulus packages in Britain and Japan soon also worked its usual magic, of course. So, record highs on Wall Street. The London stock market back in bull market territory (thanks to the weak pound) and even Europe shaking off its Brexit fears. Not a bad day, but also not a reason to think the Brexit crisis is over. This chart of the FTSE 250 index of smaller UK companies this year shows how it has scrambled back from the Brexit shock last month (red for down, green for up): Ken Odeluga, market analyst at trading firm City Index, says companies most focused on the UK got the biggest boost today from Theresa May\u2019s rise to the top. We believe \u2018pure-play\u2019 UK equities have rallied on relief that the more pragmatic, less conspicuously ideological and more experienced candidate has emerged as Britain\u2019s next Prime Minster, ahead of difficult and multi-faceted discussions with a wounded and potentially vengeful EU. Investors were pleased to focus on political developments, rather than the Bank of England\u2019s promises to cushion the impact of Brexit. As Odeluga puts it: We note markets shrugged off revolving doors in the Conservative leadership contest and Labour\u2019s failure to open a trapdoor under its own chief. It has taken the withdrawal of the last right-leaning Eurosceptic standing, Andrea Leadsom, to raise an unmistakably positive reaction in the City. There\u2019s real anticipation in the City tonight about whether the Bank of England will cut interest rates to fresh record lows on Thursday. The BoE has already hinted that more stimulus will be needed this summer to help the economy. But given the inflationary impact of a weak pound, it may be reluctant to lower borrowing costs (and weaken sterling further). Kallum Pickering says the Bank could decide to leave its powder dry until August, when governor Mark Carney will present the new quarterly inflation report. He writes: We see a 60% chance that the nine member MPC votes to cut the bank rate, if so, probably by 25 basis points. However, there is a chance that the MPC holds for now, and instead opts to send a dovish signal that the bank will ease monetary policy three weeks later at the August Inflation Report when it is due to publish its revised economic forecasts. The pound is getting a late lift tonight, as Theresa May prepares to become Britain\u2019s next prime minister, on Wednesday afternoon. Sterling is hovering just below $1.30, up half a cent today. Chris Saint, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Currency Service, says: Markets will be hopeful that the prospect of Theresa May becoming Prime Minister will soon bring some clarity to the UK political landscape as well as a more conciliatory approach towards Europe. May has already insisted, though, that \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d, so she\u2019s not hinting at a referendum u-turn... European stock markets have also enjoyed a May-bounce. The STOXX Europe 600 .STOXX closed up 1.6% at 332.72, its highest close since June 23. However it is still 4% below its pre-referendum levels, due to concerns that Brexit will hurt the European economy. The news that Theresa May would replace David Cameron on Wednesday seemed to bring relief to European trading floors. Ankit Gheedia, equity and derivative strategist at BNP Paribas, reckoned that May was a safer pair of hands than Andrea Leadsom (who stepped down from the leadership race today) \u201cThe difference between Theresa May and her counterpart was that she has a disciplined approach and a proper strategy for Brexit. The alternative was uncertain. \u201cWe know she has experience, and is a bit more strategic, so the market is relieved on the back of that.\u201d (Thanks to Reuters for the quotes) Some late newsflashes from Brussels, where eurozone finance ministers have been meeting. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, head of the Eurogroup, says the Brexit vote is hurting eurozone confidence: And European commissioner Pierre Moscovici has revealed that the EC is dialling down its growth forecasts for the UK and the eurozone next year: The global rally in shares today has sent America\u2019s S&amp;P 500 index to a record high today: Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, believes the S&amp;P 500 will keep climbing: So, the S&amp;P 500 is rallying to fresh unchartered territories today. Where do we go from here? Well, the monthly chart suggests onwards and upwards. America\u2019s tech index has hit its highest level of the year: The FTSE 100 burst into Bull Market territory moments before Theresa May was crowned as the new leader of the Conservative Party. May will become prime minister on Wednesday, and investors have welcomed this sudden outbreak of certainty in UK politics. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says shares are also benefiting from expectations of an interest rate cut on Thursday. Here\u2019s his take: \u2018The Footsie has been tipped into a bull market by the emergence of Theresa May as Prime Minister, though the whiff of some loose monetary policy coming from the Bank of England this Thursday probably helped the index over the line too. The role played by the commodity behemoths should not be under-estimated either, these stocks are now trading at much higher prices than in the depths of the market in February. The Tories may be starting to get their house in order, but the stock market has hardly followed in the mould of the one-nation conservatism espoused by the party. There have been very divergent fortunes amongst the big blue chips, with some airlines, house builders and banks being left behind by the rest of the market. Here\u2019s the top risers and fallers on the FTSE 100 tonight: The FTSE 250 used to be the ugly duckling of the City, full of companies not big enough to make the Footsie 100. Now, though, it\u2019s blossomed into everyone\u2019s favourite stock market index (or so it feels, anyway). It\u2019s official! Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index is back in bull market territory. The blue-chip index of the largest firms listed on the London stock market has just closed 92 points higher tonight, at 6682, a gain of 1.4% today. That means the Footsie has risen by over 20% since 11 February, when global investors were fretting about China\u2019s slowing economy tipping the world into recession. That was a simpler time, before Brexit became the word on everyone\u2019s lips and British politics entered a period of remarkable upheaval (which ain\u2019t over yet, judging by events in the Labour party today). Mining firm Anglo American is the biggest gainer, closing 8.5% higher, followed by building supply firm Travis Perkins (up 7.8%). However, this does not mean that Britain\u2019s economy is suddenly rosy. Remember... Most of the FTSE 100 constituents are international companies, so they\u2019re not a good gauge of the UK economy The weak pound drives up their earnings (as the dollars, yen and euros they collect as profits are worth more in sterling terms). The value of these firms has been hit hard by the 10% slump in the value of the pound. The smaller FTSE 250 is still below its pre-referendum levels (despite jumping by over 2% today). Two surveys today have shown that investor confidence has been hit very hard by the Brexit vote (see Moody\u2019s warning here....and also Hargreaves Lansdown\u2019s alarming survey here..). But still, investors will be relieved to see the index up, not down. Chris Beauchamp of IG explains that events in Westminster have boosted confidence in the City. UK politics continues to provide the most compelling TV viewing of the year so far, as Teresa May\u2019s last opponent abandons the field. The bounce in UK mid-caps is more than partly due to hopes that, with Remainer May as PM, talks with Europe may be smoother, while the disappearance of a summer leadership contest has helped clear road ahead for UK equities. Shares in many smaller UK companies are also strongly higher today. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains why: The FTSE250 has also enjoyed a decent bounce, up nearly 3% hitting its highest levels since its plunge from its 23rd June peaks. This removal of one element from the mix of political uncertainty is likely to bring into sharp relief the next stage of the \u201cBrexit\u201d process and in particular the timings of when Article 50 is likely to get triggered. However, the FTSE 250 index is still below its pre-referendum levels, unlike the FTSE 100 (which gets that weak pound boost) Here\u2019s another sign that the Brexit vote has hurt the European economy. A new survey by Moody\u2019s Analytics reports that: Global business confidence has slumped in the wake of the Brexit vote in late June. European sentiment continues to sink and is now consistent with an economy that is on the verge of stalling out. More than one-fourth of the survey responses by European businesses are negative, the highest that has been on a consistent basis since the European debt crisis. Encouragingly, sentiment in the United States and Pacific Rim haven\u2019t been materially impacted by British exit vote. Weak business confidence often leads to lower investment, and less new hiring, so it could be quite damaging.... City traders are pleased that at least some of the political uncertainty sitting over Britain like a heavy fog is lifting. Connor Campbell of Spreadex explains: Theresa May is clearly the market\u2019s preferred choice for Britain\u2019s top job, as evidenced by the reaction that greeted Leadsom\u2019s stand-down statement. May\u2019s lack of interest in rushing to activate Article 50 and her relatively less contentious relationship with the EU when compared to her (now long gone) rivals, as well as the general cheer at the mere fact of the UK once again having a PM, is arguably responsible for the rise from the FTSE and pound, both of which improved on their morning performances. The former jumped by nearly 1%, sitting firmly at 2016 (and indeed 11 month) highs; the latter, meanwhile, managed to climb away from its earlier lows, even if the currency remains haunted by the spectre of a Bank of England rate cut on Thursday. The chancellor is watching events unfold from across the Atlantic, and tweets: The FT reckons that foreign secretary Phillip Hammond could become finance minister in Theresa May\u2019s government.... London shares have extended their gains this afternoon, as Wall Street opened strongly on the back of Friday\u2019s forecast-busting non-farm payrolls. The S&amp;P 500 set a record high, while the Dow was up 92 points, or 0.5 percent, to 18,240 within the first half hour of trading, with banks leading the charge. \u201cReaching a new high may see money moving from the sidelines of safety trades, like Treasury bonds and gold, back into the equity markets,\u201d Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth, told Reuters. \u201cThe emphasis of the markets will be how fast and how long the S&amp;P remains above the record today.\u201d By 3pm, the FTSE 100 had extended its gains to just over 70 points, or 1.1%, at 6664 points. A quick recap: Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index is poised to smash into bull market territory, after being boosted by the weakness of the pound since the Brexit referendum. It has jumped 1% today, meaning it is 20% higher than in February. The smaller FTSE 250 index is also romping higher, on expectations that UK interest rates will be cut to fresh record lows on Thursday. But the pound has been volatile today, as Theresa May moved to the brink of becoming UK prime minister. May has called for a new clampdown on executive pay and predatory capitalism, getting a \u2018better late than never\u2019 welcome from the unions. Film studio Pinewood has declared that it should benefit from the weak pound, as Britain will become a more attractive place to make films. Chancellor George Osborne has landed in America, in an attempt to reassure US investors that they should still invest in Britain. In non-Brexit news: Shares in Nintendo have surged, on the back of the Pokemon Go craze Burberry has ended Chris Bailey\u2019s tenure as CEO, and hired a senior fashion chief Some non-Brexit news.... Fashion chain Burberry have just announced a new chief executive. It\u2019s Marco Gobbetti, currently CEO of fashion chain C\u00e9line. This means that Christopher Bailey, Burberry\u2019s creative mastermind, is moving to become president, after two years as CEO. He\u2019ll be chief creative officer too - but effectively he\u2019s losing day-to-day control of the company It\u2019s not a great surprise; City investors were concerned that Bailey couldn\u2019t do both jobs, especially as trading has deteriorated in recent months. Burberry shares have jumped 6%... Chancellor George Osborne has now landed New York, for his mission to reassure America that Britain is still open for business despite the Brexit vote (as we covered earlier). He\u2019ll be on US TV shortly, in an early-morning treat for America..... Enjoy the pound\u2019s rally while it lasts, says Jake Trask, currency analyst at UKForex. He predicts that sterling will soon weaken again, possibly later this week when the Bank of England announces its interest rate decision \u201cSterling pushed higher today as pro-Brexit candidate Angela Leadsom pulled out of the contest to be the next prime minister. The pound pushed up through $1.30 against the US dollar on the news, but the rally is likely to be short-lived, as Mark Carney is expected to cut interest rates to a record low of 0.25% this Thursday. \u201cShould he decide to cut rates to zero, we will likely see another multi-year low for sterling as we head towards a probable recession in the second half of the year.\u201d Almost every company on the FTSE 250 index of medium-sized UK companies has risen today. Property companies are leading the rally, driving the FTSE 250 up by 2.7% right now. Investment group St. Modwen Properties has jumped 9%, and British housebuilding company Crest Nicholson are up 7.6%. Earlier today, Theresa May identified housebuilding as a key priority if she became prime minister (which now seems an imminent prospect). This graph shows how shares in big companies on the FTSE 100 (red line) have roared back since the referendum, thanks to the slump in the pound. Smaller UK companies are shown on the blue line (the FTSE 250), and Germany\u2019s DAX is the pink line. In exquisite timing, confidence among small investors has hit its lowest level since the heights of the eurozone crisis in 2012 - just as shares keep rallying. Hargreaves Lansdown, the financial services firms, reports that its Investor Confidence Index has suffered its sharpest monthly fall in 5 years. The survey of retail investors took place on 30 June, a week after the EU referendum result, and asked them to give their view of the UK stock market over the next three years. The index fell from 92 points in May to 67 in June; the biggest one month percentage fall since June 2011. The index now stands at a four year low - in May 2012 it stood at a level of 61, as Greece looked like it might be on the brink of leaving the eurozone. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says confidence appears to have \u201ccollapsed\u201d after the Brexit vote, among investors, consumers and businesses. The dwindling faith in the UK\u2019s future financial prospects has the potential to become a self-fulfilling prophecy, if companies and individuals start to assume a bunker mentality, and delay or cancel spending and investment. Investors are naturally twitchy about what Brexit means for the future of the stock market in the coming months and years. However continued low interest rates will remain supportive of shares, not least because there is really nowhere else for investors to go for income. Commercial property is one other option, though we have seen problems that can arise for investors in that market over the last week or so. The pound just put its nose back over the $1.30 mark, on the prospect of Theresa May becoming Britain\u2019s next PM sooner than expected. Britain\u2019s blue-chip FTSE 100 index is smashing into Bull Market territory. The Footsie has jumped by 60 points to 6650, a new 11-month high, as Andrea Leadsom confirms that she is withdrawing from the Tory party leadership battle. Crucially, more than 20% above the 5,537 level hit in mid-February, when markets had been driven down by fears over the global economy. So if it closes there tonight, the Footsie will be in bull market territory. Mining stocks are leading today\u2019s rally, with Anglo American up 5%. UK building companies are also sharply higher; Taylor Wimpey and Persimmon have both gained 6%. The usual provisos apply; the FTSE 100 is priced in sterling (which is worth 10% less than last month). And it is dominated by international firms, not UK ones. The smaller FTSE 250 is still 5% below its pre-referendum levels, following a 2% jump this morning. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says investors are expecting the Bank of England to ease monetary policy on Thursday. Last Friday\u2019s upbeat US employment report is also cheering the City. Mahony adds: Amid a sea of green in the FTSE, it is interesting to see the housebuilders and banks gaining heavily, in what has become a proxy for risk appetite across financial markets. There is no doubt that the housebuilders and banks are currently a risky play, given the severity of their recent devaluation. However, in days when the market is in the green, the performance of these sectors will reflect how far reaching that optimism really is. The pound is suddenly jumping, clawing back most of today\u2019s losses, as rumours sweep Westminster that Andrea Leadsom is about to quit the Tory leadership race. Caution is needed, as it\u2019s only at a three-hour high.... Maybe traders aren\u2019t sure what happens next. And they\u2019re not alone... Our politics liveblog have full coverage of Theresa May\u2019s speech: Theresa May, one of the two candidates to replace Cameron, is preaching a progressive message this morning. May is arguing that ordinary families need more help. Wages have only grown slowly, energy bills have rocketed, and monetary stimulus measures have helped those on the property ladder - but not those who can\u2019t [who wrote this speech, Ed Miliband?]. May is also promising a crackdown on executive pay, giving workers more power, and improving UK productivity. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says it\u2019s better late than never.... \u201cThe TUC has long argued for workers to be given seats on company boards and remuneration committees. Workers have a clear interest in the long-term success of their companies and deserve a bigger say. \u201cThis move would inject a much-needed dose of reality into boardrooms, as well as putting the brakes on the multi-million pay and bonus packages which have done so much to damage the reputation of corporate Britain. \u201cIf politicians are serious about making chief executives more accountable this is a common sense approach. I stand ready to meet Theresa May to discuss these proposals.\u201d David Cameron also told the Farnborough Airshow that it is in Britain\u2019s \u201cfundamental interest\u201d to remain very close to the EU. Prime minister David Cameron is urging Britain to use the Brexit vote to tackle the country\u2019s productivity problems. Speaking at the Farnborough Air Show, Cameron calls for a \u201cmassive national effort\u201d to build a strong dynamic economy.. He points out that output per hour in the UK is lower than US, Germany or France, and cites high speed rail, superfast broadband and housebuilding as key infrastructure areas to work on. Now we are leaving the EU, Britain must rapidly explore all possible supply-side reforms, such as tax reforms, Cameron continues. And he\u2019s singling out pharmaceuticals, life sciences, technology, and fintech as important areas where Britain can lead the world. One problem, of course... Cameron won\u2019t be in power in two month\u2019s time. So for all his talk about the \u201cground work\u201d being underway, his successor must actually do the heavy lifting.... The AFP newswire have a good take on George Osborne\u2019s trip to America: British finance minister George Osborne was Monday holding talks with Wall Street investors, kicking-off a series of visits to leading international financial centres to build post-Brexit economic ties. \u201cVital work will begin today on building stronger economic and trade relationships with the UK\u2019s closest trading partners,\u201d the Treasury said in a statement as Chancellor of the Exchequer Osborne headed to New York to meet investors on Wall Street. And Osborne will next week lead a trade mission to Singapore and China after Britain last month voted in a referendum to exit the European Union, the Treasury added. \u201cWhile Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU clearly presents economic challenges, we now have to do everything we can to make the UK the most attractive place in the world to do business,\u201d Osborne, who voted for Britain to remain in the EU, said in the statement. \u201cWe will continue to be a beacon for free trade, democracy and security, more open to that world than ever.\u201d They also point out that the UK is considering easing the tax bill on companies: Following the Brexit vote, Osborne is planning to slash corporation tax over fears of an exodus by big business. According to the Treasury, he could extend planned cuts to Britain\u2019s levy on company profits to under 15 percent. Prior to the vote, the tax rate on corporate profits was already set to be cut from 20 percent to 19 next year and to 17 percent in 2020. Britain\u2019s business minister Sajid Javid on Friday held post-Brexit talks on the country\u2019s future trade relationship with India, the first of many such discussions he plans with world powers. Britain is left with the huge task of forging fresh trade agreements with individual countries as a non-bloc member. Javid has said that the British government, which will soon be led by a new prime minister after the post-Brexit vote resignation of David Cameron, plans to have up to 300 specialist staff by the end of the year to aid in the new trade negotiations. The jump in the FTSE 100 doesn\u2019t tell us much about the UK economy, except that it may trigger bonus payments to chief executives.... Japanese bank Nomura are predicting that sterling could hit a new 31-year low by Friday: The pound may be losing its shock value... Neil Wilson, markets analyst at ETX Capital, confirms that the prospect of fresh stimulus from the Bank of England is driving shares up (and the pound down) The prospect of looser monetary will help equities but it\u2019s another nail in sterling\u2019s coffin. Homebuilders, which rallied on Friday after a turbulent week, are on the up again today. Miners are also rising again as investors price in an interest rate cut. Encouragingly for UK firms, the FTSE 250 is trading up 1%, beating the FTSE 100\u2019s 0.5% rise. European markets are up across the board as they react to Friday\u2019s upbeat jobs report from the US, which spurred the Dow to a 1% gain and saw the S&amp;P 500 close within one point of its record high. Asian stock markets have now closed at one-month highs. Traders are betting that Japanese PM Shinzo Abe can now implement new structural reforms to make the economy more productive, having won a key election victory over the weekend. British film studio Pinewood has emerged as one of the winners from the Brexit vote. The company told shareholders this morning that the 10% tumble in the pound since the referendum was good for business. It said: The result of the UK\u2019s referendum on membership of the EU is now known. In the context of our business, the decline in the \u00a3sterling exchange rate is undoubtedly positive for our international customers. We will continue to monitor sentiment around the issue going forward. Pinewood has played a vital role in the UK film industry for decades. Everything from the Carry On and Pink Panther series to James Bond and the later Harry Potter films were produced at its sites. Maybe they\u2019ll make Brexit, The Movie one day too (rating PG). There were astonishing scenes on the Tokyo stock market today, as shares in console maker Nintendo surged by 25% following the runaway success of the new Pok\u00e9mon Go game. It\u2019s particularly notable, as Nintento is only indirectly linked to the game (which has sent users racing around, squinting into their phones, looking for the monsters) Sterling is weakening this morning, down over half a percent against the US dollar at $1.288. That underlines how the City expect a UK interest rate cut this week. Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit is confident that the Bank of England will do something this week: City investors are expecting the Bank of England to cut interest rates to fresh record lows on Thursday, to fight the dangers of recession following the Brexit vote. Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct says this is helping to drive shares up in London today: London\u2019s FTSE-100 is starting the week with some solid gains as Friday\u2019s upbeat unemployment data from the US and hopes of further stimulus measures out of Japan continue to buoy sentiment. There\u2019s also the spectre of a rate cut and further QE being unveiled at the Bank of England later in the week which is again delivering some cause for cheer and gains are eye-catchingly broad-based as a result. European stock markets have jumped in early trading, as last Friday\u2019s knockout US jobs report continues to cheer the City. In London, the FTSE 100 has risen by 45 points, or +0.7%, at 6636. That\u2019s the highest level since mid-August. Mining companies, banks, and UK housebuilders are the top risers, suggesting trader are less worried about the global economy and a UK recession. The FTSE 100 isn\u2019t the best gauge of the UK economy, as it is full of international companies whose overseas earnings are boosted by the weak pound. And also... the index is valued in sterling (so it\u2019s not at an 11-month high in US dollar terms). Encouragingly, the FTSE 250 index is up 0.7% this morning too. It contains more UK companies than the blue-chip FTSE 100. Top risers include retail chain Sports Direct and bank Virgin Money. Other European markets are also in the green: George Osborne may get a rough ride as he tries to woo America\u2019s top politicians and financiers this week: Bloomberg\u2019s reckons he faces a \u2018tall order\u2019 to persuade the US that all is well in the UK: He\u2019ll be mounting a public relations exercise at a time when the pound has slumped to a 31-year low against the U.S. dollar and real-estate funds are beingfrozen to avoid fire sales. Further undermining sentiment in the country is the two-month wait to discover the identity of the next prime minister, and discord gripping the opposition Labour Party. There\u2019s also no guarantee that Osborne will have high office once his close ally, David Cameron, has been replaced by either Theresa May or Andrea Leadsom. UK chancellor George Osborne is urging international investors not to give up on Britain, as the fallout from the EU referendum continues to hit the global economy. Osborne is flying to New York today, to meet with top Wall Street bankers. And his message is that Britain is not \u201cquitting the world\u201d, even though it has voted to leave the European Union. He has set the scene with an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal this morning, arguing that Britain will still play a key role on the world stage. Quitting the EU (something Osborne campaigned in vain against) must mean closer links with the rest of the world, starting with America. He writes: \u200eThe question now is not what Britain is leaving; it is what Britain will become. There are those who want our exit from the EU to signal that we should now turn our back on the world, resist the free-market forces of globalization and become a more insular, less tolerant place. Similar forces are at work in other Western nations. We must not be afraid to confront them head-on. I am determined that \u2014 on the contrary \u2014 we now set out to build a more outward-looking, global-facing Britain, with stronger links with its friends and allies around the world. That must start with a closer economic relationship with North America. President Obama had warned that Britain would be at the \u2018back of the queue\u2019 for a trade deal. Osborne, though, hopes we can squeeze our way to the front. For first time in 40 years, the U.K. will be setting its own trade terms. So we should begin the conversation now with the U.S., and with the members of the North American Free Trade Agreement, about how we can deliver even closer economic ties. I have spoken to House Speaker Paul Ryan several times in the past two weeks about a stronger trading relationship\u2014and this week I will welcome Treasury Secretary Jack Lew to London to see what more we can do together. It is now in the overwhelming interest of both countries to do so. We are each other\u2019s largest investors, with almost $1 trillion invested in each other\u2019s economies. U.S. investment in the U.K. is around 10 times U.S. investment in China; British investment in the U.S. is around 50 times Chinese investment in the U.S. And that \u2018special relationship\u2019 with the US needs strengthening: Our economic trade ties with North America must now become stronger. My message is simple: Britain may be leaving the EU, but we are not withdrawing from the world. Britain will be a beacon for free trade, democracy and security, more open to that world than ever. Here\u2019s the full piece: WSJ: Britain Is Open for Business Osborne\u2019s mission makes sense; this would be an awful time for US companies to pull investment out of the UK. But he\u2019d better expect some tough questions about Britain\u2019s plans for Brexit, the Tory leadership battle, and the prospects for the pound.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. At first glance, all looks calm this morning. Asia\u2019s stock markets have hit a one-month high overnight after Japan\u2019s prime minister romped to election victory, potentially paving the way for constitutional changes and perhaps more stimulus measures. Investors are still feeling a warm glow after last Friday\u2019s US employment report, which showed many more jobs were created last month than expected. But beneath the surface, nasty things are lurking. The Brexit vote continues to dominate the UK, although we could be in limbo until Conservative Party members have appointed our next prime minister. And worries are mounting about Italy\u2019s banks, after Deutsche Bank AG\u2019s chief economist predicted that the sector may need a \u20ac150bn bailout. David Folkerts-Landau told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper that: \u201cEurope is extremely sick and must start dealing with its problems extremely quickly, or else there may be an accident. I\u2019m no doomsday prophet, I am a realist.\u201d Also coming up today.... UK chancellor George Osborne is meeting with US financial chiefs on Wall Street Eurozone finance ministers will hold a eurogroup meeting in Brussels this afternoon It\u2019s the Farnborough Airshow We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

A major boost came from foreign companies that switched their base to Ireland, increasing the value of the country\u2019s corporate sector. Michael Connolly, a senior statistician at Ireland\u2019s Central Statistics Office, said: What happens here is that an entire balance sheet of a company relocating to Ireland from somewhere else is included in our capital stocks or our international investment position. The very dramatic increase has increased the capacity for production in the economy and impacts the accounts for 2015 in the increase of exports and imports. Read our full story on the figures here: German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has been speaking in Brussels, where he joined other EU finance ministers for the latest Ecofin meeting. He called for Britain to be clear about its Brexit decision as soon as possible to limit long-term uncertainty. Speaking separately in Berlin, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel said her government\u2019s goal is to ensure Brexit does not have an impact in Germany. The FTSE 100 has risen above 6,700 for the first time since 11 August. Investors continue to be cheered by the swifter-than-expected conclusion to the Conservative Party leadership contest, with Theresa May confirmed on Tuesday as the UK\u2019s new PM. The FTSE is up 0.3% or 18 points at 6,701. The pound is up 1.2% against the dollar, at $1.3152. It is up 0.9% against the euro at \u20ac1.1850. Back in the wider world, European markets are higher. The FTSE 250 is up 0.6% at 16,803. Mark Carney came under considerable pressure from MPs, who quizzed him on the Bank\u2019s position in the lead up to the referendum on 23 June. It was the governor\u2019s first appearance in front of the Treasury Committee. Key points from the session: Carney said that by highlighting potential risks associated with Brexit he was representing the Bank\u2019s independent view, and not that of David Cameron or George Osborne. There was no political bias, he insisted. There was no discussion with the chancellor about any particular Brexit \u201cline\u201d to be taken by the Bank, the governor said. He said the move to relax the rules on how much capital banks must hold was not expected to be a \u201csilver bullet\u201d, addressing all the risks posed by the Brexit vote. But it would help to send a message to businesses and households that banks had money to lend. There will be no repeat of the credit crunch of 2008/2009. Consumers are also in a better position than they were before the crisis, with fewer debts. The Bank of England did not intervene in America\u2019s response to the HSBC files. A report in the US suggests the Department of Justice did not want to see legal proceedings against the bank because of the risks to financial stability. The Bank has the tools to ensure both monetary and financial stability, Carney said. He added the UK\u2019s exposure to the troubled Italian banking system was modest. The weaker pound could reduce Britain\u2019s current account deficit by about a third. Will the Brexit decision be negative for foreign direct investment over the long term, Tyrie asks Richard Sharp, an external member of the FPC? In the short to medium term yes, Sharp answers, in the longer term it will depend on policies and agreements struck. And that concludes the session. Full story and summary to follow. The governor says a weaker pound should improve the current account deficit, making it smaller. If maintained, the drop in the pound since the referendum would reduce the current account deficit by about a third, Carney estimates. Turning to the downsides of the Brexit vote for the current account, Carney includes the reduction in foreign investment in UK commercial property, and the \u201cmodest increase\u201d in risk premium associated with UK assets. When institutions try to bluff their way through risks, sweeping them under the carpet it is \u201cexactly the wrong thing to do\u201d, Carney says. Carney turns to the fall in the pound since the referendum. The exchange rate move can help the UK adjust to the post-Brexit environment, including the change in trade terms that will follow, the governor says. FPC member Donald Kohn says that if you are going to make a major decision to build a factory or open a new office in the UK, you would want to know what the terms of trading would be with other countries. Andrew Tyrie follows up by saying the Bank\u2019s MPC and FPC would have come in for considerable criticism had they not commented on the potential consequences of Brexit in the run up to the referendum. Deputy governor Cunliffe says the Bank\u2019s reputation would have been damaged if it had not warned of Brexit risks before the vote. Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg is up. He clashed with Carney in the run-up to the referendum, accusing the governor of being in the pocket of the chancellor on the remain side of the campaign. Rees-Mogg asks whether the Bank must be like Caesar\u2019s wife, \u201cabove suspicion\u201d? The MP is pressing on with the idea that Carney showed political bias in the run-up to the referendum by arguing that being a member of the EU would be net beneficial for the UK economy. Carney rejects the idea. The Conservative MP is now taking Carney to task on his comment pre-referendum that UK rates could go either up or down in the event of a Brexit vote. Was it ever likely that policy would be tightened, Rees-Mogg asks, or did it just suit the chancellor\u2019s argument? Carney says the statement was a balanced view, reflecting the views of the MPC as a whole. The governor is keeping a fairly cool head in the face of some hostile questioning by Rees-Mogg. Carney gets the last word, suggesting those questioning whether the Bank was biased \u201cshould consider their [own] motivations their judgements?\u201d Markets are hedging \u201cdownside risk\u201d according to Carney, which is why we have seen record low bond yields. Low bond yields do not give an accurate signal of the future of the UK economy. \u201cThe financial system can withstand huge shocks. There will be growth\u201d. Carney is talking about the ultra low rates environment we are currently in. The governor suggests that the Bank still has tools up its sleeve should it need them. We have the tools to meet our responsibilities for both monetary and financial stability. Carney continues to sound the same reassuring note he has adopted since the Brexit result was known on 24 June. Economists believe the Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee will announce fresh measures to stimulate the UK economy - possibly as early as Thursday when it announces its monthly policy decision. The MPC could further cut interest rates (from 0.5%) or extend quantitative easing (from \u00a3375bn), or both. FPC member Donald Kohn says the most likely scenario of a rise in UK interest rates is a strong economy. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be all bad news.\u201d Sir Jon Cunliffe, the Bank\u2019s deputy governor for financial stability, says we have seen the beginning of financial markets putting a risk premium on UK assets. However, his FPC colleague Donald Kohn says this is limited, because the banks are better capitalised than they were in the run-up to the financial crisis. Carney says consumers are in a better position than they were in the run-up the crisis, less indebted. So households indebtedness now poses a smaller risk to financial stability. Labour\u2019s Mann asks the governor how the Bank might deal with the short term risks posed by a potential second referendum on Scottish independence. He says the issue of UK bank headquarters should be addressed well before any future decision on independence. Now to Italian banks. Carney says there is a macroeconomic risk posed by Italian banks and their bad loans and the Italian authorities are looking at it. The UK\u2019s exposure is \u201cmodest,\u201d the governor says. Labour MP John Mann is bringing Carney to task on property funds, and the fact the FPC was aware that investors were likely to withdraw large sums of money in the event of a Brexit vote. Why didn\u2019t the FPC do anything? Carney says that markets have created funds with daily liquidity that invest in illiquid assets (i.e. property). He says the FCA were aware and were looking at the issue. Tyrie now asks Donald Kohn about a Republican party report in the US that claims the Department of Justice did not want to see legal proceedings against the HSBC because of risks to financial stability. Should we be taking this seriously? Kohn says he has no specific knowledge of this situation. I wouldn\u2019t pass judgment until I heard the other side of the story. Tyrie to Carney: \u201cDid you discuss the matter with the chancellor? The allegation here is that UK authorities have been meddling.\u201d Carney says he was not involved in or aware of any alleged intervention on the HSBC case. (A reminder of the HSBC files here.) There will be no \u201ccredit crunch\u201d, unlike 2008/2009, according to the governor, because banks will have funds available to lend. Credit supply (lack of it) will not constrain the economy. Reeves says she worries that the relaxing of rules on bank\u2019s capital requirements are not going to be enough to save the economy post-Brexit. Carney says it\u2019s just one element of a bigger story: We would not represent this as a single silver bullet. It is part of a series of measures. Reeves says she is still worried about whether there will be a reduction in lending. Carney says that demand, not credit availability, is more likely to wane. We really want to make it as clear as possible to businesses and individuals that credit should be available for the right ideas, for the right transactions, be it a mortgage or a new business. Rachel Reeves, Labour MP, says the Bank was right to warn on Brexit risks before she moves on to the issue of counter-cyclical buffers. Carney says that by relaxing the rules for banks he wanted to \u201ctake off the table\u201d concerns about credit supply. \u201cThe banks are well capitalised.\u201d Now Tyrie is asking whether Carney would agree to the publication of records of any discussions the governor had with Osborne on the matter, in order to ease any fears of political bias the public might have. The governor says that he is prepared to look at how that can be done as long as it is within the public interest. Tyrie quips that lead Brexiteer Boris Johnson has credited Carney with doing a good job since the vote. Returning to serious mode, Carney says things are different in the current era, much more transparent. We don\u2019t keep things under wraps. The governor now has the chance to defend himself against the allegations. He describes the allegations as \u201cextraordinary\u201d. The chair [of the FPC] does not guide conclusions. The views of the FPC are the views of the FPC. What was in the March record are the views of the FPC, they are not pre-judged or pre-decided. Tyrie asks whether the Chancellor sought from Carney guidance on the likely \u201clines\u201d the Bank would take on the referendum. Carney says he didn\u2019t, that\u2019s not the way it works. David Kohn, an external member of the Bank\u2019s Financial Policy Committee, says the committee were in agreement on Brexit risks, and that there was no pressure on policymaker to take one view or another. We looked at the potential risks that might emerge from a leave vote. All of us agreed it was the biggest near term risk to financial stability The statement we put out at the end of March was a consensus opinion. Tyrie says he wants to address the allegation in the run-up to the referendum that the Bank attempted to scare voters about Brexit for political motives. Tyrie runs through the allegations, made by various politicians on the Leave side of the campaign. They claimed the governor was working in the interests of David Cameron and George Osborne, calling into question the independence of the Bank of England. Tyrie: That\u2019s a very serious allegation. Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury Committee, makes the point that this is a significant moment, as it is the first opportunity for MP\u2019s to quiz the governor since the Brexit vote. Here we go. The governor and Bank colleagues take their seats. The Treasury Committee is late starting, we will be bringing you updates once it\u2019s underway... The full story on the FPC minutes from the Guardian\u2019s Jill Treanor: Quick note before the governor starts... This from Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets on the relief among investors... The confirmation of a new UK Prime Minister has offered some welcome certainty in uncertain times. Theresa May as PM has produced no Mayday calls in markets. The \u201csafe hands\u201d of Mrs May at the helm has actually reduced distress signals. The pound has risen over 1% against the dollar today, adding to yesterday\u2019s gains when Andrea Leadsom ended her campaign to become the Tory party leader. The certainty of Theresa May stepping into the top job in UK politics ahead of schedule has had the perhaps unintuitive effect of weighing on UK stocks. It was the drop in sterling that cushioned the \u2018Brexit blow\u2019 because of its positive effect on UK company foreign earnings. Subsequently, the rebound in the pound is weighing on the FTSE 100, notably the big multinationals including Vodafone, GlaxoSmithKline and Diageo. Next up: Mark Carney appears at the Treasury Select Committee. Will there be fireworks as he faces his adversary Jacob Rees-Mogg, the MP and Brexit supporter ? The minutes from the Financial Policy Committee also reveal that policymakers were unanimous in the decision to cut banks\u2019 capital requirements following the EU referendum. Last week the FPC lowered a capital requirement for banks, affording them greater flexibility to absorb potential Brexit-related shocks. Bank of England was warned that investors were likely to pull large amounts of money out of commercial property funds following the Brexit vote. Minutes from the meeting of the Bank\u2019s Financial Policy Committee on 28 June and 1 July (published here) reveal that policymakers were warned by the City regulator that funds might be suspended, which is exactly what happened. Since 4 July, seven funds have made moves to stop withdrawals either by suspending trading or reducing the value of the fund. The minutes reveal: The FPC was briefed by the Financial Conduct Authority on the extent of outflows from these funds and on the possibility that funds could suspend redemptions in the near term. The Bank also published two paragraphs that were redacted from the minutes of an earlier FPC meeting in March. The pars related to contingency planning in the run-up to the 23 June referendum and were deemed at the time to be against the public interest. Here are the paragraphs: Supervisors were engaging with banks, insurers and central counterparties on their contingency plans for risks related to the referendum, including for managing funding and liquidity risks in sterling and foreign currency. Several firms had reported that they were conducting stress tests with referendum related strategies of varying severity. UBS boss warns about potential job moves from the UK following the Brexit vote... Nintendo shares are up more than 50% in the three trading days since its Pok\u00e9mon Go game was launched. Nintendo\u2019s shares rose 12.8% to \u00a522,860 in Tokyo on Tuesday, taking total gains in the past three days to 53%. It means the market value of the company has jumped by \u00a37bn since the latest version of its 21-year-old game was made available on 7 July. Pok\u00e9mon Go is the first edition of the game for mobile phones and and lets players face the monsters in the real world using their smartphone cameras. Figures published overnight showed consumer spending slowed to recession levels in the run up to the EU referendum. High street and online sales were up 0.2% in June compared with the same month a year earlier according to the survey from the British Retail Consortium and KPMG. But sales were down 0.5% on a like-for-like basis, which strips out the impact of sales at shops open for less than a year. Over the second quarter, sales were up 0.5% on the first quarter and 1.2% up on an annual basis. The BRC said this was the weakest performance since May 2009, when the economy was contracting during its longest and deepest postwar recessions. Economists have commented that consumers are likely to delay spending on big items while economic uncertainty reigns following the Brexit decision. Meanwhile the yen hit more than a two-week low against the dollar as investors factored in more monetary stimulus following the the election victory by Japan\u2019s ruling coalition. The dollar rose 0.8% to 103.64 yen, its strongest since 24 June when the Brexit vote was revealed. The pound is rising this morning, currently up 1% against the dollar at $1.3130. As it stands, the pound is on track for its biggest one-day gain since before the EU referendum. Sterling is also up 0.6% against the euro at \u20ac1.1813. Markets have edged higher in early trading, following the FTSE 100\u2019s move into a bull market on Monday. The FTSE 100 is trailing however, down four points. Investors have found comfort from the sooner-than-expected end to the Conservative Party leadership contest. Theresa May\u2019s confirmation as the next Prime Minister removes the uncertainty that investors were expecting to run for another couple of month. May is expected to move into Number 10 on Wednesday, when firm plans for Brexit and life outside the EU can get underway.

The Bank of England is in focus this morning. At 9.30am the Bank will publish the minutes of the Financial Policy Committee meeting held on 28 July and 1 July. Then at 10am the Bank\u2019s governor Mark Carney will be questioned by MPs on the Treasury Select Committee about the Financial Stability Report published by the Bank last week. Here is our story on the report: Today\u2019s session will give Carney the opportunity to provide his latest view on the fallout from the Brexit vote, in this fast-changing environment. You can watch it live here. Also coming up...

Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s warned last week that it will monitor the \u201csuccess or otherwise\u201d of the Turnbull government\u2019s ability to pass revenue and expenditure measures through the new parliament over the next 12 months. The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said on Wednesday that, after receiving the incoming government brief from Treasury this week, he had no reason to doubt the revenue projections in the Coalition\u2019s budget. But he left room for another potential revenue downgrade, saying Australia\u2019s economy was facing a volatile environment. \u201cPlainly there are a lot of factors in the global environment which impinge upon Australia\u2019s economic performance, and indeed revenues of government, both for good or ill,\u201d he said. The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, made sovereign credit ratings a key election issue during the campaign, repeatedly warning that the Coalition\u2019s budget plans would put Australia\u2019s AAA-rating at risk. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, countered that the Coalition\u2019s $48bn corporate tax cut would encourage investment and spur long-term economic growth, and therefore keep the AAA-rating in place. But critics say neither major party should take ratings agencies seriously any more because they lost their credibility during the global financial crisis. An economist, John Quiggin, argued this week that the central importance placed on the AAA rating by Australia\u2019s political class had also \u201cseriously distorted our economic policy debate\u201d. \u201cIn the lead-up to the GFC, AAA ratings were tossed around like confetti, being awarded to derivative securities that were ultimately based on home mortgages that could not possibly be repaid when prices inevitably fell,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHundreds of these allegedly gold-plated securities went into default. Only when disaster was already obvious did the agencies fix their ratings. \u201cThe announcement by Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s that Australia\u2019s AAA credit rating was to be placed on a negative outlook was widely greeted as a harbinger of doom. In reality, however, the loss of the AAA rating would have almost no effect on our economy.\u201d The warning from Fitch Ratings will nevertheless contribute to the political debate in Canberra as the Coalition and Labor readjust their economic arguments post-election. The Reserve Bank\u2019s meeting in August is already being factored in, because economists are predicting that the official interest rate could once again be cut, this time to a historically low 1.5%. On Wednesday, the latest Westpac-Melbourne Institute survey of consumer confidence \u2013 conducted between 4 and 7 July \u2013 found consumer sentiment deteriorated this month, with the number of pessimists now outweighing optimists. Westpac\u2019s chief economist, Bill Evans, said Brexit and the prospect of a hung parliament in Australia had weighed on the results.",

                "bodyText":"The Bank of England could cut interest rates and inject billions of pounds into the financial system as early as Thursday as policymakers seek to prevent Britain sliding into recession after the EU referendum. Under pressure to stem further falls in sterling, Mark Carney, the governor, is expected by financial markets to halve the 0.5% base rate on Thursday and reignite the Bank\u2019s quantitative easing programme. Speculation has intensified in recent days after Carney dropped heavy hints that action would be needed to turn around an economy suffering badly as a result of the vote to leave the EU. Several City economists said it was crucial for the central bank to step in and maintain the flow of cheap credit to the economy at a time when business and consumer confidence had fallen to levels last seen after the financial crash. A slump in the pound to a 31-year low has also undermined confidence among City investors concerned that the UK\u2019s growth prospects will be damaged by leaving the single market. Markets have put an 80% probability on a move by the Bank by Thursday. Howard Archer, chief economist at the consultancy IHS Global Insight, said: \u201cWith the UK economic outlook weakened by the Brexit vote, there can be little doubt \u2013 if any \u2013 that the Bank of England will enact some stimulus following the July MPC [monetary policy committee] meeting. The only question really seems to be what action will the MPC take?\u201d Carney said in a speech last month that the loss of confidence highlighted by a string of negative surveys meant \u201csome monetary policy easing will likely be required over the summer\u201d. A closely watched consumer confidence index from market researchers GfK last week recorded the biggest drop in sentiment for 21 years, following the Brexit vote. He also highlighted the legacy of previous shocks that meant businesses and households were suffering from \u201ceconomic post-traumatic stress disorder\u201d. Archer said it was likely the would add to the \u00a3375bn quantitative easing programme, which has been frozen for the last three years, and turn on the taps of its funding for lending scheme, offering cheap loans to banks for mortgage lending. But the Bank\u2019s nine-member MPC, which will announce its decision at midday, could disappoint after the pound enjoyed a rally this week that traders largely credited to the swift appointment of Theresa May as prime minister, ending the recent political uncertainty. The stock market has rallied over the last 10 days, regaining and more all its losses in the immediate aftermath of the referendum\u2019s shock result. Concerns that Britain would come under pressure to trigger the EU\u2019s exit clause, article 50, and start negotiations early were scotched by May\u2019s elevation to the top job. Her supporters made it clear the new government would take its time before initiating talks with Brussels.

Carney announced after the vote that Threadneedle Street would take steps to release up to \u00a3150bn worth of lending to households and businesses by relaxing regulatory requirements on the banking sector. The MPC is not expected to begin a full review of the economy until its August meeting, by which time some of the smoke caused by the Brexit vote will have cleared. A group of economists who backed Brexit said dire predictions for the UK economy were \u201cgrossly exaggerated\u201d and accused Carney and the chancellor, George Osborne, of issuing unjustified warnings over the damaging economic impact of uncertainty. Patrick Minford, an economics professor at Cardiff University and prominent monetarist, said the panic was misplaced and had largely bypassed consumers, who had maintained their spending. He said the plunge in the pound also meant there was no need for the Bank governor to take rapid action and cut interest rates.",

                "bodyText":"Britain\u2019s consumers and businesses will have to wait another month for the Bank of England to provide a boost to the ailing post-Brexit economy after Threadneeedle Street decided against an immediate cut in borrowing costs in the wake of last month\u2019s referendum. The Bank\u2019s nine-strong monetary policy committee confounded City analysts who had widely expected a fall in business and consumer confidence to prompt an immediate cut in interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25%. Instead the MPC dropped the broadest of hints that the first cut in interest rates since 2009 would come in August, with a package of measures designed to prevent activity stalling in the second half of 2016. Minutes of the MPC meeting showed that the majority of members thought there could only be the shortest of delays before action was taken to stimulate activity. The Bank also warned that it expects \u201csizeable falls\u201d in commercial property values in the coming months and also revised down the outlook for house prices. But news that rates had been left on hold prompted a sharp rise in the value of the pound \u2013 because lower interest rates tend to weaken currencies. Sterling rose by almost two cents against the US dollar to end the day just above $1.33. City experts now predict that August will see the Bank deliver a package that will halve official interest rates to 0.25%, sanction an increase in the money-creating quantitative easing programme, and expand the cut-price loans provided by the government\u2019s Funding for Lending scheme. \u201cOfficial data on economic activity covering the period since the referendum are not yet available\u201d, the minutes of the MPC meeting said. \u201cHowever, there are preliminary signs that the result has affected sentiment among households and companies, with sharp falls in some measures of business and consumer confidence.\u201d The Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, held his first meeting with the new chancellor, Philip Hammond, before the noon announcement that interest rates were for now being left on hold and that there would be no expansion of the \u00a3375bn quantitative easing scheme. Hammond made it clear during his first round of media interviews that he had no intention of delivering a post-Brexit budget but would wait until the Autumn Statement towards the end of the year before outlining the May administration\u2019s plans for tax, public spending and deficit reduction. That puts the onus on the Bank to provide support for the economy once it has completed a comprehensive assessment of the outlook in its quarterly inflation report. David Owen, chief European economist at Jefferies International, said there was a \u201cstrong case\u201d for Hammond bringing forward the timing of the Autumn Statement to early November to show a more joined up policy response. \u201cWhat chance the government finances investment projects using infrastructure bonds which the BoE ultimately buys?\u201d Speeches from MPC members over the next two weeks will now be pored over for clues as to what the Bank is planning in early August. Only one member, Gertjan Vlieghe, an external member know for his dovish views, voted in favour of an instant response to the Brexit vote. Carney, speaking a week after the shock Brexit vote, had alerted financial markets to the possibility of an immediate rate cut when he said his personal view was \u201cthe economic outlook has deteriorated and some monetary policy easing will likely be required over the summer\u201d. Dennis de Jong, managing director at currency broker UFX.com said: \u201cThe Bank of England faced its biggest interest rate decision since the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis today, and its decision against cutting the rate for the first time in more than seven years shows that Mark Carney and co believe the storm can be weathered in the short term. \u201cHowever, the unprecedented uncertainty means we could still see radical steps taken in the coming weeks to ward of a Brexit-induced recession.

AM US markets have opened slightly higher following the stronger-than-expected figures from the retail and manufacturing sectors in June. Dow Jones: +0.2% at 18,536 S&amp;P 500: +0.2% at 2,168 Nasdaq: +0.2% at 5,043 The US manufacturing sector was also in better-than-expected health in June. Output increased 0.4% over the month, compared with expectations of a 0.2% rise and a 0.3% drop in May. The wider measure of industrial output rose by 0.6%, following a 0.3% drop in May. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, says the unexpected strength of retail sales signals annual growth of between 2.5%-3% in the second quarter. Rob Carnell, chief international economist at ING, says the data suggests the Federal Reserve might raise US interest rates before markets are currently expecting. Markets have virtually no tightening by the Fed priced in until late 2017, but following on from the strong recent labour market report, the latest US data indicate that there is nothing much wrong with either US growth, and few reasons for concern about inflation either. Markets seem in a wait-and-see mode following the UK Brexit vote, and the Fed seems in no hurry to disappoint them by doing anything radical. So we don\u2019t see this data having much effect on markets expectations. But the evidence is mounting that the pessimism on the US economy and the Fed in particular is overdone, and a market rethink cannot be too far away. US retail sales for June have come in stronger-than-expected, rising 0.6% over the month compared with expectations of a much smaller 0.1% increase. It was an improvement on May, when sales were up by just 0.2% (revised down from an earlier estimate of 0.5% growth). Separate US data showed annual inflation was unchanged at 1% in June, roughly in line with expectations of 1.1%. Core inflation - which strips out more volatile elements such as energy and food - ticked up to 2.3% in June from 2.2% in May. The rail minister Claire Perry has resigned, after previously admitting she was \u201coften ashamed\u201d to be in the job while Southern continues to cause misery for commuters. Our story here: European new car sales grew 6.9% in June compared with the same month a year earlier, with 1.46m vehicles registered. It was the 34th consecutive month of growth. Among the major markets, Italy was the strongest performer, with new car sales up 11.9%, while the UK was at the bottom of the pile with sales down 0.8% (as private sales fell before the referendum). Italy: +11.9% Spain: +11.2% Germany: +8.3% France: 0.8% UK: -0.8% Connor Campbell, analyst at Spreadex, has this take on equity markets, which are down across Europe: Europe\u2019s earlier positions only became more entrenched as Friday went on, while the US open looks unlikely to bring much excitement. Dropping around 20 points the FTSE dipped below 6650, sporadically grazing lows not see since the start of the week. The continued losses in the travel sector, alongside the wave of red currently coating the commodities, were the catalysts for the UK index\u2019s Friday fall, though the residual disappointment that the Bank of England failed to reveal any stimulus measures yesterday obviously also played a part. The eurozone understandably saw the biggest losses this morning, the DAX and CAC falling 0.5% and 0.8% respectively following the tragic events in Nice on Thursday evening. Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC\u2019s general secretary, says the drop in UK construction output in May shows there is an urgent need for Theresa May\u2019s government to deliver on its industrial strategy pledge. Even before the referendum vote, construction was in trouble. We need to ensure that working people do not pay the price for leaving the EU. Greg Clark needs to live up to his new title as Industrial Strategy Secretary and develop an industrial road map for the UK. A major programme of public investment can support jobs and growth, and provide a much-needed confidence boost. That means ministers greenlighting Heathrow\u2019s third runway, expanding high-speed rail, and building more homes. European markets are still down, with investors finding little to cheer. The FTSE 250 is down 1.2% at 16,591 Here is our full story on Andrew Haldane\u2019s insistence that the Bank of England must pump fresh stimulus into the UK economy from August. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, described this morning\u2019s weak UK construction data as the latest in \u201can ugly run of data for the sector\u201d. He says the pace of UK economic growth probably slowed in the second quarter - from 0.4% in the first - with the construction acting as a drag. Construction looks likely to have contracted in the second quarter, adding weight to expectations that the overall pace of economic growth will have slowed in the second quarter from the 0.4% expansion seen in the first quarter. PMI data point to just a 0.2% rise in second quarter GDP. Going forward, prospects look worse, for the short term at least. The drop in activity seen in the June construction PMI was fueled by uncertainty about the mere possibility off \u2018Brexit\u2019. The reality of the UK leaving the EU and the associated heightened uncertainty, especially in relation to commercial property and housing investment, is therefore likely to cause further stress in coming months. The Bank of England needs to unleash fresh measures at its August policy meeting to deal with the fallout from the Brexit vote. That is the view of Andy Haldane, the Bank\u2019s chief economist and member of the rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee. The MPC surprised the City yesterday by failing to cut interest rates. Economists were forecasting a quarter point cut to 0.25%. But in comments made on Friday Haldane is loud and clear that the Bank is poised to act in August, an inflation report month when policymakers will have access to the latest forecasts. And the MPC might do more than cut rates. Haldane says: In my personal view... a material easing of monetary policy is likely to be needed, as one part of a collective policy response aimed at helping protect the economy and jobs from a downturn. Given the scale of insurance required, a package of mutually complementary monetary policy easing measures is likely to be necessary. And this monetary response, if it is to buttress expectations and confidence, needs I think to be delivered promptly as well as muscularly. By promptly I mean next month, when the precise size and extent of the necessary stimulatory measures can be determined as part of the August Inflation Report round. It is fairly unusually for a member of the MPC to be so direct, and Haldane\u2019s comments immediately reduced the pound\u2019s gains against the dolllar. It is now up just 0.1% at $1.3352. Haldane uses an interesting analogy to stress the importance of taking strong action, quickly: I would rather run the risk of taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut than taking a miniature rock hammer to tunnel my way out of prison \u2013 like another Andy, the one in the Shawshank Redemption. And yes I know Andy did eventually escape. But it did take him 20 years. The MPC does not have that same \u201cluxury\u201d. The poor construction data for May suggests the sector was a drag on the wider economy in the second quarter of the year. Construction output would have had to have risen 1.9% in June just to be flat over the quarter. That seems unlikely, especially given the Markit PMI indicator suggests June was a very weak month for the sector. The ONS will publish its first estimate of second-quarter growth on 27 July. Reaction to the weak construction data is coming in. Output fell 2.1% in May compared with June, and was 1.9% lower than a year earlier according to the Office for National Statistics data. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said it was \u201cmore very disappointing news on the construction sector\u201d. Housebuilding was the main drag over the month. The construction sector does look to be vulnerable following the Brexit vote. The vote to leave the EU threatens to weigh down markedly on construction activity in the near term at least due to heightened caution of clients to commit to major projects particularly in the commercial real estate sector, likely markedly weakened economic activity and the very real risk of a significant downturn in the housing market. Earlier this week, the UK\u2019s biggest housebuilder Barratt said it could reduce the rate at which it builds new homes because of the economic slowdown the Brexit vote is expected to trigger. The sharper-than-expected fall in construction in May came a month before Britain voted in the EU referendum on 23 June. The biggest driver of the monthly fall was a slowdown in private housebuilding, signalling caution among companies in the run-up to the vote. The only part of the construction sector that didn\u2019t shrink in May was infrastructure. Construction output fell 2.1% in May, following a 2.8% increase in April (revised up from 2.5%). It was worse than expected, with economists forecasting a smaller drop of 1%. Sterling is set for its biggest weekly gain since 2009, during the depths of the financial crisis. The pound is up 0.6% against the dollar at $1.3414, after hitting a low point on Monday of $1.2849. Here is our story on how Canada is educating Britain on how to do trade deals... The UK government has approached Canada for advice on how to do trade deals following Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU. Liam Fox, secretary of state for the newly created department for international trade, will meet Chrystia Freeland, Canada\u2019s trade minister on Friday afternoon. She will be able to give Fox a key insight into the technicalities of how Canada negotiated its recent trade agreement with the EU. Freeland told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that securing such trade deals is \u201cvery very complicated\u201d, and that\u2019s with a 300-strong negotiating team. Britain, on the other hand, does not have a negotiating team. It hasn\u2019t needed one as a member of the EU because trade agreements are struck by Brussels on behalf of its member states. That could prove to be a major stumbling block, as the UK government will need to bring in a large team to negotiate new deals for Britain post-Brexit. Where will they all come from? The government will hope that it can \u2018borrow\u2019 negotiators from places such as Canada and New Zealand, but it is also thought to be sounding out top law firms and consultancies which could prove costly for the UK taxpayer. The pound is now back below $1.34, but is still up 0.3% at $1.3373. It is just a touch up against the euro at\u20ac1.2006. Markets are down across Europe this morning. Travel and leisure companies are among the biggest fallers following the Bastille Day attack in Nice, France. FTSE 100: -0.1% at 6,649 FTSE 250: -0.2% at 16,760 STOXX Europe 600: -0.5% at 337 France\u2019s CAC: -0.7% at 4,353 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.5% at 10,021 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.1% at 16,789 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.2% at 8,536 Asian markets have risen, helped by data from China which suggested the world\u2019s second largest economy is stable. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound continues to rise this morning and is now above $1.34, after receiving a boost on Thursday when the Bank of England surprised the City by leaving interest rates on hold at 0.5%. Economists polled by Reuters were forecasting a quarter point rate following earlier signals from governor Mark Carney that the Bank was ready to pump more stimulus into the economy in a bid to ward off recession in this post Brexit-vote world. The Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee is now expected to lower rates at its meeting in August - an inflation report month when policymakers have access to Threadneedle Street\u2019s latest economic forecasts. The pound is up 0.7% against the dollar at $1.3434, and up 0.6% against the euro at \u20ac1.2068. Also coming up today... UK construction output numbers for May, which should give an indication of confidence in the run-up to the referendum. Eurozone inflation data for June. The Bank of England is expected to publish a speech by Andy Haldane, its chief economist and member of the Monetary Policy Committee. Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor is giving a speech in Toronto about climate change. From the US, we will bring you the latest data from the retail and manufacturing sectors, as well inflation data for June.",

                "body":"<p>Almost four weeks have passed since Britain voted to leave the EU, and those who wanted to remain in it are having trouble accepting the result. They feel bereft. They feel that they were defeated by underhand means. They feel that those who voted for Brexit were uneducated and didn\u2019t really understand what they were doing.</p> <p>There is a nasty undercurrent of disdain, bordering on contempt, to all this angst. Many of those on the losing side of the referendum debate appear to actively want the economy to slide into recession in order to teach the 52% a lesson.</p> <p>Let\u2019s be clear. The economy is fragile. It was slowing down even before the referendum date was fixed and it is ill-prepared for the shock of Brexit. The UK has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/21/brexit-uncertainty-hits-plans-to-cut-budget-deficit\">a budget deficit</a> of 4% of GDP, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/30/uk-current-account-deficit-deepens-brexit-fears\">balance of payments deficit </a>of 7% of GDP and the worst recent productivity record of any G7 country bar Italy. The idea that George Osborne \u201cfixed the roof while the sun was shining\u201d is fatuous.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, it is easy to sketch out the reasons why things are going to be difficult. Traditionally, investment is the swing factor in any economic cycle. When businesses are upbeat about the future, they spend more on new kit, boosting national output. When they are cautious, as they are certain to be now, they mothball spending plans and GDP weakens.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/18/the-uk-eu-battle-over-free-movement-and-terms-of-trade\">The UK-EU battle over free movement and terms of trade | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Consumer spending <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/12/consumer-spending-slows-recession-eu-referendum-retail-sales-bad-weather\">will also be hit</a> by the squeeze on spending power caused by the higher inflation that will result from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/06/brexit-pound-plunges-to-30-year-lows-as-eu-fears-bite-into-global-markets-again\">impact of the falling pound</a> on the cost of imports. The flipside is that exports become cheaper, which will help boost output, albeit not by much, unless global demand recovers from its current depressed level.</p> <p>A slowdown, therefore, seems inevitable. The extent and duration of that slowdown will depend on the actions taken by the Bank of England and the Treasury, and how long it takes the government to sketch out what a Brexit Britain is going to look like.</p> <p>None of this is a surprise. The notion that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/29/bank-of-england-clamps-down-buy-to-let-lending\">economy would struggle</a> after a leave vote was strongly argued during the referendum campaign, but did not carry the day.

                "bodyText":"Almost four weeks have passed since Britain voted to leave the EU, and those who wanted to remain in it are having trouble accepting the result. They feel bereft. They feel that they were defeated by underhand means. They feel that those who voted for Brexit were uneducated and didn\u2019t really understand what they were doing. There is a nasty undercurrent of disdain, bordering on contempt, to all this angst. Many of those on the losing side of the referendum debate appear to actively want the economy to slide into recession in order to teach the 52% a lesson. Let\u2019s be clear. The economy is fragile. It was slowing down even before the referendum date was fixed and it is ill-prepared for the shock of Brexit. The UK has a budget deficit of 4% of GDP, a balance of payments deficit of 7% of GDP and the worst recent productivity record of any G7 country bar Italy. The idea that George Osborne \u201cfixed the roof while the sun was shining\u201d is fatuous. What\u2019s more, it is easy to sketch out the reasons why things are going to be difficult. Traditionally, investment is the swing factor in any economic cycle. When businesses are upbeat about the future, they spend more on new kit, boosting national output. When they are cautious, as they are certain to be now, they mothball spending plans and GDP weakens. Consumer spending will also be hit by the squeeze on spending power caused by the higher inflation that will result from the impact of the falling pound on the cost of imports. The flipside is that exports become cheaper, which will help boost output, albeit not by much, unless global demand recovers from its current depressed level. A slowdown, therefore, seems inevitable. The extent and duration of that slowdown will depend on the actions taken by the Bank of England and the Treasury, and how long it takes the government to sketch out what a Brexit Britain is going to look like. None of this is a surprise. The notion that the economy would struggle after a leave vote was strongly argued during the referendum campaign, but did not carry the day. Hence the view that those who voted for Brexit didn\u2019t understand what was at stake. Yet the evidence suggests that many of those who voted to leave knew that there would be a short-term hit to the economy, but decided that they were willing to take the risk. They weighed up the pros and cons \u2013 as did US investment banks, the CBI and universities \u2013 but came up with a different answer. A speech given last week by Andy Haldane, the chief economist at the Bank, helps explain why so many people were unmoved by George Osborne\u2019s argument that the UK would be voting for a DIY recession if the country opted for Brexit. On a visit to Nottingham, Haldane said he was struck by the fact that for many people, the recession that followed the financial crisis of 2008 had never ended. When he talked about economic recovery, he was stopped in his tracks by a \u201cforest of furrowed brows\u201d. The message was simple: there had been no recovery. As Haldane went on to explain, this was not a case of false consciousness. The economic facts are plain: the economy is simply not delivering for millions of people. Earnings are 7% above where they were when the recession ended in 2009, but still 5% below the peak once rising prices are taken into account. This is the longest period of flat or falling real wages since the mid 19th century. UK national wealth, measured by the value of assets such as property and pensions, has increased by an impressive sounding \u00a33tn since 2009, but the gains have been skewed towards those who owned their own homes or had sizeable pension pots. Only in two UK regions of the UK, London and the south-east, is GDP per head higher than it was before the recession. Everywhere else, it is lower \u2013 strikingly so in some parts of the country. The argument deployed by the remain side, that the only real risk to Britain\u2019s economic renaissance was a vote to leave the EU, worked in the more affluent parts of Britain, where the recovery was tangible, but fell on deaf ears elsewhere. During the campaign, Osborne put out figures showing that households in the UK would be \u00a34,300 a year worse off on average by 2030 in the event of Brexit, because the economy would be six percentage points smaller. This had zero impact. In part, that might be because voters were rightly dubious about the Treasury\u2019s ability to make such long-term economic forecasts.

All the evidence suggests that this was a perfectly logical assumption. In essence, the referendum divided Britain between those who were doing well out of the status quo and those who weren\u2019t. The latter group wanted change and appear to be willing to risk a recession to get it. And change there has certainly been. Osborne has been fired, his ludicrous idea of a post-Brexit \u201cpunishment\u201d budget has been scrapped, and the idea of balancing the budget by the end of the parliament rightly abandoned. The Treasury has been told to put growth before deficit reduction, a change of tack that is long overdue, and will have to work with a business department that has the crafting of an industrial strategy as part of its remit. A stimulus package will be announced by the Bank next month. Brexit has also forced the rest of the EU to have a rethink, with a debate under way between those who think that the response should be a drive for closer integration and a more powerful group, which believes that the dream of political union is dead in the water. As in the UK, budgetary rules will be loosened, and not before time. None of this should disguise the enormity of the challenges ahead.

Assuming the bid price, Softbank is paying over 25% less in yen terms compared to over a year ago to acquire this crown jewel of UK, and indeed global, intellectual property. The devaluation of sterling will continue to provide interesting investment opportunities for overseas investors to buy UK assets, including central London property, at a discount. </p> <p>The repercussions of the Brexit decision have yet to be felt. Over the next six to nine months we will see not only the direct effect on growth in the UK and Europe of this blow to business confidence, but also the impact it has on the political landscape. We should take some reassurance from recent market action as it was a high profile challenge to the resilience of the European financial system. The measures central banks have put in place to address outside \u201cshocks\u201d passed an important test, which is an endorsement of the progress made since the Eurozone crisis. Furthermore, as last week\u2019s non-European data indicated, the world economic picture still has many bright spots. The US remains highly resilient whilst the picture in emerging markets is improving. If the last two weeks has taught us anything, it is that Britain is not as important to the world as the world is to Britain, hence the importance of retaining a global perspective when making investment decisions.</p> <p>Our view prior to Brexit was that the world would \u201cmuddle through\u201d and risk takers would be rewarded for their steely nerve. Our view now is the same, but there is less margin for error and a higher level of background political risk.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-578cdcf5e4b08239dbab7cc8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-18T13:45:22.999Z\">2.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wells Fargo buys City office block development for \u00a3300m</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In another sign that Britain remains open for business, US bank Wells Fargo is to buy an 11-storey office block development in the heart of the City in one of the largest real estate deals since the Brexit vote.<br><br>It has bought the development - 33 Central at 33 King William Street - from property company HB Reavis.

                "bodyText":"The ARM deal may have boosted the UK markets, but elsewhere the mood was fairly uninspired. French and German markets dipped slightly while Italy edged higher and Wall Street struggled to gain ground. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 26.18 points or 0.39% higher at 6695.42, but that was more than accounted for by the gain in ARM (26.5 points). It still represents the highest close since August last year Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.04% to 10,063.13 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.34% lower at 4357.74 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.08% to 16,762.73 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.08% at 8524.4 In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.38% to 555.26 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 4.79 points or 0.03%. Meanwhile after the hawkish comments from MPC member Martin Weale, the pound has added 0.49% to $1.3255. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. It has ended up being a fairly uninspiring day on the markets, with only the \u00a324bn deal to buy UK chip designer ARM giving a boost to leading shares. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct said: There\u2019s really only one story driving the rally in London today, and that\u2019s the bid for ARM Holdings that\u2019s been received from Japan\u2019s SoftBank. Shares in the microchip company are up around 40% and if it hadn\u2019t been for this news, the day\u2019s performance would have been a whole lot more pedestrian. Hawkish comments from BoE policymaker Martin Weale have also done little to buoy sentiment for UK stocks today, although the confidence this kind of message imparts has at least managed to cheer the housebuilders. At the other end of the board, TUI is markedly lower off the back of the weekend\u2019s events in Turkey amidst fears of holidaymakers changing plans for the summer, whilst BHP Billiton is also struggling with word that a subsidiary has seen its debt rating downgraded to junk weighing here. Oil prices are now down around 2% as new data showed a hike in US crude supplies. Market data firm Genscape reported a stock build of 26,460 barrels last week at the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery hub, following a surge in US supplies of gasoline and distillate last week. Brent crude is currently down $1.03 a barrel at $46.58 while West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, is down 2.1% at $44.98 a barrel. Wall Street has edged ahead in early trading, continuing to head towards record highs but only gradually. A drop in the oil price has taken the shine off some reasonable company results, with Bank of America beating expectations with its second quarter figures. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 0.12% at 18538, compared to its lifetime high of 18557. The proposed takeover of ARM by Japan\u2019s Softbank is an illustration of the consequences of volatility in the global currency markets, says John Haynes, head of research at Investec Wealth &amp; Investment: The announcement of an agreed bid for ARM Holdings by Softbank of Japan is the clearest illustration possible of the consequences of the current global currency volatility. Assuming the bid price, Softbank is paying over 25% less in yen terms compared to over a year ago to acquire this crown jewel of UK, and indeed global, intellectual property. The devaluation of sterling will continue to provide interesting investment opportunities for overseas investors to buy UK assets, including central London property, at a discount. The repercussions of the Brexit decision have yet to be felt. Over the next six to nine months we will see not only the direct effect on growth in the UK and Europe of this blow to business confidence, but also the impact it has on the political landscape. We should take some reassurance from recent market action as it was a high profile challenge to the resilience of the European financial system. The measures central banks have put in place to address outside \u201cshocks\u201d passed an important test, which is an endorsement of the progress made since the Eurozone crisis. Furthermore, as last week\u2019s non-European data indicated, the world economic picture still has many bright spots. The US remains highly resilient whilst the picture in emerging markets is improving. If the last two weeks has taught us anything, it is that Britain is not as important to the world as the world is to Britain, hence the importance of retaining a global perspective when making investment decisions. Our view prior to Brexit was that the world would \u201cmuddle through\u201d and risk takers would be rewarded for their steely nerve. Our view now is the same, but there is less margin for error and a higher level of background political risk. In another sign that Britain remains open for business, US bank Wells Fargo is to buy an 11-storey office block development in the heart of the City in one of the largest real estate deals since the Brexit vote. It has bought the development - 33 Central at 33 King William Street - from property company HB Reavis. The deal will allow the US bank to consolidate its 850 London-based staff in a single location when construction is completed in the third quarter of 2017. Terms of the deal were not revealed but a source told Reuters it was likely to be worth around \u00a3300m. A quick recap. One of the Bank of England\u2019s top policymakers has dampened expectations that UK interest rates will be slashed to fresh record lows next month. Martin Weale argued that Britain may not need immediate reassurance from the BoE, and argued that central bankers shouldn\u2019t act as nursemaids to the markets\u2019 every whim. Weale also predicted that the Brexit vote will make the country poorer, as firms slash spending and hiring. The warning came after a flurry of data showing that the Brexit vote has hurt the economy. The EY Item Club predicted a recession next year. Deloitte reported that business confidence has suffered its worst knock in at least a decade. RightMove warned that asking price for home sales have dipped in the last month. Societe Generale predicted that house prices in some London areas could halve! Elsewhere... The UK government has thrown its backing behind Japanese corporation SoftBank\u2019s \u00a324bn takeover of the tech firm ARM Holdings. Downing Street says the deal is in the national interest, while SoftBank\u2019s CEO Masayoshi Son claims to have wowed Theresa May and Philip Hammond with his pledges to invest in the company and hire more staff. Cambridge\u2019s MP, though, is worried... Turkey\u2019s stock market has now slumped by over 5%, following last week\u2019s coup attempt. The Turkish lira has recovered some of Friday night\u2019s heavy losses, as the Erdogan government asserts control. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, predicts more lira losses: Over time, interest rates will need to be reduced significantly in order to stimulate demand in the economy. But at the same time, this will reduce the appeal of the lira as a higher yielding currency for foreign investors. So whichever way you look at it, the outlook for the Lira looks dire unfortunately. Unsurprisingly, the Adam Smith Institute thinks overseas firms shouldn\u2019t be blocked from buying UK ones. Their head of research, Ben Southwood, says it would be a blunder to consider blocking deals such as the SoftBank/ARM takeover. Here\u2019s his argument: \u201cVetting all foreign bids for British firms represents yet another step on the risky road to \u2018Italyification\u2019 of the UK economy, where inefficient national champions are propped up and those putting money into our growth are scrutinised based on their national origin. \u201cThe fact you can later sell your business to a wider pool of investors\u2014and attract capital from everywhere in the world\u2014is a major driver behind British investment. It is also the foundation of Britain\u2019s world-beating finance industry, which provides an outsized portion of UK output, and UK tax revenues. \u201cBritish economic success has been based on openness to trade and investment for hundreds of years. Theresa May must not put an end to that.\u201d Is he right? Well, ARM is hardly a failing company in need of some foreign expertise. It\u2019s already hugely successful, providing key chips for the iPhone (for example). SoftBank are paying 43% over last week\u2019s share price precisely because ARM is such a good company. Also, SoftBank\u2019s insistence that really wants ARM\u2019s technology, and will help the company grow, should allay fears in Westminster. The Labour MP for Cambridge doesn\u2019t share the Conservative government\u2019s enthusiasm for the \u00a324bn takeover of ARM \u2013 Britain\u2019s preeminent tech company. Daniel Zeichner is concerned about ARM\u2019s long-term future under Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, and isn\u2019t totally convinced by its pledge to double the UK workforce. He told ITV News that: \u201cWell of course the promises are great, but how are those promises going to be guaranteed? Do we know what will happen in 6 months or a year? Do we know much about SoftBank? And they seem to be making some pretty big deals across the world. This is a Cambridge success story upon which the future of the United Kingdom is probably depends because this is what we\u2019re good at.\u201d Holiday firm TUI is the worst-performing stock on the FSTE 100 so far today, shedding over 2%. Traders are calculating that the turmoil in Turkey is going to deter holidaymakers from jetting to its resorts; although recent terrorist attacks had already had an impact. Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct explains: TUI is also struggling with that news from Turkey likely to further disrupt travel to the country this summer, although there has been a shift in bookings by holidaymakers for some months now to resorts in the Western Mediterranean. The shock Brexit vote has taken the world\u2019s attention off other issues, such as the ongoing economic crisis in Greece. But the eurozone\u2019s most troubled member hasn\u2019t gone away. And European Comissioner Pierre Moscovici has popped to Athens today, for high-level talks about its current bailout programme. He\u2019s met with prime minister Alexis Tsipras, and discussed the labour reforms and spending cuts that Greece needs to enforce, to get its next tranche of bailout funds (worth around \u20ac2.8bn). Over in Downing Street, Theresa May\u2019s spokeswoman has told lobby reporters that SoftBank\u2019s takeover of ARM is in the national interest (that\u2019s via Reuters) SoftBank\u2019s CEO, Masayoshi Son, has denied that the Brexit vote prompted him to launch today\u2019s massive \u00a324bn takeover of UK chipmaker ARM. Speaking to reporters in London, Son says the EU referendum did not affect his decision. He says SoftBank is determined to have a big role in the development of the Internet of Things -- the next major area of technology. The FT\u2019s Arash Massoudi is tweeting the key points: Son also declared that Britain\u2019s new political masters are impressed by the deal - and his pledge to double ARM\u2019s UK workforce. Readers with expensive houses in the heart of London should take a deep breath, and stay sitting down. French bank Societe Generale has predicted that house prices in the capital could plunge by over 30%, due to the vote to leave the European Union. That\u2019s based on the idea that highly paid City workers will be forced out of London, if Britain loses access to the single market. That would end the \u2018passporting\u2019 which lets banks in the UK sell services across the EU, and mean banks have to shift overseas. SocGen analyst Marc Mozzi explains the gloomy prognosis: \u201cWhile in recent stress tests, the major U.K. banks were assessed with declines of around 30 percent in commercial real estate prices, we fear that London residential could experience an even more severe downturn. \u201cBrexit will damage the U.K. economy, and some companies will almost certainly have to relocate parts of their business to retain access to the EU single market.\u201d Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, reckons Martin Weale may decline to support an interest rate cut in August: Sky\u2019s Ed Conway isn\u2019t too surprised; Weale is one of the more hawkish MPC members. Buzzfeed\u2019s Simon Neville flags up that the rapid appointment of Theresa May as prime minister may calm the situation: Martin Weale has also warned that the Brexit vote will make the UK population poorer. The Bank of England rate-setter tells his audience in London that: My own view is that, despite any savings resulting from a lower contribution to the EU budget, the nation\u2019s income, and thus people\u2019s incomes, are likely to be reduced as a result of the choice made on 23rd June. Weale is concerned that Britain may not retain full access to the single market, which has delivered useful economies of scale. A failure to retain them would amount to a worsening of Britain\u2019s supply conditions reducing both productivity and household incomes. International competition may also have had the effect of stimulating productivity improvements in domestic firms. He also warns that everyone could suffer, if London\u2019s financial sector takes a hit (perhaps because banks are forced to move operations into the EU): Should life become harder for the financial sector then....that may fall disproportionately on London and the South-East. But, if taxable capacity declines disproportionately as a result, the effects of this on people\u2019s incomes will be spread across the country more evenly than the effects on output. He also produces these two charts, showing how UK business confidence has declined in the last few weeks. Bank of England policymaker Martin Weale has just fired a warning shot at the City, saying interest rates might not be cut in August. Speaking in London, Weale revealed that he is not convinced - yet anyway - that rates need to be slashed from 0.5% to fresh record lows to calm Brexit fears. Weale (who has previously voted to raise interest rates), says: the Bank shouldn\u2019t be worried about disappointing the markets. The Old Lady of Threadneedle Street is not a nurse to markets. People who trade in markets know that the Monetary Policy Committee sets policy month by month in the way that its members think appropriate. It does sometimes, as we did in our July meeting, give an indication of where policy may go in the future. But that is no more than the best judgement at the time and not in any sense a commitment; the public understand that. Weale also argues that the Bank doesn\u2019t need to act early to reassure households and businesses. In contrast to the experience of 2008, I do not have any sense that either consumers or businesses are panic-struck and, as I observed, there have been no material signs of financial panic. Last week, the Bank of England surprised many economists by voting to leave interest rates on hold. The minutes of the meeting showed that many members of its monetary policy committee expect to agree on a new stimulus package in August. However, that might not necessarily include a rate cut. The MPC could vote to boost quantitative easing (buying bonds from banks with newly created money), or launch new measures to encourage banks to lend to businesses and consumers. The UK will fall into a \u201cshort, shallow recession\u201d around the turn of the year as Brexit hits house prices, jobs and spending, according to forecasters at the EY Item Club. In another dose of gloom, they have slashed their 2017 growth estimate to 0.4% from 2.6%, and warned that Britain\u2019s economy will suffer permanent harm from the decision to leave the EU. The group says: \u201cThere are likely to be severe confidence effects on spending, only partially cushioned by a fall in the pound. \u201cWe would expect a permanent reduction in the level of U.K. output and productivity.\u201d Britain\u2019s new digital minister is also backing the ARM takeover, underlying that SoftBank are not going to be blocked by Westminster. \u201cInvestment\u201d is a funny way of describing a takeover bid -- surely Hancock knows that the money goes to ARM\u2019s shareholders? The government\u2019s eagerness to support the deal is also ironic, as prime minister Theresa May has pledged to protect UK firms in \u2018strategic\u2019 industries from foreign takeovers. Proof that a week really is a long time in politics... Brexit fears have now hit Britain\u2019s housing market, according to the latest data from Rightmove. UK property asking prices have dropped 0.9% over the last month, suggesting that the EU referendum is hitting demand for property. Some sellers may also be trying to get a deal before Britain\u2019s economy has deteriorated. Jeremy Duncombe, director of the Legal &amp; General Mortgage Club, reckons its not a reason to panic: \u201cGiven the uncertainty that has followed the UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU, it\u2019s not surprising that house prices have decreased month-on-month for the first time in a while. We need however to look at the annual trend and not a month in isolation. House prices are still rising faster much than inflation over a 12 month period, and a slowing of this growth is not necessarily a bad thing. Turkey\u2019s stock market has slumped by 3% in early trading, failing to match the gains in other markets. Traders at the Istanbul Stock Exchange are understandably nervous following last weekend\u2019s failed coup, which is likely to deter businesses from investing in Turkey and holidaymakers from visiting the country. There\u2019s huge trading in the Turkish lira too. It tumbled on Friday night as military officers tried to overthrow president Erdo\u011fan, falling from 2.88 lira to the $1 to 3.04. The lira has now bounced back a bit, as Turkey\u2019s government rounds up thousands of suspected coup plotters. Wolfango Piccoli of Teneo Intelligence fears Turkey faces further instability: This highlights that Erdogan is eager to exploit the event to expand his power and continue the witch-hunt, further worsening the state of Turkey\u2019s crumbling democracy. Moreover, there is a growing risk of a snap election, as the AKP might seize the opportunity to enlarge its parliamentary majority with the aim of introducing an executive presidency via a constitutional revision. With two opposition parties (the MHP and the HDP) undergoing significant internal turmoil, an early election could deliver the necessary numbers for Erdogan\u2019s dream to be fulfilled. On the external front, the already strained relationship with the US could worsen as a result of Ankara\u2019s increased determination to request the extradition of Fethullah Gulen, who has been quickly accused by the Turkish government of being behind the failed putsch. ARM\u2019s soaring share price has helped to drive the FTSE 100 towards the 11-month intraday high hit last week. The Footsie is up 45 points in early trading to 6715, while the smaller FTSE 250 has gained 1%. Other European stock markets are also up in early trading, as traders remain sanguine despite Brexit concerns and the instability in Turkey. Overnight, a top City fund manager warned that Brexit will be \u201chorrible\u201d for the UK economy. Richard Buxton, the chief executive and head of UK equities at Old Mutual Global Investors (OMGI), says the referendum vote is \u201cstupendously final.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t always agree with Martin Wolf [the Financial Times columnist], but when he wrote the day after that this is probably the single worst event in British postwar history, yeah, I don\u2019t disagree Buxton also laid into the Leave campaign for failing to have a strategy for actually leaving the EU: \u201cYou can criticise the Brexit team for a) an utterly mendacious campaign and b) not expecting that they would really win, so never having a plan. I mean the whole thing is literally unbelievable. It is extraordinary how we have ended up where we are.\u201d Shares in chipmaker ARM Holdings have surged by 45% at the start of trading, as the City reacts to SoftBank\u2019s takeover offer. They\u2019re changing hands for \u00a317.32 each, slightly over the Softbank offer of \u00a317. That suggests investors expect the deal to go through, and there may be some speculation of a rival offer (even though Softbank are paying a 43% premium). Britain\u2019s new finance minister has decided that the takeover of ARM Holdings by SoftBank is a jolly good thing. Philip Hammond argues that the deal shows that the Brexit vote hasn\u2019t hurt Britain\u2019s place in the world, saying: \u201cBritain has lost none of its allure to international investors. Britain is open for business - and open to foreign investment.\u201d He\u2019s tweeting the same message: The deal is also a reminder that the slump in the pound makes UK assets more affordable to overseas investors. The yen has surged by almost a third against the pound over the last year, including a 12% spike since the referendum. However... ARM\u2019s share price has also been boosted by the weak pound (as it earns most of its revenues in foreign currencies). British firms are slashing their spending plans in the face of uncertainty following last month\u2019s EU referendum vote. In a worrying signal, anxiety among UK bosses has hit a five year high, according to accountancy firm Deloitte. Its survey found that 82% of chief financial officers from FTSE 350 and large private companies are planning to cut capital spending in the next year. That\u2019s the biggest amount since the survey began a decade ago, up from 34 percent in the first quarter. And 83% are planning to rein in their hiring plans, in a blow to workers seeking new jobs. Alarmingly, businesses are more pessimistic than after the financial crisis in 2008. Ian Stewart, Deloitte\u2019s chief economist, sums up the situation: \u201cPerceptions of uncertainty have soared to levels last associated with the euro crisis five years ago. \u201cThe spike in uncertainty has had a toxic effect on business sentiment, with optimism dropping to the lowest level since our survey started in 2007 -- lower, even, than in the wake of the failure of Lehman in late 2008.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There are three things on the agenda in the City today. Firstly, the Brexit vote, as companies continue to chew through the implications of last month\u2019s EU referendum. Second, investors are watching the situation in Turkey closely after last weekend\u2019s failed coup attempt. President Erdo\u011fan remains in power, and is now pledging to purge the Turkish state of dissidents. But the sight of tanks on the streets may shake confidence in the country, which is already facing high inflation and a troubled tourism industry. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets explain: Following a turbulent weekend, markets are actually quite calm. The weekend\u2019s main highlight was the failed attempt to overthrow the Turkish government in a military coup d\u2019etat and the subsequent mass detentions of military and judiciary personal. And thirdly, we have some early morning takeover action. ARM Holdings, Britain\u2019s biggest technology company, is being taken over by Japan\u2019s SoftBank in a \u00a324bn deal. Encouragingly, SoftBank are promising to at least double the number of UK employees at ARM, in what looks a massive bet on the Internet of Things [the idea that every object will be linked to the web] We\u2019ll be tracking all the main developments through the day.",

                "bodyText":"With Wall Street hitting new record highs, global markets were in relatively buoyant mood, as global jitters faded for the moment. Rising oil prices helped, following a reduction in US crude stocks last week, as did the continuing trend of better than expected US company results, with Microsoft and Morgan Stanley both pleasing investors. In the UK the FTSE 100 finished above 6700 for the first time since last August. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct said: Having come close for the last two days, London\u2019s FTSE-100 is finally finishing above the 6,700 level, with fresh record highs on Wall Street helping shape sentiment in the latter part of the session. Financial stocks are leading the charge with better than expected unemployment readings adding further weight to the idea that a rate cut may not be all that imminent, whilst it\u2019s the miners that are the day\u2019s laggards. Anglo American has followed Rio Tinto in posting some lacklustre numbers and this is casting a shadow over the sector as a whole. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 31.62 points or 0.47% at 6728.99 Germany\u2019s Dax added 1.61% to 10,142.01 France\u2019s Cac climbed 1.15% higher to 4379.76 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.54% to 16,763.82 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.06% better at 8575.5 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.06% to 569.74 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 38 points or 0.21% higher. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow for, among other things, the latest meeting of the European Central Bank. Meanwhile UK prime minister Theresa May has flown to Berlin to meet German chancellor Angela Merkel, with Brexit very much on everyone\u2019s mind. For the latest developments, see our political live blog: No surprise really, but S&amp;P has cut Turkey\u2019s credit rating from BB+ to BB and its outlook from stable to negative following the recent coup attempt. The agency said it expected a period of heightened unpredictability which could constrain capital flowing into Turkey\u2019s economy. Oil prices continue to recover after the US Energy Information Administration reported a 2.3m barrel fall in crude inventories, and have moved back into positive territory for the day. West Texas Intermediate is now up 0.67% at $44.95 a barrel having fallen as low as $43.69. While the FTSE 100 has been regaining ground since the shock Brexit vote and is now sitting at an 11 month high, the more UK focused FTSE 250 has yet to recover the level it reached ahead of the June 23 vote. But the mid-cap index is getting there, and a rise of 1% to its current 17,080 leaves it only 250 points shy of its pre-referendum level. Investors appear to have been comforted by the fact that the worst predictions of disaster following a leave vote have yet to be realised, with even the IMF this week rowing back from its talk of a UK recession in the wake of Brexit. US crude stocks fell last week much in line with expectations, with a draw of 2.34m barrels compared to a forecast 2.1m. But gasoline stocks rose unexpectedly, compared to expectations of no change: So crude prices remain lower but recovering from their worst levels, with West Texas Intermediate now down 0.9%, while gasoline future have hit their lowest since early March. The consumer confidence figures, while not as bad as they could be, still show that Brexit could have an effect on EU economic activity, says economist Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight: While there are no details available, there can be little doubt that a second successive drop in Eurozone consumer confidence to a three-month low in July is largely the consequence of heightened concerns over the economic and political outlook following the UK\u2019s vote to leave the European Union. The June consumer confidence survey - which showed modest slippage - had been completed before the UK vote on 23 June. There may be an element of relief that July\u2019s drop in Eurozone consumer confidence was not greater and it may alleviate some of the deepest concerns about how much Eurozone growth will be negatively impacted by the Brexit vote. Nevertheless the clear dip in Eurozone consumer confidence in July reinforces belief that the Brexit vote will have some dampening impact on Eurozone economic activity - particularly as the consumer has been a key growth driver for the Eurozone, notably in the first quarter of this year. On the positive side, for now at least, the fundamentals still look pretty solid for consumers in the Eurozone with negligible inflation supporting purchasing power and labour markets significantly improved overall. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said these figures could mark the low point: Consumer confidence in the EU had already dropped in the lead up to the Brexit vote and, in the uncertain aftermath, it\u2019s no real surprise that the mood has worsened. In the UK, consumer confidence has actually come through robustly, which may be an indicator as to how the rest of EU consumers will respond. Suddenly the euro doesn\u2019t look so shaky next to the falling pound, so there\u2019s every chance we could be looking at a consumer confidence nadir in today\u2019s numbers.\u201d In the wake of the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU, consumer confidence in the area fell sharply, new data shows. According to a flash estimate by the European Commission, consumer confidence in the EU as a whole dropped by \u201ca marked\u201d 1.8 points to -7.6 in July. This is the worst level for two years. In the eurozone, confidence fell by 0.7 points to -7.9, slightly better than the -8 figure expected by economists polled by Reuters. The June figure of -7.2 was revised up from the initial -7.3. Oil is on the slide again ahead of US inventory figures, with West Texas Intermediate down 1.8% at $43.84, a two month low. The fall reflects continuing strength in the US dollar as well as concerns about a supply glut. US markets continue to move ahead, as Microsoft and Morgan Stanley continue the trend of companies reporting better than expected results. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up around 13 points or 0.06% at 18572 having earlier hit a new peak of 18618. The S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.26% and Nasdaq 0.48%. The world\u2019s largest companies saw their revenues fall last year for the first time since 2010, according to the latest Fortune Global 500 list. Total revenues dropped 11.5% to $27.6trn from $31.2trn in 2014, with profits down 11.2% to $1.48trn. Fortune says: There are plenty of reasons for the reversal. A slowdown in China\u2019s once-booming economy has affected companies worldwide. Growth in the U.S. and Europe remains modest at best. And sustained low oil prices have erased billions in sales for giant petroleum producers like Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell, and Sinopec. But one macroeconomic trend looms largest of all: the explosive comeback of the U.S. dollar and the wide-ranging impact of its renewed strength on global trade. The US had 134 companies on this year\u2019s list, the highest number of any country, followed by China with 103 and 52 from Japan. The US added 6 new companies from the previous year, China added 5, and Japan lost 2, says Fortune. Chinese, Japanese and the US companies together accounted for 58% of the list. China only had 19 companies a decade ago. Britain currently has 26 Fortune Global 500 companies with 17 of them based in London (before any impact from Brexit of course.) Walmart is top of the list, as it has been eleven times since 1995. Apple appears in the top ten for the first time: 1. Walmart Stores (U.S.) 2. State Grid (China) 3. China National Petroleum (China) 4. Sinopec Group (China) 5. Royal Dutch Shell (Netherlands) 6. Exxon Mobil (U.S.) 7. Volkswagen (Germany) 8. Toyota Motor (Japan) 9. Apple (U.S.) 10. BP (Britain) The full list and more details are here. Here\u2019s link to the Moody\u2019s report on UK banks (see 13.49): US markets are expected to open higher following better-than-expected results from Microsoft and Morgan Stanley: Moody\u2019s has downgraded its outlook for the UK banking system to negative from stable because of the Brexit vote. Carlos Suarez Duarte, senior vice president at Moody\u2019s: Increased uncertainty about the UK\u2019s future trade relationship with the EU will likely lead to reduced confidence and lower investment and consumer spending in the UK. This will, in turn, pressure revenues, asset quality and profitability metrics for all banks in the UK, though some are more resilient to these pressures than others. Philip Hammond has had a dream start as chancellor according to Larry Elliott, the Guardian\u2019s economics editor: The Bank of England says there are no signs of a general slowing in activity. Consumers are still spending in the shops. The International Monetary Fund says the economy will slow sharply but will avoid a recession. It is still early days, of course. The full effects of the Brexit vote on the economy will only become apparent over months and years rather than in the four weeks that have so far passed since 23 June. As the Bank\u2019s agents made clear in their monthly report, many companies were so stunned by the result they have yet to work out what to do next. The IMF made a similar point in its updated World Economic Outlook. It noted that Brexit was still unfolding, which is obviously true. That said, Hammond has not had the baptism of fire that many predicted. Forecasts from the remain camp \u2013 of which the new chancellor was a member \u2013 came thick and fast in the run-up to the referendum. All of them warned of severe and immediate consequences if the leave side won. Read the full article here: Debbie Abrahams, Labour\u2019s shadow work and pensions secretary, has commented on the earlier labour market figures. She says wage growth remains too weak. (It was 2.3% in the three months to May, or 2.2% excluding bonuses.) It is welcome that there has been a fall in unemployment. However, under the Tories long term pay growth continues to be sluggish and our economy is over-reliant on low paid insecure work. If Theresa May is serious about supporting working people we need to see serious action on tackling low pay and investing in the high-skilled high-wage jobs our economy needs. MPs on the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee will publish their report on employment practices at Sports Direct on Friday... The Guardian understands the official investigation into Sports Direct\u2019s failure to pay its warehouse workers the national minimum wage has been widened to include the sportswear chain\u2019s 13,000 retail workers. Here is the full update from Simon Goodley: Returning to the labour market data, the number of people claiming jobless benefits rose by 400 in June to almost 760,000. It was far smaller than the 3,500 increase predicted by economists but the figure for May was heavily revised to show a 12,200 jump over the month, compared with the 400 fall the ONS previously estimated. As we move into afternoon trading European markets are up. Investors are cheered by evidence from the Bank of England that so far, the Brexit vote does not appear to have triggered a slowdown. Wolfgang Schaeuble, Germany\u2019s no nonsense finance minister, will meet the new UK chancellor Philip Hammond on Saturday on the sidelines of the G20 meeting in China. As well as bilateral talks between the two men, G20 finance ministers will discuss the aftermath of Brexit and how policymakers can ease concerns. The TUC has a different take on the unemployment report, arguing that it\u2019s not all good news. Specifically it points to the sharp rise in self-employment, which has increased by 300,000 people over the past year and now represents 15.1% of the workforce (4.8 million). TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says: While it\u2019s good to see more people in work, the huge increase in self-employment raises questions about the nature of these jobs. These newly self-employed workers are not all budding entrepreneurs. Many don\u2019t choose self-employment, being forced onto contracts with fewer rights, less pay and no job security. We need more decent jobs. Not working conditions like those exposed at the courier firm Hermes these week, where workers were pushed on to self-employed contracts with fewer rights. Economists at Capital Economics still expect the Bank of England to inject fresh stimulus into the economy in August, despite the better-than-expected UK jobs figures. Paul Hollingsworth at Capital Economics: Despite the relatively upbeat assessment of the labour market overall, we still expect the Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee to follow through with its (loose) commitment to ease policy at its next meeting on 4th August. After all, the vote to leave the EU will almost certainly now cause some firms to put hiring decisions on hold or cut back headcounts altogether. Indeed, we expect the unemployment rate to drift up over the coming quarters. He adds however that comments from the Bank\u2019s regional agents support his view that the short-term impact of the Brexit vote will be less severe than many think. Today\u2019s Bank of England agents\u2019 report showed that a majority of firms did not expect a near-term impact from the referendum outcome on their investment or hiring plans. Accordingly, for now we remain content with our view that the damage to the economy in the short term will be rather less severe than many others are anticipating. Not everyone agrees that the fallout from Brexit is limited so far. UK households think the outlook for their finances is the worst in two-and-a-half years following the decision to leave the UK. The indicator dropped to 47 in July from 49.3 in June according to Markit\u2019s latest survey. Anything below 50 signals a deterioration. People are also becoming more concerned about their jobs, Markit said. Philip Leake, economist at Markit: The survey suggests that the Brexit vote has badly affected households\u2019 views on their finances. With future prospects clouded by uncertainty, July data pointed to the worst financial outlook in two-and-a-half years. Household concerns also intensified as workplace activity fell for the first time since May 2012, with employers awaiting a clearer picture following the Brexit vote. The comments from the Bank of England agents - as well as the better-than expected employment data - are supporting the pound. It was down against the dollar before the two reports were published but is now up 0.6% at $1.3193. James Smith, economist at ING, says there may be trouble ahead, despite the upbeat tone struck by the Bank\u2019s agents: The latest update from the Bank of England\u2019s Agents suggests that there is little evidence of a knee-jerk reaction from businesses post-Brexit, but the medium/long-term outlook is more uncertain. The main message was that firms, for the time being, were seeking to maintain \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d and this suggests that it may be a while before we see any material Brexit impact show up in UK data. Further down the road, the outlook appears to be less certain. On investment, approximately a third expected some negative impact over the next 12 months, echoing the sentiment of recent surveys. There is \u201cno clear evidence\u201d that a UK slowdown is underway since the Brexit vote, according to the Bank of England\u2019s network of regional agents. Bank agents talk to businesses around the country to gain clues about how the economy is really doing, and the July report is the first since the 23 June referendum. The agents reported that while business uncertainty had \u201crisen markedly\u201d, there was little evidence that consumers were spending less. A majority of firms spoken with did not expect a near-term impact from the result on their investment or staff hiring plans. But around a third of contacts thought there would be some negative impact on those plans over the net 12 months. As yet there was no clear evidence of a sharp general slowing in activity. The jobs figures suggest employers were not rattled enough in the run-up to the EU referendum to freeze hiring or cut jobs on a major scale. The big question is whether that will change following the Brexit vote. The UK unemployment rate has fallen to 4.9% in the three months ending May, from 5%. The last time it was as low as that was 2005. These better-than-expected jobs figures are a gift to the new chancellor, Philip Hammond, who wasted no time commenting on them: Today\u2019s employment and wage figures are proof that the fundamentals of the British economy are strong. In the months before the referendum, employment in the UK reached a new record high, unemployment fell to its lowest in a decade and wages continued to rise. As the economy adjusts to the effect of the referendum decision, it is doing so from a position of economic strength. While the decision to leave the European Union marks the beginning of a new phase for our economy, the message we take to the world is this: our country remains open for business and we are the same outward-looking, globally-minded, big-thinking country we have always been. The pound rose back above $1.31 after better-than-expected figures from the UK jobs market. The headline figures: Unemployment rate falls unexpectedly to 4.9% in the three months ending May from 5%. It was the lowest since 2005. The number of people out of work falls by 54,000 to 1.65m. People claiming jobless benefits rises by a much smaller than expected 400 to 759,100 Employment rises by 176,000 to 31.7m Record employment rate of 74.4% Earnings increase by 2.3%, as expected The Bank of England will shortly publish its agents\u2019 summary of business conditions for July. It will provide the first snapshot of how businesses around the UK have responded to Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU following the 23 June referendum. Figures published later today are expected to show consumer confidence weakened in the eurozone in July, following the Brexit vote. The \u2018flash\u2019 indicator from the European Commission is expected to fall to -8 from -7.3 in June. Nintendo has lost some of the gains made since the release of its hugely successful Pokemon Go game. Shares were down almost 15% at one point on Wednesday following reports the release of the game might be delayed in Japan. Nintendo\u2019s market value had doubled since the launch of the game - which combines the virtual world with the real one - earlier this month. Asian markets were mixed on Wednesday. Nikkei: -0.3% at 16,682 Hang Seng: +0.9% at 21,857 The FTSE 100 is up 19 points or 0.3% at 6,716 in early trading. The FTSE 250 is roughly flat at 16,902. Most other major European markets are up. Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.5% at 10,027 France\u2019s CAC: +0.4% at 4,348 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.1% at 16,660 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.4% at 8,515 The pound has dipped below $1.31. It is currently down 0.2% at $1.3085. The euro is down against both the pound and the dollar. It is down 0.3% against the pound at 83.93p, and hit a two-and-a-half-week low against the dollar of $1.0985. The dollar is rising partly on the back of expectations that the Fed will raise interest rates before the end of 2016 following positive data from the US economy (including jobs and the housing market). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. At 9.30 the Office for National Statistics will publish latest figures from the UK jobs market. The figures are expected to show the number of people claiming unemployment benefit rose by 3,500 in June, following a drop of 400 in May. The headline unemployment rate will cover the three months to the end of May and is expected to be unchanged at 5%. Wage growth including bonuses is expected to pick up to 2.3% from 2%. Excluding bonuses growth is expected to be unchanged at 2.3%. The figures should provide some clues about how confident employers were feeling in the run-up to the 23 June referendum. Any shock to the downside would undoubtedly trigger a few alarm bells about the outlook for UK jobs in the aftermath of the Brexit vote.",

                "bodyText":"That\u2019s a good moment to wrap up for the day, and indeed the week. Here\u2019s our full news story about the worrying slide in UK business confidence, activity and new orders this month: We\u2019ll be back next week with more rolling coverage of the twists and turns in the economy, the financial markets and more. Thanks, and have a good weekend. GW Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, fears that the UK economy might be in even worse shape than the PMI show. That\u2019s because today\u2019s \u2018flash\u2019 survey doesn\u2019t include the construction industry, which has probably also taken a Brexit hit. The full PMIs, released in a couple of weeks, will give a fuller picture. Larry adds: The abrupt and large fall in both orders and output reported by IHS Markit and the CIPS clearly makes a recession in the second half of 2016 a real risk. Similar results for August and September would suggest a 0.4% contraction in the economy in the third quarter. It only takes two successive quarters of contraction to constitute a technical recession. More here: Newsflash from America: The US manufacturing sector has grown at its fastest pace in a year, suggesting the Brexit vote has not caused any problems. The US manufacturing PMI has jumped to 52.9, from 51.3 in June, the highest figure since last October (any figure over 5o shows growth). Quite a contrast with the UK\u2019s manufacturing PMI, which dived from 52.1 in June to just 49.1 this month. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll all score full marks on our new Brexit quiz..... It\u2019s now a month since the UK\u2019s EU referendum, so my colleague Martin Belam has taken a look at the economic, financial and social impact of that historic vote: And Ben Chu of the Independent has calculated that the taxpayer\u2019s stake in two British banks has shrunk by \u00a36bn: Shadow chancellor John McDonnell says the government needs to take action now to combat the slowdown gripping the UK economy. Speaking on Sky News, McDonnell says Philip Hammond shouldn\u2019t wait until the autumn statement to scrap the government\u2019s fiscal plans. I think he needs to get back here now, scrap the fiscal framework that is failing at the moment, and start the investment that is needed. Right now, government departments are pausing investment decisions and implementing austerity measures, at a time when the economy needs more help, McDonnell adds. And finally... Oops, Faisal hadn\u2019t finished explaining the wonders of the PMI report.... Back to the grim UK PMI report... and Faisal Islam of Sky News has tweeted why this survey is worth taking seriously: It\u2019s also worth noting that Markit survey purchasing managers at over 1,200 UK firms each month; this is a serious report. Christine Lagarde\u2019s lawyer says she is confident of proving her innocence over the Tapie case. Breaking news from France: The head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, has lost her final attempt to avoid appearing in court over a long-running financial scandal. Reuters has the details: France\u2019s highest appeals court ruled on Friday that IMF chief Christine Lagarde must stand trial for her role in a \u20ac400m payout as French finance minister in 2008 to businessman Bernard Tapie. The court rejected her appeal against a judge\u2019s order in December for her to stand trial at the Cour de Justice de la Repulique, a special court that tries ministers for crimes in office. Here\u2019s some background on the Tapie affair: Some mild optimism from the Resolution Group\u2019s Duncan Weldon: Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at City firm Monex Europe, also fears that Britain is heading into recession. Here\u2019s his take on this morning\u2019s PMI survey: \u201cThe report makes for grim reading and suggests that the shock to the economy will be severe compared to others on record. Composite Output and New Orders, which include data for other sectors of the economy, registered their steepest ever recorded falls. Although an increase in manufacturing export business offers a ray of hope, it\u2019s difficult to see how this report points to anything other than a recession in the immediate future. \u201cThe question now is just how deep and sustained this slump in output will prove. With services activity and new orders falling at their quickest rate in seven years the risk of businesses delaying investment and hiring is very significant. If the slump is extended or worsens into August and July, even the reduced forecasts we\u2019ve recently seen for growth in 2016 will start to look optimistic. Sky News\u2019s economics editor Ed Conway has collared chancellor Philip Hammond in China, and got him to comment on today\u2019s PMI survey. Hammond says the PMI shows that business sentiment has suffered from the Brexit vote. It tells us that people\u2019s confidence, businesses\u2019 confidence has been dented. They\u2019re not sure, there\u2019re in a position of uncertainty now. Our job is to restore as much certainty as we can, as quickly as we can. That means reaching agreements with European partners, and also striking deals with other countries such as China, the chancellor says. [reminder: He\u2019s hoping to drum up some investment opportunities during his trip to Beijing, before arriving at the G20 meeting of finance ministers and central bankers this weekend]. Philip Hammond also repeated that he could \u201creset fiscal policy\u201d in the autumn statement later this year, once the government has a clearer picture of the UK economy after the Brexit vote. We are clear that we are going to support the economy over this period, so we can take advantage of the opportunities that the referendum gives us in the medium and long term. The pound is sliding deeper into the red, as investors digest the news that Britain\u2019s companies have suffered their worst month since the financial crisis. Sterling is now down 1% against the US dollar at $1.31, down from $1.323 overnight. Some traders are pricing in a cut in UK interest rates in August, and perhaps a wide-ranging stimulus package to help the economy. Encouragingly, Markit also found that companies become less gloomy as July unfolded. The rapid political changes that saw Theresa May installed as prime minister last week may have reassure business leaders, according to Markit\u2019s Chris Williamson. The slump in the UK PMI, from 52.4 to just 47.7, shows that UK businesses are gripped by Brexit uncertainty. Zach Witton, deputy chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, says Westminster needs to take action, fast. \u201cThe very sharp pause in activity indicates that manufacturers have reacted to the shock of the referendum result by adopting a wait-and-see approach. A key question is how long this will be sustained, as a failure to restart activity will have implications for their appetite for investment and recruitment, and thus have an implication for the real economy. The uncertainty surrounding the outlook for manufacturing highlights that there is potential for the Government to shore up confidence in the coming months.\u201d It\u2019s not ALL bad news, though. UK manufacturers have reported the biggest jump in new exports in two years, Markit says. That suggests the slump in the pound since the referendum is providing a boost, making exports more competitive: Perhaps the most alarming part of today\u2019s survey is that service sector companies are extremely downbeat about economic prospects. Markit\u2019s business expectations index has slumped by its largest amount on record, back to levels last seen during the financial crisis: This implies service sector firms will be cautious about taking on new staff or launching new projects in the coming months. Today\u2019s report is vindication for those Remain campaigners who warned against Brexit, argues journalist Sunny Hundal: Markit\u2019s PMI surveys have undermined the notion that the rest of Europe would suffer as badly as the UK from the Brexit vote. While Britain appears to be shrinking, France\u2019s economy was quite resilient and German private sector growth hit its highest level of the year (see earlier post). Ferdinando Giugliano of the La Republica newspaper tweets the key numbers: Joshua Mahony, Market Analyst at IG, reckons Europe is actually benefitting from the uncertainty: Today has shown a stark contrast between Eurozone and UK economic fortunes in the wake of the EU referendum, with the negative impact felt after the vote largely isolated to the UK. There is perhaps a feeling amongst the likes of France and German that the vote is a case of the UK shooting itself in the foot, with a significant amount of business expected to leave the UK in favour of Frankfurt, Paris and Dublin. There is no surprise that the eurozone services PMI readings have shown particular strength, with the French services sector taking on extra staff to the greatest extent since 2008 as UK based firms look to become less London centric. Jake Trask, currency analyst at UKForex, also fears that Britain is heading into recession. \u201cThe first clear evidence of the economic damage done by the UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU was shown today. The Flash UK Services PMI missed the target by some distance, posting a worrying 47.4 \u2013 far lower than the 49 expected by economists. \u201cThe figure was the worst since April 2009, when the country was still shaken by the fallout from the global financial crisis. Chris Leslie MP, a former shadow chancellor, has called for MPs on both sides of the House of Commons to pay attention to the PMI survey: This chart shows just how quickly the UK economy has gone into reverse this month; in the biggest one-month fall ever: (50 is the cut-off point between growth and contraction) Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says the UK PMI survey is \u201ctruly abysmal\u201d, and suggests that the EU referendum vote has - as feared - hit the economy. \u201cToday\u2019s super-weak PMI is the first hard evidence that Brexit has already had an impact on the UK economy. There was a sharp fall in activity in July and it now looks like the Bank of England has the data it needs to launch fresh easing at its next meeting at the start of August. Quite simply, the UK economy contracted at the fastest pace since the start of 2009, when the global financial crisis plunged us into recession. The readings suggest we are heading for a recession again and it is almost certain the BoE will pull the trigger on aggressive stimulus to boost aggregate demand. Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics says today\u2019s PMI report is \u2018woeful\u2019, and should prompt the Bank of England to cut interest rates. Rupert Harrison of investment management group Blackrock is also concerned (Harrison is a former advisor to chancellor George Osborne) Reuters\u2019 Jamie McGeever says Britain appears to be heading into recession: The pound has fallen by over half a cent against the US dollar, as traders react to the news that Britain\u2019s economy appears to be shrinking. It\u2019s dropped from $1.323 to $1.317. David Noble, CEO at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, says Markit\u2019s report paints a pretty worrying picture. He also warns that the weak pound has driven up the cost of imported materials: \u201cThe UK economy has suffered sharp falls in output and new orders following the EU referendum as uncertainty has taken hold. The overall pace of decline was the strongest since early-2009. \u201cWeaker sterling has driven a steep rise in input prices for manufacturers but there is a glimmer of positivity with the new exchange rate encouraging a rise in export orders. However, with a subdued global economy, it is not yet clear whether these opportunities will materialise in the long term. This chart shows how British services and manufacturing have both suffered a plunge in output this month: Breaking: Britain\u2019s economy is shrinking at the fastest pace since the financial crisis, as the Brexit vote hits confidence and spending. Data firm Markit reports that services and manufacturing sectors have both suffered a big hit this month. They are contracting at the fastest pace since 2009, as output and new orders fall across the sector. Many firms blamed uncertainty caused by June\u2019s EU referendum. It suggests that the UK economy is shrinking, at a quarterly rate of 0.4%. Markit economist Chris Williamson says: \u201cJuly saw a dramatic deterioration in the economy, with business activity slumping at the fastest rate since the height of the global financial crisis in early-2009. \u201cThe downturn, whether manifesting itself in order book cancellations, a lack of new orders or the postponement or halting of projects, was most commonly attributed in one way or another to \u2018Brexit\u2019. Here\u2019s the details (any reading below 50 shows a contraction): Flash UK PMI Composite Output Index at 47.7 (52.4 in June). 87-month low. Flash UK Services PMI Activity Index at 47.4 (52.3 in June). 88-month low. Flash UK Manufacturing PMI at 49.1 (52.1 in June). 41-month low. Flash UK Manufacturing PMI Output Index at 49.1 (52.9 in June). 40-month low. Reaction to follow.... The City is on tenterhooks, as we await Markit\u2019s first healthcheck on the UK economy since the Brexit vote.... Despite Germany\u2019s robust performance, eurozone growth has edged down to its lowest in one-and-a-half year low in July. That\u2019s the verdict from Markit\u2019s \u2018flash\u2019 assessment of the euro economy, which has dropped to 52.9 this month from 53.1 in June. That still shows growth, but at the slowest rate since January 2015. Markit\u2019s Chris Williamson says the eurozone was \u201csurprisingly resilient\u201d, but is concerned that the Brexit vote has caused some damage: Business confidence about the outlook in the service sector has deteriorated to the worst for just over one-and-a-half years, linked primarily to the political and economic instability induced by the UK referendum, pointing to near-term downside risks for an already-lacklustre eurozone economy. \u201cPolicymakers will be reassured by the resilience of the PMI in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote, but the fragility of the recovery leaves plenty of room for speculation about further stimulus later in the year.\u201d Economist Rupert Seggins shows the key points: UK property company shares are sliding this morning. Upmarket London estate agent Foxtons have shed almost 5%, and rival real estate firm Countrywide have tumbled almost 8%. That\u2019s partly due to LSL Property\u2019s Brexit-induced profit warning this morning. But it\u2019s also triggered by a survey from Hometrack, showing that London will bear the brunt of the property slowdown. Back in the UK.... supermarket chain Sainsbury has been given the green light to take control of the Argos chain. Here\u2019s an audio clip of chancellor Philip Hammond revealing that he might \u2018reset\u2019 UK fiscal policy this autumn. Thanks to my colleague Matthew Weaver, who is running our Politics Live blog today: This morning\u2019s economic data is a case of \u2018so far, so good\u2019, with Germany\u2019s private sector growing at its fastest pace this year. Germany\u2019s private sector has shrugged off the Brexit shock. Market\u2019s German PMI reports, just released, show that manufacturers and service companies kept growing this month - faster than expected. Ouch! Shares in UK property firm LSL have slumped by a fifth after it warned that the Brexit vote will hit its profits this year. LSL, which owns the Your Move chain, has told the City that trading slowed in the run-up to the referendum, and has worsened since as consumer uncertainty has increased. It no longer expects to hit its targets this year, and warns that full year group operating profit will be \u201csignificantly lower\u201d than previously expected. Shares have tumbled by 21% in early trading. The first of today\u2019s PMI surveys are out...and they show that France\u2019s private sector was flat this month, after shrinking a little in June. The French composite PMI rose to 50.0in July - the point separating expansion and contraction - up from 49.6 in June. Markit chief economist Chris Williamson says it\u2019s a decent figure, given everything France has been through recently: \u201cIn the face of the terrorist attack [in Nice] and the Brexit vote, to have the index coming up to 50.0 in a stable economy is perhaps a good result.\u201d Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics fears that today\u2019s UK PMIs will show Britain\u2019s economy is contracting this month. IMF chief Christine Lagarde has called for the uncertainty surrounding Britain\u2019s Brexit vote to be removed as soon as possible. Speaking to reporters after meeting China\u2019s Premier Li Keqiang, Lagarde also blamed the EU referendum for making the IMF downgrade its global growth forecasts this week. Chancellor Philip Hammond has dropped a clear hint that he\u2019ll tear up his predecessor\u2019s tax and spending plans. During his first overseas visit since becoming Britain\u2019s finance minister, Hammond said that he might have to \u201creset\u201d fiscal policy when he delivers the autumn statement later this year. The scale of such a \u2018reset\u2019 will depend on how Britain\u2019s economy responds to the Brexit vote. George Osborne\u2019s goal of a budget surplus by the end of the parliament already appears doomed. Hammond is planning to use his China trip to promote British business opportunities, especially the City. He\u2019ll be telling his hosts that Britain is still open for business. We\u2019ll get the first clear glimpse of how Britain\u2019s economy has fared since the EU referendum this morning. Markit\u2019s Purchasing Managers Index survey, due at 9.30am, will show if UK manufacturers, construction firms and services companies expanded or contracted in the last few weeks. The PMI measures activity, output and employment levels, and economists fear they will show the UK economy took a hit after the surprise win for the Leave campaign. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets explains: Markit is releasing a special one-off \u2018flash\u2019 version of the July UK PMIs today based on ~70% of the normal responses. The UK PMIs were already drifting lower even ahead of the referendum. Now they are expected to dip below the breakeven level of 50. In the case of services, that would be the first contractionary reading since late 2012. But...the initial response may evolve as respondents get more political certainty. We will need to see the August PMI surveys in early September to get a more definitive view of the impact on UK activity. Ipek Ozkardeskaya of London Capital Group warns that the pound could take a hit, if he PMIs are disappointing: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s lots on the agenda to keep us busy today. First up, MPs have delivered a withering verdict on Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct empire, warning that conditions are more suited to a Victorian workhouse than a 21st century retail chain. Eight months after a Guardian investigation, the business, innovation and skills (BIS) select committee concluded that Ashley treated his workers like commodities, not human beings. They condemned the company\u2019s \u2018six strikes and you\u2019re out\u2019 policy, and the use of thousands of zero-hour contracts which left staff in a precarious state. It\u2019s a pretty devastating verdict on Ashley, who admitted to MPs last month that Sports Direct had failed to pay the minimum wage due to searching staff in their own time. Luke Primarolo, the regional officer at Unite, says other companies have lessons to learn too: \u201cSports Direct is by no means the only company to engage people on such terms. What this highlights is a wider issue of real work today. The government needs to seriously consider what legislation needs to be put in place to protect people from exploitation.\u201d Here\u2019s the full story: Second, finance ministers and central bankers have headed to China for a G20 meeting. Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union will be high on the agenda. Philip Hammond, the UK\u2019s new chancellor, is holding meetings with his Chinese counterparts right now. Thirdly, we get new PMI surveys showing the state of the European economy this month. Excitingly, this will include a rare \u2018flash\u2019 assessment of Britain\u2019s private sector in the first few weeks after the Brexit vote. Here\u2019s the timings: 8am: French flash PMI for July 9.30am: German flash PMI for July 9am: Eurozone flash PMI for July 9.30am: UK flash PMI for July European markets are expected to take a breather, as investors ponder whether central banks will deliver more stimulus to fight a downturn.",

Compared with the euro, the pound has fallen by 9% since the vote and is at a three-year low \u2013 making holidays in euroland more expensive.</p> <p>The decline comes as investors worry about weakness in the UK economy and the prospect of interest rate cuts to boost demand.

Other travel companies are also suffering as, along with increased concerns about terror attacks, they face the prospect of UK holidaymakers ditching more expensive overseas trips and staying at home. But executives at Heathrow airport said on Friday that the Leave vote had been good for business, with the falling pound encouraging international visitors to spend more in its shops, as well as making it easier to raise money from foreign investors. FIRST SIGNS OF ECONOMIC IMPACT The first real sign that Brexit is having an impact on the economy emerged last Friday, with a Markit survey showing business activity in services and manufacturing shrinking in July at its fastest rate since the global financial crisis in 2009. The data suggested that UK GDP could contract by 0.4% in the third quarter, according to Markit. Until then, the data had been equivocal. The International Monetary Fund, which before the referendum had warned of possible recession if the Leave campaign won, cut its forecast for UK growth in 2017 by 0.9% points to 1.3% from its April estimate. But that is still similar to its forecasts for Germany and France. A report from the Bank of England\u2019s regional agents last week showed that a majority of firms were not planning to mothball investment or change their hiring plans. The latest job figures looked upbeat: showing unemployment at its lowest level for more than a decade, with 31.7 million people in work in the three months to the end of May \u2013 176,000 more than for the three months to February 2016. On the high street, however, the volume of retail sales fell by 0.9% between May and June. This compared to a rise of the same amount in the previous three months, and showed the effect of falling consumer confidence in the run-up to and immediate aftermath of the EU vote. This was backed up by a survey from the British Retail Consortium and KPMG showing retail sales in the three months before the vote at their weakest for seven years, while market research group GfK recorded the biggest slide in consumer confidence for 21 years in a one-off poll following the referendum. Inflation is on the rise, with official figures showing that dearer air fares and driving costs helped to push the consumer price index up by 0.5% in the year ending in June, up from 0.3% previously. With higher prices on the way after the Brexit vote, inflation could breach its 2% target during 2017.",

                "bodyText":"Ahead of some key central bank meetings this week, notably the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan, investors managed to hold their nerve. So despite oil prices slipping back further, stock markets in Europe (mostly) ended in positive territory, lifted by positive news from the likes of BT and GKN. But banks remained in the doldrums ahead of Friday\u2019s European stress test results. Wall Street was marginally lower by the time Europe closed, as a spate of new data suggested a US rate rise could be on the cards again later in the year. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 added 13.90 points or 0.21% to 6724.03 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.49% to 10,247.76 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.15% at 4394.77 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB edged up 0.03% to 16,697.01 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.18% at 8560.2 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.22% to 566 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 32 points or 0.18%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. In sum, the US data seems to point to a possible rate rise this year, which has not been lost on the stock market. Wall Street has now lost ground, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now down 80 points or 0.44%. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: A batch of particularly strong US data points highlighted the frustrating position [Federal Reserve chair] Janet Yellen &amp; co find themselves in, where their domestic economy warrants another interest rate hike to normalise monetary policy. However, with global headwinds blowing more from the Atlantic and less from the Pacific, the Fed appears to have her hands tied for the time being. Despite markets largely disregarding the possibility of any actions from the Fed tomorrow, today\u2019s outperformance in data spanning manufacturing, consumer confidence and new home sales seemed to raise the likeliness of a 2016 hike, spurring weakness in US stocks. More on the rise in US new home sales. Reuters reports: New U.S. single-family home sales rose more than expected in June, reaching their highest level in nearly 8-1/2 years, the latest sign that the housing market was gathering momentum. The Commerce Department said on Tuesday new home sales increased 3.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 592,000 units last month, the highest level since February 2008. May\u2019s sales pace was revised up to 572,000 units from the previously reported 551,000 units. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for about 9.6 percent of the housing market, rising to a rate of 560,000 units last month. More US data, this time fairly reasonable, and giving the Federal Reserve something to think about. The July consumer confidence index came in at 97.3, better than the expected 95.9 and little changed from the revised 97.4 figure for June (down from an initial 98). And the Richmond Fed composite manufacturing index came in at +10 in July, compared to -10 in June. Back with the housing market, single family home sales rose 3.5% in June compared to no change in May. On the services data Markit said: July data suggested that growth in the U.S. service sector remained muted, with activity rising at the weakest pace in the current five-month sequence of expansion. A slower increase in new business was also recorded. On a more positive note, the rate of job creation picked up slightly and business sentiment improved markedly from June\u2019s record low. On the price front, slower increases were registered for both input costs and output prices during the month. Andrew Harker, senior economist at Markit said: The U.S. service sector remained stuck in a low gear at the start of the third quarter of 2016, with growth of activity remaining subdued amid a slower rise in new business. This is particularly disappointing given the decent numbers posted by the manufacturing sector last week. A bit more encouraging was the rebound in business confidence following June\u2019s survey low, suggesting that a return to stronger growth will be possible once the current soft patch comes to an end. Whether this will be before the presidential election or not remains to be seen, however. Growth in the US service sector is slowing, according to an initial estimate for July. Markit\u2019s services PMI index came in at 50.9, down from the 51.4 level seen in June and below forecasts of a figure of 52. But Markit\u2019s composite index - taking in both services and manufacturing - was up from 51.2 in June to 51.5, the highest since April. US markets are marginally higher in early trading as investors keep their powder dry ahead of a host of big name companies reporting later, including Apple and Twitter, as well as Wednesday\u2019s interest rate decision from the Federal Reserve. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up just 11 points or 0.06%. Oil continues to come under pressure on persistent concerns about a supply glut at the same time as demand weakens along with the global economy. Brent crude is currently dow 0.36% at $44.56 a barrel, having earlier fallen as low as $44.14, a level not seen since the middle of May. Over to the US, and as the Federal Reserve meets to decide its latest move on interest rates, there is a spate of economic data coming out for them to consider. Markets are not expecting the US central bank to change rates, although there is a growing school of thought that it may raise borrowing costs before the end of the year if the economic picture seems to be heading in the right direction. Larry Hatheway, chief economist at asset management firm GAM, said: The Federal Reserve is unlikely to announce a change in its target Fed Funds rate at the conclusion of this week\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. A hallmark of the Yellen Fed, and its predecessors, is clear communication regarding policy decisions, avoiding surprises. Given the uncertainties the Fed had cited around \u2018Brexit\u2019 as well as the weakness of the May employment report, the Fed is widely believed to be \u2018on hold\u2019, a view it will almost certainly confirm this week. That said, the FOMC statement is also likely to recognise that the much discussed concerns for capital markets, the world economy and \u2013 by extension \u2013 the US economy stemming from the UK \u2018Leave\u2019 result have not, for the most part, manifested themselves. Without saying so directly, the Fed is likely to conclude that the primary economic consequences of \u2018Brexit\u2019 will be felt in the UK, with little impact on US economic conditions. So the latest data is likely to be scoured for signs of how the US economy is performing. First off the block is some housing data, which shows prices rising less than expected but still indicating a fairly strong marke.t The S&amp;P Case-Schiller index rose 5.2% in May year on year, below the 5.4% figure in the previous month and the 5.5% forecast by economists polled by Reuters. David M. Blitzer of the S&amp;P index committee said: Overall, housing is doing quite well...In addition to strong prices, sales of existing homes reached the highest monthly level since 2007 as construction of new homes showed continuing gains. Assuming Martin Weale is a bellwether, what might the Bank of England do next week to stimulate the economy? Jeremy Cook of World First predicts an interest rate cut, a new bout of quantitative easing (QE; buying bonds with new money), and new measures to encourage banks to lend. He says: We are maintaining our call for a Bank of England interest rate cut by 25bps and an increase in QE by somewhere between \u00a350bn and \u00a375bn. Within the announcement we are also looking for something similar to the ECB\u2019s TLTRO \u2013 Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operation \u2013 that allows banks to borrow at negative rates i.e. get paid for borrowing. This would be a subsidy to British banks that should insulate the financial system from the unwanted effects of negative deposit rates should the Bank see the need. This is the kind of financial policy engineering that may allow for a near term pick-up in inflation expectations and, maybe more importantly, a calming of fears around financial stability. But other economists are split over the chances of more quantitative easing, on top of the \u00a3375bn of bonds already held by the BoE. Danielle Haralambous of the Economist Intelligence Unit points out that the Bank doesn\u2019t have many conventional tools left.... We should have worn special hats today, as apparently it\u2019s Mario Draghi Day. No, the European Central Bank president hasn\u2019t been honoured with his own holiday (yet). Instead, it\u2019s the fourth anniversary of his pledge to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the euro. That surprise promise, made in London in 2012, paved the way towards various initiatives to fight the eurozone\u2019s slide into deflation. Draghi\u2019s pledge to buy unlimited quantities of bonds from struggling nations helped to drive down eurozone bond yields. And thanks to the splurge of quantitative easing, the ECB\u2019s balance sheet has swollen dramatically. However, but inflation remains worryingly low, growth is still quite weak and inflation too high. Maybe we\u2019ll have more to celebrate next year. In the meantime, check out the FT\u2019s collection of graphs to show how the last four years have developed. After a quiet morning in the City, BT is still the best-performing stock on the FTSE 100. Its shares have now jumped by almost 5%, showing investors\u2019 verdict on Ofcom\u2019s decision not to split the company. This table shows how significant Openreach is to BT\u2019s financial performance: Britain\u2019s banks have turned up their noses at the latest offer of cheap cash from the Bank of England. The BoE has allocated just \u00a375m of liquidity in its latest weekly auction since the Brexit vote. This gives banks a chance to swap assets for ready cash, in case they are facing a funding squeeze. Clearly they are not - \u00a375m is the lowest take-up since the EU crisis began, down from \u00a3250m last week. The Federation of Small Businesses is deeply alarmed about the prospect that firms could be charged negative interest rates by their banks. Mike Cherry, the FSB\u2019s national chairman, has urged the Bank of England to fully consider the consequences of cutting rates to fresh record low: Today\u2019s warning from Natwest and RBS will be deeply concerning to small firms. FSB\u2019s latest research shows small business confidence is already at a four year low. Firms are less optimistic, cutting headcount and curbing investment intentions. \u201cWhen the Monetary Policy Committee meets next week to decide on interest rates, we would call on them to do everything possible to consider the implications of changing interest rates for smaller firms and the self-employed looking to maintain or grow their business. \u201cIt is now vital that all finance providers holding deposits from small businesses do everything they can to update customers concerned about any changes to their Business Current Account (BCA) during this uncertain economic period. Martin Weale\u2019s new enthusiasm for a fresh stimulus package raises the prospect that UK interest rates are slashed to almost zero next week. A interest rate cut would present challenges for the banking sector, as rates are already just 0.5%. The Guardian revealed last night that NatWest is already warning business customers that it could impose negative interest rates \u2013 meaning they would be charged to leave money at the bank. Clive Lewis, head of enterprise at the ICAEW, says businesses need to prepare for negative interest rates. He fears that it could encourage firms to take money out of the bank, raising the risk of theft. Lewis says: \u201cIt is vital that all customers, but especially small business customers, check all communications from their bank and monitor their accounts. Banks are well within their rights to do this, but for small businesses where cash flow is tight, this could cause significant problems if they are not prepared. \u201cThe danger is that this could have a distorting effect by incentivising customers not to keep their money in the bank \u2013 either prompting unwarranted spending or causing them to store money in ways that are less safe\u201d Lending to UK business and housebuyers has fallen, highlighting nervousness created by the EU referendum. Mortgage approvals fell to 40,103 in June, down from 41,842 [corrected] in May, according to the British Bankers Association. That\u2019s the fewest mortgage approvals since March 2015, although more money was loaned than a year ago. The BBA also reports that business lending fell in June for the first time this year, indicating that businesses delayed big projects before June\u2019s Brexit vote. BBA chief economist Rebecca Harding says we can\u2019t read too much into this, though: \u201cOverall, business confidence was clearly fragile in anticipation of the outcome of the vote, but these results are not a verdict on the health of the economy post-Brexit,\u201d The pound has weakened against all other major currencies this morning, after Martin Weale threw his weight behind a new stimulus package for the UK economy. Sterling is still down half a cent against the US dollar at $1.309. It\u2019s down a similar amount against the euro too, at \u20ac1.192. Traders are calculating that Weale\u2019s change of heart is significant, as other policymakers may also be spurred into action by the latest economic data. UK hedge fund manager Man Group has warned that the EU referendum is casting a shadow over the City. Man posted a 3% drop in funds under management today. CEO Manny Roman says customers could be spooked by the Brexit vote: The outlook, particularly cross border post Brexit, remains uncertain and accordingly the risk appetite of our clients has the potential to impact flows. Oil giant BP has warned that economic conditions are tough, after missing City forecasts in the last quarter. BP made an underlying replacement cost profit of $720m in the second quarter of 2016, down from $1.3bn last year, as the low oil price continued to hit revenues. BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley sounded cautious, telling shareholders that: \u201cAs we look forward we expect the external environment to remain challenging,\u201d BP shares are down 1.7% this morning. Next week\u2019s Bank of England monetary policy committee meeting is Martin Weale\u2019s last chance to influence monetary policy, as he steps down later in August. He has a somewhat spotty record too \u2013 having voted to raise borrowing costs several times since the financial crisis due to (unwarranted?) worries over inflation. Kit Juckes of French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale comments: He has attended 71 MPC meetings so far (if my maths is right) and has voted to leave rates unchanged 59 times and to hike 12 times. The MPC has never moved rates over that period but perhaps this time, he\u2019ll be a bellwether. Martin Weale\u2019s warning about the weakening UK economy shows that the Bank of England is close to launching a stimulus package, say analysts. Here\u2019s Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct: Although the Bank of England meet again to discuss rates next week, it had initially been thought that meaningful action would have to wait until we had a full quarter\u2019s worth of post-Brexit data on the table, but opinions here may now be shifting. Jeremy Cook of World First agrees: With Weale now expected to vote for a policy cut in what will be his last meeting as a member of the Monetary Policy Committee it is now almost a guarantee that the majority will plump for a stimulatory increase in monetary accommodation. The exact make-up of that policy still remains in doubt. Reuters\u2019 Jamie McGeever is struck by Weale\u2019s sudden change of view: Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron has also blasted Ofcom for not splitting BT up, given the steady criticism over the telco\u2019s broadband service. He argues that the regulator has proved to be toothless, even though today\u2019s ruling forces Openreach to work more closely with other service providers: \u201cIt provides a poor service to customers and has been starved of investment. Giving more powers and investment to Openreach is better than nothing but the crucial thing is it will leave millions of customers with poor quality broadband. That is unacceptable in the modern age when the government claims to be creating a digital economy. \u201cIf a watchdog yet again fails to bark, perhaps it is time to put it down.\u201d John Fingleton, the former head of Britain\u2019s Office for Fair Trading, reckons Ofcom have blundered by not completing separating BT\u2019s network arm from the retail side of the company. BT\u2019s bosses may be breathing a sigh of relief this morning after regulator Ofcom resisted pressure to formally split the company. Shares in BT have jumped by 3% after Ofcom recommended that Openreach, its broadband network provider, should become a legally separate company. Some BT critics had argued that Openreach should be completely split off, to prevent the company from failing to invest enough in the country\u2019s telecoms infrastructure. Those calls have not been heeded by the regulator, though, as my colleague Angela Monaghan explains: BT will not have to sell off its Openreach broadband division despite concerns that it has been starved of investment and provides a poor quality of service. The media regulator, Ofcom, has instead ordered BT to give more independence and investment powers to Openreach. Ofcom said Openreach should be run as a legally separate company within BT Group, with its own board and its own brand. \u201cThis model would provide Openreach with the greatest degree of independence from BT Group that is possible without incurring the costs and disruption \u2013 to industry and consumers \u2013 associated with separating the companies entirely,\u201d Ofcom said, announcing the decision. Shares in London are rising in early trading, partly thanks to the weakening pound: Martin Weale\u2019s decision to back fresh stimulus measures next week has caused a stir in the City. Analysts at Royal Bank of Canada reckon that there\u2019s only one \u2018hawk\u2019 left on the committee: The Financial Times carries an interview with BoE MPC member Martin Weale that indicates he will now vote in favour of an immediate stimulus package at the August meeting. In a speech last week said he wanted to \u201cwait for firmer evidence before making any policy change\u201d but following the sharp fall in the recent \u2018flash\u2019 PMI surveys he now thinks that news will be very material for next week\u2019s decision. The business survey evidence has been a lot worse than he was expecting. Of the MPC members to have spoken on the record since the referendum, that now leaves just Kristin Forbes as a hawkish outlier. However, Weale is also getting some stick for this u-turn, given he was arguing against immediate stimulus measures last week. City traders are selling the pound with gusto, following Martin Weale\u2019s hint that he\u2019ll vote for a Bank of England stimulus programme next week. Sterling has fallen by half a cent against the US dollar to $1.3092, which isn\u2019t great news for anyone heading to America on their holidays. That adds to Friday\u2019s selloff, when the pound dropped by 1.5 cents after Markit\u2019s PMI survey showed the economy shrinking at its fastest rate since 2009. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The big news this morning is that one of the Bank of England\u2019s most hawkish members has warned that the economy is worse than he expected. Martin Weale has been shaken into action by last week\u2019s grim purchasing managing index (PMI), which showed that manufacturing firms and service companies had suffered falling orders and demand in July. That report implies that the UK economy is probably shrinking this month. And it means Weale is likely to vote for a new stimulus package, which may include an interest rate cut, at next week\u2019s meeting. Weale told the FT that last Friday\u2019s PMIs were \u201ca lot worse than I had thought\u201d and showed \u201cexpectations have worsened sharply\u201d. He added: \u201cThey are the best short-term indicator we have at the moment. I certainly feel they are very material for the decision we\u2019ll be taking next week.\u201d Here\u2019s a reminder of just how sharply the PMI slumped into contraction territory: It\u2019s quite a change of stance from Weale- -- back on 18 July, he argued that we didn\u2019t have enough evidence that the economy was suffering from June\u2019s Brexit vote. Clearly a week is a long time in monetary policy.... Only one member of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee, Gertjan Vlieghe voted to cut interest rates at this month\u2019s meeting. But Weale won\u2019t be the only policymaker to have clocked the importance of the PMIs, so the next meeting on August 4 could be rather lively... Here\u2019s the FT\u2019s story: Also coming up today.... Telecoms regulator Ofcom is announcing plans to restructure BT Openreach, the telco\u2019s network arm. It will be split off into a \u2018distinct company\u2019, separate from the rest of the operation. But will it be enough to allay concerns over service levels and broadband speed? We\u2019ll be watching the BHS scandal again today too, after MPs yesterday released a damning report into the collapse of the retailer. Sir Philip Green, who came into particular criticism, is now threatening to sue MP Frank Field over comparison to Robert Maxwell. There\u2019s a flurry of company news this morning, with oil giant BP and fund manager Man Group reporting to the City: But the major corporate news won\u2019t come until late tonight, when Apple and Twitter reveal how well they performed in the last quarter. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main news through the day....",

                "bodyText":"The prospect of a UK interest rate cut next week was virtually confirmed on Tuesday after a key member of the Bank of England\u2019s policymaking committee warned the economy was in a worse state than he expected just a week ago. In a sudden U-turn from his previous stance, Dr Martin Weale, one of the more hawkish members of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee, suggested in an interview with the Financial Times (\u00a3) that he was likely to vote for further stimulus measures. On 18 July, Weale said in a speech there was not enough evidence that the economy was suffering from the UK\u2019s vote to leave the European Union. Weale\u2019s change of heart followed Friday\u2019s poor UK services and manufacturing PMI survey, showing firms suffering falling orders and demand in July. The survey suggested the UK economy was on course to shrink by 0.4% in the third quarter unless conditions improved, according to the report\u2019s compliers, Markit. Weale said that last Friday\u2019s PMIs were \u201ca lot worse than I had thought\u201d and showed \u201cexpectations have worsened sharply\u201d. He added: \u201cThey are the best short-term indicator we have at the moment. I certainly feel they are very material for the decision we\u2019ll be taking next week. \u201cI see things rather differently from what I would have done had we not had those numbers and the material point is that they were collected after 12 July, so after the initial shock of the referendum. \u201cWhat I said last week is that I would like more information as well as more reflection and I have had more information. Although you can\u2019t say there\u2019s a clear signal, if you spend all the time waiting for a clear signal, it never comes.\u201d Weale\u2019s comments sent the pound sharply down to a two-week low of $1.3060 although it later recovered some ground to trade at $1.3127, down 0.1% on the day. At this month\u2019s MPC meeting, only one member of the committee, Gertjan Vlieghe, voted to cut interest rates. In light of the slowdown in the economy, a majority of analysts polled by Reuters had already expected a rate cut and some believe the Bank could restart its \u00a3375bn quantitative easing or bond buying programme. Jeremy Cook of World First said: \u201cWe are maintaining our call for a Bank of England interest rate cut by 25 basis points and an increase in QE by somewhere between \u00a350bn and \u00a375bn.\u201d Meanwhile, the Federation of Small Business warned the Bank to consider the consequences of cutting rates after the Guardian revealed that high street bank NatWest - owned by Royal Bank of Scotland - had warned business customers it might impose negative rates and charge customers to accept deposits. Mike Cherry, the FSB\u2019s national chairman, said: \u201cThe warning from NatWest and RBS will be deeply concerning to small firms. FSB\u2019s latest research shows small business confidence is already at a four-year low. Firms are less optimistic, cutting headcount and curbing investment intentions. \u201cWhen the monetary policy committee meets next week to decide on interest rates, we would call on them to do everything possible to consider the implications of changing interest rates for smaller firms and the self-employed looking to maintain or grow their business.\u201d In his FT interview, Weale, who leaves the MPC after the August meeting, said monetary policy would not boost the economy immediately and may not prevent a recession. Wednesday sees the first estimate for second quarter UK GDP, with analysts expecting a growth to remain at 0.4%, the same as in the first three months of the year More signs of weakness in the economy came as mortgage approvals fell to 40,103 in June, down from 41,842 in May, according to the British Bankers Association. The BBA also reported that business lending fell by \u00a3526m in June, the first decline this year, indicating that businesses delayed big projects before June\u2019s Brexit vote.",

May\u2019s initial reading of a 2.3% drop was revised downwards to a 2.8% fall.</p> <p>Rob Carnell, chief international economist at ING Bank, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The volatile durable goods orders data fell again in June by 4.0% month on month, following a 2.8% decline in May. This matters because goods orders are one of the ways we can track business investment over the quarter. With the quarter now complete, the picture for business investment in the second quarter of 2016, following 2 previous quarters of decline, remains poor. </p> <p>More accurate yardsticks for business investment than the headline orders series, are the trend series for core orders and shipments. Core (ex defence and aircraft) orders accelerated their decline on a 3-month annualised basis in June. But the equivalent figure for shipments fell at a slower pace, though remained negative. </p> <p>We think this suggests a flat business investment figure in the second quarter of 2016 - or something close to flat - and this would be a slight improvement on the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016.</p> <p>We had not expected much more than this, but nonetheless, our 2.8% quarter on quarter forecast for second quarter GDP growth might now be a couple of tenths too high, assuming we have all our other subcomponents correct.</p> <p>This would still leave second quarter 2016 GDP at about 2.5% - a marked improvement on 1.1% in the first quarter, and will help hawkish Fed members argue that the Fed should not hold its fire for too much longer before hiking rates again. The domestic economy does seem to have recovered some of its momentum since late 2015 / early 2016, and international political developments and market uncertainty are now the main deterrents to further fed tightening.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5798b3cee4b02d2223d825a8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-27T13:21:03.411Z\">2.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FTSE 250 regains all post-Brexit vote losses</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The FTSE 100 is not the only index to be boosted by the news of better than expected UK GDP figures and, perhaps more pertinently, an interest rate cut from the Bank of England next week to try and stall a post-Brexit downturn.</p> <p>The leading index is now at its highest level for more than a year - the best since 20 July 2015.</p> <p>Meanwhile the FTSE 250, which is more focused on the UK domestic economy than the 100 index, has regained all the losses it suffered since the Brexit result.</p> <p>The mid-cap index is up 1.6% at 17,354, compared to the 17,333 level it reached on the day of the referendum.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5798ae2fe4b0e0542bbb25c5\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-27T13:13:12.978Z\">2.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Lunchtime summary: Growth beats forecasts, but....</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A quick recap.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jul/27/uk-gdp-economy-growth-brexit-referendum-pound-markets-live?page=with:block-57986face4b065cfc0a5bf80#block-57986face4b065cfc0a5bf80\">Fears that Britain\u2019s economy stalled in the run-up to the EU referendum have eased a little, after growth in the second quarter of 2016 beat forecasts</a>.</strong></p> <p>UK GDO rose by 0.6% in April-June, the ONS reported, thanks to the biggest jump in industrial output since 1999.</p> <p> That beats forecasts of 0.4% growth, and means Britain\u2019s economy is 7.7% larger than before the 2008 crash.<br></p> <p>Details:</p> <ul> <li>Services: grew by 0.5%<br></li> <li>Industrial production: grew by 2.1%<br></li> <li>Manufacturing: grew by 1.8%<br></li> <li>Construction: shrank by 0.4%<br></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3d0aacf683e2d0f48ca5d684babeb760b3e1183\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3d0aacf683e2d0f48ca5d684babeb760b3e1183/0_0_763_546/500.jpg\" alt=\"Where the growth came from:\" width=\"500\" height=\"358\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Where the growth came from:</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ONS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jul/27/uk-gdp-economy-growth-brexit-referendum-pound-markets-live?page=with:block-579872e7e4b0e0542bbb24f9#block-579872e7e4b0e0542bbb24f9\">Chancellor Philip Hammond has declared that the figures show Britain\u2019s economic fundamentals are robust</a>, as it enters a world of Brexit uncertainty.

The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 26.40 points or 0.39% higher at 6750.43, its best level since 5 August 2015 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.7% to 10,319.55 France\u2019s Cac climbed 1.19% to 4446.96 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was 0.99% better at 16,863.01 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.18% at 8661.4 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.56% to 569.16 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 31 points or 0.17% ahead of the US Federal Reserve interest rate decision. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Here\u2019s Reuters on the rise in US crude oil stocks: Oil prices tumbled more than 2 percent on Wednesday, hitting a two-month low, after the U.S. government reported a surprise build in crude and gasoline inventories during the peak summer driving season. The U.S. Energy Information Administration said domestic crude stockpiles rose 1.7 million barrels, against analysts\u2019 forecasts for a drawdown of 2.3 million barrels. \u201cA drop in refinery runs at the peak of summer driving season indicate refiners are dialing back amid faltering profit margins,\u201d said Matt Smith, analyst at New York-based oil cargoes tracker Clipperdata. Refinery crude runs fell 277,000 barrels per day last week as utilization rates fell 0.8 percentage point to 92.4 percent of capacity, EIA data showed. Oil prices are under pressure again after new figures showing a surprise increase in US crude stocks. The Energy Information Administration said crude oil stocks rose by 1.67m barrels last week to 521.1m, rather than the 2m fall which had been expected. US markets are off to a positive start, lifted by better than expected results from Apple and ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 56 points or 0.3%, while the S&amp;P 500 is up 0.16% and Nasdaq is 0.63% better. Earlier in the US came some evidence of economic weakness, ahead of the Federal Reserve interest rate decision. Orders for durable goods - long lasting items ranging from toasters to aircraft - fell 4% month on month in June, the biggest drop since August 2014. May\u2019s initial reading of a 2.3% drop was revised downwards to a 2.8% fall. Rob Carnell, chief international economist at ING Bank, said: The volatile durable goods orders data fell again in June by 4.0% month on month, following a 2.8% decline in May. This matters because goods orders are one of the ways we can track business investment over the quarter. With the quarter now complete, the picture for business investment in the second quarter of 2016, following 2 previous quarters of decline, remains poor. More accurate yardsticks for business investment than the headline orders series, are the trend series for core orders and shipments. Core (ex defence and aircraft) orders accelerated their decline on a 3-month annualised basis in June. But the equivalent figure for shipments fell at a slower pace, though remained negative. We think this suggests a flat business investment figure in the second quarter of 2016 - or something close to flat - and this would be a slight improvement on the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. We had not expected much more than this, but nonetheless, our 2.8% quarter on quarter forecast for second quarter GDP growth might now be a couple of tenths too high, assuming we have all our other subcomponents correct. This would still leave second quarter 2016 GDP at about 2.5% - a marked improvement on 1.1% in the first quarter, and will help hawkish Fed members argue that the Fed should not hold its fire for too much longer before hiking rates again. The domestic economy does seem to have recovered some of its momentum since late 2015 / early 2016, and international political developments and market uncertainty are now the main deterrents to further fed tightening. The FTSE 100 is not the only index to be boosted by the news of better than expected UK GDP figures and, perhaps more pertinently, an interest rate cut from the Bank of England next week to try and stall a post-Brexit downturn. The leading index is now at its highest level for more than a year - the best since 20 July 2015. Meanwhile the FTSE 250, which is more focused on the UK domestic economy than the 100 index, has regained all the losses it suffered since the Brexit result. The mid-cap index is up 1.6% at 17,354, compared to the 17,333 level it reached on the day of the referendum. A quick recap. Fears that Britain\u2019s economy stalled in the run-up to the EU referendum have eased a little, after growth in the second quarter of 2016 beat forecasts. UK GDO rose by 0.6% in April-June, the ONS reported, thanks to the biggest jump in industrial output since 1999. That beats forecasts of 0.4% growth, and means Britain\u2019s economy is 7.7% larger than before the 2008 crash. Details: Services: grew by 0.5% Industrial production: grew by 2.1% Manufacturing: grew by 1.8% Construction: shrank by 0.4% Chancellor Philip Hammond has declared that the figures show Britain\u2019s economic fundamentals are robust, as it enters a world of Brexit uncertainty. He can also point to plans to invest more than \u00a3300m in London City Airport. But many economists have warned that the economy is probably now shrinking. It could even fall into recession, if Britain gets a serious bout of Brexit blues. There\u2019s also concern that most of the growth occurred in April, before dropping off in May. The report has little detail on how the economy fared in the immediate run-up to the June 23 referendum either. Worryingly, UK retail sales have tumbled at the fastest rate since January 2012 this month. And Ireland\u2019s central bank has cut its growth forecasts for 2016 and 2017, due to the impact caused by the EU referendum vote. But City traders are in upbeat move, sending the FTSE up by 49 points to 6773 -- a new 11-month high. They\u2019re expecting a fresh bout of stimulus from the Bank of Japan soon, followed by a UK interest rate cut next week. Fast food chain McDonalds has just announced plans to hire thousands more workers in the UK; suggesting it is also confident about future prospects. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, reckons that Philip Hammond knows full well that Britain\u2019s economy is entering turbulent times: He writes: The Brexit result was unexpected and has, judging by the surveys since, affected the outlook for both the services and manufacturing sectors. Construction was the one sector that was already struggling in the buildup to the vote and is likely to face an even tougher winter than the rest of the economy. Growth is going to slow down markedly from now on. The length and depth of that slowdown will depend on how quickly businesses regain their equilibrium. The Bank of England knows that, which is why a big package of measures designed to boost confidence will be announced next week. More here: Here\u2019s more City reaction to the growth figures. Bad news: UK retail sales have fallen at the fastest pace in over four years in July this month. The latest survey, from the CBI, bolsters concerns that the economy is weakening fast - unravelling the solid growth in the last quarter. Some 24% of retailers said that sales volumes were up in July compared with a year earlier, while 38% said they were down, giving a rounded balance of -14%. That\u2019s the weakest reading since January 2012. The CBI says: Within retail, sales by grocers, and furniture and carpets stores were the main drivers of the drop in overall volumes. But some sectors bucked the trend, with non-specialised department stores and retailers of footwear and leather goods reporting higher volumes. Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics says it\u2019s worrying news: Ireland\u2019s Central Bank has downgraded its forecasts for GDP growth for 2016 and 2017 citing the adverse affect of Brexit on the economy. Britain is Ireland\u2019s biggest export partner while Ireland is Britain\u2019s fifth biggest trading partner with \u20ac1.5bn in transactions a week. The Central Bank said it believed the Irish economy, which is one of the fastest growing in Europe, would continue to grow but that Brexit was negative for the economy. It cut its projections for growth in 2016 by 0.2% to 4.9% GDP growth. It also slashed 0.6% off its 2017 growth forecasts, down to 3.6%. It said it expected a prolonged period of uncertainty while the UK was negotiating its Brexit package which would damage investor confidence. In a statement Ireland\u2019s Central Bank chief economist, Gabriel Fagan, said while the economy\u2019s reliance on the British export market had weakened over recent decades. However... \u201cSome sectors, including agri-food, clothing, footwear and tourism continue to have a relatively high dependency on exports to the UK and, consequently, could be affected disproportionately\u201d. Tourism is expected to take a particular hit because of the weakened pound. Among Ireland\u2019s top 10 exports to Britain are food and drink and packaged medicines while the UK\u2019s exports to Britain including gas, cars and pharmaceuticals. Edgar Morganrath, associate research professor at Dublin\u2019s Economic and Social Research Institute has said that custom paperwork could add three to four per cent on costs for exporters to the UK, in line with additional costs of exporting to non-EU territories including US and Canada. Here\u2019s the full report Britain\u2019s growth since the crisis is less impressive once you adjust for the increase in population: On a per-capita basis, the economy is only 1.3% bigger than in 2008, not the 7.7% headline increase report today. Matthew Whittaker of the Resolution Foundation shows how this is much worse than in previous recessions: Andy Bruce of Reuters has highlighted how April provided the bulk of the growth in the last quarter: If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s our news story on today\u2019s growth figures: Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC, fears that Britain\u2019s economy is entering a period of weak growth, despite the forecast-beating performance in the last quarter: \u201cThe pick up in growth in the UK in the second quarter is consistent with other data - for employment, retail sales and yesterday\u2019s CBI survey of manufacturers. \u201cHowever, we also know that the EU Referendum result has sent a shockwave through the business world and we should expect much slower growth this quarter - the main scenario in our latest PwC Economic Outlook suggests growth slowing to around 1.6% this year. 2017 is likely to see even more sluggish growth - our central view is for GDP to increase by just 0.6% next year. Once upon a time, Britain\u2019s chancellor would have celebrated today\u2019s growth figures by donning a florescent jacket and building a wall. But Philip Hammond doesn\u2019t shares George Osborne\u2019s love of hard hats; so he\u2019s decamped to London City Airport this morning. He\u2019s there to announce a \u00a3344m expansion programme for the airport, meaning more space for planes and an enlarged terminal to house extra passengers. Today\u2019s report shows that \u201cdire predictions\u201d that the economy would grind to a halt before the EU referendum were false, says Peter Rosenstreich of Swissquote Bank. In actuality, growth accelerated as business raced ahead of the uncertain vote (lead by industrial output). This unexpected read indicates that the UK economy was in stronger position ahead of the vote then originally forecasted. But Rosenstreich also fears Britain could now fall into recession: However, this preliminary estimate does not capture the post referendum fallout, which is likely to drive Q3 lower, possibly into recession. We remain bearish on the British pound as the UK economy will clearly go through a period of economic adjustment and likely BoE interest rate cuts.\u201d One decent quarter doesn\u2019t mean Britain\u2019s industrial sector has roared back, points out Ben Chu of the Independent: The chancellor has been tweeting: Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, also fears that the UK will contract following the Brexit vote, but might avoid a full-blown recession. He points out that today\u2019s strong growth reading is \u201calmost entirely due to the exceptional April performance\u201d [see earlier graph] That means the economy was probably weakening in June. \u201cGDP growth in Q2 looks likely to represent one last hurrah for the economy before it enters a softer and more turbulent period. The lack of momentum as the economy entered Q3 means that the chances of a negative reading for the current quarter are relatively high. However, our view remains that the extent to which the economy will slow in the second half of the year has been overplayed and that the UK may avoid a technical recession.\u201d Ben Brettell, senior economist at financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown, is encouraged by the 2.1% surge in UK industrial output: The UK economy shook off pre-referendum nerves to grow by a better-than-expected 0.6% in the second quarter, with a notably strong performance from the manufacturing sector. It\u2019s always difficult to tell where you\u2019re going by looking in the rear-view mirror, and as such today\u2019s GDP figures can\u2019t be taken as evidence of the current climate. However, what they do show is an absence of pre-Brexit concerns, meaning that if the forecast downturn does materialise, at least we start from a position of relative strength. However... Danielle Haralambous of the Economist Intelligence Unit reckons it won\u2019t last..... Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the international payments company, World First, fears that Britain\u2019s economy will shrink in the current quarter, despite a better performance than expected in the last three months. He says: Preliminary GDP figures are always heavily caveated; less than 50% of the survey data is in and will likely over-represent the beginning of the quarter compared to the end..... \u201cUnfortunately we believe the overall UK economic picture is one of recession at the moment and while it is still too early to forecast we are looking for Q3 GDP to fall by anywhere 0.1-0.4%. Today\u2019s data will limit calls that the UK was slowing into the vote however.\u201d Today\u2019s GDP report is mainly based on data from April and May, as it\u2019s too early to have a full picture of the economy in June. So if Britain did suffer a dose of Brexit angst last month, it won\u2019t appear in today\u2019s data - we\u2019ll have to wait for the second estimate of GDP in August. Simon French, chief economist of Panmure Gordon, flags up that April was a particularly strong month: Britain\u2019s carmakers and pharmaceutical firms helped to drive the economy forwards, according to Joe Grice, the Office for National Statistics\u2019 top economist. The ONS also found little sign that the EU referendum on June 23rd had hurt the economy during the last quarter. Despite the surge in industrial output last quarter, the sector is *still* smaller than before the financial crisis back in 2008. Only the services sector (which makes up 70% of the economy) is larger: Britain\u2019s economy is now 7.7% higher than the pre-economic downturn peak, in the first quarter of 2008. The 0.6% growth recorded in Q2 means the UK has been growing for the last 14 quarters: Britain\u2019s new Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, has welcomed the news that the UK growth rate has jumped to 0.6%. He says: \u201cToday\u2019s GDP figures show that the fundamentals of the British economy are strong. In the second quarter of this year our economy grew by 0.6 per cent \u2013 faster than was expected. Indeed we saw the strongest quarterly rise in production for nearly twenty years, so it is clear we enter our negotiations to leave the EU from a position of economic strength. \u201cThose negotiations will signal the beginning of a period of adjustment, but I am confident we have the tools to manage the challenges ahead, and along with the Bank of England, this government will take whatever action is necessary to support our economy and maintain business and consumer confidence. Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector has a very good quarter, according to today\u2019s GDP report. UK industrial output jumped by 2.1% during the April-June period, the strongest quarterly growth since the third quarter of 1999. However, the service sector slowed to 0.5% growth, down from 0.6% in Q1. And construction output shrank by 0.4%. On an annual basis, the UK economy grew by 2.2% over the last 12 months - up from 2.0% three months ago. Here we go: The UK economy expanded by 0.6% in the last three months, up from 0.4% in the January-March quarter. That\u2019s faster than expected. It suggests that the UK economy was in fairly robust shape before June\u2019s EU referendum. Lots more detail and reaction to follow! Tension is mounting in the City, as traders wait for the UK GDP data to drop in 10 minutes. The pound is weakening a little, down 0.1% against the US dollar at $1.3111. Ana Thaker, market economist at PhillipCapital, explains why investors are anxious: A positive figure will add to optimism that the UK economy was robust going into the vote and therefore may weather the repercussions better than previously forecasted. However, poor figures will be a blow to already fragile and worried markets, with expectations that the Brexit decision will only exacerbate problems in an already weak economy and could see weakness in Sterling as markets contemplate the prospect of an easing package from the Bank of England. London\u2019s stock market has hit a new 11-month high this morning. The FTSE 100 has risen by 20 points to 6744, a level last seen in August 2015. Shares are rallying worldwide, after Japan\u2019s prime ministers promised a stimulus package, worth around \u00a3200bn: Encouragingly, several UK companies have told shareholders this morning that they\u2019re not suffering any serious harm from the Brexit vote. Yet, anyway. Here\u2019s Housebuilder Taylor Wimpey: One month on from the EU Referendum, current trading remains in line with normal seasonal patterns. Customer interest continues to be high, with a good level of visitors both to our developments and to our website. Challenger bank Metro says: \u201cMetro Bank is in a strong position to deal with any post European Referendum uncertainty. Since the Referendum vote we have seen no change in customer behaviour or impact on business flows.\u201d Fund manager Jupiter is also upbeat: Jupiter has continued to deliver strong investment outperformance after all fees in the first half of the year. Net flows were positive despite the market backdrop and we made further targeted investments to support our strategy of diversification by product, client type and geography which continues to deliver on behalf of our clients and shareholders. Since the end of June, we have continued to see net flows into our products. It\u2019s early days, of course - Britain hasn\u2019t even triggered Article 50 to begin the formal exit from the EU. Today\u2019s second-quarter growth figures could be a \u201clast hurrah\u201d before the Brexit vote plunges the UK into recession early next year. That\u2019s according to Bloomberg\u2019s Jill Ward, who flags up that economists expect GDP to shrink slightly over the next six months:. So, even if the growth rate does rise to 0.5%, we should still brace for trouble ahead: Samuel Tombs, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, told them: \u201cThe economy had done quite well in the run-up to the referendum, but that can turn pretty quickly. \u201cWe\u2019ve already seen consumer confidence fall very sharply and all of the survey data has just collapsed over the last month.\u201d More here: British Economy\u2019s Last Hurrah Awaited Before Brexit Growth Shock And here\u2019s what a \u2018last hurrah\u2019 looks like in practice #ouch Critics often argue that GDP is a poor measure of the health of an economy. For example, it doesn\u2019t distinguish between valuable and harmful economic output, nor does it include voluntary work or unpaid activity. It also doesn\u2019t measure economic inequality, or living standards. And we have a perfect example of that today; a survey showing that UK real wages (earnings adjusted for inflation) have shrunk by 10% since the 2007 financial crisis. That dire performance is only matched by Greece, and shows why many people have felt isolated from the recovery since the crisis. Frances O\u2019Grady of the TUC (which prepared the report) says it shows the economy is still too fragile: \u201cWages fell off the cliff after the financial crisis, and have barely begun to recover,. People cannot afford another hit to their pay packets. Working people must not foot the bill for a Brexit downturn in the way they did for the bankers\u2019 crash.\u201d Phamaceuticals firm GlaxoSmithKline has given the British economy a boost, by announcing a \u00a3275m investment programme to expand its UK manufacturing sites. GSK swept aside worries about the Brexit vote, declaring that it was driven to invest the money by the UK\u2019s \u201cskilled workforce and competitive tax system\u201d. The money will be spent across three GSK sites: Barnard Castle in County Durham, Montrose in Angus, and Ware in Hertfordshire. Understandably, the UK government has hailed the news - as a sign that Britain is still open for business despite voting to leave the EU. Business and Energy Secretary, Greg Clark argues: \u201cAn investment of this scale is a clear vote of confidence in Britain and underlines our position as a global business leader. GSK\u2019s recognition of our skilled workforce, world leading scientific capabilities and competitive tax environment is further proof that there really is no place better in Europe to grow a business.\u201d Good morning. Britain\u2019s economy is centre-stage today, as we await the official UK GDP figures for the second quarter of this year. That report, due at 9.30am sharp, will show how well the British economy performed in the second quarter of this year. The City consensus is that the economy grew by 0.4% between April and June, matching the fairly modest growth recorded in January to March. But some fear that the growth rate may have slowed, perhaps to 0.3%. Today\u2019s report is particularly important as it covered the period running up to the June 23 referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the EU. It should show whether the UK economy was in decent shape as the nation headed to the polling booths, or already weakening. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, explains why the GDP report matters: \u201cIt will tell us if the referendum gave the UK economy the jitters in the lead up to the vote. \u201cThere are several indicators which have pointed to a slowdown in economic activity as the referendum approached.\u201d The report will also show how Britain\u2019s manufacturing, services, construction and agriculture all performed during the quarter. As this chart shows, Services has provided the bulk of the growth since the financial crisis - making it more dominant than ever. It\u2019s also a busy morning for UK financial results, with housebuilder Taylor Wimpey, broadcaster ITV, challenger banks Shawbrook and Metro Bank all reporting to the City. They\u2019ll doubtless be talking Brexit today.",

                "bodyText":"Fears that the British economy has been knocked off course by the Brexit vote have been reinforced by signs of retrenchment across key industries, according to fresh reports. The first health checks of important sectors since Britain voted to leave the European Union overshadowed growth figures, showing a stronger-than-expected performance by the UK in the run-up to the referendum. An expansion of 0.6% in the British economy between April and June was countered by signals from the construction industry, car factories and high street stores that provide the Bank of England with justification for moving to boost growth when its interest rate-setting committee meets next week. The City was braced for action \u2013 from the Bank and the Treasury \u2013 to head off the threat of recession after Thursday\u2019s report. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, made it clear that there would be no repeat of the second quarter GDP growth in the months following Brexit. Hammond said the UK would at least enter divorce negotiations with the EU from a position of strength after the Office for National Statistics said the best quarterly performance by industry since 1999 had pushed up overall economic growth from 0.4% in the first three months of 2016. However, Hammond indicated a slowdown was imminent. \u201cThose negotiations will signal the beginning of a period of adjustment, but I am confident we have the tools to manage the challenges ahead, and along with the Bank of England, this government will take whatever action is necessary to support our economy and maintain business and consumer confidence,\u201d he said.

The Bank has been weighing up what little evidence there has been of the state of the economy in the five weeks since the referendum. In the latest batch of surveys released on Thursday, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said its members were gloomy about the prospects for growth, jobs and investment; the British Retail Consortium said jobs were being shed in the months leading up to the referendum; and RICS \u2013 the body that represents chartered surveyors \u2013 said workloads for construction had weakened.

Commodities have enjoyed a particularly volatile second half of this week, with crude continuing to tumble heavily on a global supply glut alongside evidence that fund managers are heavily shorting crude prices.</p> <p>Tonight\u2019s Bank of Japan meeting has been the focal point of the week despite yesterday\u2019s Fed announcement. One of the main reasons for the post-referendum rally has been the promise of easing from the likes of the ECB, Bank of England and Bank of Japan. With the overnight index swap markets rating the chance of a Bank of England rate cut at 100% next week, it seems like a matter of time until we see some sort of action. However, given that we have seen the post-referendum rally stall after weeks of inaction in Europe, there is a feeling that the FTSE is waiting for some form of stimulus to spark another leg higher.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-579a1633e4b00eff095cd6b2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/larryelliott\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-28T15:00:44.544Z\">4.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The IMF has been criticised for its handling of the eurozone crisis...by the IMF.

That compares to 0.2% growth in the first quarter, and analyst expectations of a 0.3% increase. Year on year, the economy grew by 1.4%. Economist Peter Vanden Houte at ING Bank said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs the negative impact of the March 22 terrorist attacks in Brussels on hotels, catering and retail trade amounted to about \u20ac180m for the first half of this year. This probably shaved off around 0.1 percentage points from second quarter GDP growth. On top of that, the second quarter saw a rather tense social climate, with several strikes, most notably in public transport. This also weighed on growth.</p> <p>While the GDP components have not been published yet, the improvement in sentiment in industry seems to point to a positive contribution from investment and export. Residential construction most likely also contributed positively. With the situation on the labour market continuing to improve, consumption has probably also expanded, though some negative impact of the terrorist attacks seems likely.</p> <p>All in all today\u2019s figure seems hopeful, as it confirms that the Belgian economy still has some underlying momentum, putting in a strong performance despite the terrorist attacks and the strikes. Certainly, with Brexit and potentially a somewhat tighter fiscal policy, there are new headwinds that might hamper growth in the second half, but we believe that even then a quarterly growth pace of around 0.2% to 0.3% should be feasible. We will await further data confirmation in the coming weeks, but on the back of today\u2019s figures we are likely to have to revise our estimate for Belgian GDP growth upwards to 1.4% (from 1.2%).</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-579a0704e4b00eff095cd670\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-28T13:30:24.728Z\">2.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Earlier, US jobless claims rose by more than expected last week, according to the Labor Department.</strong></p> <p>The number of Americans claiming unemployment benefits grew by 14,000 to 266,000, compared to expectations of an increase to 260,000.

                "bodyText":"After the Federal Reserve kept US interest rates on hold and ahead of a decision by the Bank of Japan, stock markets fell back after their recent highs. Falling oil prices and disappointing results from the likes of Royal Dutch Shell and Lloyds Banking Group also hit sentiment. Investors were nervous ahead of the European bank stress test results due on late on Friday. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 29.37 points or 0.44% at 6721.06 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.43% to 10,274.93 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.59% at 4420.58 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 2.02% to 16,522.64 on worries about the country\u2019s banks ahead of the stress tests Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 2.1% lower at 8479.2 In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.11% to 562.84 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 72 points or 0.4%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Markets are in wait and see mode ahead of the Bank of Japan rate decision later, but oil continues to fall on renewed worries about oversupply and weak demand. West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark has now fallen 20% since its June highs, indicating a bear market. Meanwhile in the UK the FTSE 100 is down just 7 points while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is 74 points lower after the Federal Reserve kept US interest rates on hold but hinted at possible rises later in the year. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: An unsurprisingly indecisive session in Europe has seen the likes of the FTSE largely flatlining as traders reduced their risk overnight ahead of the week\u2019s risk event from the Bank of Japan. Commodities have enjoyed a particularly volatile second half of this week, with crude continuing to tumble heavily on a global supply glut alongside evidence that fund managers are heavily shorting crude prices. Tonight\u2019s Bank of Japan meeting has been the focal point of the week despite yesterday\u2019s Fed announcement. One of the main reasons for the post-referendum rally has been the promise of easing from the likes of the ECB, Bank of England and Bank of Japan. With the overnight index swap markets rating the chance of a Bank of England rate cut at 100% next week, it seems like a matter of time until we see some sort of action. However, given that we have seen the post-referendum rally stall after weeks of inaction in Europe, there is a feeling that the FTSE is waiting for some form of stimulus to spark another leg higher. The IMF has been criticised for its handling of the eurozone crisis...by the IMF. Larry Elliott reports: The IMF\u2019s handling of the financial crisis in the eurozone has been criticised by the organisation\u2019s own independent watchdog in a report that says the fund failed to spot the scale of the problem, was guilty of over-optimistic forecasts and left the impression that it was treating Europe differently. While accepting that sorting out the problems of Greece, Ireland and Portugal \u201cposed extraordinary challenges\u201d, the IMF\u2019s Independent Evaluation Office (IEO) said the fund had missed the buildup of banking system risks in some countries and shared the widely held \u201cEurope is different\u201d mindset. The report looked into how the IMF handled the eurozone crisis, which began with the May 2010 bailout of Greece, but subsequently spread to Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus. It found that the \u201cIMF\u2019s pre-crisis surveillance identified the right issues but did not foresee the magnitude of the risks that would later become paramount\u201d. The full story is here: The vast majority of Irish small to medium enterprises believe Brexit is a threat to their business, writes Henry McDonald in Dublin: A survey released today by the British-Irish Chamber of Commence found that out of 400 Irish SMEs 262 of them see Brexit as a threat with far fewer envisaging the post-EU future as an opportunity The research also polled 88 British SMEs who do major business in Ireland. John McGrane, the Director General of the Chamber stressed that the Irish SME sector, which is the largest part of the Republic\u2019s economy, still see the UK as key to their business despite Britain leaving the EU. McGrane said the uncertainty within Irish SME\u2019s over what to do next after the Brexit vote required \u201cjoined up support\u201d from both the Irish and British government and their relevant agencies. He added: \u201cBusiness wants collaborative thinking and the Chamber stands ready to support its members, and Government, to continue to protect and grow the deep trade linkages between the UK and Ireland. We\u2019re ready to join up with likeminded agencies and organisations to ensure all businesses get the most joined-up supports they need to confront the uncertainties, and opportunities, ahead.\u201d The survey was conducted over the weeks following the EU referendum. The expectation of an interest rate cut by the Bank of England continues to put pressure on sterling. The pound has fallen 1% against the euro, hitting a two week low of 84.48p a euro. Against the dollar it is currently down 0.58% at $1.3142. Back with Brexit, and ratings agency S&amp;P Global says the decision to leave the European Union should have little impact on the UK\u2019s project finance initiative. It said: We analyse the effect of Brexit on our U.K. portfolio of over 50 rated transactions, in particular the potential repercussions of a higher inflationary environment, weaker economic growth, and the change in the credit quality of revenues and financial counterparties. While we believe that the risks of adverse economic developments in the U.K. have increased, we expect U.K. private finance initiative (PFI) projects will maintain their credit strength. A day after the US Federal Reserve kept interest rates on hold but suggested there could be a possible hike later this year, US stock markets have slipped lower in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 44 points or 0.22%, while the S&amp;P 500 has slipped 0.29% and Nasdaq 0.14%. Ahead of eurozone GDP figures on Friday, new data from Belgium has shown the country\u2019s economy growing by 0.5% quarter on quarter, despite terrorist attacks and strikes. That compares to 0.2% growth in the first quarter, and analyst expectations of a 0.3% increase. Year on year, the economy grew by 1.4%. Economist Peter Vanden Houte at ING Bank said: According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs the negative impact of the March 22 terrorist attacks in Brussels on hotels, catering and retail trade amounted to about \u20ac180m for the first half of this year. This probably shaved off around 0.1 percentage points from second quarter GDP growth. On top of that, the second quarter saw a rather tense social climate, with several strikes, most notably in public transport. This also weighed on growth. While the GDP components have not been published yet, the improvement in sentiment in industry seems to point to a positive contribution from investment and export. Residential construction most likely also contributed positively. With the situation on the labour market continuing to improve, consumption has probably also expanded, though some negative impact of the terrorist attacks seems likely. All in all today\u2019s figure seems hopeful, as it confirms that the Belgian economy still has some underlying momentum, putting in a strong performance despite the terrorist attacks and the strikes. Certainly, with Brexit and potentially a somewhat tighter fiscal policy, there are new headwinds that might hamper growth in the second half, but we believe that even then a quarterly growth pace of around 0.2% to 0.3% should be feasible. We will await further data confirmation in the coming weeks, but on the back of today\u2019s figures we are likely to have to revise our estimate for Belgian GDP growth upwards to 1.4% (from 1.2%). Earlier, US jobless claims rose by more than expected last week, according to the Labor Department. The number of Americans claiming unemployment benefits grew by 14,000 to 266,000, compared to expectations of an increase to 260,000. The previous week\u2019s level was revised down by 1,000 to 252,000. Weekly claims have been below 300,000, which is seen as a sign of a healthy labour market, for 73 consecutive weeks. Over in Paris, an EDF board member has resigned shortly before the energy company announce whether it will push on with plans to build a new nuclear plant at Britain\u2019s Hinkley Point. Gerard Magnin said the project was risky, and would undermine France\u2019s efforts to develop renewable energy technology. Magnin\u2019s resignation may be a sign that EDF will stick with Hinkley. An announcement is expected later today. Over in America, tech giant Oracle has swooped on cloud computing pioneer NetSuite in a $9.3bn deal. The deal should boost Oracle\u2019s web services offering; its founder, Larry Ellison, is also NetSuite\u2019s largest shareholder. Newsflash from Germany: the country\u2019s inflation rate has jumped to 0.4% this month, up from 0.2% in June. That\u2019s the highest level since January, which should pleas the European Central Bank in its battle to ward off deflation. The overall eurozone inflation reading is due at 10am BST tomorrow. Alex Stubb, Finlands\u2019s former prime minister and finance minister, has warned that it will take a long time for the Brexit drama to play out. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, Stubb said Europe was facing one of its biggest events in decades. It\u2019s a 1952 moment, when the Coal and Steel Community was created, or 1989 when the Cold War ended. This is huge for Europe, there\u2019s no denying it. Stubb, a veteran of the eurozone debt crisis, says Europe is following its usual three-stage approach to Brexit \u2013 first crisis, then chaos, and finally a sub-optimal solution. He adds: It\u2019s going to be a long, long process. What we get at the end of the day, I don\u2019t know. Eurozone companies have defied the fall in consumer confidence, and are actually a little more optimistic this month. The EC\u2019s economic sentiment indicator has risen to 104.6 in July from 104.4 in June. Anna Zabrodzka, economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, says it shows \u201cresilience\u201d to the Brexit vote. Other persistent worries such as the slowing Chinese economy, the immigration wave, and continued tensions with Russia also seem to made little impact on the confidence of consumers and businesses in the euro area. However, risks are skewed to the downside.\u201d Consumer confidence across Europe has fallen this month, driven by a sharp slump in the UK. That\u2019s according to the European Commission\u2019s monthly healthcheck on consumer morale, which fell to -7.9 this month from -7.2 in June. UK consumer confidence, which had been riding relatively high, took a real tumble: The dramatic events of the last few weeks have sent some of us staggering towards the drinks cabinet. But Diageo, the UK-based alcoholic beverages giant, is worried that the Brexit vote may hit sales of its whisky brands overseas, once Britain leaves the EU. Ivan Menezes, chief executive of Diageo, told CNBC that Scotland\u2019s whisky industry is dependent on global trade: Out of Brexit, our focus is really on ensuring that we keep Scotch whisky healthy. The trade agreements in Europe and around the world. You know, Johnnie Walker was in over 100 markets, long before Coca Cola left the shores of America.\u201d As well as Johnnie Walker, Diageo also produces Bell\u2019s whisky, plus several single malts including Talisker and Lagavulin. More Brexit gloom. JCDecaux, the French outdoor advertising group, has said it is likely to cut back its UK investment plans following the decision to leave the EU. JCDecaux, which installs those massive screens at railway stations, airports and London bus shelters, says: Given the uncertainty surrounding the impact of the Brexit decision on the UK economy and advertising revenue, we are reviewing the number of screens we are deploying until we can evaluate the economic conditions and have improved visibility. Union leaders are urging the UK government to act urgently to protect the economy from the impact of the Brexit vote. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says: \u201cThe growing expectation since the Brexit vote of an economic slowdown seems to be a factor. The government needs to act now to secure jobs and investment before thousands of working people pay the price of Brexit with the loss of their job. And Rob MacGregor of Unite is alarmed by Lloyds\u2019s decision to cut an extra 3,000 jobs: \u201cThis announcement is very bad news for workers and their families, and more widely it is a further body blow to the UK economy. \u201cThese are permanent jobs that are being lost. As a country, we can\u2019t afford to lose these jobs in a challenging post-Brexit world. As well publishing half year results which reveal job cuts and branch closures, Lloyds Banking Group has also admitted it is being investigated by the Financial Conduct Authority over the way it handles customers facing difficulty paying their mortgages. There is not much detail but in the results Lloyds said: \u201cIn May, the FCA informed the group that it was commencing an investigation in connection with the group\u2019s mortgage arrears handling. At this stage it is not possible to make an assessment of the outcome of this ongoing review\u201d. Lloyds did not take a provision for the payment protection misselling scandal. But in the first six months of the year the bank took a \u00a3460m to cover a range of so-called \u201cconduct issues\u201d. This included \u00a3215m \u201cin respect of arrears related activities on secured and unsecured retail products, \u00a370m in respect of complaints relating to packaged bank accounts and \u00a350m related to insurance products sold in Germany\u201d. In another worrying sign, a closely-watched survey of consumer confidence has hit its lowest level in three years after the Brexit vote. The monthly index conducted by YouGov and the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) has tumbled to 106.6, the lowest since July 2013, down from 111.3. That\u2019s the biggest one-month drop in six years. The survey found that the public are concerned about the impact of the June referendum, particularly on house prices (how very British!). Stephen Harmston, Head of YouGov Reports, says: \u201cThe public are still absorbing the EU referendum result but it is clear that consumer confidence has taken a significant and clear dive.\u201d Spain is celebrating the news that the country\u2019s jobless rate has hit its lowest level in six years, before the eurozone crisis began. However.... one in five adults are still out of work, and the situation could deteriorate if Europe\u2019s economy suffers from Brexit. Royal Dutch Shell is one of the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 this morning, down 3% after posting a 70% tumble in earnings. It blamed the recent tumble in crude oil prices, which have eaten into its profitability. CEO Ben van Beurden warned shareholders that \u201clower oil prices continue to be a significant challenge across the business.\u201d Inchcape, the UK car dealership, has warned that demand for new cars is weakening, due to the Brexit vote. It told shareholders this morning: Ahead of the EU referendum, the second quarter New Vehicle market growth rate moderated to 1.0% from 5.1% in the first quarter. We expect this moderation of the New Vehicle market to persist into the second half of 2016. Building society Nationwide has reported that house prices were stable in July, rising 0.5% month-on-month. The average house cost \u00a3205,715, 5.2% higher than a year ago. However.... as mortgages are approved towards the end of the process, this doesn\u2019t whether buyers have been spooked by the Brexit vote. Engineering firm Rolls-Royce is also cutting jobs, after reporting an 80% tumble in profits in the first half of 2016. Today\u2019s losses mean Countrywide has shed a third of its value since the referendum, highlighting how the UK\u2019s property sector will suffer from Brexit. It\u2019s a bleak morning in the financial sector too, as Lloyds Banking Group slashes 3,000 jobs. The bank is speeding up its cost-cutting programme, and closing 200 branches as it enters a \u201cperiod of uncertainty\u201d following the Brexit vote. Our City editor Jill Treanor explains that Lloyds is also preparing for interest rates to be slashed next week: The bank is blaming changes to customer behaviour and anticipated cuts to interest rates following the vote for Brexit last month. Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, signalled a rate cut would take place during the summer and the City now expects rates will be cut from their 0.5% historic low on 4 August. More here: And here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 take: Shares in Countrywide has dropped by almost 5% at the start of trading, following its Brexit-induced earnings warning. Britain\u2019s biggest lettings and estate agent group has issued a stark warning that parts of the country\u2019s property market are weakening, since last month\u2019s referendum, Countrywide, which runs 50 different high street brands, admitted that profits this year will be lower than in 2015. And it pins the blame firmly on the decision to leave the EU. According to Countrywide there was a clear market slowdown in May and June. And since the vote, commercial and London residential transactions have stalled, it says, with a \u201cless pronounced impact\u201d on other operations. The number of homes sold subject to contract in London fell 29% in April-June, compared to January-March. Alison Platt, Countrywide\u2019s CEO, says: As we stated in our last Trading Update on 26 April, we took a cautious view of the months leading up to the EU referendum and beyond. In the event, we saw a slowdown in our Retail and London residential businesses and, since the EU referendum result this has become more marked in London, the South East and expensive prime markets. The rest of the country has fared somewhat better and our Lettings business and mortgage trends have been largely unaffected. Countrywide also posted a 25% tumble in adjusted pretax profits for the first half of 2016, and warned of more challenges ahead. As Platt put it says: This period of uncertainty will inevitably impact the level of transactional activity in the second half of the year and, although it is too early to quantify accurately, we will not meet last year\u2019s result at the EBITDA level. Here\u2019s a round-up of Countrywide\u2019s brands: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Five weeks after the European Union referendum, we\u2019re now seeing signs that the vote to leave the EU is hitting the UK economy. Three influential surveys released overnight have shown worrying signs that Britain\u2019s car industry, retail sector and building companies are all suffering from the Brexit vote. In a worrying cocktail, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said its members were gloomy about the prospects for growth, jobs and investment; the British Retail Consortium said jobs were being shed in the months leading up to the referendum; and RICS \u2013 the body that represents chartered surveyors \u2013 said workloads for construction had weakened. It\u2019s a clear signal that the uncertainty created by June\u2019s vote is starting to hit demand, confidence and activity. The SMMT\u2019s chief executive, Mike Hawes warned that Britain\u2019s car revival has been underpinned by \u201ctariff-free access to the single market\u201d, so losing that access would be a serious blow. Here\u2019s the full story: This all rather takes the shine off yesterday\u2019s forecast-beating growth figures, which showed the UK\u2019s GDP expanded by 0.6% in the last quarter. Also coming up... Investors are pondering whether the US central bank might manage to raise interest rates soon, despite the Brexit risk. Last night, the Federal Reserve declared that the US jobs recovery had picked up momentum, and the near-term risks to the US economy had diminished. Intriguingly,the Fed also declared that: \u201cNear-term risks to the economic outlook have diminished.\u201d Perhaps a hint that the EU referendum hasn\u2019t caused as much market mayhem as feared. Over in Paris, French energy company EDF is deciding whether to give the go-ahead for an \u00a318bn nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset. The rumours are that the project will go ahead, despite concerns over cost and safety: And there\u2019s a blizzard of corporate results this morning, sending my Reuters machine into overdrive as companies clear the decks before the August lull. That include Lloyds Banking Group, BT, Countrywide, Thomas Cook, Diageo, Rolls Royce, Royal Dutch Shell, BAE and Sky. We\u2019ll pick the best bits out...",

GDP was revealed to be up 0.6% in the second quarter, greater than the 0.4% growth seen in the previous three months, but more timely indicators pointed to falling confidence among car factories, high street stores and in the construction industry. Manufacturing group EEF has added its voice to that gloom on Friday. Its overview of business confidence among factory bosses found optimism dropped most sharply in the south-east England and London region and in Wales. The smallest decline in confidence was among firms in the north-east England, according to the survey carried out with accountants BDO. The poll of 410 firms found that UK manufacturers\u2019 average confidence score just before the referendum was 6.37 out of a possible 10 points, and had declined to 5.24 following the vote. \u201cThe Brexit vote has put the manufacturing sector\u2019s recovery in jeopardy,\u201d said Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF. She noted that despite suffering the largest fall, the south east England and London region still ranked top in the UK for business confidence while the north-west England and the east Midlands had the lowest scores. \u201cThe growth path is now uncertain in all regions and, while firms in the south-east and London and Wales look better placed to ride the storm, companies in the eastern counties, north-east and the south-west appear more downbeat about their ability to cope,\u201d Hopley said. Exchange rate volatility, political uncertainty and the prospect of increased costs on the back of a weaker pound were all causing concern for manufacturers, the lobby group said. \u201cWith a solid business environment, supportive policies and the right outcome from Brexit negotiations allowing for trade and ongoing access to skilled workers, manufacturers should be able to overcome the risks, reap future growth rewards and get their business confidence back on track,\u201d it added. Tom Lawton, manufacturing head at the report\u2019s co-author, BDO, said there had been encouraging signs from the new government of support for the sector. \u201cThe lack of a clear strategy for the manufacturing sector over recent years has been of huge concern and it is encouraging to see Theresa May\u2019s promise of a proper industrial strategy,\u201d said Lawton. \u201cWe would like to see the government match manufacturers\u2019 long-term outlook by developing a 15 to 20 year industrial policy that avoids the disruptions of the political cycle.\u201d",

The final figure for the previous month was 93.5. The survey\u2019s chief economist Richard Curtin said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Although confidence strengthened in late July, for the month as a whole the Sentiment Index was still below last month\u2019s level mainly due to increased concerns about economic prospects among upper income households.</p> <p>The Brexit vote was spontaneously mentioned by record numbers of households with incomes in the top third (23%), more than twice as frequently as among households with incomes in the bottom two-thirds (11%). Given the prompt rebound in stock prices as well as the tiny direct impact on U.S. trade, it is surprising that concerns about Brexit remained nearly as high in late July as immediately following the Brexit vote.</p> <p>While concerns about Brexit are likely to quickly recede, weaker prospects for the economy are likely to remain. Uncertainties surrounding global economic prospects and the presidential election will keep consumers more cautious in their expectations for future economic growth. Based on the strength in personal finances and low interest rates, real consumer spending is now expected to rise by 2.6% through mid 2017.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile the Chicago purchasing managers index has come in at 55.8 in July, better than the expected 54 but below the 56.8 recorded in June.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/spreadexfins/status/759021955320254464\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">USA Chicago PMI announcement -  Actual: 55.8, Expected: 54.0 <a href=\"https://t.co/2kaIjr8fQH\">pic.twitter.com/2kaIjr8fQH</a></p>&mdash; Spreadex (@spreadexfins) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/spreadexfins/status/759021955320254464\">July 29, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><em>On that note it\u2019s time to close for the day.

Former Anglo Irish Bank treasury official John Bowe was handed down a two year prison sentence. Denis Casey, the former Irish Life &amp; Permanent chief executive was sentence to two years in jail</p> <p>The sentences were delivered at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court on Friday by Judge Mr Martin Nolan. The judge said all the men had behaved in a \u201creprehensible manner\u201d and knew that they were doing was wrong. The trio stood accused of doctoring Anglo Irish Bank\u2019s books to make it look like it had \u20ac7.2bn in its accounts. They faced charges of moving money illegally between the Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Life&amp;Permanent.</p> <p>Judge Nolan said the case was one where \u201chonesty and integrity was sorely lacking.\u201d Addressing the role of McAteer in the illegal scheme, Judge Nolan said: \u201cIt is grossly reprehensible what he did and a great shame.\u201d</p> <p>All three men had pleaded not guilty during a trial that has lasted 89 days. During sentencing the judge also singled out the firm Ernst &amp; Young for its role in signing off Anglo Irish Bank\u2019s accounts: \u201cIt beggars belief that Ernst &amp; Young signed off on the accounts.

Thus, whilst the domestic economic picture may be sufficiently strong for another hike, the Fed will likely maintain its current cautious (although broadly positive) stance in September and ahead of the US Presidential Election in November.

Managing economist Danae Kyriakopoulou said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Data released today by Eurostat showed that the pace of quarter-on-quarter GDP expansion across the Eurozone slowed to 0.3% during the second quarter of 2016.

Importantly, today\u2019s release refers to economic growth in the three months to June, ahead of the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU which is widely expected to negatively impact on the currency bloc. Cebr expects growth to weaken further over the remaining quarters of this year and next....</p> <p>We maintain our view that monetary policy has largely reached its limits in terms of the support it can provide to the recovery and that it needs to be complemented by non-monetary stimulus measures in order to succeed. In that respect, this week\u2019s decision to by-pass the rules of the Stability and Growth pact and not fine Spain and Portugal for breaching the 3% deficit threshold is a welcome move by the European Commission.

And the second quarter growth figure of 0.3% is likely to be revised, he adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After the strong growth in the first quarter (+0.6%), which was helped by some temporary factors like the mild winter weather, it was no surprise that there would be some pay-back in the second quarter.</p> <p>The disappointing 0% growth in France, largely due to a decline in inventories, was one of the culprits behind the weaker Eurozone growth performance. Bear in mind though, that in a number of big member states, comprising Germany and Italy, GDP figures still have to be published, implying that today\u2019s figure is prone to revision.</p> <p>While no demand components have been published yet, we believe that household consumption remained an important growth driver for the Eurozone, as unemployment continued to fall over the previous quarter. Looking at the European Commission\u2019s sentiment indicators, exports probably didn\u2019t play a major role in second quarter growth, though we still pencil in a positive growth contribution.</p> <p>The third quarter started on a good footing, but it is probably too soon to start downplaying the potential negative impact of Brexit on Eurozone growth.</p> <p>In a separate report the flash HICP inflation estimate was published, showing that headline inflation came out at 0.2% in July, slightly higher than expected.</p> <p>Today\u2019s set of data gives policy makers only limited comfort. The good news is that the economy still has some momentum, though there is little acceleration to be expected as long as the Brexit story continues to inject some uncertainty into the external environment. At the same time, inflation remains uncomfortably low, whilst the ECB\u2019s toolbox is getting emptier. The ECB looks set to remain in a wait-and-see mode, but we can imagine that the pressure to come up with something new will increase again, especially if growth shifts more decisively into a lower gear.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38d47b2c6c22f9c8f3a9461f38ed5ae3d36804b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38d47b2c6c22f9c8f3a9461f38ed5ae3d36804b0/0_0_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"French economy and industry minister Emmanuel Macron.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">French economy and industry minister Emmanuel Macron.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bertrand Guay/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-07-29T09:59:46.234Z\">at 10.59am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-579b20f0e4b00eff095cd845\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-29T09:28:28.631Z\">10.28am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is probably pleased that eurozone inflation is creeping up, although it is still far shy of his 2% target.

This is in line with expectations that first quarter\u2019s consumption rebound could not last without more signs of higher employment growth. Government actions to boost corporate investment seem to have been less effective in the second quarter while net exports remained the weak spot of the French economy. If employment growth fails to accelerate, the risks materializing from the Brexit shock could lead to further weaknesses in the second half of this year.</p> <p>...It should be noted that the US and the UK were large contributors to growth last year, which helped limiting the negative net export growth contribution of 2015 to -0.3%. With the Brexit risk materializing and a weaker US dollar, this position will probably deteriorate further in the second half of the year.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>After the Brexit shock, we have revised our GDP growth forecast downwards to 1.4% in 2016 after 1.2% in 2015, and to 1.1% in 2017. With no room for manoeuvre left as far as reforms are concerned, the French economy can only count upon the stimulus added by recent policies (lowering labour costs and giving investment tax breaks). We think this will not be enough to secure a stronger recovery path before the 2017 Presidential election, especially if employment growth does not accelerate strongly in the near term.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>But Spain, despite its political troubles, is performing well. ING\u2019s Geoffrey Minne says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Once again, Spanish figures remain strong and GDP growth rate of 3.2% year on year leaves Spain as a solid leader among large Eurozone countries.</p> <p>Looking at the economic situation, nearly everything seems to continue in the right direction...While the detail about GDP components is not available yet, we suspect consumption to be at the heart of the recovery, as households still benefited from the same cocktail of rising real earnings, decreasing unemployment and rebounding housing prices. The second good news of today is that the inflation rate continues to move towards the positive territory.

                "bodyText":"US consumers were less confident in July than the previous month, according to a new survey, partly due to the Brexit vote. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index came in at 90 for July, lower than the 90.5 expected but up on the preliminary reading of 89.5. The final figure for the previous month was 93.5. The survey\u2019s chief economist Richard Curtin said: Although confidence strengthened in late July, for the month as a whole the Sentiment Index was still below last month\u2019s level mainly due to increased concerns about economic prospects among upper income households. The Brexit vote was spontaneously mentioned by record numbers of households with incomes in the top third (23%), more than twice as frequently as among households with incomes in the bottom two-thirds (11%). Given the prompt rebound in stock prices as well as the tiny direct impact on U.S. trade, it is surprising that concerns about Brexit remained nearly as high in late July as immediately following the Brexit vote. While concerns about Brexit are likely to quickly recede, weaker prospects for the economy are likely to remain. Uncertainties surrounding global economic prospects and the presidential election will keep consumers more cautious in their expectations for future economic growth. Based on the strength in personal finances and low interest rates, real consumer spending is now expected to rise by 2.6% through mid 2017. Meanwhile the Chicago purchasing managers index has come in at 55.8 in July, better than the expected 54 but below the 56.8 recorded in June. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. Following the weaker than expected US GDP figures, as well as disappointing results from Exxon and Chevron, it is no surprise that US markets have opened lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 27 points or 0.15% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.08% lower. But Nasdaq edged up 0.14% after positive updates from Alphabet and Amazon. Meanwhile over in Ireland, three bankers from banks that almost bankrupted Ireland have been sent to jail today by a Dublin court, writes Ireland correspondent Henry McDonald: The trio from the now defunct Anglo Irish Bank and the taxpayer rescued Irish Life &amp; Permanent were given prison sentences for their part in a conspiracy to inflate the accounts of financial institutions by \u20ac7.2 bn. Ex-Anglo Irish Bank chief risk officer Willie McAteer has been sentenced to three and a half years. Former Anglo Irish Bank treasury official John Bowe was handed down a two year prison sentence. Denis Casey, the former Irish Life &amp; Permanent chief executive was sentence to two years in jail The sentences were delivered at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court on Friday by Judge Mr Martin Nolan. The judge said all the men had behaved in a \u201creprehensible manner\u201d and knew that they were doing was wrong. The trio stood accused of doctoring Anglo Irish Bank\u2019s books to make it look like it had \u20ac7.2bn in its accounts. They faced charges of moving money illegally between the Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Life&amp;Permanent. Judge Nolan said the case was one where \u201chonesty and integrity was sorely lacking.\u201d Addressing the role of McAteer in the illegal scheme, Judge Nolan said: \u201cIt is grossly reprehensible what he did and a great shame.\u201d All three men had pleaded not guilty during a trial that has lasted 89 days. During sentencing the judge also singled out the firm Ernst &amp; Young for its role in signing off Anglo Irish Bank\u2019s accounts: \u201cIt beggars belief that Ernst &amp; Young signed off on the accounts. How they signed off on the accounts as true and fair is a mystery to me.\u201d Judge Nolan added: \u201cThey should have known what was occurring if they were doing their job properly.\u201d In 2009 following the global financial crash Anglo Irish Bank was nationalised with the Irish taxpayer having to pay \u20ac30bn to rescue it. The bank was once the preferred bank of builders and property speculators. The sharp practices at the bank during the Celtic Tiger boom when it allowed Irish developers and investors to pay the global property market caused national outrage in Ireland. Here\u2019s our report on the US GDP figures: The US economy grew by just 1.2% from April to June, the US Department of Commerce announced on Friday, as cut backs by businesses wiped out a rise in consumer spending. The lower-than-expected figure is the latest in a series of disappointing economic numbers attributed to growing uncertainty among consumers and businesses, both of whom are keeping a tighter rein on spending. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the US government to report that gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 the broadest measure of the economy\u2019s health \u2013 would increase at a 2.6% annual rate after rising at a rate of 1.1% in the first quarter. The 1.1% figure was revised down to 0.8% on Friday. The economy has now grown at an annual rate of less than 2% for three straight quarters. The full story is here: And here\u2019s a chart showing how US GDP has been revised in the past: Alex Lydall, senior sales trader at foreign exchange business Foenix Partners, also believes a US rate rise is now unlikely this year: Janet Yellen will continue to sit on the fence with interest rates for the foreseeable future on disappointing news this afternoon that US GDP increased to a sluggish 1.2%, on preliminary figures where analysts had expectations of an uplift to 2.6%. Rhetoric from the Federal Reserve lately has been somewhat cautious, meaning the significant miss of growth figures will put the bearish committee members back in the driving seat. With global risk appetite tentative on the back of the EU Referendum results, the global powerhouse of the US is often seen as a precursor to global performance. If these preliminary figures signify a shift on the downside for the domestic economy in the US, not only will rate hikes be unlikely this year, but the benchmark for global risk will be adversely affected in the medium term. The pound is now up 0.5% against the US currency at $1.3232. The dollar has weakened against the euro to $1.1132, a level last seen on 15 July while the yen has also extended its gains against the US currency. Despite a weaker than expected US GDP number, the underlying picture is more mixed, said economist James Smith at ING Bank: The US economy grew by less than expected in the second quarter, growing by just 1.2% quarter on quarter (annualised). That said, the underlying picture is on balance slightly more encouraging than this headline suggests. Consumption in particular was very strong, increasing by 4.2% quarter on quarter(annualised) and follows some solid retail sales data over the past few months. There was also a large drag from inventories, which shaved -1.16% from the headline, which given that this in the most part is simply noise, the underlying growth picture was probably closer to 2% in the second quarter. However, business investment continues to provide some cause for concern...There were also a series of negative backward revisions to overall GDP, suggesting that trend growth has been slightly lower over the past year or so than previously thought. Overall though, this release is probably fairly neutral for the Fed, with strong consumer activity balancing out with the fall in investment. Indeed, with recent evidence tentatively suggesting that the recent shortfall in job creation was a temporary blip and inflation gradually moving in the right direction, there is fairly minimal cause for concern regarding the domestic economic picture. However, the Federal Reserve Open Markets Committee has got its eye firmly on \u201cglobal economic and financial developments\u201d, which we think refers to uncertainty following Brexit and forthcoming political developments in the US and Europe. Thus, whilst the domestic economic picture may be sufficiently strong for another hike, the Fed will likely maintain its current cautious (although broadly positive) stance in September and ahead of the US Presidential Election in November. That said, assuming the domestic economy continues to head in the right direction, then we think there is a strong likelihood of a rate hike in early 2017. We may see FOMC speakers trying to guide markets closer to this point over coming days and weeks. Pointing out the US GDP figures were subject to revision, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, said: The increase in real GDP in the second quarter reflected positive contributions from personal consumption expenditures and exports that were partly offset by negative contributions from private inventory investment, nonresidential fixed investment, residential fixed investment, and state and local government spending. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, decreased. Further mixed signals from the US economy, with second quarter annualised GDP growth coming in at 1.2%, much lower than the 2.6% expected by analysts but up from the 0.8% seen in the first quarter. The figures back up the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision not to raise interest rates this week. And they may not necessarily rule out an increase later in the year although they do seen to make it less likely. Ahead of US GDP data here are the expected openings on US markets: Back with the markets, and European shares are trying to edge higher following the eurozone GDP figures, with Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.37% and France\u2019s Cac climbing 0.07%. But the FTSE 100 has dipped 0.2%, not helped by a near 10% plunge in education group Pearson reported a bigger than expected 7% fall in half year sales and said it would cut 4,000 jobs as part of a restructuring programme. Ahead of the results of the latest European banking stress tests, one of the most troubled of a troubled Italian banking system is seeking a solution to its difficulties: An eleventh hour rescue deal has been tabled for Italy\u2019s Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS), the world\u2019s oldest bank, as investors and pensioners alike brace for the result of an official assessment of its financial health. European regulators release the results of a so-called stress test of MPS, Italy\u2019s third largest bank, and 50 other banks across the EU which are being assessed after the close of US markets on Friday. The results will be closely followed by investors around the world but particularly in Italy, where worse-than-expected news could set off a chain of events that may have drastic consequences for thousands of ordinary Italian investors who bought debt in the bank. The results of the stress tests have already been sent to the banks but will only be made public at 9pm London time. There is concern that an acute banking crisis in Italy, led by troubles at MPS but possibly other banks as well, could ignite European and global banking crises. Ahead of the stress test results, the board of the troubled Italian bank was meeting to weigh up to potential solutions: the last-minute offer received on Thursday night from the former chief executive of Intesa Sanpaolo, Corrado Passsera, and the Swiss bank UBS; and a rescue plan being co-ordinated by JP Morgan and Mediobanca. However, the MPS board is likely to reject the UBS offer, sources told Reuters. The full story is here: Domestic demand in the eurozone is likely to help offset any problems caused by the UK\u2019s Brexit vote, said economist Marco Valli at UniCredit Research: The high volatility of GDP data in the first half of the year probably mainly reflects temporary factors (supportive in the first quarter of 2016, negative in the second quarter), while the underlying growth trend seems to have remained reasonably steady, at least when looking at the most informative survey indicators. Therefore, today\u2019s data do not change the fundamental story. We expect signs of moderate slowdown to emerge in the coming months, mainly reflecting the Brexit fallout via the trade channel and, to a lesser extent, the confidence channel. However, the resilience of eurozone domestic demand on the back of improved fundamentals for consumption and investment is likely to provide a good buffer. The Centre for Economics and Business Research also expects a slowdown in the coming months and warns other measures on top of monetary policy may be needed to support the economy. Managing economist Danae Kyriakopoulou said: Data released today by Eurostat showed that the pace of quarter-on-quarter GDP expansion across the Eurozone slowed to 0.3% during the second quarter of 2016. This confirms Cebr\u2019s view back in April that first quarter\u2019s impressive 0.6% growth was yet another false dawn for the currency bloc. Importantly, today\u2019s release refers to economic growth in the three months to June, ahead of the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU which is widely expected to negatively impact on the currency bloc. Cebr expects growth to weaken further over the remaining quarters of this year and next.... We maintain our view that monetary policy has largely reached its limits in terms of the support it can provide to the recovery and that it needs to be complemented by non-monetary stimulus measures in order to succeed. In that respect, this week\u2019s decision to by-pass the rules of the Stability and Growth pact and not fine Spain and Portugal for breaching the 3% deficit threshold is a welcome move by the European Commission. Further flexibility, leniency, and initiative on other levers of economic policy, particularly among those economies that can afford it, will be key in ensuring a sustainable recovery for the Eurozone going forward. The eurozone GDP figures show the economy is still growing but inflation remains uncomfortably low, says Peter Vanden Houte at ING Bank. And the second quarter growth figure of 0.3% is likely to be revised, he adds: After the strong growth in the first quarter (+0.6%), which was helped by some temporary factors like the mild winter weather, it was no surprise that there would be some pay-back in the second quarter. The disappointing 0% growth in France, largely due to a decline in inventories, was one of the culprits behind the weaker Eurozone growth performance. Bear in mind though, that in a number of big member states, comprising Germany and Italy, GDP figures still have to be published, implying that today\u2019s figure is prone to revision. While no demand components have been published yet, we believe that household consumption remained an important growth driver for the Eurozone, as unemployment continued to fall over the previous quarter. Looking at the European Commission\u2019s sentiment indicators, exports probably didn\u2019t play a major role in second quarter growth, though we still pencil in a positive growth contribution. The third quarter started on a good footing, but it is probably too soon to start downplaying the potential negative impact of Brexit on Eurozone growth. In a separate report the flash HICP inflation estimate was published, showing that headline inflation came out at 0.2% in July, slightly higher than expected. Today\u2019s set of data gives policy makers only limited comfort. The good news is that the economy still has some momentum, though there is little acceleration to be expected as long as the Brexit story continues to inject some uncertainty into the external environment. At the same time, inflation remains uncomfortably low, whilst the ECB\u2019s toolbox is getting emptier. The ECB looks set to remain in a wait-and-see mode, but we can imagine that the pressure to come up with something new will increase again, especially if growth shifts more decisively into a lower gear. The European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is probably pleased that eurozone inflation is creeping up, although it is still far shy of his 2% target. Alex Lydall, senior sales trader at Foenix Partners, said: A subtle smile will likely creep across Mario Draghi\u2019s face this morning as an uplift in eurozone CPI figures for July (0.2%) gives an element of breathing space which perhaps market participants were not expecting. In what is now a post-Brexit era, little has been noted of the impact on the eurozone, rather focus has largely been on the UK, so solid GDP figures this morning and the inflation rise will give hope that the eurozone is (at least) starting this era on an improved status. Negative sentiment is rife and global impacts largely unknown at present, but as Draghi recently pointed out, the initial headwinds have been dealt with efficiently, and the rest remains to be unknown. One step at a time, but for now, measurable success is emanating from the eurozone. Peter Read, co-founder of trading network Pelican, said: ECB President Mario Draghi will be relieved to see the encouraging inflation data released today, which swiftly followed strong numbers from the two pillars of the eurozone, Germany and France. Yet Draghi will know that hitting his own two per cent yearly growth target for the eurozone off the back of strong German and French economies alone will be difficult. Uncertainty about the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU won\u2019t be going away anytime soon, and many observers are now casting nervous looks at the troubled Italian banking sector to see whether the positives from the rest of the continent will be overshadowed by yet another crisis. The eurozone GDP figures do not really include any effects of the Brexit vote, of course. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: After a strong first quarter for eurozone GDP it comes as little surprise that second quarter growth has slowed. The effect of the UK\u2019s Brexit vote hasn\u2019t set in yet, although many will expect numbers to continue to slide. We\u2019ve already seen the Bank of Japan underwhelm the markets this morning with just a modest expansion of its stimulus programme, and it will be the Bank of England\u2019s turn to announce its policy decision next week. These are testing times for central banks all over the world and the markets are looking for swift and strong action. There are also inflation and unemployment figures out from the European Union. Eurozone inflation came in higher than expect in July, up 0.2% from 0.1% in June according to the initial estimate from Eurostat. It said: Looking at the main components of euro area inflation, food, alcohol &amp; tobacco is expected to have the highest annual rate in July (1.4%, compared with 0.9% June), followed by services (1.2%, compared with 1.1% in June), non-energy industrial goods (0.4%, stable compared with June) and energy (-6.6%, compared with -6.4% in June). Meanwhile the eurozone unemployment rate for June came in as expected at 10.1%. Eurostat said: The euro area seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate was 10.1% in June 2016, stable compared to May 2016 and down from 11.0% in June 2015. This remains the lowest rate recorded in the euro area since July 2011. The EU28 unemployment rate was 8.6% in June 2016, stable compared to May 2016 and down from 9.5% in June 2015. This remains the lowest rate recorded in the EU28 since March 2009. In the wider European Union, the 28 member states saw GDP rise by 0.4% quarter on quarter, down from 0.5%. Year on year, EU GDP came in unchanges at 1.8%. The eurozone economy slowed in the second quarter, but performed slightly better than expected. GDP growth came in at 0.3% quarter on quarter, down from 0.6% in the first three months of the year but in line with forecasts. Year on year the rise was 1.6%, down from 1.7% but higher than the expected figure of 1.5%. Oil continues to come under pressure on worries of a supply glut and slowing demand. On Thursday West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - entered bear market territory by falling 20% below its June high. Now Brent crude has followed suit: In the weeks leading up to the EU referendum, UK mortgage approvals fell to their lowest level since May 2015. But lending to consumers rose at its fastest pace for nearly 11 years, according to new Bank of England figures. The Bank said 64,766 mortgages were approved compared with 66,722 in May, below analyst expectations of a figure of 65,650. As for consumer lending, it jumped by 10.3% year on year although this may slow down in the months following the referendum, if the latest drop in consumer confidence is any guide. German retail sales for June seemed to have held up in the run-up to the UK\u2019s referendum. Reuters reports: German retail sales fell by 0.1 percent on the month in June but a stronger-than-forecast yearly rise suggested consumer spending, which is expected to drive growth this year, remains a pillar of support for the economy as foreign trade weakens. The volatile indicator, which is often subject to revision, was in line with expectations in a Reuters poll for a 0.1 percent monthly drop, data from the Federal Statistics Office showed on Friday. The monthly data for May was revised down to a rise of 0.7 from a previously reported increase of 0.9 percent. On the year, annual retail sales in Europe\u2019s largest economy climbed by 2.7 percent in real terms - far more than the 1.3 percent increase forecast by economists in a Reuters poll. France\u2019s economy could weaken further after the Brexit vote, says ING economist Julien Manceaux: French GDP growth slowed to 0.0% in the second quarter. This is in line with expectations that first quarter\u2019s consumption rebound could not last without more signs of higher employment growth. Government actions to boost corporate investment seem to have been less effective in the second quarter while net exports remained the weak spot of the French economy. If employment growth fails to accelerate, the risks materializing from the Brexit shock could lead to further weaknesses in the second half of this year. ...It should be noted that the US and the UK were large contributors to growth last year, which helped limiting the negative net export growth contribution of 2015 to -0.3%. With the Brexit risk materializing and a weaker US dollar, this position will probably deteriorate further in the second half of the year. After the Brexit shock, we have revised our GDP growth forecast downwards to 1.4% in 2016 after 1.2% in 2015, and to 1.1% in 2017. With no room for manoeuvre left as far as reforms are concerned, the French economy can only count upon the stimulus added by recent policies (lowering labour costs and giving investment tax breaks). We think this will not be enough to secure a stronger recovery path before the 2017 Presidential election, especially if employment growth does not accelerate strongly in the near term. But Spain, despite its political troubles, is performing well. ING\u2019s Geoffrey Minne says: Once again, Spanish figures remain strong and GDP growth rate of 3.2% year on year leaves Spain as a solid leader among large Eurozone countries. Looking at the economic situation, nearly everything seems to continue in the right direction...While the detail about GDP components is not available yet, we suspect consumption to be at the heart of the recovery, as households still benefited from the same cocktail of rising real earnings, decreasing unemployment and rebounding housing prices. The second good news of today is that the inflation rate continues to move towards the positive territory. The harmonized CPI went progressively from -1.2% year on year in April to -0.9% in June and -0.6% in July. Looking at the political situation, nearly everything seems to go wrong. After two election rounds, no concrete solution is on the table and even if Rajoy would like to see a government in the beginning of August, it seems unlikely. All in all, political turmoil has barely scratched GDP growth and job creation in the first semester and Spain has appeared more resilient than expected. The effect of Brexit and national political uncertainty can still suddenly come into play but with current tailwinds, GDP growth in 2016 is set to hover around 3%. However until the end of the year, slippages are possible, caused by political events be it in Barcelona or in Madrid. The French GDP figures could be a bad omen for the forthcoming eurozone GDP figures, says Capital Economics: Another warning about the UK property market - London in particular - in the wake of the Brexit vote, this time from estate agency Foxtons. Despite a second election in six months during the second quarter, Spain\u2019s economy still managed to show steady growth. Spain\u2019s GDP rose by 0.7% quarter on quarter between April and June, in line with expectations and up 3.2% year on year. Earlier in the week, Spain avoided a fine from the European Union over its budget deficit and was given an extra two years to achieve a target for its deficit to be no more than 3% of GDP. Portugal was given similar dispensation. Contrary to expectations, the FTSE 100 has fallen in early trading, down 14 points or 0.2%. Barclays is leading the risers, up 4% after its results while British Airways owner International Airlines Group is down nearly 2% after it reported a lower than expected 4.7% rise in second quarter profit and said it no longer expected to grow 2016 profits by \u20ac900m as it had forecast in February. But Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac both opened 0.4% higher. Ahead of the eurozone GDP figures, Unicredit analysts say they expect a modest expansion in the second quarter: After a strong first quarter, GDP growth likely weakened in the second quarter of 2016: we forecast +0.3% quarter on quarter, with risks tilted to the downside. Hard data suggest that private consumption and construction investment slowed substantially, while the trade channel is unlikely to have picked up the slack. On the output side, industrial production lost traction. There are also eurozone inflation and unemployment figures due, while in the UK we get mortgage approvals for June, and in the US, second quarter GDP. Back to the French GDP numbers, and in volume terms growth was flat in the second quarter after a 0.7% rise in the previous three months. Household expenditure fell sharply from 1.2% to flat, while imports dropped by 1.3% and exports declined by 0.3%. Year on year, GDP grew by 1.4% compared to 1.3% previously but below forecasts of a 1.6% increase. And here\u2019s how the French GDP figures break down: Here are the forecasts for the European market open. Meanwhile the Nikkei is currently up 0.56% while the Hang Seng has slipped 0.86%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The eurozone economy will be in the spotlight today with growth figures for the second quarter - the run up to the UK\u2019s Brexit vote - expected to show a slowdown. But bear in mind that UK second quarter GDP ended up being better than forecasts despite the concerns about the referendum. Meanwhile the Bank of Japan has disappointed the market with its latest stimulus package, leaving interest rates at their previous negative level but slightly boosting its stimulus package. Our story is here: Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said the disappointment from the new Japanese measures could put more pressure on Bank of England governor Mark Carney. The B0E is odds on to cut interest rates next week but the scope for an underwhelming result here has increased, said Lawler: The Bank of Japan has eased policy but it hasn\u2019t impressed markets...The Japanese yen has rallied against every major currency following the BOJ announcement, taking USD/JPY down 200 pips to 103. Further declines for another test of the key 100 level appear likely. It was a missed opportunity for the BOJ to have done more at its first meeting after Prime Minister Abe was re-elected with a new mandate to expand Abenomics. Even the Japanese stock market, which is the single biggest beneficiary of the policy change saw shares drop, with the Nikkei choppy before falling nearly 1%. The shift into the yen, typically perceived as a haven asset will have repercussions on demand for risky assets including European stocks. The impact of Japan\u2019s weak monetary stimulus is being interpreted differently across Europe..... Mark Carney has boxed the Bank of England into a corner, with market expectations now 100% that it will cut interest rates in August, primarily because of his \u201cmore monetary easing by summer\u201d comment. The Bank of Japan\u2019s governor Kuroda appears to have felt compelled to act given the weight of expectation but has delivered something underwhelming. Mark Carney might be at risk of doing the same. Back with eurozone GDP and the figures will be scoured for any sign of a Brexit effect. The agenda looks like this: The figures from France are already out and show a flat performance compared to expectations of a 0.2% rise quarter on quarter: More on that in a moment. Also high on the agenda are the results of the latest European banking stress tests, with Italian banks in particular in the spotlight on concerns about their balance sheets and non-performing loans. The report is due out after the close of the US market. Speaking of banks, Barclays has just reported a 10% fall in half year underlying profit. Elsewhere there are updates from British Airways owner International Airlines Group, and there is likely to be more fallout from the last minute delay to the Hinkley Point C nuclear deal with EDF:",

Other committee members have been more restrained in their calls for action, which has drawn a sympathetic response from some economists. . \u201cI think they want to retain bullets,\u201d said Tim Graf, the head of macro-strategy for Europe at State Street Global Markets. \u201cAnd I am not certain given the experience on low rates elsewhere and negative rates elsewhere that they want to go that aggressive in total.\u201d Graf expects the Bank to cut by 25 basis points and \u201cprobably look at something like the funding for lending scheme\u201d. Economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch also expect a cut to 0.25% and some fresh quantitative easing and credit easing measures. They too highlight the limited power of the central bank and the need for fiscal policy. \u201cThe fundamental issue with all the monetary policy tools we can think of is that they are close to pushing on a string,\u201d write economist Robert Wood and strategist Sebastien Cross at the bank. With that in mind, they say the Bank should \u201cdo \u2018too much\u2019, do it early hoping that reduces the need for further stimulus later and do everything in the hope that at least something works\u201d. Carney rebuffs the charge that monetary policy has lost its firepower, but he too has made clear that central banks alone cannot be relied on to shore up the economy and that government action is needed too. While it waits for action from the new government, the Bank faces a difficult balancing act. Cut rates too far and there is a risk of causing damage to the financial sector and savers that would be counterproductive. A drastic move might also spark panic in financial markets, while not cutting at all would deal a serious blow to the Bank\u2019s credibility after it signalled action. What the Bank will hope to do is to lift sentiment, allay jitters about the housing market and so keep that all important driver of the UK economy -consumer spending - going.",

For many years it had been assumed that Bank rate could go no lower than 0.5%, where it has been pegged since the economy was deep in recession in early 2009. Brexit has put paid to that notion. Expect rates to be cut to 0.25%.</p> <p>That, though, is unlikely to be the end of things. The Bank has made it clear that it is considering a \u201cpackage\u201d of measures, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/15/bank-of-england-chief-economist-calls-for-big-post-brexit-stimulus\" title=\"\">Andy Haldane</a>, its chief economist, has talked of the need for a \u201csledgehammer\u201d. A 0.25-point cut in interest rates will not live up to the advance billing.</p> <p>The Bank has a range of other options. It could cut rates even further, to 0.1%. It could use forward guidance to send out a message that interest rates will remain at ultra-low levels for a considerable period to come. It could restart quantitative easing (QE), adding to the \u00a3375bn of government bonds it bought between 2009 and 2012. It could widen the QE programme to include corporate bonds. It could expand its Funding for Lending programme, which led to a marked pick-up in activity when first introduced in the summer of 2012. Or it could come up with some new initiative that nobody is expecting: a twist in the tale that takes the audience by surprise.</p> <p>The Bank has shown in the past that it can make a bold statement. When the economy was collapsing in late 2008, the MPC didn\u2019t tinker around with half-point rate cuts: it slashed them from 4.5% to 3% and continued hacking away until borrowing costs stood at a historic low of 0.5%.</p> <p>Business surveys released since Brexit have nearly all been pretty downbeat but most were conducted in the confused days immediately after the referendum when companies were dumbstruck by the result. There is a possibility that sentiment will have improved as a result of the calmer conditions in the financial markets and the early arrival in Downing Street of Theresa May.</p> <p>But why take the risk? In the current circumstances, the Bank\u2019s job is to demonstrate that it won\u2019t allow the economy to slide into recession through official neglect. A show of shock and awe can buy some time while the government fleshes out its post-Brexit plan.</p> <p>If there is an argument for holding back, it is that more stimulus will be required in the months to come. Thursday will not be the end of the story. As with all the best blockbusters, there will be a sequel.</p> <h2>By any measure, going ahead with Hinkley would be madness</h2> <p>As the UK government readies itself to \u201cconsider carefully all the component parts\u201d of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/28/hinkley-point-c-to-go-ahead-after-edf-board-approves-project\" title=\"\">\u00a318bn Hinkley Point project</a>, it should start with first principles. The nuclear power station, as currently financed, is a threat to the UK\u2019s national energy security. It would be absurdly expensive for UK consumers. And the technology hasn\u2019t been shown to work.</p> <p>Any of those reasons ought to be enough to condemn Hinkley to the bin, to be remembered only as a prize example of successive governments\u2019 craven indulgence of the nuclear lobby. Taken together, they make the case overwhelming: Hinkley is not the answer to the UK\u2019s looming energy crisis.</p> <p>On the national security point, Theresa May should start by reading an excellent analysis by Nick Timothy, her joint chief of staff, published last October. The government is <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2015/10/nick-timothy-the-government-is-selling-our-national-security-to-china.html\" title=\"\">\u201cselling our national security to China\u201d</a>, argued Timothy, noting the alarm of the security services that a Chinese state-backed firm could take a one-third stake in Hinkley as a precursor to building its own nuclear reactor in Bradwell in Essex.</p> <p>Others make the financial point that the former chancellor George Osborne\u2019s grovel for Chinese cash wasn\u2019t merely embarrassing but also baffling. The UK government can currently borrow at 0.7% for 10 years. Why not take advantage of that, rather than play off-balance-sheet games to the benefit of Beijing?</p> <p>The costs of Hinkley are now well known. The UK insulated itself from cost overruns in the construction phase by granting EDF a licence to print money for 35 years. The price of oil, taken as proxy for the cost of wholesale energy, would have to average $150 a barrel, compared with $42 currently, for three decades for Hinkley to represent good value. Yes, nuclear-generated electricity is reliable. But if that is what we want, build smaller and cheaper modular reactors.</p> <p>In any case, \u201creliable\u201d is not a good description of EDF. Its attempts in Finland and Normandy to build Hinkley-style European pressurised reactors (EPRs) are years behind schedule. If you want reliable energy, do not order an EPR from EDF.</p> <p>May, untainted by Osborne\u2019s obsession with Hinkley, has a chance to free the UK from the madness. She must take it.</p> <h2>One signature from Sir Philip is all that is required</h2> <p>Last week hundreds of BHS staff picked up their final paycheques and there were multiple pictures of battered department stores <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/27/bhs-frank-field-calls-on-sfo-to-launch-formal-inquiry-into-demise-philip-green-dominic-chappell\" title=\"\">closing their doors</a> for the last time. They were the starkest possible contrast to the long-lens shots of Sir Philip Green lounging around the Aegean on his new \u00a3100m yacht, Lionheart.</p> <p>Green wasn\u2019t in total relaxation mode. He was busy firing off legal letters to Dominic Chappell, the man who shepherded BHS into administration just a year after buying it from Green for \u00a31, and to Frank Field, the MP who compared Green to the former <em>Mirror</em> publisher and pensions thief Robert Maxwell. Green\u2019s clearly mad as hell about taking the rap for the demise of BHS. He has promised to \u201csort\u201d the \u00a3571m pension scheme hole, and the mounting controversy \u2013 over his billions, his boat and his knighthood while BHS staff face pension cuts \u2013 would recede if he did exactly that. A single cheque is all that is required \u2026</p>",

A 0.25-point cut in interest rates will not live up to the advance billing. The Bank has a range of other options. It could cut rates even further, to 0.1%. It could use forward guidance to send out a message that interest rates will remain at ultra-low levels for a considerable period to come. It could restart quantitative easing (QE), adding to the \u00a3375bn of government bonds it bought between 2009 and 2012. It could widen the QE programme to include corporate bonds. It could expand its Funding for Lending programme, which led to a marked pick-up in activity when first introduced in the summer of 2012. Or it could come up with some new initiative that nobody is expecting: a twist in the tale that takes the audience by surprise. The Bank has shown in the past that it can make a bold statement. When the economy was collapsing in late 2008, the MPC didn\u2019t tinker around with half-point rate cuts: it slashed them from 4.5% to 3% and continued hacking away until borrowing costs stood at a historic low of 0.5%. Business surveys released since Brexit have nearly all been pretty downbeat but most were conducted in the confused days immediately after the referendum when companies were dumbstruck by the result. There is a possibility that sentiment will have improved as a result of the calmer conditions in the financial markets and the early arrival in Downing Street of Theresa May. But why take the risk? In the current circumstances, the Bank\u2019s job is to demonstrate that it won\u2019t allow the economy to slide into recession through official neglect. A show of shock and awe can buy some time while the government fleshes out its post-Brexit plan. If there is an argument for holding back, it is that more stimulus will be required in the months to come. Thursday will not be the end of the story. As with all the best blockbusters, there will be a sequel. By any measure, going ahead with Hinkley would be madness As the UK government readies itself to \u201cconsider carefully all the component parts\u201d of the \u00a318bn Hinkley Point project, it should start with first principles. The nuclear power station, as currently financed, is a threat to the UK\u2019s national energy security. It would be absurdly expensive for UK consumers. And the technology hasn\u2019t been shown to work. Any of those reasons ought to be enough to condemn Hinkley to the bin, to be remembered only as a prize example of successive governments\u2019 craven indulgence of the nuclear lobby. Taken together, they make the case overwhelming: Hinkley is not the answer to the UK\u2019s looming energy crisis. On the national security point, Theresa May should start by reading an excellent analysis by Nick Timothy, her joint chief of staff, published last October. The government is \u201cselling our national security to China\u201d, argued Timothy, noting the alarm of the security services that a Chinese state-backed firm could take a one-third stake in Hinkley as a precursor to building its own nuclear reactor in Bradwell in Essex. Others make the financial point that the former chancellor George Osborne\u2019s grovel for Chinese cash wasn\u2019t merely embarrassing but also baffling. The UK government can currently borrow at 0.7% for 10 years. Why not take advantage of that, rather than play off-balance-sheet games to the benefit of Beijing? The costs of Hinkley are now well known. The UK insulated itself from cost overruns in the construction phase by granting EDF a licence to print money for 35 years. The price of oil, taken as proxy for the cost of wholesale energy, would have to average $150 a barrel, compared with $42 currently, for three decades for Hinkley to represent good value. Yes, nuclear-generated electricity is reliable. But if that is what we want, build smaller and cheaper modular reactors. In any case, \u201creliable\u201d is not a good description of EDF. Its attempts in Finland and Normandy to build Hinkley-style European pressurised reactors (EPRs) are years behind schedule. If you want reliable energy, do not order an EPR from EDF. May, untainted by Osborne\u2019s obsession with Hinkley, has a chance to free the UK from the madness. She must take it. One signature from Sir Philip is all that is required Last week hundreds of BHS staff picked up their final paycheques and there were multiple pictures of battered department stores closing their doors for the last time. They were the starkest possible contrast to the long-lens shots of Sir Philip Green lounging around the Aegean on his new \u00a3100m yacht, Lionheart. Green wasn\u2019t in total relaxation mode. He was busy firing off legal letters to Dominic Chappell, the man who shepherded BHS into administration just a year after buying it from Green for \u00a31, and to Frank Field, the MP who compared Green to the former Mirror publisher and pensions thief Robert Maxwell. Green\u2019s clearly mad as hell about taking the rap for the demise of BHS. He has promised to \u201csort\u201d the \u00a3571m pension scheme hole, and the mounting controversy \u2013 over his billions, his boat and his knighthood while BHS staff face pension cuts \u2013 would recede if he did exactly that. A single cheque is all that is required \u2026",
