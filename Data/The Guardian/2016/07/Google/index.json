There are those who want our exit from the EU to signal that we should now turn our back on the world, resist the free-market forces of globalization and become a more insular, less tolerant place. Similar forces are at work in other Western nations.</p> <p>We must not be afraid to confront them head-on.

                "bodyText":"That\u2019s all for tonight (although I might pop back and add some front pages later). Here\u2019s our latest news story about the markets: Goodnight and thanks for reading and commenting! GW And finally tonight.... America\u2019s stock market has hit a new alltime high, as global markets continue their relief rally. The S&amp;P 500 index closed 7 points higher, or 0.33%, at 2,136.95 points. That narrowly breaches the previous high set in May 2015. Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, reckons that traders are feeling more optimistic about the global economy (after last Friday\u2019s decent US employment report). Paulsen says: \u201cYou have Brexit and global stagnation, but underneath that we keep getting really good economic numbers and that is forcing the (stock) market to new highs.\u201d The tantalising scent of fresh stimulus packages in Britain and Japan soon also worked its usual magic, of course. So, record highs on Wall Street. The London stock market back in bull market territory (thanks to the weak pound) and even Europe shaking off its Brexit fears. Not a bad day, but also not a reason to think the Brexit crisis is over. This chart of the FTSE 250 index of smaller UK companies this year shows how it has scrambled back from the Brexit shock last month (red for down, green for up): Ken Odeluga, market analyst at trading firm City Index, says companies most focused on the UK got the biggest boost today from Theresa May\u2019s rise to the top. We believe \u2018pure-play\u2019 UK equities have rallied on relief that the more pragmatic, less conspicuously ideological and more experienced candidate has emerged as Britain\u2019s next Prime Minster, ahead of difficult and multi-faceted discussions with a wounded and potentially vengeful EU. Investors were pleased to focus on political developments, rather than the Bank of England\u2019s promises to cushion the impact of Brexit. As Odeluga puts it: We note markets shrugged off revolving doors in the Conservative leadership contest and Labour\u2019s failure to open a trapdoor under its own chief. It has taken the withdrawal of the last right-leaning Eurosceptic standing, Andrea Leadsom, to raise an unmistakably positive reaction in the City. There\u2019s real anticipation in the City tonight about whether the Bank of England will cut interest rates to fresh record lows on Thursday. The BoE has already hinted that more stimulus will be needed this summer to help the economy. But given the inflationary impact of a weak pound, it may be reluctant to lower borrowing costs (and weaken sterling further). Kallum Pickering says the Bank could decide to leave its powder dry until August, when governor Mark Carney will present the new quarterly inflation report. He writes: We see a 60% chance that the nine member MPC votes to cut the bank rate, if so, probably by 25 basis points. However, there is a chance that the MPC holds for now, and instead opts to send a dovish signal that the bank will ease monetary policy three weeks later at the August Inflation Report when it is due to publish its revised economic forecasts. The pound is getting a late lift tonight, as Theresa May prepares to become Britain\u2019s next prime minister, on Wednesday afternoon. Sterling is hovering just below $1.30, up half a cent today. Chris Saint, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Currency Service, says: Markets will be hopeful that the prospect of Theresa May becoming Prime Minister will soon bring some clarity to the UK political landscape as well as a more conciliatory approach towards Europe. May has already insisted, though, that \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d, so she\u2019s not hinting at a referendum u-turn... European stock markets have also enjoyed a May-bounce. The STOXX Europe 600 .STOXX closed up 1.6% at 332.72, its highest close since June 23. However it is still 4% below its pre-referendum levels, due to concerns that Brexit will hurt the European economy. The news that Theresa May would replace David Cameron on Wednesday seemed to bring relief to European trading floors. Ankit Gheedia, equity and derivative strategist at BNP Paribas, reckoned that May was a safer pair of hands than Andrea Leadsom (who stepped down from the leadership race today) \u201cThe difference between Theresa May and her counterpart was that she has a disciplined approach and a proper strategy for Brexit. The alternative was uncertain. \u201cWe know she has experience, and is a bit more strategic, so the market is relieved on the back of that.\u201d (Thanks to Reuters for the quotes) Some late newsflashes from Brussels, where eurozone finance ministers have been meeting. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, head of the Eurogroup, says the Brexit vote is hurting eurozone confidence: And European commissioner Pierre Moscovici has revealed that the EC is dialling down its growth forecasts for the UK and the eurozone next year: The global rally in shares today has sent America\u2019s S&amp;P 500 index to a record high today: Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, believes the S&amp;P 500 will keep climbing: So, the S&amp;P 500 is rallying to fresh unchartered territories today. Where do we go from here? Well, the monthly chart suggests onwards and upwards. America\u2019s tech index has hit its highest level of the year: The FTSE 100 burst into Bull Market territory moments before Theresa May was crowned as the new leader of the Conservative Party. May will become prime minister on Wednesday, and investors have welcomed this sudden outbreak of certainty in UK politics. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says shares are also benefiting from expectations of an interest rate cut on Thursday. Here\u2019s his take: \u2018The Footsie has been tipped into a bull market by the emergence of Theresa May as Prime Minister, though the whiff of some loose monetary policy coming from the Bank of England this Thursday probably helped the index over the line too. The role played by the commodity behemoths should not be under-estimated either, these stocks are now trading at much higher prices than in the depths of the market in February. The Tories may be starting to get their house in order, but the stock market has hardly followed in the mould of the one-nation conservatism espoused by the party. There have been very divergent fortunes amongst the big blue chips, with some airlines, house builders and banks being left behind by the rest of the market. Here\u2019s the top risers and fallers on the FTSE 100 tonight: The FTSE 250 used to be the ugly duckling of the City, full of companies not big enough to make the Footsie 100. Now, though, it\u2019s blossomed into everyone\u2019s favourite stock market index (or so it feels, anyway). It\u2019s official! Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index is back in bull market territory. The blue-chip index of the largest firms listed on the London stock market has just closed 92 points higher tonight, at 6682, a gain of 1.4% today. That means the Footsie has risen by over 20% since 11 February, when global investors were fretting about China\u2019s slowing economy tipping the world into recession. That was a simpler time, before Brexit became the word on everyone\u2019s lips and British politics entered a period of remarkable upheaval (which ain\u2019t over yet, judging by events in the Labour party today). Mining firm Anglo American is the biggest gainer, closing 8.5% higher, followed by building supply firm Travis Perkins (up 7.8%). However, this does not mean that Britain\u2019s economy is suddenly rosy. Remember... Most of the FTSE 100 constituents are international companies, so they\u2019re not a good gauge of the UK economy The weak pound drives up their earnings (as the dollars, yen and euros they collect as profits are worth more in sterling terms). The value of these firms has been hit hard by the 10% slump in the value of the pound. The smaller FTSE 250 is still below its pre-referendum levels (despite jumping by over 2% today). Two surveys today have shown that investor confidence has been hit very hard by the Brexit vote (see Moody\u2019s warning here....and also Hargreaves Lansdown\u2019s alarming survey here..). But still, investors will be relieved to see the index up, not down. Chris Beauchamp of IG explains that events in Westminster have boosted confidence in the City. UK politics continues to provide the most compelling TV viewing of the year so far, as Teresa May\u2019s last opponent abandons the field. The bounce in UK mid-caps is more than partly due to hopes that, with Remainer May as PM, talks with Europe may be smoother, while the disappearance of a summer leadership contest has helped clear road ahead for UK equities. Shares in many smaller UK companies are also strongly higher today. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains why: The FTSE250 has also enjoyed a decent bounce, up nearly 3% hitting its highest levels since its plunge from its 23rd June peaks. This removal of one element from the mix of political uncertainty is likely to bring into sharp relief the next stage of the \u201cBrexit\u201d process and in particular the timings of when Article 50 is likely to get triggered. However, the FTSE 250 index is still below its pre-referendum levels, unlike the FTSE 100 (which gets that weak pound boost) Here\u2019s another sign that the Brexit vote has hurt the European economy. A new survey by Moody\u2019s Analytics reports that: Global business confidence has slumped in the wake of the Brexit vote in late June. European sentiment continues to sink and is now consistent with an economy that is on the verge of stalling out. More than one-fourth of the survey responses by European businesses are negative, the highest that has been on a consistent basis since the European debt crisis. Encouragingly, sentiment in the United States and Pacific Rim haven\u2019t been materially impacted by British exit vote. Weak business confidence often leads to lower investment, and less new hiring, so it could be quite damaging.... City traders are pleased that at least some of the political uncertainty sitting over Britain like a heavy fog is lifting. Connor Campbell of Spreadex explains: Theresa May is clearly the market\u2019s preferred choice for Britain\u2019s top job, as evidenced by the reaction that greeted Leadsom\u2019s stand-down statement. May\u2019s lack of interest in rushing to activate Article 50 and her relatively less contentious relationship with the EU when compared to her (now long gone) rivals, as well as the general cheer at the mere fact of the UK once again having a PM, is arguably responsible for the rise from the FTSE and pound, both of which improved on their morning performances. The former jumped by nearly 1%, sitting firmly at 2016 (and indeed 11 month) highs; the latter, meanwhile, managed to climb away from its earlier lows, even if the currency remains haunted by the spectre of a Bank of England rate cut on Thursday. The chancellor is watching events unfold from across the Atlantic, and tweets: The FT reckons that foreign secretary Phillip Hammond could become finance minister in Theresa May\u2019s government.... London shares have extended their gains this afternoon, as Wall Street opened strongly on the back of Friday\u2019s forecast-busting non-farm payrolls. The S&amp;P 500 set a record high, while the Dow was up 92 points, or 0.5 percent, to 18,240 within the first half hour of trading, with banks leading the charge. \u201cReaching a new high may see money moving from the sidelines of safety trades, like Treasury bonds and gold, back into the equity markets,\u201d Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth, told Reuters. \u201cThe emphasis of the markets will be how fast and how long the S&amp;P remains above the record today.\u201d By 3pm, the FTSE 100 had extended its gains to just over 70 points, or 1.1%, at 6664 points. A quick recap: Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index is poised to smash into bull market territory, after being boosted by the weakness of the pound since the Brexit referendum. It has jumped 1% today, meaning it is 20% higher than in February. The smaller FTSE 250 index is also romping higher, on expectations that UK interest rates will be cut to fresh record lows on Thursday. But the pound has been volatile today, as Theresa May moved to the brink of becoming UK prime minister. May has called for a new clampdown on executive pay and predatory capitalism, getting a \u2018better late than never\u2019 welcome from the unions. Film studio Pinewood has declared that it should benefit from the weak pound, as Britain will become a more attractive place to make films. Chancellor George Osborne has landed in America, in an attempt to reassure US investors that they should still invest in Britain. In non-Brexit news: Shares in Nintendo have surged, on the back of the Pokemon Go craze Burberry has ended Chris Bailey\u2019s tenure as CEO, and hired a senior fashion chief Some non-Brexit news.... Fashion chain Burberry have just announced a new chief executive. It\u2019s Marco Gobbetti, currently CEO of fashion chain C\u00e9line. This means that Christopher Bailey, Burberry\u2019s creative mastermind, is moving to become president, after two years as CEO. He\u2019ll be chief creative officer too - but effectively he\u2019s losing day-to-day control of the company It\u2019s not a great surprise; City investors were concerned that Bailey couldn\u2019t do both jobs, especially as trading has deteriorated in recent months. Burberry shares have jumped 6%... Chancellor George Osborne has now landed New York, for his mission to reassure America that Britain is still open for business despite the Brexit vote (as we covered earlier). He\u2019ll be on US TV shortly, in an early-morning treat for America..... Enjoy the pound\u2019s rally while it lasts, says Jake Trask, currency analyst at UKForex. He predicts that sterling will soon weaken again, possibly later this week when the Bank of England announces its interest rate decision \u201cSterling pushed higher today as pro-Brexit candidate Angela Leadsom pulled out of the contest to be the next prime minister. The pound pushed up through $1.30 against the US dollar on the news, but the rally is likely to be short-lived, as Mark Carney is expected to cut interest rates to a record low of 0.25% this Thursday. \u201cShould he decide to cut rates to zero, we will likely see another multi-year low for sterling as we head towards a probable recession in the second half of the year.\u201d Almost every company on the FTSE 250 index of medium-sized UK companies has risen today. Property companies are leading the rally, driving the FTSE 250 up by 2.7% right now. Investment group St. Modwen Properties has jumped 9%, and British housebuilding company Crest Nicholson are up 7.6%. Earlier today, Theresa May identified housebuilding as a key priority if she became prime minister (which now seems an imminent prospect). This graph shows how shares in big companies on the FTSE 100 (red line) have roared back since the referendum, thanks to the slump in the pound. Smaller UK companies are shown on the blue line (the FTSE 250), and Germany\u2019s DAX is the pink line. In exquisite timing, confidence among small investors has hit its lowest level since the heights of the eurozone crisis in 2012 - just as shares keep rallying. Hargreaves Lansdown, the financial services firms, reports that its Investor Confidence Index has suffered its sharpest monthly fall in 5 years. The survey of retail investors took place on 30 June, a week after the EU referendum result, and asked them to give their view of the UK stock market over the next three years. The index fell from 92 points in May to 67 in June; the biggest one month percentage fall since June 2011. The index now stands at a four year low - in May 2012 it stood at a level of 61, as Greece looked like it might be on the brink of leaving the eurozone. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says confidence appears to have \u201ccollapsed\u201d after the Brexit vote, among investors, consumers and businesses. The dwindling faith in the UK\u2019s future financial prospects has the potential to become a self-fulfilling prophecy, if companies and individuals start to assume a bunker mentality, and delay or cancel spending and investment. Investors are naturally twitchy about what Brexit means for the future of the stock market in the coming months and years. However continued low interest rates will remain supportive of shares, not least because there is really nowhere else for investors to go for income. Commercial property is one other option, though we have seen problems that can arise for investors in that market over the last week or so. The pound just put its nose back over the $1.30 mark, on the prospect of Theresa May becoming Britain\u2019s next PM sooner than expected. Britain\u2019s blue-chip FTSE 100 index is smashing into Bull Market territory. The Footsie has jumped by 60 points to 6650, a new 11-month high, as Andrea Leadsom confirms that she is withdrawing from the Tory party leadership battle. Crucially, more than 20% above the 5,537 level hit in mid-February, when markets had been driven down by fears over the global economy. So if it closes there tonight, the Footsie will be in bull market territory. Mining stocks are leading today\u2019s rally, with Anglo American up 5%. UK building companies are also sharply higher; Taylor Wimpey and Persimmon have both gained 6%. The usual provisos apply; the FTSE 100 is priced in sterling (which is worth 10% less than last month). And it is dominated by international firms, not UK ones. The smaller FTSE 250 is still 5% below its pre-referendum levels, following a 2% jump this morning. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says investors are expecting the Bank of England to ease monetary policy on Thursday. Last Friday\u2019s upbeat US employment report is also cheering the City. Mahony adds: Amid a sea of green in the FTSE, it is interesting to see the housebuilders and banks gaining heavily, in what has become a proxy for risk appetite across financial markets. There is no doubt that the housebuilders and banks are currently a risky play, given the severity of their recent devaluation. However, in days when the market is in the green, the performance of these sectors will reflect how far reaching that optimism really is. The pound is suddenly jumping, clawing back most of today\u2019s losses, as rumours sweep Westminster that Andrea Leadsom is about to quit the Tory leadership race. Caution is needed, as it\u2019s only at a three-hour high.... Maybe traders aren\u2019t sure what happens next. And they\u2019re not alone... Our politics liveblog have full coverage of Theresa May\u2019s speech: Theresa May, one of the two candidates to replace Cameron, is preaching a progressive message this morning. May is arguing that ordinary families need more help. Wages have only grown slowly, energy bills have rocketed, and monetary stimulus measures have helped those on the property ladder - but not those who can\u2019t [who wrote this speech, Ed Miliband?]. May is also promising a crackdown on executive pay, giving workers more power, and improving UK productivity. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says it\u2019s better late than never.... \u201cThe TUC has long argued for workers to be given seats on company boards and remuneration committees. Workers have a clear interest in the long-term success of their companies and deserve a bigger say. \u201cThis move would inject a much-needed dose of reality into boardrooms, as well as putting the brakes on the multi-million pay and bonus packages which have done so much to damage the reputation of corporate Britain. \u201cIf politicians are serious about making chief executives more accountable this is a common sense approach. I stand ready to meet Theresa May to discuss these proposals.\u201d David Cameron also told the Farnborough Airshow that it is in Britain\u2019s \u201cfundamental interest\u201d to remain very close to the EU. Prime minister David Cameron is urging Britain to use the Brexit vote to tackle the country\u2019s productivity problems. Speaking at the Farnborough Air Show, Cameron calls for a \u201cmassive national effort\u201d to build a strong dynamic economy.. He points out that output per hour in the UK is lower than US, Germany or France, and cites high speed rail, superfast broadband and housebuilding as key infrastructure areas to work on. Now we are leaving the EU, Britain must rapidly explore all possible supply-side reforms, such as tax reforms, Cameron continues. And he\u2019s singling out pharmaceuticals, life sciences, technology, and fintech as important areas where Britain can lead the world. One problem, of course... Cameron won\u2019t be in power in two month\u2019s time. So for all his talk about the \u201cground work\u201d being underway, his successor must actually do the heavy lifting.... The AFP newswire have a good take on George Osborne\u2019s trip to America: British finance minister George Osborne was Monday holding talks with Wall Street investors, kicking-off a series of visits to leading international financial centres to build post-Brexit economic ties. \u201cVital work will begin today on building stronger economic and trade relationships with the UK\u2019s closest trading partners,\u201d the Treasury said in a statement as Chancellor of the Exchequer Osborne headed to New York to meet investors on Wall Street. And Osborne will next week lead a trade mission to Singapore and China after Britain last month voted in a referendum to exit the European Union, the Treasury added. \u201cWhile Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU clearly presents economic challenges, we now have to do everything we can to make the UK the most attractive place in the world to do business,\u201d Osborne, who voted for Britain to remain in the EU, said in the statement. \u201cWe will continue to be a beacon for free trade, democracy and security, more open to that world than ever.\u201d They also point out that the UK is considering easing the tax bill on companies: Following the Brexit vote, Osborne is planning to slash corporation tax over fears of an exodus by big business. According to the Treasury, he could extend planned cuts to Britain\u2019s levy on company profits to under 15 percent. Prior to the vote, the tax rate on corporate profits was already set to be cut from 20 percent to 19 next year and to 17 percent in 2020. Britain\u2019s business minister Sajid Javid on Friday held post-Brexit talks on the country\u2019s future trade relationship with India, the first of many such discussions he plans with world powers. Britain is left with the huge task of forging fresh trade agreements with individual countries as a non-bloc member. Javid has said that the British government, which will soon be led by a new prime minister after the post-Brexit vote resignation of David Cameron, plans to have up to 300 specialist staff by the end of the year to aid in the new trade negotiations. The jump in the FTSE 100 doesn\u2019t tell us much about the UK economy, except that it may trigger bonus payments to chief executives.... Japanese bank Nomura are predicting that sterling could hit a new 31-year low by Friday: The pound may be losing its shock value... Neil Wilson, markets analyst at ETX Capital, confirms that the prospect of fresh stimulus from the Bank of England is driving shares up (and the pound down) The prospect of looser monetary will help equities but it\u2019s another nail in sterling\u2019s coffin. Homebuilders, which rallied on Friday after a turbulent week, are on the up again today. Miners are also rising again as investors price in an interest rate cut. Encouragingly for UK firms, the FTSE 250 is trading up 1%, beating the FTSE 100\u2019s 0.5% rise. European markets are up across the board as they react to Friday\u2019s upbeat jobs report from the US, which spurred the Dow to a 1% gain and saw the S&amp;P 500 close within one point of its record high. Asian stock markets have now closed at one-month highs. Traders are betting that Japanese PM Shinzo Abe can now implement new structural reforms to make the economy more productive, having won a key election victory over the weekend. British film studio Pinewood has emerged as one of the winners from the Brexit vote. The company told shareholders this morning that the 10% tumble in the pound since the referendum was good for business. It said: The result of the UK\u2019s referendum on membership of the EU is now known. In the context of our business, the decline in the \u00a3sterling exchange rate is undoubtedly positive for our international customers. We will continue to monitor sentiment around the issue going forward. Pinewood has played a vital role in the UK film industry for decades. Everything from the Carry On and Pink Panther series to James Bond and the later Harry Potter films were produced at its sites. Maybe they\u2019ll make Brexit, The Movie one day too (rating PG). There were astonishing scenes on the Tokyo stock market today, as shares in console maker Nintendo surged by 25% following the runaway success of the new Pok\u00e9mon Go game. It\u2019s particularly notable, as Nintento is only indirectly linked to the game (which has sent users racing around, squinting into their phones, looking for the monsters) Sterling is weakening this morning, down over half a percent against the US dollar at $1.288. That underlines how the City expect a UK interest rate cut this week. Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit is confident that the Bank of England will do something this week: City investors are expecting the Bank of England to cut interest rates to fresh record lows on Thursday, to fight the dangers of recession following the Brexit vote. Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct says this is helping to drive shares up in London today: London\u2019s FTSE-100 is starting the week with some solid gains as Friday\u2019s upbeat unemployment data from the US and hopes of further stimulus measures out of Japan continue to buoy sentiment. There\u2019s also the spectre of a rate cut and further QE being unveiled at the Bank of England later in the week which is again delivering some cause for cheer and gains are eye-catchingly broad-based as a result. European stock markets have jumped in early trading, as last Friday\u2019s knockout US jobs report continues to cheer the City. In London, the FTSE 100 has risen by 45 points, or +0.7%, at 6636. That\u2019s the highest level since mid-August. Mining companies, banks, and UK housebuilders are the top risers, suggesting trader are less worried about the global economy and a UK recession. The FTSE 100 isn\u2019t the best gauge of the UK economy, as it is full of international companies whose overseas earnings are boosted by the weak pound. And also... the index is valued in sterling (so it\u2019s not at an 11-month high in US dollar terms). Encouragingly, the FTSE 250 index is up 0.7% this morning too. It contains more UK companies than the blue-chip FTSE 100. Top risers include retail chain Sports Direct and bank Virgin Money. Other European markets are also in the green: George Osborne may get a rough ride as he tries to woo America\u2019s top politicians and financiers this week: Bloomberg\u2019s reckons he faces a \u2018tall order\u2019 to persuade the US that all is well in the UK: He\u2019ll be mounting a public relations exercise at a time when the pound has slumped to a 31-year low against the U.S. dollar and real-estate funds are beingfrozen to avoid fire sales. Further undermining sentiment in the country is the two-month wait to discover the identity of the next prime minister, and discord gripping the opposition Labour Party. There\u2019s also no guarantee that Osborne will have high office once his close ally, David Cameron, has been replaced by either Theresa May or Andrea Leadsom. UK chancellor George Osborne is urging international investors not to give up on Britain, as the fallout from the EU referendum continues to hit the global economy. Osborne is flying to New York today, to meet with top Wall Street bankers. And his message is that Britain is not \u201cquitting the world\u201d, even though it has voted to leave the European Union. He has set the scene with an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal this morning, arguing that Britain will still play a key role on the world stage. Quitting the EU (something Osborne campaigned in vain against) must mean closer links with the rest of the world, starting with America. He writes: \u200eThe question now is not what Britain is leaving; it is what Britain will become. There are those who want our exit from the EU to signal that we should now turn our back on the world, resist the free-market forces of globalization and become a more insular, less tolerant place. Similar forces are at work in other Western nations. We must not be afraid to confront them head-on. I am determined that \u2014 on the contrary \u2014 we now set out to build a more outward-looking, global-facing Britain, with stronger links with its friends and allies around the world. That must start with a closer economic relationship with North America. President Obama had warned that Britain would be at the \u2018back of the queue\u2019 for a trade deal. Osborne, though, hopes we can squeeze our way to the front. For first time in 40 years, the U.K. will be setting its own trade terms. So we should begin the conversation now with the U.S., and with the members of the North American Free Trade Agreement, about how we can deliver even closer economic ties. I have spoken to House Speaker Paul Ryan several times in the past two weeks about a stronger trading relationship\u2014and this week I will welcome Treasury Secretary Jack Lew to London to see what more we can do together. It is now in the overwhelming interest of both countries to do so. We are each other\u2019s largest investors, with almost $1 trillion invested in each other\u2019s economies. U.S. investment in the U.K. is around 10 times U.S. investment in China; British investment in the U.S. is around 50 times Chinese investment in the U.S. And that \u2018special relationship\u2019 with the US needs strengthening: Our economic trade ties with North America must now become stronger. My message is simple: Britain may be leaving the EU, but we are not withdrawing from the world. Britain will be a beacon for free trade, democracy and security, more open to that world than ever. Here\u2019s the full piece: WSJ: Britain Is Open for Business Osborne\u2019s mission makes sense; this would be an awful time for US companies to pull investment out of the UK. But he\u2019d better expect some tough questions about Britain\u2019s plans for Brexit, the Tory leadership battle, and the prospects for the pound.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. At first glance, all looks calm this morning. Asia\u2019s stock markets have hit a one-month high overnight after Japan\u2019s prime minister romped to election victory, potentially paving the way for constitutional changes and perhaps more stimulus measures. Investors are still feeling a warm glow after last Friday\u2019s US employment report, which showed many more jobs were created last month than expected. But beneath the surface, nasty things are lurking. The Brexit vote continues to dominate the UK, although we could be in limbo until Conservative Party members have appointed our next prime minister. And worries are mounting about Italy\u2019s banks, after Deutsche Bank AG\u2019s chief economist predicted that the sector may need a \u20ac150bn bailout. David Folkerts-Landau told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper that: \u201cEurope is extremely sick and must start dealing with its problems extremely quickly, or else there may be an accident. I\u2019m no doomsday prophet, I am a realist.\u201d Also coming up today.... UK chancellor George Osborne is meeting with US financial chiefs on Wall Street Eurozone finance ministers will hold a eurogroup meeting in Brussels this afternoon It\u2019s the Farnborough Airshow We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

                "bodyText":"Investors are still trying to catch some of the runaway success of Pok\u00e9mon Go, extending the gain for Nintendo shares to more than 50% in three trading days since the game was launched. Nintendo\u2019s shares rose 12.8% to \u00a522,860 in Tokyo on Tuesday, taking total gains in the past three days to 53%. The rise has added \u00a37bn to the company\u2019s market value since the latest version of its 21-year-old game was made available on 7 July. Pok\u00e9mon Go is the first edition of the game \u2013 whose slogan is \u201cgotta catch \u2018em all\u201d \u2013 for mobile phones and lets players apprehend the eponymous monsters using their smartphone cameras. It has turned Nintendo from a reluctant adopter of mobile gaming to an augmented reality trailblazer that has taken gaming off the sofa and into uncharted territory. Nintendo is only indirectly involved with the game but it owns 33% of the Pok\u00e9mon company, which holds the Pok\u00e9mon franchise and develops the main series of games, and it has a stake in Niantic, the former Google subsidiary that developed Pok\u00e9mon Go. The game is free but it makes money by tempting people to buy extra Pok\u00e9Balls and other in-app features \u2013 and the signs are that it is highly compulsive. So far, Pok\u00e9mon Go is officially available only in the US, Australia and New Zealand. It immediately became the top free app in the US and was so popular on launch day that the servers briefly failed. The app has been downloaded more than 5m times on Android and has overtaken dating service Tinder for active users. It is also rapidly approaching the daily active Android users of Twitter. With servers still under strain, its introduction to the UK and other countries has been delayed. Android users have taken to \u201csideloading\u201d the game, letting them get around Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s staged rollout but criminals have already produced malware-infected versions that, once installed, give hackers access to the user\u2019s phone and information. In further evidence of the underworld capitalising on the craze, armed robbers used it to lure victims to an isolated trap in Missouri on Sunday. People in the US have also been injured chasing monsters into hazardous spots and, on Friday, a teenager found a dead body while playing the game. There was also a report of how the game led some players to a Hells Angels club. These problems, along with the fickle nature of gamers, have caused analysts to warn that the bonanza could prove short-lived. Michael Pachter, an analyst at the stockbroker Wedbush Securities, told Bloomberg News: \u201cThe game requires couch potatoes to get off the couch, and the novelty will wear off when they get tired or when their phone batteries die. I give this four months at the top of the charts, then it will fade.\u201d Nintendo, whose other famous characters include Super Mario Bros, came late to mobile gaming as it sought to protect its console business.

There is definitely a different approach and strategy within NCS and the other YouTube-based companies [compared with] the traditional music industry. They have completely opposite approaches in how to utilise YouTube and other digital platforms.\u201d</p> <p>Working hand-in-hand with NCS is AEI Group, which has invested in the company and provides infrastructure for it. They both operate under this new way of thinking that cuts free from the traditional approaches that they feel limits the new industry. Diluk Dias, MD of AEI Group, believes YouTube is a godsend.

For example, the track features in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUMPwByVpww\">a video made by tech channel TechRax</a>, in which someone drops an iPhone into a lava lamp.

We put links to Spotify and iTunes in there and it got to 30m plays on Spotify fairly quickly. It was also doing a few thousand downloads a week on iTunes. We were not concerned about the monetisation [of use on other YouTube videos].\u201d</p> <p> The track is now on 405m streams on Spotify which means, based on its average per-stream rate of $.0007, it would have generated roughly $2.8m (\u00a32.1m) in songwriting and recorded music royalties. YouTube was seen as pivotal in promoting the track and the thinking is that, without it, it would never have taken off on Spotify.</p> <p> With its expansive reach and helpful data, YouTube is, in Dias\u2019 eyes, more powerful than radio \u2013 which the music industry still sees as the kingmaker for hits.</p> <p> \u201cRadio is now almost the last place [we go to],\u201d he says of how his own company\u2019s promotional strategies and priorities have changed. \u201cBy the time you have built the record on streaming services and on YouTube, it\u2019s already a hit and is already making money for you.

The assault on YouTube is more political than is being let on, he says.</p> <p> \u201cWith all the major label contracts coming up for renegotiation it makes absolute sense [to attack it],\u201d Gaster explains. \u201cThese are huge businesses run by intelligent people and as much as it\u2019s a mud-slinging exercise at the moment, I am hopeful they will reach a middle ground where artists are being [properly] remunerated and YouTube continues to grow its platform and its offerings to artists. YouTube has given us and many independent artists an audience and an opportunity to build a brand. That\u2019s allowed us to exercise a business that goes far beyond what\u2019s on YouTube.\u201d</p> <p> None of this is likely to change the minds of the major labels, major publishers and the \u201c1%\u201d of pop stars such as Paul McCartney, Elton John and Taylor Swift, who are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/13/taylor-swift-youtube-music-royalties-battle\">steadfast in their belief</a> that YouTube must be taken to task. But while their status means they dominate the headlines, their stance does not reflect the industry as a whole. Besides, the music business has never been completely united on any industry change, and YouTube is no exception. </p>",

We put links to Spotify and iTunes in there and it got to 30m plays on Spotify fairly quickly. It was also doing a few thousand downloads a week on iTunes. We were not concerned about the monetisation [of use on other YouTube videos].\u201d The track is now on 405m streams on Spotify which means, based on its average per-stream rate of $.0007, it would have generated roughly $2.8m (\u00a32.1m) in songwriting and recorded music royalties. YouTube was seen as pivotal in promoting the track and the thinking is that, without it, it would never have taken off on Spotify. With its expansive reach and helpful data, YouTube is, in Dias\u2019 eyes, more powerful than radio \u2013 which the music industry still sees as the kingmaker for hits. \u201cRadio is now almost the last place [we go to],\u201d he says of how his own company\u2019s promotional strategies and priorities have changed. \u201cBy the time you have built the record on streaming services and on YouTube, it\u2019s already a hit and is already making money for you. For me that is hugely exciting.\u201d James Gaster is the founder of Mahogany Sessions, a YouTube channel designed to showcase and break new acts. He believes YouTube has allowed his business to exist but also get to a point where it is big enough to attract brands and sponsors who will help bankroll what they do. The assault on YouTube is more political than is being let on, he says. \u201cWith all the major label contracts coming up for renegotiation it makes absolute sense [to attack it],\u201d Gaster explains. \u201cThese are huge businesses run by intelligent people and as much as it\u2019s a mud-slinging exercise at the moment, I am hopeful they will reach a middle ground where artists are being [properly] remunerated and YouTube continues to grow its platform and its offerings to artists. YouTube has given us and many independent artists an audience and an opportunity to build a brand. That\u2019s allowed us to exercise a business that goes far beyond what\u2019s on YouTube.\u201d None of this is likely to change the minds of the major labels, major publishers and the \u201c1%\u201d of pop stars such as Paul McCartney, Elton John and Taylor Swift, who are steadfast in their belief that YouTube must be taken to task. But while their status means they dominate the headlines, their stance does not reflect the industry as a whole. Besides, the music business has never been completely united on any industry change, and YouTube is no exception.",

Vestager said the size of the total penalty reflected the large market involved and the long duration of the collusive behaviour. The highest previous fine for collusion between companies was \u20ac1.4bn imposed on a TV and computer monitor tubes cartel in 2012. Volkswagen-owned Scania, of Sweden, is still under investigation after not taking part in the settlement following the announcement of the commission\u2019s investigation in November 2014. Rachel Adcox, a partner at US law firm Axinn Veltrop &amp; Harkrider, said: \u201cThese are large companies in an industry that generates significant revenues. The striking thing is the period of time over which the cartel is alleged to have taken place.\u201d Adcox said it was not surprising that cartel members conducted their activities by email given that such communications are traceable. \u201cIt\u2019s more common than you would think \u2026 Email has become an important tool for investigators because evidence of a cartel from even 10 or 15 years ago can be recovered,\u201d she said. Vestager said the 30m trucks on European roads make up three-quarters of the inland transport of goods and that it is important for the economy that there is competition between manufacturers. \u201cWe have today put down a marker by imposing record fines for a serious infringement. It is not acceptable that MAN, Volvo/Renault, Daimler, Iveco and DAF were part of a cartel instead of competing with each other. For 14 years, they colluded on the pricing and on passing on the costs for meeting environmental standards to customers. This is also a clear message to companies that cartels are not accepted.\u201d The commission said it found no link between the cartel and the use of defeat devices to manipulate emissions tests. Volkswagen admitted last year that it had used the devices to under-report emissions from its diesel vehicles in tests. Customers will be able to bring civil claims for damages against the companies in national courts. The commission\u2019s antitrust directive, which must take effect by the end of 2016, is designed to make it easier for victims of anti-competitive behaviour to receive damages.",

And the more we think about it the more likely and sensible it is for others to run the rule over this.\u201d",
