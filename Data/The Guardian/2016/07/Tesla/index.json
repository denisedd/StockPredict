Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>An unsurprisingly indecisive session in Europe has seen the likes of the FTSE largely flatlining as traders reduced their risk overnight ahead of the week\u2019s risk event from the Bank of Japan. Commodities have enjoyed a particularly volatile second half of this week, with crude continuing to tumble heavily on a global supply glut alongside evidence that fund managers are heavily shorting crude prices.</p> <p>Tonight\u2019s Bank of Japan meeting has been the focal point of the week despite yesterday\u2019s Fed announcement. One of the main reasons for the post-referendum rally has been the promise of easing from the likes of the ECB, Bank of England and Bank of Japan. With the overnight index swap markets rating the chance of a Bank of England rate cut at 100% next week, it seems like a matter of time until we see some sort of action. However, given that we have seen the post-referendum rally stall after weeks of inaction in Europe, there is a feeling that the FTSE is waiting for some form of stimulus to spark another leg higher.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-579a1633e4b00eff095cd6b2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/larryelliott\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-28T15:00:44.544Z\">4.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The IMF has been criticised for its handling of the eurozone crisis...by the IMF.

That compares to 0.2% growth in the first quarter, and analyst expectations of a 0.3% increase. Year on year, the economy grew by 1.4%. Economist Peter Vanden Houte at ING Bank said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs the negative impact of the March 22 terrorist attacks in Brussels on hotels, catering and retail trade amounted to about \u20ac180m for the first half of this year. This probably shaved off around 0.1 percentage points from second quarter GDP growth. On top of that, the second quarter saw a rather tense social climate, with several strikes, most notably in public transport. This also weighed on growth.</p> <p>While the GDP components have not been published yet, the improvement in sentiment in industry seems to point to a positive contribution from investment and export. Residential construction most likely also contributed positively. With the situation on the labour market continuing to improve, consumption has probably also expanded, though some negative impact of the terrorist attacks seems likely.</p> <p>All in all today\u2019s figure seems hopeful, as it confirms that the Belgian economy still has some underlying momentum, putting in a strong performance despite the terrorist attacks and the strikes. Certainly, with Brexit and potentially a somewhat tighter fiscal policy, there are new headwinds that might hamper growth in the second half, but we believe that even then a quarterly growth pace of around 0.2% to 0.3% should be feasible. We will await further data confirmation in the coming weeks, but on the back of today\u2019s figures we are likely to have to revise our estimate for Belgian GDP growth upwards to 1.4% (from 1.2%).</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-579a0704e4b00eff095cd670\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-28T13:30:24.728Z\">2.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Earlier, US jobless claims rose by more than expected last week, according to the Labor Department.</strong></p> <p>The number of Americans claiming unemployment benefits grew by 14,000 to 266,000, compared to expectations of an increase to 260,000.

                "bodyText":"After the Federal Reserve kept US interest rates on hold and ahead of a decision by the Bank of Japan, stock markets fell back after their recent highs. Falling oil prices and disappointing results from the likes of Royal Dutch Shell and Lloyds Banking Group also hit sentiment. Investors were nervous ahead of the European bank stress test results due on late on Friday. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 29.37 points or 0.44% at 6721.06 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.43% to 10,274.93 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.59% at 4420.58 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 2.02% to 16,522.64 on worries about the country\u2019s banks ahead of the stress tests Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 2.1% lower at 8479.2 In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.11% to 562.84 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 72 points or 0.4%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Markets are in wait and see mode ahead of the Bank of Japan rate decision later, but oil continues to fall on renewed worries about oversupply and weak demand. West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark has now fallen 20% since its June highs, indicating a bear market. Meanwhile in the UK the FTSE 100 is down just 7 points while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is 74 points lower after the Federal Reserve kept US interest rates on hold but hinted at possible rises later in the year. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: An unsurprisingly indecisive session in Europe has seen the likes of the FTSE largely flatlining as traders reduced their risk overnight ahead of the week\u2019s risk event from the Bank of Japan. Commodities have enjoyed a particularly volatile second half of this week, with crude continuing to tumble heavily on a global supply glut alongside evidence that fund managers are heavily shorting crude prices. Tonight\u2019s Bank of Japan meeting has been the focal point of the week despite yesterday\u2019s Fed announcement. One of the main reasons for the post-referendum rally has been the promise of easing from the likes of the ECB, Bank of England and Bank of Japan. With the overnight index swap markets rating the chance of a Bank of England rate cut at 100% next week, it seems like a matter of time until we see some sort of action. However, given that we have seen the post-referendum rally stall after weeks of inaction in Europe, there is a feeling that the FTSE is waiting for some form of stimulus to spark another leg higher. The IMF has been criticised for its handling of the eurozone crisis...by the IMF. Larry Elliott reports: The IMF\u2019s handling of the financial crisis in the eurozone has been criticised by the organisation\u2019s own independent watchdog in a report that says the fund failed to spot the scale of the problem, was guilty of over-optimistic forecasts and left the impression that it was treating Europe differently. While accepting that sorting out the problems of Greece, Ireland and Portugal \u201cposed extraordinary challenges\u201d, the IMF\u2019s Independent Evaluation Office (IEO) said the fund had missed the buildup of banking system risks in some countries and shared the widely held \u201cEurope is different\u201d mindset. The report looked into how the IMF handled the eurozone crisis, which began with the May 2010 bailout of Greece, but subsequently spread to Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus. It found that the \u201cIMF\u2019s pre-crisis surveillance identified the right issues but did not foresee the magnitude of the risks that would later become paramount\u201d. The full story is here: The vast majority of Irish small to medium enterprises believe Brexit is a threat to their business, writes Henry McDonald in Dublin: A survey released today by the British-Irish Chamber of Commence found that out of 400 Irish SMEs 262 of them see Brexit as a threat with far fewer envisaging the post-EU future as an opportunity The research also polled 88 British SMEs who do major business in Ireland. John McGrane, the Director General of the Chamber stressed that the Irish SME sector, which is the largest part of the Republic\u2019s economy, still see the UK as key to their business despite Britain leaving the EU. McGrane said the uncertainty within Irish SME\u2019s over what to do next after the Brexit vote required \u201cjoined up support\u201d from both the Irish and British government and their relevant agencies. He added: \u201cBusiness wants collaborative thinking and the Chamber stands ready to support its members, and Government, to continue to protect and grow the deep trade linkages between the UK and Ireland. We\u2019re ready to join up with likeminded agencies and organisations to ensure all businesses get the most joined-up supports they need to confront the uncertainties, and opportunities, ahead.\u201d The survey was conducted over the weeks following the EU referendum. The expectation of an interest rate cut by the Bank of England continues to put pressure on sterling. The pound has fallen 1% against the euro, hitting a two week low of 84.48p a euro. Against the dollar it is currently down 0.58% at $1.3142. Back with Brexit, and ratings agency S&amp;P Global says the decision to leave the European Union should have little impact on the UK\u2019s project finance initiative. It said: We analyse the effect of Brexit on our U.K. portfolio of over 50 rated transactions, in particular the potential repercussions of a higher inflationary environment, weaker economic growth, and the change in the credit quality of revenues and financial counterparties. While we believe that the risks of adverse economic developments in the U.K. have increased, we expect U.K. private finance initiative (PFI) projects will maintain their credit strength. A day after the US Federal Reserve kept interest rates on hold but suggested there could be a possible hike later this year, US stock markets have slipped lower in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 44 points or 0.22%, while the S&amp;P 500 has slipped 0.29% and Nasdaq 0.14%. Ahead of eurozone GDP figures on Friday, new data from Belgium has shown the country\u2019s economy growing by 0.5% quarter on quarter, despite terrorist attacks and strikes. That compares to 0.2% growth in the first quarter, and analyst expectations of a 0.3% increase. Year on year, the economy grew by 1.4%. Economist Peter Vanden Houte at ING Bank said: According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs the negative impact of the March 22 terrorist attacks in Brussels on hotels, catering and retail trade amounted to about \u20ac180m for the first half of this year. This probably shaved off around 0.1 percentage points from second quarter GDP growth. On top of that, the second quarter saw a rather tense social climate, with several strikes, most notably in public transport. This also weighed on growth. While the GDP components have not been published yet, the improvement in sentiment in industry seems to point to a positive contribution from investment and export. Residential construction most likely also contributed positively. With the situation on the labour market continuing to improve, consumption has probably also expanded, though some negative impact of the terrorist attacks seems likely. All in all today\u2019s figure seems hopeful, as it confirms that the Belgian economy still has some underlying momentum, putting in a strong performance despite the terrorist attacks and the strikes. Certainly, with Brexit and potentially a somewhat tighter fiscal policy, there are new headwinds that might hamper growth in the second half, but we believe that even then a quarterly growth pace of around 0.2% to 0.3% should be feasible. We will await further data confirmation in the coming weeks, but on the back of today\u2019s figures we are likely to have to revise our estimate for Belgian GDP growth upwards to 1.4% (from 1.2%). Earlier, US jobless claims rose by more than expected last week, according to the Labor Department. The number of Americans claiming unemployment benefits grew by 14,000 to 266,000, compared to expectations of an increase to 260,000. The previous week\u2019s level was revised down by 1,000 to 252,000. Weekly claims have been below 300,000, which is seen as a sign of a healthy labour market, for 73 consecutive weeks. Over in Paris, an EDF board member has resigned shortly before the energy company announce whether it will push on with plans to build a new nuclear plant at Britain\u2019s Hinkley Point. Gerard Magnin said the project was risky, and would undermine France\u2019s efforts to develop renewable energy technology. Magnin\u2019s resignation may be a sign that EDF will stick with Hinkley. An announcement is expected later today. Over in America, tech giant Oracle has swooped on cloud computing pioneer NetSuite in a $9.3bn deal. The deal should boost Oracle\u2019s web services offering; its founder, Larry Ellison, is also NetSuite\u2019s largest shareholder. Newsflash from Germany: the country\u2019s inflation rate has jumped to 0.4% this month, up from 0.2% in June. That\u2019s the highest level since January, which should pleas the European Central Bank in its battle to ward off deflation. The overall eurozone inflation reading is due at 10am BST tomorrow. Alex Stubb, Finlands\u2019s former prime minister and finance minister, has warned that it will take a long time for the Brexit drama to play out. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, Stubb said Europe was facing one of its biggest events in decades. It\u2019s a 1952 moment, when the Coal and Steel Community was created, or 1989 when the Cold War ended. This is huge for Europe, there\u2019s no denying it. Stubb, a veteran of the eurozone debt crisis, says Europe is following its usual three-stage approach to Brexit \u2013 first crisis, then chaos, and finally a sub-optimal solution. He adds: It\u2019s going to be a long, long process. What we get at the end of the day, I don\u2019t know. Eurozone companies have defied the fall in consumer confidence, and are actually a little more optimistic this month. The EC\u2019s economic sentiment indicator has risen to 104.6 in July from 104.4 in June. Anna Zabrodzka, economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, says it shows \u201cresilience\u201d to the Brexit vote. Other persistent worries such as the slowing Chinese economy, the immigration wave, and continued tensions with Russia also seem to made little impact on the confidence of consumers and businesses in the euro area. However, risks are skewed to the downside.\u201d Consumer confidence across Europe has fallen this month, driven by a sharp slump in the UK. That\u2019s according to the European Commission\u2019s monthly healthcheck on consumer morale, which fell to -7.9 this month from -7.2 in June. UK consumer confidence, which had been riding relatively high, took a real tumble: The dramatic events of the last few weeks have sent some of us staggering towards the drinks cabinet. But Diageo, the UK-based alcoholic beverages giant, is worried that the Brexit vote may hit sales of its whisky brands overseas, once Britain leaves the EU. Ivan Menezes, chief executive of Diageo, told CNBC that Scotland\u2019s whisky industry is dependent on global trade: Out of Brexit, our focus is really on ensuring that we keep Scotch whisky healthy. The trade agreements in Europe and around the world. You know, Johnnie Walker was in over 100 markets, long before Coca Cola left the shores of America.\u201d As well as Johnnie Walker, Diageo also produces Bell\u2019s whisky, plus several single malts including Talisker and Lagavulin. More Brexit gloom. JCDecaux, the French outdoor advertising group, has said it is likely to cut back its UK investment plans following the decision to leave the EU. JCDecaux, which installs those massive screens at railway stations, airports and London bus shelters, says: Given the uncertainty surrounding the impact of the Brexit decision on the UK economy and advertising revenue, we are reviewing the number of screens we are deploying until we can evaluate the economic conditions and have improved visibility. Union leaders are urging the UK government to act urgently to protect the economy from the impact of the Brexit vote. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says: \u201cThe growing expectation since the Brexit vote of an economic slowdown seems to be a factor. The government needs to act now to secure jobs and investment before thousands of working people pay the price of Brexit with the loss of their job. And Rob MacGregor of Unite is alarmed by Lloyds\u2019s decision to cut an extra 3,000 jobs: \u201cThis announcement is very bad news for workers and their families, and more widely it is a further body blow to the UK economy. \u201cThese are permanent jobs that are being lost. As a country, we can\u2019t afford to lose these jobs in a challenging post-Brexit world. As well publishing half year results which reveal job cuts and branch closures, Lloyds Banking Group has also admitted it is being investigated by the Financial Conduct Authority over the way it handles customers facing difficulty paying their mortgages. There is not much detail but in the results Lloyds said: \u201cIn May, the FCA informed the group that it was commencing an investigation in connection with the group\u2019s mortgage arrears handling. At this stage it is not possible to make an assessment of the outcome of this ongoing review\u201d. Lloyds did not take a provision for the payment protection misselling scandal. But in the first six months of the year the bank took a \u00a3460m to cover a range of so-called \u201cconduct issues\u201d. This included \u00a3215m \u201cin respect of arrears related activities on secured and unsecured retail products, \u00a370m in respect of complaints relating to packaged bank accounts and \u00a350m related to insurance products sold in Germany\u201d. In another worrying sign, a closely-watched survey of consumer confidence has hit its lowest level in three years after the Brexit vote. The monthly index conducted by YouGov and the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) has tumbled to 106.6, the lowest since July 2013, down from 111.3. That\u2019s the biggest one-month drop in six years. The survey found that the public are concerned about the impact of the June referendum, particularly on house prices (how very British!). Stephen Harmston, Head of YouGov Reports, says: \u201cThe public are still absorbing the EU referendum result but it is clear that consumer confidence has taken a significant and clear dive.\u201d Spain is celebrating the news that the country\u2019s jobless rate has hit its lowest level in six years, before the eurozone crisis began. However.... one in five adults are still out of work, and the situation could deteriorate if Europe\u2019s economy suffers from Brexit. Royal Dutch Shell is one of the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 this morning, down 3% after posting a 70% tumble in earnings. It blamed the recent tumble in crude oil prices, which have eaten into its profitability. CEO Ben van Beurden warned shareholders that \u201clower oil prices continue to be a significant challenge across the business.\u201d Inchcape, the UK car dealership, has warned that demand for new cars is weakening, due to the Brexit vote. It told shareholders this morning: Ahead of the EU referendum, the second quarter New Vehicle market growth rate moderated to 1.0% from 5.1% in the first quarter. We expect this moderation of the New Vehicle market to persist into the second half of 2016. Building society Nationwide has reported that house prices were stable in July, rising 0.5% month-on-month. The average house cost \u00a3205,715, 5.2% higher than a year ago. However.... as mortgages are approved towards the end of the process, this doesn\u2019t whether buyers have been spooked by the Brexit vote. Engineering firm Rolls-Royce is also cutting jobs, after reporting an 80% tumble in profits in the first half of 2016. Today\u2019s losses mean Countrywide has shed a third of its value since the referendum, highlighting how the UK\u2019s property sector will suffer from Brexit. It\u2019s a bleak morning in the financial sector too, as Lloyds Banking Group slashes 3,000 jobs. The bank is speeding up its cost-cutting programme, and closing 200 branches as it enters a \u201cperiod of uncertainty\u201d following the Brexit vote. Our City editor Jill Treanor explains that Lloyds is also preparing for interest rates to be slashed next week: The bank is blaming changes to customer behaviour and anticipated cuts to interest rates following the vote for Brexit last month. Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, signalled a rate cut would take place during the summer and the City now expects rates will be cut from their 0.5% historic low on 4 August. More here: And here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 take: Shares in Countrywide has dropped by almost 5% at the start of trading, following its Brexit-induced earnings warning. Britain\u2019s biggest lettings and estate agent group has issued a stark warning that parts of the country\u2019s property market are weakening, since last month\u2019s referendum, Countrywide, which runs 50 different high street brands, admitted that profits this year will be lower than in 2015. And it pins the blame firmly on the decision to leave the EU. According to Countrywide there was a clear market slowdown in May and June. And since the vote, commercial and London residential transactions have stalled, it says, with a \u201cless pronounced impact\u201d on other operations. The number of homes sold subject to contract in London fell 29% in April-June, compared to January-March. Alison Platt, Countrywide\u2019s CEO, says: As we stated in our last Trading Update on 26 April, we took a cautious view of the months leading up to the EU referendum and beyond. In the event, we saw a slowdown in our Retail and London residential businesses and, since the EU referendum result this has become more marked in London, the South East and expensive prime markets. The rest of the country has fared somewhat better and our Lettings business and mortgage trends have been largely unaffected. Countrywide also posted a 25% tumble in adjusted pretax profits for the first half of 2016, and warned of more challenges ahead. As Platt put it says: This period of uncertainty will inevitably impact the level of transactional activity in the second half of the year and, although it is too early to quantify accurately, we will not meet last year\u2019s result at the EBITDA level. Here\u2019s a round-up of Countrywide\u2019s brands: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Five weeks after the European Union referendum, we\u2019re now seeing signs that the vote to leave the EU is hitting the UK economy. Three influential surveys released overnight have shown worrying signs that Britain\u2019s car industry, retail sector and building companies are all suffering from the Brexit vote.

Over in Paris, French energy company EDF is deciding whether to give the go-ahead for an \u00a318bn nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset. The rumours are that the project will go ahead, despite concerns over cost and safety: And there\u2019s a blizzard of corporate results this morning, sending my Reuters machine into overdrive as companies clear the decks before the August lull.
