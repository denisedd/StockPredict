Investors took fright at the prospect of a hard Brexit and the currency has declined more than 6% against the dollar since then.</p> <p>A flash crash last Thursday, when the pound fell by 6% in 10 minutes, heightened concerns that investors had lost faith in sterling as a major currency. A year ago a pound bought $1.55.<br></p> <p>However, the pound\u2019s decline had the opposite effect on the UK\u2019s leading share index. The FTSE 100 touched a new intra-day record of 7,129.83 during afternoon trading, although it closed nearly 60 points lower after a late bout of selling, below the record closing figure of 7,104 reached last year. The driving force for the UK market\u2019s recent surge has been the <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/2016/oct/10/pound-continues-to-fall-against-dollar-and-euro-amid-hard-brexit-fears\">rapid decline in the pound</a>, which has boosted the value of companies that earn much of their revenues in dollars.</p> <p>Michael Saunders, a former investment banker who joined the monetary policy committee in August, said Britain\u2019s large current account deficit was adding to the anxiety about the ability of the nation to pay its way once it quits the European Union.</p> <p><a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/2016/oct/04/weak-post-brexit-growth-forecast-likely-wrong-bank-michael-saunders\">Saunders said the current account</a>, which measures the balance of trade, cash transfers and investment income with other countries, was already undermining confidence in the UK\u2019s ability to pay its way before the EU referendum.</p> <p>Speaking to MPs on the treasury select committee, Saunders warned it was now a major issue and compounding the already weak sentiment on currency markets towards sterling.</p> <p>Saunders told MPs:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cGiven the scale and persistence of the UK\u2019s current account deficit, I would not be surprised if sterling falls further, but I am fairly agnostic as to whether any further depreciation is likely,\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>Saunders, who joined the MPC from the US investment bank Citi, where he was chief economist, said investors were weighing up the implications of Britain leaving the EU.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe work done by the International Monetary Fund and the OECD suggests that the long-run effects of the UK\u2019s exit from the EU is that growth will be lower. If all we are doing is adjusting to a new equilibrium, that is not a concern.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Only if the pound plummets or triggers falls in other markets would the Bank of England need to consider cutting rates to bolster confidence and growth, he added.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cIf such a scenario were to materialise then, provided inflation expectations and pay growth remain well-contained, I would expect the mpc to largely look through any such direct effects on inflation of sterling weakness, even if they extend for several years.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>But the lower pound, which reduces the cost of UK goods and services sold abroad, could boost exports and offset much of the anxiety caused by the Brexit vote.</p> <p>A fall in imports would also help to reduce the current account deficit, he said, adding that the government could take advantage of the current depressed situation to boost growth with extra spending.</p> <p><a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/politics/2016/oct/09/theresa-may-rules-out-commons-vote-on-single-market-exit\">Several Tory MPs, including supporters of the Leave campaign, have warned that leaving the single market</a> will harm the economy and have demanded ministers make every effort to negotiate continued access.<br></p> <p>But the hardline taken by Downing Street and an equally robust response from European leaders, who have emphasised the free movement of labour as a pillar of the single market, have heightened concerns in the City that Britain will eventually leave all the EU\u2019s major institutions.</p> <p>Kathleen Brooks, research director at financial betting firm City Index and Forex.com, says traders fear the UK could be dragged back by Brexit uncertainty.</p> <p>She told BBC News that: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe weakness in the pound is really a sign that investors don\u2019t have confidence in a post-Brexit UK economic outlook. They think Brexit is going to be very negative for the UK economy, and UK GDP could contract going forward.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><em>And that\u2019s all for tonight.

In addition, we face added uncertainty over the US Election -there is a strong chance that if Hilary comes into power the US Dollar could gain a lot of strength on the back of that. In regards to the long-term, I think we could see the pound make a recovery, as we begin to see what a post-Brexit UK looks like. The biggest obstacle for the poundcurrently is the uncertainty and anxiety that surrounds the nature of divorce proceedings from the EU.

First of all, the crash in the pound is a reminder of one overriding danger that some of us have been warning about for years: Britain <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21557494\">does not pay its way</a> in the world. It buys far more goods and services from other countries than it sells to them.</p> <p>That deficit is made up entirely by what Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, has called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/26/mark-carney-fails-to-rule-out-eight-year-term-at-bank-of-england\">the kindness of strangers</a>\u201d. Which is fine, for as long as those foreign strangers consider London a safe haven for their cash. That shouldn\u2019t be taken for granted now that Britain is about to take a giant political and economic leap into the dark \u2013 and sterling has already plunged further this year than the Argentinian peso. Remember, Whitehall is only beginning to think seriously about the mechanics of leaving the EU: years of this mayhem are still to come.</p> <p>Ah, we\u2019re told: but all this currency weakness is just brilliant for British exporters. It makes their goods so much cheaper to sell abroad.

                "bodyText":"And finally, here\u2019s my colleague Philip Inman\u2019s summary of today\u2019s drama: The pound endured another day of pressure from investors on Tuesday after continued jitters on the foreign exchange markets pushed it down more than two cents to $1.21. Sterling recorded its worst four-day performance since the Brexit vote as a Bank of England official said he expected the pound to fall further in the coming weeks, driven by the referendum result and the UK\u2019s trade deficit with the rest of the world. The exchange rate with the US dollar stood at $1.30 last week when Theresa May opened the Conservative party conference and appeared to put regaining control of immigration above staying inside the EU\u2019s single market free trade area. Investors took fright at the prospect of a hard Brexit and the currency has declined more than 6% against the dollar since then. A flash crash last Thursday, when the pound fell by 6% in 10 minutes, heightened concerns that investors had lost faith in sterling as a major currency. A year ago a pound bought $1.55. However, the pound\u2019s decline had the opposite effect on the UK\u2019s leading share index. The FTSE 100 touched a new intra-day record of 7,129.83 during afternoon trading, although it closed nearly 60 points lower after a late bout of selling, below the record closing figure of 7,104 reached last year. The driving force for the UK market\u2019s recent surge has been the rapid decline in the pound, which has boosted the value of companies that earn much of their revenues in dollars. Michael Saunders, a former investment banker who joined the monetary policy committee in August, said Britain\u2019s large current account deficit was adding to the anxiety about the ability of the nation to pay its way once it quits the European Union. Saunders said the current account, which measures the balance of trade, cash transfers and investment income with other countries, was already undermining confidence in the UK\u2019s ability to pay its way before the EU referendum. Speaking to MPs on the treasury select committee, Saunders warned it was now a major issue and compounding the already weak sentiment on currency markets towards sterling. Saunders told MPs: \u201cGiven the scale and persistence of the UK\u2019s current account deficit, I would not be surprised if sterling falls further, but I am fairly agnostic as to whether any further depreciation is likely,\u201d Saunders, who joined the MPC from the US investment bank Citi, where he was chief economist, said investors were weighing up the implications of Britain leaving the EU. \u201cThe work done by the International Monetary Fund and the OECD suggests that the long-run effects of the UK\u2019s exit from the EU is that growth will be lower. If all we are doing is adjusting to a new equilibrium, that is not a concern.\u201d Only if the pound plummets or triggers falls in other markets would the Bank of England need to consider cutting rates to bolster confidence and growth, he added. \u201cIf such a scenario were to materialise then, provided inflation expectations and pay growth remain well-contained, I would expect the mpc to largely look through any such direct effects on inflation of sterling weakness, even if they extend for several years.\u201d But the lower pound, which reduces the cost of UK goods and services sold abroad, could boost exports and offset much of the anxiety caused by the Brexit vote. A fall in imports would also help to reduce the current account deficit, he said, adding that the government could take advantage of the current depressed situation to boost growth with extra spending. Several Tory MPs, including supporters of the Leave campaign, have warned that leaving the single market will harm the economy and have demanded ministers make every effort to negotiate continued access. But the hardline taken by Downing Street and an equally robust response from European leaders, who have emphasised the free movement of labour as a pillar of the single market, have heightened concerns in the City that Britain will eventually leave all the EU\u2019s major institutions. Kathleen Brooks, research director at financial betting firm City Index and Forex.com, says traders fear the UK could be dragged back by Brexit uncertainty. She told BBC News that: \u201cThe weakness in the pound is really a sign that investors don\u2019t have confidence in a post-Brexit UK economic outlook. They think Brexit is going to be very negative for the UK economy, and UK GDP could contract going forward.\u201d And that\u2019s all for tonight. Do tune in tomorrow for more coverage of the pound, the financial markets, the global economy and more.... Remember, tonight\u2019s ructions aren\u2019t JUST about Brexit. The dollar has hit an eight-month high against a basket of currencies, on speculation that US interest rates are heading higher soon: Some more thoughts from Duncan Weldon of Resolution Group: The FT\u2019s John Gapper is concerned that parliament doesn\u2019t have its eye on the ball.... This is a positively grim day for the pound, which just stuck its nose below the $1.21 mark as today\u2019s relentless selloff continues. More reaction to the pound\u2019s recent slump. Except, your average emerging market currency has performed an awful lot better than the pound this year. Brazil\u2019s Real, for example, has surged by almost 25%. Sterling is struggling to find a floor tonight \u2013 it just touched $1.2107, a decline of almost 2.5 cents against the US dollar today alone. Kathleen Brooks, Research Director at City Index and Forex.com, says traders fear the UK could be dragged back by Brexit uncertainty. She told BBC News tonight that: The weakness in the pound is really a sign that investors don\u2019t have confidence in a post-Brexit UK economic outlook. They think Brexit is going to be very negative for the UK economy, and UK GDP could contract going forward. If we have many more days like today, then talk of a Sterling Crisis won\u2019t seem far-fetched. So let\u2019s quickly recap, as City traders take a breather. The pound has suffered another day of heavy losses, shedding two cents against the US dollar to $1.214, and one euro cent to \u20ac1.098. The selloff was triggered by fresh worries about the cost of a hard Brexit, after leaked Treasury papers suggested leaving the single market would ultimately cost \u00a366bn in lost tax receipts. That forecast has been criticised by pro-Brexit ministers, who accuse the Treasury of scare-mongering. Labour, though, fear that \u201cjobs, livelihoods and public services\u201d are at risk. Two leading bankers, from Citi and Morgan Stanley, have warned they could start to move jobs out of London in 2017. Rob Rooney, CEO of Morgan Stanley International, was blunt about the consequences fo a hard Brexit: It really isn\u2019t terribly complicated. If we are outside the EU and we don\u2019t have what would be a stable and long-term commitment to access the single market then a lot of the things we do today in London, we\u2019d have to do inside the EU 27. And two Bank of England policymakers have issued warnings about the impact of Brexit. Michael Saunders, of the Monetary Policy Committee, predicted that the pound could fall further. And Anil Kashyap of the Financial Policy Committee warned that Britain could suffer a budgetary black hole if well-paid City jobs move overseas. The weak pound did push shares in London up briefly, to a new all-time high. But then a late selloff sent the FTSE 100 into the red. Analysts say the pound is also being squeezed by the recent strength of the US dollar, which is benefitting from speculation that Hillary Clinton will win next month\u2019s presidential election. Paresh Davdra, CEO of RationalFX, predicts a lot more volatility for sterling... \u201cIn the short term, I think we will see the pound continue to slide. A lot of what has been happening has been in reaction to political events, namely any update on Brexit that comes from the government. This week we have seen the first evidence from the Prime Minister that Britain is heading for a clean break from the EU \u2013traditionally the least desirable option for the economy \u2013which has been a major factor behind the pound\u2019s slump. As we get closer to Article 50 being invoked, I think we will see the pound continue to fall further. In addition, we face added uncertainty over the US Election -there is a strong chance that if Hilary comes into power the US Dollar could gain a lot of strength on the back of that. In regards to the long-term, I think we could see the pound make a recovery, as we begin to see what a post-Brexit UK looks like. The biggest obstacle for the poundcurrently is the uncertainty and anxiety that surrounds the nature of divorce proceedings from the EU. But once we overcome that, we should begin to see the trend reverse. Until then however, it will likely continue to a bumpy ride for the UK\u2019s currency.\u201d The pound is also suffering a late rout against the euro, as Brexit fears thump sterling again. It\u2019s fallen by one euro cent, or around 1%, to \u20ac1.098. Crumbs, make that $1.2153 -- which means the pound has lost two cents against the US dollar today! The pound is ploughing new lows, and is now down 1.75 cents at $1.2177. That\u2019s a new 31-year low, if you exclude the odd flash-crash last Friday... Sterling is now at an eight-year low against a basket of major currencies. And if it weakens much further, we could hit 40-year lows, according to Reuters journalist Jamie McGeever. Today\u2019s selloff means the pound has suffered its worst four-day run since late June, and the aftermath of the EU referendum vote. Back then, sterling was worth around $1.48. It has now shed around 17.5% of its value since. The selloff has intensified since Theresa May declared that she\u2019ll trigger article 50 by the end of March. The pound has dropped by 7 1/2 cents, or nearly 6%, since the start of the Conservative Party conference, from $1.2975 to $1.22-ish. That\u2019s a really sharp decline, as investors have faced up to the prospect of Brexit taking place by spring 2019. May\u2019s promises of immigration controls also pushed the pound down, as traders anticipated a Hard Brexit, which would deprive UK firms of membership of the single market. My colleague Aditya Chakrabortty has written a scorching piece about the sterling slump. Here\u2019s a flavour: So let\u2019s have some ugly facts. First of all, the crash in the pound is a reminder of one overriding danger that some of us have been warning about for years: Britain does not pay its way in the world. It buys far more goods and services from other countries than it sells to them. That deficit is made up entirely by what Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, has called \u201cthe kindness of strangers\u201d. Which is fine, for as long as those foreign strangers consider London a safe haven for their cash. That shouldn\u2019t be taken for granted now that Britain is about to take a giant political and economic leap into the dark \u2013 and sterling has already plunged further this year than the Argentinian peso. Remember, Whitehall is only beginning to think seriously about the mechanics of leaving the EU: years of this mayhem are still to come. Ah, we\u2019re told: but all this currency weakness is just brilliant for British exporters. It makes their goods so much cheaper to sell abroad. True, but that is to overestimate the bag of bones that is the British manufacturing sector 30 years after the Thatcher revolution. Back over in Dublin, the Irish government has unveiled a series of measures designed to protect the economy from a Brexit shock. It aims to protect foreign investment, boost tourism and reduce the exposure of farmers in the wake of the collapse of sterling. Under the \u201cGetting Ireland Brexit Ready\u201d programme, announced by the finance minister, a \u201crainy day fund\u201d will be built up from surplus budgets for use as a contingency for public services in the event of a shock to the economy after Brexit Day, expected in 2019. A special \u20ac150m loan fund to help farmers with cash flow and short term borrowings is to be established amid concern many are struggling to cope with the sharp decline in the value of their exports to the UK, A special tax relief programme designed to help foreign investors with the smooth movement of staff from the US and elsewhere is to be extended until the end of 2020. This programme will allow employers to relocate state from overseas offices with minimal tax complications. A reduced nine per cent VAT rate is to be retained in the tourist sector to assist the competitiveness of the hospitality sector which is heavily dependent on UK tourists. The government says: \u201cThe measure acts to secure and embed investment, which can lead to sustainable growth and strengthens Ireland\u2019s innovative capabilities.\u201d At the same time the government has released a sector by sector analysis of the impact Brexit could have on trade with Britain, the country\u2019s biggest trading partner. Agri-food and computer services are among the most exposed sectors. The Revenue commissioners have also been asked to scope out how potential customs with the UK and with Northern Ireland would work. Unveiling the package, finance minister Michael Noonan said the Brexit vote posed \u201cimportant challenges for the Irish economy\u201d and it needed to \u201cprotect the progress\u201d made to the economy since the crash of 2010. Breaking: Britain\u2019s stock market has failed to hit a new closing high, as the City frets about the costs of a hard Brexit. A late afternoon selloff sent the FTSE 100 down by 0.38%, or 26 points, to 7070 points. It had earlier hit a new all-time high of 7129 points (as covered here). Retail stocks rallied, with Next up 4% and Marks &amp; Spencer up 3.2%. But mining stocks fell, as the strengthening US dollar pushed down commodity prices. Now, in theory, the weak pound should have driven the FTSE 100 higher. But it appears that Brexit worries have pushed shares price down, especially predictions that leaving the single market would create a fiscal black hole. Top bankers from Citi and Morgan Stanley also dented confidence, by warning they could quit the City of London next year. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx explains: A lunchtime surge saw the FTSE smash through to 7129; now it\u2019s back hovering below 7100, that midday burst of energy proving to be brief. Perhaps reports that both Citi and Morgan Stanley have stated they will leave London if Britain appears to be heading for a hard Brexit have weighed on investors\u2019 appetite for the UK index; perhaps it was a bout of profit-taking. Either way the FTSE couldn\u2019t hold onto its highs for long. Wall Streeet is also in the red, with the Dow down around 1% after aluminium firm Alcoa disappointed the markets. Chris Beauchamp of IG says investors are also driving the US dollar higher, because they expect American interest rates to rise before Christmas. The blame for the general \u2018risk off\u2019 mood can be attributed partly to Alcoa, whose disappointing figures have put US markets on the defensive, but overall the equity rally is being knocked by a rising US dollar, as traders rush back to the greenback thanks to soaring expectations of a move by the Fed in December The pound is hitting new lows against the US dollar in late London trading. It has now shed almost 1.5 cents today, to just $1.221. That partly reflects fears over hard Brexit. It\u2019s also due to the fact the US dollar is strengthening against most currencies. Worth noting that the euro is also having a bad week. Traders are piling into the US dollar in anticipation that American interest rates might rise in December. Fujitsu says that its 1,800 planned job cuts are not a response to the Brexit vote, and it remains committed to the UK (that\u2019s hot off the Reuters terminal) The pound is taking another pummelling, now down its lowest point of the day at $1.223. It was briefly lower on Friday, during the flash crash that drove sterling to fresh 31-year lows. Bad news for UK workers at Fujitsu. The Japanese electronics firm is planning to cut up to 1,800 jobs as part of a \u2018transformation programme\u2019. That\u2019s via the Press Association. No word if it\u2019s Brexit-related.... Global stock markets are turning a little sour now, dragging the FTSE 100 away from today\u2019s record high. US aluminium firm Alcoa has disappointed investors, by missing revenue and profit forecasts today. That\u2019s a downbeat start to the latest earnings season, leaving Wall Street traders unimpressed. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says: Expectations were that we will finally get a quarter when we can be confident to say that earning season will give us a number which will make the foundation a little more stronger for the US economy. But the number released from Alcoa was simply just a disaster and has made investors angry who are willing to liquidate their position. So, all the main markets are now in the red: The pound is still looking weak, too, down almost one cent today at $1.228 The government won\u2019t be lured on whether we\u2019re in a full-blown sterling crisis, or not, reports Paul Waugh of Huffington Post. Personally, I think $1.20 might be the trigger point for some serious \u201cSterling Crisis\u201d headlines; so we\u2019re still a few cents away. Two senior bankers have warned that they could start moving jobs out of the City, perhaps next year, if Britain appears to be heading for a hard Brexit. Speaking at a London conference today James Bardrick, the boss of Citi\u2019s UK operation, said his bank could trigger its contingency plan by early next year. Bardrick said: \u201cHow do we and when do we start making decisions ... knowing the plan is ready to go ... it could be in the first quarter of 2017.\u201d Rob Rooney, CEO of Morgan Stanley international, gave a blunt warning that jobs would have to move back into the EU, if Britain quit the single market. As Rooney put it: \u201cIt really isn\u2019t terribly complicated. If we are outside the EU and we don\u2019t have what would be a stable and long-term commitment to access the single market then a lot of the things we do today in London, we\u2019d have to do inside the EU 27.\u201d (thanks to Reuters for the quotes). This is what Bank of England policymaker Anil Kashyap was banging on about this morning, when he predicted a \u201cnon-trivial\u201d impact on the UK\u2019s fiscal plans if lots of well-paid City jobs moved overseas. Today\u2019s stock market surge is only a \u2018hollow victory\u2019, argues Laith Khalaf of financial services group Hargreaves Lansdown. He says it\u2019s being driven by currency movements rather than a fundamental improvement in UK companies. Nonetheless UK investors will still be cheered to see a boost to their pension pots and ISA valuations, as it represents a genuine increase to their wealth in pounds and pence. The concern will be that a reversal in fortunes for the currency could see the gains wiped off as quickly as they appeared. That may well be the case, though it\u2019s hard to see anything in the foreseeable future that\u2019s going to propel the pound back to its former glory. Having smashed through the intraday record high, City traders are now wondering if the FTSE 100 will do the double and close at a record high. And with two and a half hours to go, it\u2019s nip and tuck, frankly. The Footsie has dipped back a little, since hitting 7129 points two hours ago. It\u2019s now just 7097, compared to an alltime closing high of 7104 points. This is good, from the Press Association: The Irish government also warned that the Brexit vote is \u201ca real risk\u201d to the Republic\u2019s economy, due to the close trade ties. Dublin has already trimmed its growth forecast for 2017, as this statement from today\u2019s 2017 Budget explains: During the delivery of his budget to the Dail (Irish parliament) this lunchtime Ireland\u2019s Finance Minister Michael Noonan was quite bullish in defending the Republic\u2019s controversial low corporation tax regime. Despite the EU ruling that Apple owed billions in tax thanks to the taxation policy in Ireland, Noonan told the Dail: \u201cIreland\u2019s 12.5% corporation will not be changed and nobody in Europe or anywhere else is asking for it to be changed.\u201d On the Republic\u2019s international tax strategy, Noonan says it: \u201crestates our commitment to meet international tax principles and how our corporate tax regime remains fair but competitive into the future.\u201d Overall he has announced around \u20ac300m in tax cuts mainly for the lower paid. Around \u20ac1.7bn will be allocated to extra spending for the public services. Back in Dublin, crash barriers have been erected to prevent any surge of protestors demonstration over today\u2019s Irish budget 2017. So far there has been little sign of many demonstrators unlike in the days of the last recession when thousands congregated in Molesworth Street over austerity cuts and deals to recapitalise Ireland\u2019s busted banking system. (via US student Keela Sweeney) Neil Wilson of ETX Capital agrees that the weak pound is the main factor driving the FTSE 100 to an all-time high today. Brexiters might point to the FTSE\u2019s rise as a sign of strength but this is very much a story of sterling weakness boosting foreign earnings \u2013 which account for around two-thirds to three-quarters of FTSE 100 company revenues. Having said that today\u2019s gains largely come from UK-focused stocks like Next, Whitbread, Marks &amp; Spencer, Travis Perkins and Taylor Wimpey. He also believes that Bank of England policymaker Michael Saunders may have helped push shares higher, during his testimony to MPs (highlights are here) We also got comments today from one Bank of England policymaker that the MPC would not be too fussed if inflation overshoots \u2013 the market seems to have taken this as a clear indication that rates are staying on the floor for a while yet. A weak pound and lower-for-longer interest rates is generally good for equities. Duncan Weldon, head of research at City firm Resolution Group, points out that the FTSE 100 isn\u2019t a great barometer of the UK economy. The index\u2019s 10 biggest companies are (in order), Royal Dutch Shell, HSBC, Unilever, BP, British American Tobacco, GlaxoSmithKline, BHP Billiton, AstraZeneca, Vodafone and Diageo. That\u2019s two oil giants, two pharmaceuticals firms, a global bank, a tobacco firm, a consumer goods titan, a major mining company, an international drinks business and a major telecoms group. Ben Chu of the Independent is tweeting some interesting graphs about the FTSE: We\u2019re calling it a record high... but The Telegraph\u2019s Tara Cunningham points out that the Footsie is 6% down this year, when priced in US dollars. That means UK shares are attractive for American investors, another factor that has driven the market up since the Brexit vote. Boom! The pound is falling further as lunchtime approaches in the City, driving shares in London up to their highest ever level. The FTSE 100 index has just smashed through to a new all-time intraday high, up 30 points at 7129. That breaks the previous record set in April 2015. It\u2019s being driven by retailers such as Next (+4.2%) and Marks &amp; Spencer (+3.1%), plus building companies. The smaller FTSE 250 index, which contains more UK focused companies, has gained 0.7% - close to the record high struck last week. But there is a proviso.... share prices are partly being driven up by the weakness of the pound (which makes overseas earnings more valuable). And the pound is continuing to slide today, now down another cent at $1.225. This graph, from Bloomberg, shows how the FTSE 100 has pushed higher as the pound has weakened since June: Chris Beauchamp, Chief Market Analyst at IG, says the weak pound is \u201cworking its magic\u201d on share prices again. UK investors will once again be cheering the impact of a falling pound, as the drop in sterling once again works its magic on the FTSE 100. The index has hit its all-time high, although this will doubtless bring out the legions armed with their charts of the FTSE rebased into a variety of currencies to paint the index in a less flattering light. Of course, most UK investors will simply be pleased to see their portfolios rise, and will worry about the currency later. Good numbers from luxury firm LVMH have helped Burberry to rise steadily this morning, with the stock touching its highest level since August 2015. There are also protesters outside government buildings in Ireland today, ahead of the budget: A local entrepreneur and founder of a Irish startup company called Parkio has welcomed Dublin\u2019s decision to halve capital gains tax for entrepreneurs, to 10%, to help cushion the impact of the Brexit vote. His accountant had estimated he was going to be paying approximately 33%. (thanks to journalism student Lucas Nolan) Back in Ireland, the government\u2019s new budget is now expected to contain some measures to counteract and indeed exploit the impact of Brexit. There will be additional funding for the Republic\u2019s Industrial Development Authority, which over four decades has attracted multi-national corporations from Dell to Apple, Microsoft to Google to the country. The extra money for the IDA will enable it to try and woo even more global hi-tech giants to low corporation tax Ireland (12.5%) especially those companies who are worried that the UK out of Europe means Britain is no longer a beachhead into the EU single market. It is part of moves to portray Ireland globally as the only English-speaking country still in the the EU and mainly for the benefit of American hi-tech multi nationals in particular. One potential \u2018Brexit shock absorber\u2019 in this year\u2019s budget is the dramatic halving of capital gains tax for home-grown entrepreneurs from 20% to just 10%. This is another move designed to boost indigenous Irish firms to cope with any potential collateral damage Brexit could cause to the Republic\u2019s economy. Anil Kashyap refuses to say whether he thinks the pound is likely to suffer further falls over the next few years. I\u2019d have to resign from the University of Chicago if I started forecasting currency moves, Kashyap tells the Treasury committee -- we\u2019re known for our position that the market sets these prices. The newest member of the Bank of England\u2019s Financial Policy Committee adds: Until we see what the relations are between the UK and the EU, it\u2019s very hard to know where any of this is going to settle Q: But what about if we knew we were getting a hard Brexit? Then the pound would probably weaken further, Kashyap. But it still depends exactly what \u2018hard Brexit means\u2019. Q: Hard Brexit is taken to mean a swift exit from the EU, and a fallback to WTO rules..... Kashyap replies that this could have serious consequences for the Treasury: If you lose a bunch of financial services jobs... then the fiscal consequences of that is non-trivial, as those jobs are so high paying, and [generate] so much tax. 3.7% of total UK employment is in financial services, and 11.5% of fiscal revenues come from financial services, he adds. You don\u2019t have to lose lots of that before you have a hole in the budget that could be meaningful. And that could have some knock-on effects for the exchange rate. Reminder: A leaked Treasury paper has predicted that the UK could eventually lose \u00a366bn of tax revenues after Brexit: The Treasury Committee is now questioning Anil Kashyap, a US academic who is joining the Bank of England\u2019s Financial Stability Committee. They\u2019re not best pleased that Kashyap is planning to miss one FPC meeting due to teaching commitments at the University of Chicago (but to be fair, he\u2019s squeezing his teaching commitments into just 10 weeks). Kashyap is also being quizzed about the huge fine hanging over Deutsche Bank. Is that a threat to financial stability? Kashyap argues that letting banks get away with malpractice would be a bigger threat to stability. And he denies that the problems in the European banking system start with US fines. He blames low growth, and badly capitalised banks -- such as in Italy. If the size of the problem in Italy was as small as some people have claimed, they\u2019d have fixed it by now, Kashyap adds. And that\u2019s the end of Michael Saunders\u2019 session at parliament, to rubberstamp his appointment to set interest rates on the Monetary Policy Committee. The big news is that Saunders thinks the pound could extend its recent losses since the Brexit vote. He told MPs that: \u201cGiven the scale and persistence of the UK\u2019s current account deficit, I would not be surprised if sterling falls further, but I am fairly agnostic as to whether any further depreciation is likely.\u201d Also: He thinks the Bank will \u2018look through\u2019 the inflationary consequences of the weak pound. He\u2019s not terribly worried by the speed of the pound\u2019s decline, arguing that the currency is adjusting to the reality of Brexit. He thinks the slump in sterling could push import prices up by 13%, potentially pushing inflation up by 1.5 percentage points a year. He thinks the UK economy will grow faster over the next few quarters than previously thought, but this doesn\u2019t tell much about the long-term. Saunders said: I think the economy will do better over the next few quarters. I don\u2019t think that tells you about the long run effects. It\u2019s important not to make judgements on the long run based on the short run view. What the economy does in the next few years is crucial. Q: Is the Bank of England now \u2018out of ammunition\u2019 to stimulate the economy? Saunders says not. Interest rates could be cut again (although they\u2019re already only 0.25%), and the Bank could also boost its asset purchase scheme (buying bonds with newly created money). We\u2019ve still got tools, if needed, he insists. Michael Saunders say the UK economy will probably perform better than expected over the next few quarters (echoing a point he made in a speech last week). But that doesn\u2019t tell us much about the long-term effects of Brexit. Q: Were the Bank of England\u2019s warnings before the EU referendum justified? Saunders only joined the Bank of England this summer, so he was still working in the City during the Brexit vote. He says most City experts expected a Brexit vote to lead to a weaker currency and lower growth, but no-one knew if this would lead to financial instability. So as a player in the market, Saunders was reassured by Mark Carney\u2019s comments -- as it showed the Bank would act to stabilise the markets. The Brexit vote isn\u2019t the only thing pushing the pound down, Michael Saunders adds. The UK\u2019s current account deficit (around 6% of GDP) is also weighing on sterling. And Saunders admits that he wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see the pound fall further! He also explains that a 20% drop in the pound (slightly more than what we\u2019ve seen since June) would probably push import prices up by 12-13%, which would add 4 percentage points to inflation over a few years. That could mean inflation is 1.5 percentage points higher than otherwise at its peak (so 3.5% rather than 2%, for example). And Saunders thinks the Bank of England could \u2018look through\u2019 this, rather than raise borrowing costs to squeeze it out. Q: Are you worried about the recent volatility in the pound? Michael Saunders says sterling is adjusting to the reality that Britain is leaving the European Union, and the likely impact on growth. If the speed at which the currency falls creates ripples in other asset markets, then that is a problem. But...if we are just adjusting to a new equilibrium, then the speed of the adjustment is not a problem. Saunders also insists that the Bank does not have any target for the pound, or a level where it would intervene to support sterling. The Bank has \u201clong ago learned its lesson\u201d here, he smiles (a reference to Black Wednesday in 1992 when speculator George Soros forced the pound out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism). Over in parliament, new Bank of England policymaker Michael Saunders is being questioned by the Treasury Committee. It\u2019s being streamed live here. Saunders has been asked about Theresa May\u2019s recent criticism of the BoE\u2019s stimulus policies, for making people who own assets richer, but penalising savers and the poor. He defends the current policy of record low interest rates, plus a quantitative easing programme. I don\u2019t think we at the Bank of England can tackle the distributional effects of monetary policy. We can\u2019t set interest rates for different groups. If the Bank raised interest rates to support savers, then the economy would be weaker, unemployment would be higher, asset prices over time would be weaker, and over time, interest rates would eventually be lower too, Saunders claims. Q: So should you set QE and monetary policy blind to the distributional effects? Yes, Saunders replies, unless those distributional effects obstruct the impact of monetary policy. Big news out of South Korea: Samsung is \u201cpermanently halting production of its Galaxy Note 7. Killing off the smartphone is a \u201cdrastic step\u201d, says Bloomberg, after several customers reported that replacement devices have caught fire. Bloomberg explains: After halting sales of the new versions of the large-screen smartphone that failed to fix exploding batteries, Samsung finally pulled the plug on a key product that was supposed to compete with Apple Inc.\u2019s iPhones and other high-end smartphones during the U.S. holiday shopping season. Production will stop, Samsung said in a statement Tuesday. At $1.229, the pound has shed almost seven cents against the US dollar since Theresa May announced she\u2019d trigger article 50 by next March. That\u2019s a fall of around 5%, in less than seven trading days, and means the pound is now 17% lower than on referendum day. Reuters reckons the pound is suffering its worst four-day run since immediately after the Brexit vote. That\u2019s bad for import prices, and Brits heading abroad. But Peter Rosenstreich, head of market strategy at Swissquote Bank, believes exporters should soon benefit. A Brexit is definitely not the end of the world. Moreover, the devalued pound will see exports gain momentum within the next few month. Over in Germany, investor confidence has risen this month: John McDonnell MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chancellor, has responded to the warning that a \u201chard Brexit\u201d could cost the Treasury \u00a366bn a year in tax revenues. \u201cLosing access to the single market would be devastating for jobs, livelihoods and our public services yet the Tory government are prepared to take this desperate step, despite being warned by their own experts of the consequences. The British people voted to leave the European Union and all sides must respect that decision, but what they certainly didn\u2019t vote for was economic misery and the loss of jobs.\u201d After coming tantalisingly close to a new alltime high, the FTSE 100 has now shed all those early gains. Despite today\u2019s selloff, sterling isn\u2019t the worst-performing currency today. That honour has been grabbed by the South African rand, which just tumbled by 3% against the US dollar. There are reports that finance minister Pravin Gordhan has been issued with a summons for fraud, over a surveillance unit which was set up when he led the national tax agency. South African government bonds, and bank shares, are also falling in value. Over in parliament, MPs on the Business Committee are holding a session on Britain\u2019s industrial strategy. They\u2019ll hear from former chancellor George Osborne, former deputy PM Lord Heseltine and Sir Vince Cable, who ran the BIS department before the last election. Our Politics Live blog is tracking the action: The UK jobs market is also suffering from the Brexit vote, according to recruitment firm PageGroup. Gross profits at its UK division fell by 4.7% in the last three month, it told the City today. PageGroup blames on \u201cfragile market conditions\u201d following June\u2019s referendum, particularly in the financial services sector. Steve Ingham, PageGroup\u2019s CEO, says: In the UK, confidence levels remained fragile and below levels seen earlier in the year.... With the prevailing uncertainty in the UK, the challenges in some of our other larger markets and the unpredictable nature of the current cycle, we remain cautious in our short-term outlook. The official unemployment data since the Brexit vote has been quite encouraging, with the jobless rate still just 4.9%. But the claimant count did rise in August, suggesting some weakness. It\u2019s been a while since we last had a full-blown currency crisis, everyone panicking because the pound is falling through the floor. Well, we\u2019re having one now. So says John Humphrys, Today Programme presenter, with a certain amount of relish. But is it really a crisis? Gerard Lyons, former chief economic advisor to Boris Johnson, says it\u2019s not. He believes we should welcome the cheaper pound. Sterling has been seen as overvalued for some time - and the scale of the current account deficit, at 7%, is huge. In an era of low inflation and low growth, a weaker pound is a good thing, Lyons adds. But Ngaire Woods, professor of Global Economic Governance at the University of Oxford, is much more concerned. The cost of importing machines, or medical equipment for the NHS, from the US has immediately gone up, she says, and that will hurt the economy down the road. Firms also face new uncertainties --over the future of foreign workers, and the UK\u2019s future trade links \u2013 says Woods, adding: Here at Oxford University we have top international professors saying they might not move to Oxford.... It\u2019s budget day in Ireland and the first for the new coalition led by Fine Gael but propped up by Independent members of the Dail, and supported for the first time in terms of the national financial plans by the main opposition party Fianna Fail. Irish budgets of recent past have been cost-cutting austerity driven events as the last Fine Gael-Labour government sought to restore the black hole in Irish public finances caused by the banking crash and the collapse of the Celtic Tiger economy. In recent years Ireland has been the leading country in the EU in terms of growth but the state is still borrowing heavily on international markets to pay for its public services. There are some small give-away measures in this year\u2019s budget and they include: An extra \u20ac5 per week for the nation\u2019s pensioners. An additional \u20ac900 per year to each child if he or she is in 40 hours of childcare per week. Extra spending for an additional 1,000 nurses and 800 more garda officers. A 50 eurocent hike in the price of cigarettes.  A reduction of \u20ac5 in the cost of prescription charges for the over 70s. All in all they are modest adjustments and extra spending indicating the cautious approach taken by Finance Minister Michael Noonan. He presents his budget to the Dail at 1pm and it will be interesting to see if he introduces any other measures aimed at absorbing future shocks to the economy caused by Britain\u2019s planned exit from the European Union. With the UK still Ireland\u2019s largest trading one commentator in Dublin yesterday even called for the creation of an Irish Minister in charge of Brexit-affairs given the impact the British leaving the UK may have on the Republic\u2019s economy. Neil Wilson of City firm ETX Capital is alarmed by the \u201csharp moves\u201d in the value of the pound this morning. He fears that Brexit angst could drive sterling down to $1.20. GBP/USD crashed through the $1.23 handle to around 1.2284, its lowest level since last week\u2019s gyrations. It\u2019s not unreasonable to think that ferocious flash crash was just a very tentative toe in the water and the pound is now plunging headlong into the abyss. Sterling seems to be looking for a level and it\u2019s really unclear where that could be and so bargain hunting is a risky game to play at the moment. The $1.20 handle earmarked by many before the referendum is definitely in play as everyone seems to be short sterling at present. The weak pound is helping to drive the London stock market close to record highs. The FTSE 100 index of top blue-chip shares has risen by almost 20 points, or 0.25%, to 7118 points. That would be a record closing high, and is only 6 points away from the all-time intraday high. Exporters, such as fashion firm Burberry, are benefitting from the cheapness of sterling. It\u2019s also good for mining companies, who earn their money in dollars. Sterling is now at its weakest level since the financial crisis broke out, when measured against a basket of other top currencies. Reuters has the details: Trade-weighted sterling hit a nearly-eight-year low of 74.0 at the Bank of England\u2019s first morning print of the index, which measures the pound\u2019s broader strength. It was also half a percent weaker at 90.51 pence per euro. Some traders cited a Financial Times report that Russian bank VTB may move its European hub to Frankfurt, Paris or Vienna as having added to worries of financial sector cutbacks inLondon due to Brexit. \u201cThere is nothing to go on on the data front today, but concerns surrounding our ever increasing current account deficit have reignited discussion around the widespread impact such a hole can create,\u201d said Tobias Davis, head of corporate treasury sales at Western Union in London. Kit Juckes, currency expert at Societe Generale, fears that the weakness of the pound could spread to other assets, such as government bonds and shares. In real effective terms, sterling is 10% lower than it was in 1992 after leaving the ERM and is now weaker than it was after Lehman. Press comment is now shifting to embracing the positive effects of a weak pound and in due course that\u2019ll be true but any further weakness from here might simply reflect loss of confidence and be bad for UK assets (gilts, equities, house prices, you name it...) in general. Although a weak pound means Britain is poorer, it could also help the economy ride out the Brexit storm. Ashoka Mody, the IMF\u2019s former deputy-director for Europe, has told the Daily Telegraph that we should be celebrating sterling\u2019s slump. Mody argues that the pound was overvalued before June\u2019s vote, and has simply dropped to a more suitable level. \u201cIt is desirable from every point of view. The idea that Britain is in crisis or is on its knees before the exchange rate vigilantes is ludicrous. \u201cThe UK economy is rebalancing amazingly well. It is a stunning achievement that a once-in-fifty-year event should have gone to smoothly.\u201d More here. The pound\u2019s weakness is being exacerbated by traders piling into the US dollar. The dollar is in demand, as Donald Trump is seen as increasingly unlikely to become US president in November. Tape recordings of Trump boasting about groping women have dealt another blow to his campaign, prompting more top Republicans to withdraw their endorsements: Kathleen Brooks of City Index says Trump\u2019s \u201ccrash and burn\u201d is boosting the dollar, The latest election polls in the US suggest that Hillary Clinton is extending her lead over Donald Trump, which is considered dollar positive. The most senior Republican in Congress, Paul Ryan, has abandoned Trump after the latest debate against Clinton, further signs that his campaign is losing momentum at this crucial stage of the election race. It\u2019s looking like another bad morning for sterling, as the British currency continues to weaken in the face of Brexit worries. The pound has dropped by over half a cent this morning to $1.229 -- which would be a 31-year low, if you ignored the flash crash that sent sterling tumbling on Friday. Sterling has also lost fresh ground against the euro, down 0.33% to \u20ac1.106. This latest selloff follows reports that Britain could lose \u00a366bn of tax revenues each year if the UK takes the plunge with a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 Here\u2019s the story: Leaked government papers suggest that leaving the single market and switching to World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules would cause GDP to fall by up to 9.5% compared with staying in the EU. The draft cabinet committee paper seen by the Times is based on forecasts from the controversial study into the predicted impact of quitting the EU published by George Osborne in April during the referendum campaign. Although the then chancellor faced widespread criticism over the report, the Treasury stands by its calculations, according to the Times. The documents says: \u201cThe Treasury estimates that UK GDP would be between 5.4% and 9.5% of GDP lower after 15 years if we left the EU with no successor arrangement, with a central estimate of 7.5%. Some pro-Brexit ministers have dismissed the report, saying the Treasury is being unduly pessimistic and going over the top. Sam Coates, the Times journalist who broke the story, explains that the report uses the same Treasury forecasts produced in April. This may heighten concerns among businesses that they could be locked out of the single market by March 2019.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Coming up today.... Brexit fears continues to swirl around the City this morning, as the pound continues to be buffered by concerns over Britain\u2019s exit strategy from the EU. Overnight, Russia\u2019s VTB Bank has become the first big lender to publicly say it will move its European headquarters out of the UK. Herbert Moos, deputy chairman, told the Financial Times that VTB is now eying up Frankfurt, Vienna and Paris as alternative sites for its European hub. Moos says: \u201cWe did have bigger plans for the London office, but after Brexit we are scaling them down and building them up elsewhere. \u201cOur board will decide where by the end of the year.\u201d More here: Brexit pushes VTB\u2019s Europe HQ out of London That kind of talk is likely to weigh on UK assets, as all the major banks plan their own strategies... Brexit will also be on the minds of MPs on the the Treasury Select Committee. They will be questioning Michael Saunders, the new member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, from 10am. They\u2019ll then hear from Anil Kashyap, who is joining the Bank\u2019s Financial Policy Committee. Saunders has already said that the UK economy has performed better than the Bank expected, since the Brexit vote. Also coming up.... Tech giant Samsung is in a full-blown crisis, after pulling all its Galaxy Note 7 smartphones from sale around the globe. Several customers have reported that replacement devices have overheated, or caught fire: The oil price has hit a one-year high overnight, after Russia backed the output curbs proposed by the Opec cartel. Oil ministers are gathering in Istanbul this week for the World Energy Conference, so further developments are possible. Ireland\u2019s government is presenting its budget today; the first since Britain voted to leave the EU. And European stock markets are expected to dip in early trading, after London\u2019s FTSE 100 closed at a 15-month high last night. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

Members of the public accounts committee are also expected to further investigate HMRC\u2019s claims that its compliance team generated record revenues of \u00a326.6bn by chasing down tax dodgers.</p> <p>Official <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/561312/HMRC-measuring-tax-gaps-2016.pdf\">estimates from HMRC</a>, published on Thursday, show Britain\u2019s public finances missed out on tax revenues of \u00a336bn in 2014-15. HMRC\u2019s tax gap figures have remained at about the same level for several years despite increasing claims the agency has made about the impact of its compliance work. </p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmselect/cmpubacc/674/67405.htm\">report published this year</a>, the public accounts committee noted: \u201cHMRC told us that its performance in addressing tax fraud was good. But HMRC\u2019s assessment of the tax gap shows that the level of tax fraud has remained virtually static over the last five years.

                "bodyText":"Tax experts warned that HM Revenue &amp; Customs was underestimating the size of Britain\u2019s tax avoidance problem after the agency claimed that Britain\u2019s annual tax shortfall was only \u00a336bn \u2013 a figure that ignored controversial structures used by multinationals such as Google, Apple and Starbucks. Top HMRC officials will face questions from MPs next week over their refusal to challenge tax avoidance by multinational corporations. Members of the public accounts committee are also expected to further investigate HMRC\u2019s claims that its compliance team generated record revenues of \u00a326.6bn by chasing down tax dodgers. Official estimates from HMRC, published on Thursday, show Britain\u2019s public finances missed out on tax revenues of \u00a336bn in 2014-15. HMRC\u2019s tax gap figures have remained at about the same level for several years despite increasing claims the agency has made about the impact of its compliance work. In a report published this year, the public accounts committee noted: \u201cHMRC told us that its performance in addressing tax fraud was good. But HMRC\u2019s assessment of the tax gap shows that the level of tax fraud has remained virtually static over the last five years. The impact that HMRC claims for its work far exceeds any reduction in the tax gap.\u201d Next Wednesday, top HMRC officials are to appear before the committee again to answer questions about the tax office\u2019s performance. \u201cOne of the areas where we\u2019ll be focusing hard is on claims about [HMRC\u2019s] compliance performance,\u201d a source close to the committee said.

                "bodyText":"Crude prices are under pressure again after Iraq said it wanted to be exempt from any agreement by Opec to cut production. Markets had been hoping a meeting next month by producers would agree an output deal to support the sliding oil price. Opec announced plans last month to cut output, but details of how it would reach this target and how much individual producer countries would cut were expected at a meeting in Vienna in November. But comments from Iraq over the weekend added to the general uncertainty as to whether any agreement could be reached after all. Brent crude is currently down just over 2% at $50.71 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate is the same amount lower at $49.78. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, does not seem to have given up yet on an EU-Canada trade deal: Here\u2019s our report on the latest developments in the EU-Canada trade deal. Jennifer Rankin writes: The European Union\u2019s hopes of signing a free-trade agreement with Canada this week appear to have gone up in smoke, after Belgium announced it could not sign the treaty because of opposition from regional parliaments. The collapse of the talks highlights the pitfalls that may await the British government when it seeks to negotiate a trade deal with the EU after Brexit. The Belgian prime minister, Charles Michel, announced on Monday that Belgium was not ready to sign the EU-Canada trade pact, following emergency talks between the country\u2019s federal and regional leaders. The Belgian stalemate means Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, is expected to postpone a trip to Brussels this Thursday, when he was due to sign the treaty. Officials are assessing how the trade pact can be revived, but next steps remained unclear. Donald Tusk, the head of the European council, is due to speak to Trudeau later on Monday. Tusk had given Belgium an ultimatum of Monday night to sort out its problems, but emergency talks in Brussels in the afternoon showed the treaty remained stuck. Paul Magnette, Wallonia\u2019s minister-president, who has led opposition to the deal, said his position had not changed. He had failed to show up for crisis talks with the European commission on Sunday, according to Michel. The full report is here: A spate of takeover deals, notably AT&amp;T\u2019s \u00a370bn offer for Time Warner, and better than expected eurozone and US manufacturing PMIs have lifted most markets at the start of the trading week. But, partly due to mixed UK factory orders, the FTSE 100 has failed to hold on to early gains, and ended below the 7000 level. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: The FTSE\u2019s early gains have turned to ashes, with the index falling into the red over the course of the afternoon. Both the US and Europe have trimmed their gains, but the fall for London\u2019s chief index is the standout feature of the day. Now that the pound has stopped its freefall (for now at least), perhaps the index as a whole is beginning to look a tad overpriced. Certainly, it has shown little inclination to get back to its recent highs, with ongoing Brexit uncertainty making the UK less attractive versus a eurozone economy that appears, on the basis of today\u2019s PMI numbers, to be looking much more attractive. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 34.07 points or 0.49% at 6986.40 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.47% to 10,761.17 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.36% to 4552.58 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was up 0.81% to 17,305.77 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.27% better at 9216.2 In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.15% to 593.13 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 76 points or 0.42%. Meanwhile the pound is down 0.25% at $1.22 and a similar amount lower against the euro at \u20ac1.1206. UK prime minister Theresa May has said she is disappointed with developments in the EU-Canada trade deal. Speaking in parliament she said: \u201cI share everyone\u2019s disappointment in the stalled talks between the EU and Canada.\u201d But she said the problems would not have a bearing on the UK\u2019s own negotiations about leaving the European Union, saying the UK was not seeking to replicate an existing model but build its own. More on the prime minister in parliament in the politics live blog: Most stock markets continue to move higher, with the FTSE 100 the notable exception. Helped by M&amp;A deals and better than expected manufacturing data for October, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up around 0.47% while in Europe Germany\u2019s Dax is 0.8% higher and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.65%. But after an early increase the FTSE 100 has fallen by 0.37% and is now back below the 7000 level in the wake of mixed data from the CBI. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The markets [are] continuing to be propelled by the day\u2019s better than expected PMI readings. The US was the latest to chip in with a decent manufacturing release this Monday, the flash figure coming in at an 11 month high of 53.2 against the 51.6 forecast. This ended up helping out both the dollar and the Dow Jones; the former took 0.1% off the pound, while the latter jumped nearly 100 points after the bell to approach 18250. Over in the Eurozone the DAX and CAC held onto their morning growth, the German and French indices rising 0.9% and 0.8% respectively. The FTSE, meanwhile, remained the Western anomaly, slipping by 0.2% as investors continued to react to this morning\u2019s troublesome CBI industrial order expectations slide. More from Reuters on Belgium\u2019s failure to agree the EU-Canada trade deal: \u201cWe cannot give a yes,\u201d Paul Magnette, the premier of the Wallonia region, told reporters as he emerged. He said the main problems remained not with Ottawa, which has already agreed to modifications in the deal, but with the EU authorities. Other Socialist-led regions, including bilingual capital Brussels, are ranged behind the Walloons, while Dutch- and German-speakers back Michel\u2019s liberal-led federal coalition: \u201cWe have a Yes from the federal, Flemish and German-speaking communities and it\u2019s a No from the others,\u201d said Flanders premier Geert Bourgeois after the meeting at Michel\u2019s residence lasting less than an hour. \u201cIt\u2019s a real shame,\u201d the center-right leader said. \u201cWe\u2019re the laughing stock of the whole world. It\u2019s bad for Wallonia, for Flanders, for Belgium, for Europe, for the whole world.\u201d Michel said it was too early to say Ceta was dead and that the Walloons and he were still open to dialogue but that he must inform Tusk that Belgium was not in a position to consent now to a deal that all 27 other EU member states are ready to support... Ceta supporters say it would increase trade between the partners by 20 percent and boost the EU economy by 12 billion euros ($13 billion) a year and Canada\u2019s by C$12 billion (US $9 billion). Walloons have concerns about the threat of surging pork and beef imports from Canada and an independent court system to settle disputes between states and foreign investors, which critics say allows multinationals to dictate public policy. Many EU leaders suspect the local government in Namur is using its devolved powers to play domestic politics. Dutch language Flemish newspaper De Morgen said on Monday that the Magnette\u2019s stance was both a matter of principle and opportunism, a chance to boost his reputation and to become leader of the center-left in Belgium. Strong domestic demand is one key factor behind the better than expected US PMI figures, according to IHS Markit chief business economist Chris Williamson. He said: Manufacturing showed further signs of pulling out of the malaise seen earlier in the year, starting the fourth quarter on a solid footing. Both output and new orders are rising at the fastest rates for a year amid increasingly widespread optimism that demand will pick up again after the presidential election, which has been commonly cited as a key factor that has subdued spending and investment in recent months. There are also signs that the drag from cost-cutting policies of deliberate inventory reduction is moving into reverse. Inventory-building should therefore provide an extra boost to the economy in the fourth quarter. Weak export growth, attributable to the strong dollar, and lacklustre hiring remain big areas of disappointment, and highlight an ongoing dependency on domestic demand and a need to keep labour costs low amid a still-uncertain economic and political outlook. More signs of strength in the US economy. The Market US manfacturing PMI for October has come in at 53.2, well above the 51.5 expected by analysts. It compares to final figure for September of 51.5. This is the highest manufacturing PMI figure since October 2015. The better than expected figure adds to the idea that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates before the end of the year, pushing the dollar higher and US Treasury bond prices lower. Merger Monday has given US stock markets an early lift, ahead of a spate of major results later in the week, including from Apple and Boeing. AT&amp;T\u2019s \u00a370bn offer for Time Warner is not the only deal on the table. Broker TD Ameritrade plans to pay $4bn for Scottrade Financial Services, while aircraft component maker Rockwell Collins is offering $6.4bn for B/E Aerospace. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 114 points or 0.6% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.45% higher and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.64%. Bullard also said: The St. Louis Fed\u2019s conclusion is that a single 25-basis-point increase in the policy rate\u2013from 38 to 63 basis points\u2013will get us very close to the Taylor rule value over the forecast horizon. [The Taylor rule provides a recommended setting for the FOMC\u2019s policy rate based on current values of observable macroeconomic variables, according to Bullard] Ahead of the latest US manufacturing data for October, a Federal Reserve member has repeated his belief that one further interest rate rise is all that is necessary for the moment. St Louis Federal Reserve president James Bullard told a conference in Arkansas: The current policy rate setting is just 38 basis points, extraordinarily low by postwar historical standards. The Federal Open Markets Committee is considering raising the policy rate to a somewhat higher level, [but] the St. Louis Fed\u2019s rate path projection is much flatter than the rest of the Committee. The bottom line: Low interest rates are likely to continue to be the norm over the next two to three years. Hopes that Belgium would back a European Union trade deal with Canada appear to have been dashed, putting the agreement in jeopardy. Belgian prime minister Charles Michel said he had told EC president Donald Tusk today that the country could not sign the deal because he had failed to get agreement from regional authorities, notably Wallonia. The EU had given Belgium\u2019s federal government until late on Monday to secure backing for a deal, or a summit to sign the Ceta agreement planned for Thursday would be cancelled. But according to Reuters, Michel said to reporters after meeting regional leaders: I have officially told Tusk that we have no agreement. He said he was still open to further talks with Wallonia and said it was too early to say whether Ceta, which has been in negotiations for several years, was dead. But Tusk is now expected to contact Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and call off Thursday\u2019s planned summit. The omens had not looked good ahead of the meeting between Michel and the leaders of five regional authorities , with Wallonia\u2019s premier Paul Magnette criticising the deadline placed on the deal. He said (quote from Reuters): Every time you try to put an ultimatum it makes a calm debate and a democratic debate impossible.. We don\u2019t need an ultimatum. We will not decide anything under an ultimatum or under pressure. Magnette says the deal is bad for Europe\u2019s farmers and gives too much power to global corporate interests. The latest Guardian Brexit dashboard has just been released, and it shows that Britain\u2019s economy is starting to lose momentum as the impact of June\u2019s referendum is felt. The dashboard is a comprehensive assessment of conditions in the UK economy, and it highlights that living standards are being squeezed as the slump in sterling hits people in the pocket. My colleague Angela Monaghan explains: The dashboard for October shows that four of the eight categories have performed worse than expected, two were as expected, and two were better. Inflation jumped more sharply than expected to 1%, the highest level in almost two years, Britain\u2019s trade deficit with the rest of the world widened, as growth in imports rose faster than exports, and retail sales were flat as shoppers were put off by higher clothing prices and exceptionally warm September. Here\u2019s the story: Economist Danny Blanchflower fears that Britain is facing an \u201concoming Brexit tsunami\u201d, while PwC\u2019s Andrew Sentance is more positive. Here are their takes: And you can see the full dashboard here: Here\u2019s a recent-ish photo of Cyrus Mistry: Cyrus Mistry\u2019s shock exit from Tata today is causing a real stir. My colleague Graham Ruddick says it has implications for steelworkers in South Wales, whose future has been in doubt since Tata announced plans to sell, or shut, it. The Economist\u2019s Stanley Pignal reckons Mistry paid the price for Tata\u2019s recent struggles. Now this is interesting... Tata, the Indian manufacturing giant, has just announced the departure of its chairman, Cyrus Mistry. Ratan Tata, who ran the company for two decades, is stepping in while a permanent successor is found. In a brief statement, Tata says: Tata Sons today announced that its Board has replaced Mr. Cyrus P. Mistry as Chairman of Tata Sons. The decision was taken at a Board meeting held here today. The Board has named Mr. Ratan N. Tata as Interim Chairman of Tata Sons. The Board has constituted a Selection Committee to choose a new Chairman. The Committee comprises Mr. Ratan N. Tata, Mr. Venu Srinivasan, Mr. Amit Chandra, Mr. Ronen Sen and Lord Kumar Bhattacharyya, as per the criteria in the Articles of Association of Tata Sons. The committee has been mandated to complete the selection process in four months. It\u2019s not immediately clear why Mistry is off, but Tata\u2019s somewhat-sprawling operations have been struggling to keep pace with rivals. The group is involved in steel, automobiles, consultancy, power, and mobile telecoms.... Bang on cue, AT&amp;T and Time Warner are defending their merger (which they claim is a \u201cperfect match\u201d) The US stock market is expected to follow Europe\u2019s lead, and open higher today. The benchmark S&amp;P 500 index is tipped to jump by 0.5% when trading begins (at 2.30pm BST). AT&amp;T\u2019s plan to acquire Time Warner for $85bn has given Wall Street a dose of merger fever, even though the deal has been criticised by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, and Democratic vice-presidential pick Tim Kaine: Some reaction to Microsoft\u2019s Brexit price hike: Brexit may mean Brexit, but it also means businesses paying a lot more for using Microsoft\u2019s products. The tech giant is hiking the cost of its enterprise software, by up to 22%, in response to the slump in the pound since June\u2019s referendum. It starts in January. As my colleague Alex Hern points out, other technology products and services have also spiked in cost recently: Newsflash: UK factories have suffered a fall in industrial orders this month. The CBI\u2019s monthly survey of manufacturers shows that the balance of orders fell to -17 this month, down from -6 in September. That suggests that factories are finding things a bit tougher this month. But... they\u2019re also more upbeat about future prospects. The CBI\u2019s business optimism index has risen to -8, from a positively gloomy -47 in September. And the balance of firms reporting higher exports rose to +8 over the last three months. Perhaps the most interesting line is that the weak pound isn\u2019t being cheered too loudly. Almost half the exporters surveyed said the fall in sterling was bad for their business (even though it should make their products more attractive in foreign markets). Today\u2019s report shows that the prices paid by UK factories for their materials jumped at the fastest rate in three years, and are expected to continue growing at above their long-term average over the quarter ahead. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI chief economist, says: \u201cManufacturers\u2019 are optimistic about export prospects and export orders are growing, following the fall in Sterling. \u201cHowever, the weaker Pound is also feeding through to costs, which are rising briskly and may well spill over into higher consumer prices in the months ahead. Back in the City, shares in UK defence firm Cobham have slumped by 17% this morning after it hit investors with its second profit warning in six months. Cobham is languishing at the bottom of the FSTE 250 leaderboard, after it warned that revenues and profits continue to miss expectations. More here: Eurozone investors are also cheered by political developments in Spain, where right-wing leader Mariano Rajoy has the green light to form another administration. After 10 months of deadlock, Spain\u2019s socialist party has decided not to oppose a confidence vote, meaning Rajoy should be clear to form a minority government. The move is unpopular with some left-wing politicians, who feel they shouldn\u2019t prop up Rajoy\u2019s PP party (which is facing a flurry of corruption charges). But the prospect of a stable government in Madrid, after two inconclusive elections, is encouraging traders to buy Spanish debt. This is driving down Spain\u2019s bond yields, meaning it can borrow at cheaper rates: The euro is struggling back from its lowest level in seven months. The single currency is hovering around $1.089, having earlier fallen as low as $1.086 - its weakest point since the EU referendum. The pound is little changed this morning, at $1.224 against the dollar. Caxton FX analyst Alexandra Russell-Oliver explains: Expectations that the Fed will move on interest rates by the end of the year, likely in December, have contributed to dollar strength. The euro remains relatively under pressure in light of ongoing stimulus from the European Central Bank. The pound continues to be driven by ongoing Brexit uncertainty ahead of the triggering of Article 50 by next March, particularly concerns that the UK will pursue a \u201chard\u201d Brexit. Today\u2019s PMI report also shows that eurozone firms are hiking prices this month, for the first time in over a year. Markit says: With demand firming, companies were increasingly able to charge higher rates to customers. Average prices charged for goods and services rose for the first time since August 2015. Higher prices were often a reflection of the need to pass rising costs on to customers. Average input costs increased at the steepest rate for 15 months, linked mainly to higher commodity prices, notably oil-related, as well as rising wage costs. October\u2019s \u2018flash\u2019 PMIs suggest the eurozone is growing at a quarterly rate of around 0.4%, says Markit. That would beat the 0.3% recorded between April and June, but is still rather unspectacular. Dutch financial blogger Jeroen Blokland believes that today\u2019s PMI survey shows the European Central Bank should start reining in its stimulus programme: The ECB\u2019s QE programme is due to run out next March. Last week, president Mario Draghi hinted that it could be extended, perhaps in December. Here\u2019s economist Marcus Wright on today\u2019s PMI report: Here\u2019s Julien Lafargue, European equities strategist at JP Morgan, on today\u2019s healthcheck on the eurozone economy: According to the flash PMIs estimates, after a difficult summer, the Eurozone is accelerating again at the start of the 4th quarter. The improvement in Services in Germany is particularly encouraging as this had been an area of concerns recently. The focus is now likely to switch to inflation dynamics with input costs in Germany rising at the fastest pace in nearly 1.5 years and backlogs of work in the Eurozone accumulating at the fastest rate for over 5 years. Although we believe this would be premature, this might trigger renewed concerns about the ECB having to \u201ctaper\u201d its quantitative easing in the coming months. [Tapering = cutting the size of the European Central Bank\u2019s stimulus programme, which is currently buying \u20ac80bn of new bonds each month] Boom! Eurozone companies are growing at their fastest rate this year, as they put the shock of Britain\u2019s Brexit vote behind them. Firms are benefitting from a surge in new orders, encouraging them to take on more staff to deal with a growing backlog of work. That\u2019s the message from Markit\u2019s monthly healthcheck on the eurozone economy, just released. Markit\u2019s flash composite Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index, which measures activity in the sector, has jumped to 53.7 from September\u2019s 52.6. That\u2019s the highest reading since December 2015, and much stronger than expected. Here are the details: As we covered earlier, Germany\u2019s PMI hit a three month high this week, while France\u2019s factories have made a welcome (and long-awaited) return to growth. The eurozone\u2019s manufacturing and service sectors both posted a rise in new output, at the highest rate since the start of this year. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says the future looks quite bright: \u201cThe eurozone economy showed renewed signs of life at the start of the fourth quarter, enjoying its strongest expansion so far this year with the promise of more to come. With backlogs of work accumulating at the fastest rate for over five years, business activity growth and hiring look set to accelerate further as we head towards the end of the year. \u201cOctober\u2019s PMI is consistent with a quarterly GDP growth rate of 0.4%, led by a 0.5% pace of expansion in Germany. Modest growth of 0.2-0.3% is being signalled for France, but there are various indicators which suggest that France will enjoy stronger growth in coming months, including a marked build-up of uncompleted work. More to follow.... Some early reaction: This is from Fred Ducrozet of Swiss bank Pictet: And here\u2019s Bloomberg\u2019s Maxime Sbaihi: European stock markets are rallying in early trading, led by France after its factory sector returned to growth. The French CAC has gained 0.65%, while in London the FTSE 100 is up 44 points, or 0.6%, at 7064. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx says: Finally crawling out of contraction territory the French manufacturing PMI hit a 10 month high of 51.3 this morning; the services sector wasn\u2019t so strong, however, slipping from 53.3 (revised down from 54.1) to 52.1 month-on-month. Germany, meanwhile, beat estimates on both counts; its manufacturing PMI came in at a 32 month peak of 55.1, with the services reading at a 3 month high of 54.1. This allowed the DAX and CAC to post some decent gains this Monday, rising 0.7% and 0.8% respectively. German companies have also beaten expectations, reporting their strongest growth in three months. Markit\u2019s Flash Germany Composite Output Index has jumped to 55.1 in October, up from September\u2019s 16-month low of 52.8. Factories reported their biggest leap in activity in almost three years, while service sector firms also picked up. That suggests Germany\u2019s private sector has put its recent slowdown behind it. Firms also reported that new orders grew at their fastest rate this year Oliver Kolodseike, Economist at IHS Markit said: \u201cThe German economy has entered the fast lane again at the start of the fourth quarter, with output growth accelerating from September\u2019s recent low. The improvement in the PMI in October lifts hopes that the weaker expansions we have seen in the past two months were just a temporary soft patch, rather than the beginning of a serious slowdown. Encouragingly, French business expectations have strengthened this month, with more bosses planning to spend more on advertising and new projects: Markit says: Some panellists were buoyed by the latest increases in demand, while planned rises in investment and marketing were expected to boost overall activity. Less encouragingly, French firms are still cutting staff: On the employment front, staffing levels were marginally lower for the fifth time in 2016 so far. Both manufacturing and services sectors recorded slight drops in employment, although the fall in manufacturing was the lowest recorded in eight months of job shedding. Here\u2019s Markit\u2019s snap summary of the French PMIs: France\u2019s manufacturing sector has given the markets an early-morning lift, by reporting that they\u2019ve posted their strongest growth this year. Factory output has hit its fastest rate since March 2014 this month, raising hopes that the eurozone\u2019s second-largest economy is picking up. This pushed the \u2018flash\u2019 French manufacturing PMI, produced by Markit, up to 51.5 in October, from 49.7 in September. That\u2019s a 10-month high, ending a long run of contraction. Any reading over 50 shows growth, so this indicates that French factories are enjoyinga decent enough autumn. However.... service sector growth slowed to a three-month low; meaning the \u2018composite PMI\u2019 actually dipped a little, to 52.2 from 52.7. Paul Smith, senior economist at IHS Markit, says the data is encouraging: \u201cAlthough growth slipped slightly in October, the latest data revealed a number of positives for the French economy, especially on the manufacturing side with rising exports supporting a marked uplift in output. With signs of intensifying capacity pressures and service providers indicating expectations for near-term growth, the outlook for the rest of 2016 looks reasonably positive.\u201d Next up, German PMI..... There\u2019s relief in the eurozone today, after Portugal successfully held onto its investment-grade credit rating on Friday night. There had been fears that rating agency DBRS would slash Portugal\u2019s credit rating in to junk territory, which would have had serious consequences for. But instead, DBRS maintained Lisbon\u2019s BBB rating with a \u201cstable\u201d outlook, despite earlier expressing concerns over low growth and high debt. That has sent Portugal\u2019s bonds rallying this morning, driving down the yield on 10-year debt to a six-week low of just 3.08%. If Portugal had been downgraded by DBRS, it would no longer have been eligible for the European Central Bank\u2019s quantitative easing programme. That would have driven up borrowing costs, and raised fears that the eurozone crisis was heating up again. Portugal\u2019s government welcomed the move, saying: \u201cToday\u2019s decision increases our own and the markets\u2019 confidence in the policies chosen for the country.\u201d But.... Fitch, S&amp;P and Moody\u2019s have already slashed Portugal into junk territory, expressing fears over its slow growth rates and high public debt. So Lisbon isn\u2019t out of the woods yet. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s going to be a big week for economic data. On Thursday, we learn how the UK economy performed in the last three months, immediately after the Brexit vote. Economists expect growth to slow to 0.3% or 0.4%, from 0.7% in April. That\u2019s a significant slowdown, but not as bad as some forecasters had predicted during the referendum campaign. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says it would be: ...not bad considering the doom and gloom about the UK economy, some may say. However, there are a few signs that Brexit is starting to weigh on the UK economy. Business investment is expected to be weak, and we expect another quarter of growth heavily reliant on the consumer. Going forward, we see consumer confidence flagging once Article 50 is triggered at some point early in Q1 next year. Then on Friday, we get US GDP figures for the third quarter. Growth is expected to speed up, to around 0.6% quarter-on-quarter. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets explains: This is an immensely important week in terms of economic data and we may see some serious firecrackers which lightens up some bonfire. We could potentially see massive swings in the forex and equity markets as investors scrutinized the third quarter GDP number for the US economy which is due at the end of the week. What traders want to know is that if the US economy is regaining traction. There\u2019s not much UK economic news today, apart from the CBI\u2019s regular healthcheck on UK industry (published at 11am BST). We also get a flash view of the European economy from 8am to 9am, when the latest surveys of manufacturing and services companies in France, Germany, and the wider eurozone are released. And Bank of England deputy governor Minouche Shafik is giving a speech in Hong Kong about macroprudential policies.",
