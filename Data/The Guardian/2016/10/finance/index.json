Helena Smith reports: </p> <blockquote> <p>Anger over the incendiary issue of home repossessions intensified as clashes broke out while a court in the northern metropolis convened over the issue. Judges were forced to adjourn the hearing as protestors, who have formed a citizens group called Collectives Against Auctions, rioted with police reinforcements sent to guard the building. Last week, the same group managed to stop a similar hearing over the foreclosure of a home belonging to a man who had defaulted on a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac300,000 bank loan after storming the court room. The man, a father- of-six, who also owed \u00e2\u201a\u00ac80,000 to the social security fund, claimed he had been unable to meet loan repayments after his business went bust and he had suffered a heart attack that had left him almost wholly incapacitated.</p> <p>Home repossessions are widely seen as a tipping point for Greeks at the sharp end of the biting austerity that has been the price of the debt-stricken country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rescue from insolvency. </p> <p>But within the 19-member eurozone Greece is also the champion in non-performing loans with the International Monetary Fund estimating that of the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac900bn worth of bad loans in the area around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac100bn belong to the portfolios of Greek banks. By contrast the Greek economy accounts for a mere 1.5 per cent of the eurozone. The IMF and the EU, which have poured over \u00e2\u201a\u00ac300bn in bailout funds into the country since mid 2010, are now pressuring the government to relax protection laws against home foreclosures. In the months ahead the wave of repossessions is expected to grow amid escalating concerns that the issue is assuming explosive proportions. Indicatively Michalis Sallas, the long-serving chairman of Piraeus Bank until resigning in July, recently warned: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Citizens cannot live with the fear of expulsion and repossession. It is to nobody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s benefit, not even the banks. Who will insure [properties], who will look after them, who will pay property tax?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd </p> <p>The Greek real estate market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with the exception of that on popular Greek islands \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is among the worst performing worldwide, with properties in Athens having lost up to 70 percent of their value since the crisis began. </p> </blockquote> <p><em>On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening.

US markets seemed happy to rally on the news, making up for the losses suffered yesterday. 2140 has held yet again for the S&amp;P 500, putting the index in a good position to challenge the all-time highs once again.

The man, a father- of-six, who also owed \u00e2\u201a\u00ac80,000 to the social security fund, claimed he had been unable to meet loan repayments after his business went bust and he had suffered a heart attack that had left him almost wholly incapacitated. Home repossessions are widely seen as a tipping point for Greeks at the sharp end of the biting austerity that has been the price of the debt-stricken country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rescue from insolvency. But within the 19-member eurozone Greece is also the champion in non-performing loans with the International Monetary Fund estimating that of the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac900bn worth of bad loans in the area around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac100bn belong to the portfolios of Greek banks. By contrast the Greek economy accounts for a mere 1.5 per cent of the eurozone. The IMF and the EU, which have poured over \u00e2\u201a\u00ac300bn in bailout funds into the country since mid 2010, are now pressuring the government to relax protection laws against home foreclosures. In the months ahead the wave of repossessions is expected to grow amid escalating concerns that the issue is assuming explosive proportions. Indicatively Michalis Sallas, the long-serving chairman of Piraeus Bank until resigning in July, recently warned: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Citizens cannot live with the fear of expulsion and repossession. It is to nobody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s benefit, not even the banks. Who will insure [properties], who will look after them, who will pay property tax?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Greek real estate market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with the exception of that on popular Greek islands \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is among the worst performing worldwide, with properties in Athens having lost up to 70 percent of their value since the crisis began. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. A mild recovery in the pound after better than expected UK service sector numbers saw the FTSE 100 drift back after Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s - failed - attempt at a new record. Meanwhile talk that the European Central Bank might begin tapering its bond buying programme took the wind out of European markets, with most ending lower. But strong US services data lifted Wall Street, albeit also prompting renewed talk of US rate rises this year. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 41.09 points or 0.58% at 7033.25 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.32% to 10,585.78 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.29% lower at 4489.95 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB added 1.03% to 16,476.58 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.11% at 8778.3 In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.66% to 575.37 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 129 points or 0.71%. As for the pound, it is up 0.17% at $1.2748 against the dollar and 0.19% higher at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1378. After Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempt at a new peak, the FTSE 100 continues to flounder as the day wears on. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Today has seen a reversal of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s action, when the FTSE 100 soared (at least in the morning) as others fell back. Now, we have Wall Street advancing, and European markets paring losses, while the FTSE 100 languishes towards the bottom end of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s range. Having been such a boon in recent days, the pound has perhaps hindered the index today, although sterling has recovered only a fraction of the ground lost since the beginning of the week... The US ISM non-manufacturing index hit a level not seen since November 2015, further boosting the cause of those expecting a Fed rate hike this year. US markets seemed happy to rally on the news, making up for the losses suffered yesterday. 2140 has held yet again for the S&amp;P 500, putting the index in a good position to challenge the all-time highs once again. A bounce in oil prices undoubtedly helped, after stockpiles dropped once again. Back with the IMF, and in a new report it says global debt has hit a new record. Jill Treanor reports: Global debt levels have reached a record $152tn (\u00c2\u00a3119tn) according to the International Monetary Fund \u00e2\u20ac\u201c more than double the size of the global economy at 225% of annual global output. The Washington-based fund said that two-thirds of the debt \u00e2\u20ac\u201c approximately $100tn is held by the private sector, or companies and households. The IMF warns that debt \u00e2\u20ac\u0153can carry great risks [at] excessive levels\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report shows that the overall debt level has not decreased since the the financial crisis and recession of 2007-09, despite the fact that the most severe downturn of the post-war era was the consequence of too much reckless borrowing. The IMF says that debt as a proportion of GDP has never been higher. The full story is here: And here is analysis from our economics editor Larry Elliott, who says governments must heed the ticking debt timebomb: Oil prices are moving even higher after a surprise decrease in US crude stocks. Brent crude is currently up 2% at $51.93 while West Texas Intermediate has jumped 2.3% to $49.84. Elsewhere the International Monetary Fund has weighed in on Deutsche Bank, saying it was one of the banks which needed to convince investors its business model was viable in a low interest rate environment. The bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have fallen sharply on concerns about its balance sheet and the consequences of a possible $14bn fine by the US Department of Justice. At the IMF meeting in Washington, the fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary and capital markets deputy director Peter Dattels said (quotes from Reuters): Deutsche Bank... is among banks that need to continue to adjust to convince investors that its business model is viable going forward and has addressed the issues of operational risk arising from litigation. He said the German authorities were closely monitoring Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health and that the European financial system remained resilient. And the non-farms? But which should investors look at most, the Markit or ISM figures? Despite these strong service sector figures Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, believes a US rate rise before December is unlikely: After slipping to a six-year low in August, the news that September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ISM non-manufacturing PMI has rebounded strongly will be welcomed by Fed Chair Janet Yellen. The US economy has been sending out mixed signals in recent months, and the uncertainty has not been helped by the speculation swirling around a long-anticipated interest rate hike. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s positive figures make the case for a rate rise stronger but, as we enter the final weeks of the presidential race, the general consensus is that it is unlikely we will see any movement before December. But the surveys could be an indicator for Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs figures: Anthony Nieves, chair of the ISM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-manufacturing survey committee, said: The comments from the respondents are mostly positive about business conditions and the overall economy. A degree of uncertainty does exist due to geopolitical conditions coupled with the upcoming U.S. presidential election. And here are some of the comments highlighted by the ISM: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Somewhat flat month of overall pricing conditions; however, labor cost and availability remains a concern.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Accommodation &amp; Food Services) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Business is showing a moderate unexpected uptick over last month.

Its non-manufacturing PMI came in at 57.1 in September, showing a strong rebound from 51.4 in August and well above estimates of a figure of 53. This is the highest level since October 2015 and the biggest rise in the index since February 2011. The first of the US service sector surveys shows a better than expected performance in September. The Markit services final purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index came in at 52.3 compared to an initial reading of 51.9 and a figure of 51 in August. This is the highest level since April. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final composite PMI figure for September was 52.3, up from the first reading of 52 and August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 51.5. With oil prices continuing to rise - West Texas Intermediate is up 1.9% at $49.63 a barrel - US markets are heading higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 99 points or 0.5% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both opened around 0.3% higher. The ADP report still shows a strong jobs market, said Mark Zandi, chief economist of co-complier Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Analytics: The current record of consecutive monthly job gains continued in September. With job openings at all-time highs and layoffs near all-time lows, the job market remains in full-swing. Job growth has moderated in recent months, but only because the economy is finally returning to full-employment. But Ahu Yildirmaz, vice president and head of the ADP Research Institute, said: Job gains in September eased a bit when compared to the past 12-month average. We also observed softening this month in trade/transportation/utilities, possibly due to a continued tightening U.S. labor market and lackluster consumer spending. Ahead of more key US data - services surveys later and the non-farm payrolls on Friday - came the monthly private sector jobs figures, and they have proved disappointing. According to payrolls processor ADP, US private employers added 154,000 jobs in September, below the 166,000 figure expected by economists. This was the smallest increase since April. August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s number was revised down from a 177,000 increase to 175,000. But previewing the ADP numbers Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, suggested they were no real guide to the non-farm numbers: In the US the warm up act for Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm payrolls report is the ADP Payrolls report for September. Sadly this report has given little indication in recent months of being any sort of bellwether to its bigger brother, being remarkably stable in and around the 175k level for the last 4 months [before September]. Utility shares have been weak all day on reports that Theresa May might hit out at the charges the companies make on consumers, and sure enough she said: Where companies are exploiting the failures of the market in which they operate, where consumer choice is inhibited by deliberately complex pricing structures, we must set the market right... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just not right that two thirds of energy customers are stuck on the most expensive tariffs. So SSE is down 1.5%, National Grid is nearly 2% lower and water companies United Utilities, Severn Trent and Pennon are down between 2% and 3% (although a downbeat note from RBC Capital is not helping the last three). By attacking ultra-loose monetary policy, Theresa May might actually have put a floor under the pound. Sterling is still hovering around $1.272, up from this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 31-year lows. Investors may have concluded that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little harder for the Bank of England to ease monetary policy again in November. Especially when the economic data is still better than feared. Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, explains: May certainly doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mince her words, and since she spoke we have seen a slight uptick in the pound versus both the dollar and the euro. The FTSE 100 is also off of its lows of the day, although it still remains comfortably above 7,000. This may seem counter-intuitive, but ultra low interest rates are not great for the banking sector, so May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s words could boost this sector and thus the pound and the FTSE 100 at the same time. Of course, the BOE is independent, so May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government should not be able to change policy. But her words could be enough to ease some of the downward pressure that has been building on the pound and could be enough to trigger a mini rally, potentially back above 1.28 in GBP/USD. Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech, and her criticism of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy, has gone down rather badly with that beacon of free market ideology, the Adam Smith Institute. Director Sam Bowman sounds like a man whose eyebrows got a thorough workout during the PM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech, saying: [There isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t] any evidence that clamping down on EU immigration will help British workers, but we will have to borrow more if immigration falls because they pay in more than they cost. Or that quantitative easing has made us worse off \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the evidence suggests that without it the post-crisis recession would have been deeper and longer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mrs May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech was the opposite of pragmatic. We call on the Prime Minister to abandon her ideological attachment to interventionist economic policies, look at the evidence, and accept that it tells us that markets, not the state, are the solution to our problems.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: The International Monetary Fund has warned that pension funds and insurance groups could be wiped out by the current era of ultra-low interest rates. From Washington, our economics editor Larry Elliott reports: Insurance companies and pension funds are at risk of becoming insolvent if ultra-low interest rates persist for a prolonged period, the International Monetary Fund has warned. After almost eight years in which central banks have kept borrowing costs at record lows in an attempt to boost growth, the IMF said an over-reliance on monetary policy could have unwanted side-effects. It used its half-yearly health check of the global financial system to advise that the calmer-than-expected conditions since the Brexit vote might not last. While short-term risks had abated over the past six months, the IMF said big challenges remained \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including the impact of record-low interest rates on pension funds and insurance companies, the fragility of banks, rapid credit growth in China and the heavy indebtedness of the corporate sector in emerging countries. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The solvency of many life insurance companies and pension funds is threatened by a prolonged period of low interest rates,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the IMF said in its global financial stability report (GFSR). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Larry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s piece: This makes Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intervention on monetary policy even more intriguing.... Theresa May will have pleased many older Brits by attacking the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus programme. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s absolutely right that QE has driven up assets prices; the whole idea is that central banks mop up \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsafe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 assets such as government bonds, and encourage investors to move money into risky things. Great if you own a house, a trust fund or a Canaletto... less good if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re relying on the income from savings. But.... central banks have been driven into ever-deeper stimulus efforts by the failure of the global economy to bounce back from the 2008 crisis. And governments must take some blame. In the UK, George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s austerity budgets relied heavily on the Bank of England propping up demand with record low interest rates. European central bankers have been dropping heavy hints for months that fiscal policy needs to do more work, and that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re running short of ammo. Perhaps May has got the message..... Wowzers.... Theresa May has just fired a broadside at the Bank of England over its stimulus programme. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s addressing the Tory faithful in Birmingham now, and (in between outlining her Brexit vision and promising a clampdown on tax dodgers), she blasted the era of ultra-low interest rates and bond-buying. May declared: While monetary policy with super low rates and quantitative easing have provided emergency medicine, we have to acknowledge some of the bad side effects. People with assets have got richer, while people without have not\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 A change has got to come, and we are going to deliver it because that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what a Conservative government can do. That sounds like a serious intervention into monetary policy, frankly, aimed at governor Mark Carney (who, as a Canadian, may already be concerned about the Tory\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attacks on firms who hire foreign workers) Our Politics Liveblog has all the details: Over in Greece, air traffic control workers have called a strike in protest at proposals to reform their industry. The shake-up is part of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout programme, and due to be debated by MPs later this week. Reuters has the details: Greek air traffic controllers plan to walk off the job over four days from October 9th, grounding flights in protest at changes to their job descriptions under reforms pursued by the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign creditors. Their union said on Wednesday they would stage 24-hour strikes on October 9th and 10th, and October 12th-13th inclusive. All but emergency and search-and-rescue flights along with flights through the Athens Flight Information region would be suspended. Walkouts by Greek air traffic controllers, a department considered an essential service, have in the past been deemed illegal by Greek courts and been cancelled. The announcement on industrial action coincided with the submission of draft legislation to parliament on Tuesday evening seeking to introduce changes to the structure of the civil aviation department. So any Brits who can still afford to fly to Greece following the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tumble may have a problem (unless the courts step in...). How low could the pound go, as Britain rattles towards triggering article 50 next March (or earlier). Koon How Heng, a senior foreign-exchange strategist at Credit Suisse, believes sterling could easily hit $1.25, or lower... He told CNBC that he still has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a very negative view on sterling\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Officially, our forecast for sterling dollar is at 1.25. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We would think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to head lower. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably going to go down the tubes.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a subdued feeling on City trading floor today, after the FTSE 100 failed (just) to hit a new alltime high yesterday. The blue-chip index has shed almost 0.6%, or 40 points, to 7034 - despite Tesco soaring higher after impressing investors with its financial results today. And the smaller FTSE 250, which did hit a record high last night, has lost 0.7%. European stock markets are also in the red, today, following reports that the European Central Bank might wind back its bond-buying stimulus programme. Currently, the ECB is creating \u00e2\u201a\u00ac80bn of new money each month to buy new bonds. Bloomberg says that policymakers have considered tapering it -- steadily trimming the monthly purchases. Although the ECB denies discussing tapering, the prospect of the easy money tap being turned down has depressed the markets. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, explains: The bullish sentiment that drove yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sensational rise in the FTSE has been dampened today, with markets largely responding to the fears that perhaps the seemingly unlimited ECB QE could be limited after all. Rumours of exit plans being drawn up at the ECB highlight the growing feeling that Draghi &amp; co are facing up to a exhaustion of monetary policy policies and effectiveness. Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent has weighed in on the Brexit issue, saying June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote has caused rather less economic damage than feared. In a speech this morning, Broadbent says: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little doubt that the economy has performed better than surveys suggested immediately after the referendum and, although we aimed off those significantly, somewhat more strongly than our near-term forecasts as well. Why? Broadbent suggests the UK economy had more \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunderlying momentum than expected\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Second, the housing market may hold be better than feared. And there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also the possibility that the weak pound is supporting the economy. Broadbent says: The foreign exchange market attempts to price long-run risk and, to my mind, the currency fell after the referendum for fear of what the result might ultimately mean for the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s access to global markets. But if that is a risk for the longer term, once the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new trading arrangements come into force, those arrangements are for the time being unchanged. Against that backdrop, the fall in the exchange rate will help to support activity, cushioning the impact of greater uncertainty. While that was expected, the effect could be coming through faster than we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d anticipated. The speech also takes a good look at the impact, and causes, of record low bond yields (a massive headache for pension funds), and the wider issue of economic uncertainty. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s online here. This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t how Theresa May would like her first conference as Tory leader to be remembered. But it appears that the slump in the pound vs the euro this week means Britain has fallen to sixth place in the list of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest economies, behind our old friends France. The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris Giles has crunched the numbers, and explains: International Monetary Fund estimates of the size of economies in 2016 puts the UK at \u00c2\u00a31,932bn with France weighing in at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2,228bn, putting the UK ahead so long as a pound buys more than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.153. At the start of the week, the prime minister, chancellor, foreign secretary and Brexit secretary all boasted that Britain would get a good deal in EU talks because Britain was the fifth-largest economy in the world. At that stage their words could be justified with sterling worth \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.16 at the end of last week. The paradox of the tough talk \u00e2\u20ac\u201d with suggestions that Britain will leave the single market and clamp down heavily on immigration \u00e2\u20ac\u201d has been to pull the rug from under sterling, leaving it at a post-Brexit low of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.14 on Wednesday and below the point at which it is the fifth-largest economy. The pound is currently hovering around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.134, having hit a five-year low this morning. The encouraging service sector PMI has given the poor old pound a bit of relief. Sterling has now struggled back from its early morning selloff, and is now back around $1.2740 against the US dollar. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve now had three months worth of PMI data, since the UK referendum. And they suggest that the economy did deteriorate in July, before bouncing back in August and September. David Noble, CEO at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, is also encouraged by September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector report. Policymakers were offered much-needed positive news for September after the recent Brexit upheaval, as the service sector reported the fastest increase in new business since February this year. Though the overall activity index still remained below its long-term average and had dipped slightly compared to August, it reflected a modest revival of fortunes for services businesses. But although firms took on more workers in September, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disquiet\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd around Brexit still remains, Noble says: The sector concentrated on stabilising rather than forging ahead with confidence, as optimism stayed below the long- term average.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fears that Britain could be falling into recession have faded, following today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector data. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, believes the UK has regained \u00e2\u20ac\u0153modest growth momentum\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Across the three sectors [Services, Construction and Manufacturing] the pace of economic growth signalled was the strongest since January, fuelling greater job creation as companies shrugged off short-term Brexit worries and enjoyed the benefits of a weaker currency. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The improvement suggests the economy has regained a growth rate of approximately 0.3% after recovering from the initial shock of the EU referendum in late-June. If July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s low is included, the PMI surveys point to a mere 0.1% expansion of GDP in the third quarter, but this probably overstates the weakening in the rate of growth. Breaking: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services sector grew faster than expected last month, as firms shake off the shock of June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eu referendum. The Service Sector PMI, produced by data firm Markit, has come in at 52.6. That shows slightly slower growth than August (52.9), but comfortably ahead of estimates. Markit reports that: Activity rises but growth rate eases slightly New business grows at fastest rate since February Largest input cost rise since February 2013 Service sector firms reported that new business rose at the fastest pace since February, as customer enquiries picked up and confidence recovered. There was also \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rising demand from overseas clients\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd linked to the weak pound. However, there are also worries that the slump in sterling is driving up import costs. Markit says: The UK service sector continued to recover from July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum-induced shock, However, future expectations remained very low by historical standards and the survey recorded the sharpest increase in service sector input prices in over three-and-a-half years. More to follow.... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car industry seems to have ridden out the Brexit storm, so far anyway. New car registrations in the UK rose 1.6% in September to hit a new record, according to new data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. But SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes warns that the industry could yet be damaged: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The ability of the market to maintain this record level of demand will depend on the ability of government to overcome political uncertainty and safeguard the conditions that underpin consumer appetite\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd How bad would a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 be? Well, according to a new report, 70,000 financial services jobs could be lost if the UK leaves the single market. Up to \u00c2\u00a310bn of tax revenue could be wiped out too -- if British firms lost the ability to sell services across the European single market. The key is whether Britain retains its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpassporting\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rights, which currently allow City firms to operate in every EU country without separate licences or offices on the ground. The report, by consultancy group Oliver Wyman for TheCityUK lobby group, says that Britain would only suffer a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmodest reduction\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in activity, if it retained access to the single market. In this scenario, revenues are predicted to decline by up to \u00c2\u00a32BN (2% of total wholesale and international business), 4,000 jobs would be at risk, and tax revenues would fall by less than \u00c2\u00a30.5BN per annum. However, losing access to the single market would be much more serious ... Under conditions where the UK moves to a third country arrangement with the EU, without any regulatory equivalence and its relationship with the EU is defined by terms set out under the World Trade Organization, up to 50% of EU-related activity (\u00c2\u00a320BN in revenue) and an estimated 35,000 jobs could be at risk, along with \u00c2\u00a35BN of tax revenues per annum. When taking into consideration the knock-on impact to the whole financial services ecosystem \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the possibility of shifting of entire business units, or the closure of lines of business due to increased costs it could almost double the effect of Brexit. The Conservatives are promising a hard line on immigration -- so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to see how they can restrict the movement of people into the UK, while retaining the movement of capital out of it... Just in: growth in the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector slowed in September, suggesting Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy may have hit a soft patch. The monthly Eurozone Service sector PMI, from Markit, has dropped to 52.2, from 52.8 in August. That shows the slowest growth in activity since December 2014. And the wider \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccomposite\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 measure, including manufacturing, shows growth slowed to its weakest since January 2015. Growth picked up in France (hurrah!), but dipped in Germany, Ireland and Spain (boo) It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fairly unusual for a party conference to move the currency markets. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no doubt that the news from the Conservative\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meet-up in Birmingham this week has weakened the pound. Jeremy Cook of World First, the currency trading firm, says: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another day and another set of fresh post-Brexit lows for sterling against the majority of its trade partners. Trade weighted sterling has been lower than it is now \u00e2\u20ac\u201c following the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal from the ERM in the early 90s and as the Global Financial Crisis hit in 2008 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exporters must be praying that this Conservative Party Conference lasts another 6 weeks. Has Tesco turned the corner? Shares in the supermarket chain have jumped by 8% this morning, after its latest financial results. Investors are cheering a chunk rise in operating profits (but not in pre-tax levels), from \u00c2\u00a3372m to \u00c2\u00a3515m, and sales growth across the business. On the downside, the pension deficit has more than doubled this year.... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency has effectively been devalued by 15% against major rivals since June 23rd. Some analysts are predicting the pound could suffer further shunts downwards, as the EU exit negotiations begin in earnest. In today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Times, Koon Chow, macro and forex strategist at UBP, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drop is likely to be a series of spaced out depreciations, with the trigger for weakness being each piece of new information on the economic sacrifice that the UK government is willing to take on the path to Brexit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has also dropped in early trading, even through a weak pound is good for some companies. The FTSE 100 index, which nearly hit a record high yesterday, has dropped by 18 points to 7056. And the UK-focused FTSE 250 has also dipped by around 0.2% Sterling is continuing its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153slippery decline\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd this week as ongoing Brexit uncertainties haunt investor attraction towards the currency. So says FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga, who reckons investors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t taking comfort from recent solid economic data. Brexit jitters may be bone deep consequently ensuring the Sterling remains depressed until the article 50 invoke date. Although sentiment towards the UK economy continues to be uplifted as domestic data repeatedly beats, the persistent uncertainty and unknowns over how the Brexit negotiations will take place have seriously soured investor appetite towards the Sterling. This chart shows how sterling has hit new 31-year lows this morning, below $1.27. The pound has now lost almost three cents against the US dollar this week (and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only Wednesday morning). Theresa May knocked the wind out of sterling on Sunday, when she announced she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d trigger article 50 in March 2017, raising the chances of a hard break from the EU. Fears over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s looming exit from the European Union are hitting the pound again this morning. Sterling has slipped to a fresh 31-year low against the US dollar, falling below $1.27 for the first time since 1985. The pound is currently changing hands at $1.26932, down 0.25% today, extending yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. Sterling has also slid to a new five-year low against the euro in the last few minutes. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now worth just \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1321, meaning one euro is worth 88.3p. So what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening? Simply put, the pound is being rattled by worries about a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. That could see UK firms lose access to the single market as the government priorities control over immigration. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Two down, one to go. After solid data from Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing and construction sector this week, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to find out how the services sector performed in September. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services report, released at 9.30am, is expected to show steady growth. Economists expect the PMI to come in at 52.1, down from 52.9 in August. That would show another month of solid growth, despite the shock of the Brexit vote in June. And given that the manufacturing and construction PMIs both beat forecasts this week, perhaps services will do to. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets suspect we MAY learn that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is growing faster than thought. The September Markit/CIPS services PMI for the UK is due this morning. So far both the manufacturing and construction sector PMIs have surprised very clearly to the upside. A repeat in the services sector would reinforce the upside risks to our Q3 GDP growth forecast of -0.1% q/q which materialised after last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong news on output in the service sector in July. The eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector gets its own healthcheck too, at 9am. Also coming up today... The International Monetary Fund will release its Global Financial Stability Report at 1.45pm BST, highlighting the main dangers to the world economy. The Eurozone sovereign debt markets could be lively, following a report that the European Central Bank has been considering whether to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctaper\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 its bond-buying stimulus programme. Supermarket chain Tesco is reporting results this morning; profits are down by a quarter, but like-for-like sales are up 0.6% in the last six months. And Ben Broadbent, deputy governor of the Bank of England, is giving a speech at 9.30am in London. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

That could be compounded by a drop in physical exports, depending on the trade terms that Britain agrees with the rest of the world.</p> <p>Desmond Lachman, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, fears that the current account deficit will get even worse, pushing the pound down. He writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There appear to be at least two reasons to believe that market fears about the consequences of a hard Brexit for continued large capital flows to the UK are not misplaced. The first is that, were the UK no longer to have ready access to Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s single market for its exports, it would lose its attractiveness as a location for foreign companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 European investments. This was precisely the point that the Japanese government made at the September G20 meeting in China \u00e2\u20ac\u201c when it publicly warned its UK counterparts of the likelihood that Japanese companies would relocate out of the UK in the event of a hard Brexit.</p> <p>The second reason is that a hard Brexit would almost certainly result in the loss of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfinancial passport\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that City of London financial institutions currently enjoy for accessing the European market. A Financial Conduct Authority report in September suggested that as many as 5,500 UK financial firms could be affected by such a loss of passport rights. Major international banks including JP Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs have warned that, if the City loses its financial passport, they will need to conduct at least part of their European operations from outside the UK.</p> <p>A key point that those in favour of a hard Brexit overlook is that a rapid drying up of foreign capital flows to the UK would have dire consequences for domestic living standards. A further currency dip would raise import costs and increase inflation. Moreover, there is a likelihood that domestic economic policy would need to be tightened \u00e2\u20ac\u201c both to contain inflation and to make room for a large narrowing in the external current account deficit that foreigners would no longer be prepared to finance. UK households would be forced to reduce their consumption levels painfully, while businesses would be forced to cut back on their investment plans, to the detriment of future UK growth prospects.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.omfif.org/analysis/commentary/2016/october/on-the-road-to-a-sterling-crisis/\">More here</a></strong>.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-06T09:49:48.678Z\">at 10.49am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f60476e4b08ebe3d55755f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-06T08:00:51.273Z\">9.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>HSBC has knocked up a handy chart showing some of the possible relationships that Britain could have with the EU (<em>and what it is giving up</em>):</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MxSba/status/783933535459676160\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Lost in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash\">#Brexit</a> options?

                "bodyText":"With investors cautious ahead of the US non=farm payroll numbers on Friday, markets slipped back once more. Brexit concerns and continuing weakness in the pound added to the nervousness, amid growing anxiety about whether the UK would stay in the single market. Things were not helped by a profit warning from budget airline easyJet. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 0.47% or 33.29 points at 6999.96 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.16% to 10,568.80 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.22% at 4480.10 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB was the exception, up 0.09% at 16,491.62 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.24% at 8757.4 In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.20% to 574.22 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 19 points or 0.1%. Meanwhile the pound is down 0.85% at $1.2640 - off its worst level of $1.2623 - and 0.42% lower against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1324. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. At the IMF and World Bank meeting, there has been a strong defence of globalisation. Larry Elliott reports: The leaders of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have launched a strong defence of open markets and free trade, as concern grows that the Brexit vote and calls for protectionism in the US presidential election represent a backlash against globalisation. Christine Lagarde, the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s managing director, said international trade had been a force for good in the past few decades but that without a more equal division of the benefits of growth there was a risk of barriers going back up. As part of a concerted push back against protectionism, the World Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president, Jim Yong Kim, said China had lifted 700 million people out of poverty as a result of trade and opening its economy to competition. Kim said the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote to leave the European Union, the US presidential race and looming elections in Europe were adding to uncertainty. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These are all risks. Uncertainty is normally very bad for most developing countries.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Outlining her global policy agenda, Lagarde said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Policymakers should act and use a balanced mix of all policy levers to revive demand and raise productivity, and ensure the gains from technology and globalisation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which have led to unprecedented global welfare gains in recent decades \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are shared more broadly. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A retreat from globalisation and multilateralism is a serious risk at a time when international cooperation and coordination are as critical as ever.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The full story is here: Following UK prime minister Theresa May criticising the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quantitative easing programme and chancellor Philip Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s subsequent comments backing Mark Carney to stay on at the Bank of England, the governor is defending himself in Washington. He said he agreed with the spirit of May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments on QE and admitted monetary policy had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153distributional consequences\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but said it was not the job of the central bank to offset those. And he said May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments were absolutely not an attack on the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence. As a reminder, this is what May said: Because while monetary policy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with super-low interest rates and quantitative easing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c provided the necessary emergency medicine after the financial crash, we have to acknowledge there have been some bad side effects. People with assets have got richer. People without them have suffered. People with mortgages have found their debts cheaper. People with savings have found themselves poorer. A change has got to come. And we are going to deliver it. Just days after all the excitement about the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading index soaring through the 7000 barrier and heading towards a new high, it has sagged back below that level with a bit of a whimper. It has closed down 33.29 points at 6999.96 as the uncertainty over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the European Union continued, with the trade off between migration controls and remaining in the single market still unresolved. Fears of a hard Brexit continued despite chancellor Philip Hammond maintaining the government would seek the right Brexit for both the UK and EU. Better than expected US weekly jobless claims - coming ahead of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm payroll numbers - have renewed talk that the Federal Reserve would have leeway to raise interest rates, and thus helped push the dollar higher. That of course means the pound continues to be pressured, as if there were not enough negative noises around the UK currency. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: There were three G\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selling off in markets; the Great British pound, gilts and gold. An apparent shift in UK politics under the wing of Teresa May towards an interventionist and anti-business agenda was not received well in markets. The pound slid again in what has become a relentless barrage of selling, UK government bonds were sold and the FTSE 100 underperformed its European peers. Comments from the German chancellor have also been taken as another sell signal for the pound. Connor Campbell at Spreadex said: It seems that we are firmly back in Brexit-dominating territory \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even the mildest squawkings from the news-wire are causing pain for the pound. Today it was the turn of Angela Merkel to make sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life even more difficult, the German leader resolute in her claim that freedom of movement is a must if Britain wants to stand any chance of remaining in the single market. This, alongside seemingly the very idea that Chancellor Phillip Hammond has had to make a trip to Wall Street to reassure US banks about London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position as a financial hub post-Brexit, has led the pound to its latest 31 year nadir against the dollar and a 5 year low against the euro. At the moment the pound is down 0.8% at $1.2646 and 0.47% lower against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1319. Philip Hammond has also been on CNBC, reports Reuters: Any future decision on whether the British government should approve another round of quantitative easing to spur the economy will be taken \u00e2\u20ac\u0153carefully and cautiously,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd finance minister Philip Hammond said on Thursday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I approved a round of quantitative easing back at the beginning of August as a response to the shock that the economy had felt, but we are conscious of the impacts that QE has and we will use it carefully and cautiously,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hammond, who is currently in New York, said in a television interview with CNBC. On Wednesday British Prime Minister Theresa May said low interest rates and quantitative easing have bad side-effects. And Reuters: British finance minister Philip Hammond said on Thursday that he would focus on increasing the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic output by improving productivity, but that overall growth could slow as Britain barred most low-skilled European Union migrants. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What we need to drive is a growth in GDP per capita. We need to see our economic expansion coming from an improvement in productivity, not simply from bringing ever larger numbers of low skilled people into the economy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hammond said in an interview with Bloomberg TV in New York. Economic data earlier on Thursday showed British productivity continued to lag other countries after several years in which growth has been driven by a growing workforce, which includes higher numbers of EU migrants. Hammond also said Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government was looking at the costs and benefits of remaining in a customs union with the EU, as being outside would have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153frictional costs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for manufacturers such as carmakers. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take on their interview with chancellor Philip Hammond: The U.K. will use Brexit to build on historic trading relationships outside of the EU, Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond told Bloomberg TV in New York. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We want to get the right Brexit for Britain,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hammond told Bloomberg Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait. He described the U.K. as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mid-Atlantic in the way it does business,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and said capitalism faced problems across the developed world. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have a problem, not just a British problem but a developed world problem, in keeping our populations engaged and supportive of our market capitalism economic model,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hammond said. Hammond, who is on a visit to U.S. to meet Wall Street bosses and attend meetings of the International Monetary Fund, said he would make protecting London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial sector a priority for him. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It will be one of the U.K. government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s objectives to ensure that parts of the financial services sectors that are Europe-facing are able to continue doing business in Europe.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Philip Hammond may not want to disclose whether he thinks the value of sterling is too high or too low, but he might be pleased to know it has come off its lows of the day. The pound is currently at $1.2646, down 0.8% on the day but above the new 31 year low of $1.2623 it reached earlier. Question: Should Mark Carney (one of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best known foreign workers) stay on longer as Bank of England governor? I think the governor is doing a good job. The bank is fulfilling its remit very effectively. It helped us recover from the financial crisis and helped us smooth the shock that came on 23rd June. It is Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision...I would welcome his decision to stay if that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the decision he makes. And there the interview ends. Question: isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t UK economy doing ok? Media is focussing on backward data. UK economy was stronger than we thought.. but the concensus of forecasters is suggesting growth will slow as we go through period of negotiation until we have certainty over our position with EU. Business investment is the key focus. Business postpones decisions if climate is uncertain. We want to bring back certainty as soon as we can. Question: Investment outside London? We have a productivity problem in UK, and one of drivers is regional disparity. We are hugely underinvested in transport links [in northern region]. We will continue to support Northern powerhouse and other regions. On infrastructure, lot is done by private sector. In public sector, we have an opportunity to borrow cheaply and we have further capacity for targeted investments in productive infrastructure. But with our debt to GDP ratio we cannot have unrestrained programme of public spending. After shock of Brexit decision there will be a period of uncertainty, we have to support the economy through that. Question: Sterling gone down since Brexit. Does UK economy work at this level? We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t target exchange rate level. Market makes its judgement, and that can change quickly. The market determines the appropriate level and we are committed to free floating exchange rate system. Question: Theresa May seemed more critical of business than previous PMs. Is government anti-business? Absolutely not. We are pro-business. But we [Western economies} have a problem in keeping populations supportive of capital market model. People feel economy is not working for them, they are losers. We have to re-engage those people who feel they do not have a stake any more. We have to address signs of a sizeable amount of people becoming disenchanted. We have to deal with rogue operators. We have examples in UK of companies abusing market power, abusing workers. We have to deal with that. PM said there is a limit to the power of government but doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean they have no power at all. They have to make sure markets work properly. Sending out strong message that best way to make people free and prosperous is to have a free liberal economy. Question: is there any economic advantage to Brexit? In the long term yes and outside the EU we will build on historic trading links. Our economy is more mid-Atlantic than Europe. One reaction so far: Question: EU will say you either get migration controls or single market. From conference it appears migration is more important. Hammond: I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree. There will be discussions and there will have to be give and take on both sides... if there is a solution that is advantageous to both sides. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t delude ourselves our European partners owe us any favours. They still want access to UK market. It has to be a win-win solution. But we have to realise the Brexit vote said implicitly that we should not have freedom of movement in way we had in the past. That is about control, not saying people from Europe cannot come into the UK. This is a negotiation, we both have our starting positions and will discuss it. We have an economy heavily integrated with the EU after forty years. One of things we have to do is analyse benefits and costs of being in a customs union. Question: could we not have a longer transition period that 2 years? No doubt the process of negotiation is something we will begin to discuss. The arrangements for UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit, and arrangements for future relations. No one thought Article 50 would be used, it does not answer a lot of the questions. On passporting, allowing banks etc to trade across Europe: There are different options, passporting, equivalents. It will be one of our objectives that financial services companies doing business in Europe can continue to do so. On the number of foreign workers being limited: The problem is not highly skilled workers, banks, surgeons.. coming to the UK. The issue is people with low skills competing for entry level jobs. Our economy is growing but GDP per capita is not. Have to drive that. We will need some low skilled people but our demographics are different to elsewhere in Europe. We have population still growing before immigration. Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interview is live, and begins with Brexit and the worries of financial firms about what it will mean for them. He says we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recognise a distinction between hard and soft Brexit. It has to be the right Brexit for UK and EU. On financial services, he says it is an important part of the UK economy. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll place high priority on right solution. There are some specific needs and issues we have to understand. On euro clearing, he said ECB tried before to force clearing to take place within EU, and the court said it had no power to make such a rule. When Britain leaves EU, there will be countries not in euro but in EU requiring protection of single market. So not clear ECB could require euro clearing to be moved. And after Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments seen as critical of the Bank of England, Hammond seems more positive on governor Mark Carney: Philip Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interview should be available to watch here shortly. And on the state of the UK economy following the Brexit vote: And following the UK productivity figures earlier: Interviewer John Micklethwait tackles Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism of business in her Conservative party conference speech on Wednesday: So Hammond is reinforcing the comments made by Theresa May over the weekend, which suggested immigration controls would take priority over remaining in the single market. (Those comments of course started this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide in the pound.) Earlier German chancellor Angela Merkel said that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s four freedoms of movement \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for labour, capital, services and goods \u00e2\u20ac\u201c could not be split up. If Europe didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stick to the position that full access to the internal market is conditioned on freedom of movement, Merkel said, each member state would start doing what it wanted. UK chancellor Philip Hammond is speaking at Bloomberg and journalist Heidi Moore is tweeting the highlights: And on whether euro-clearing activities would move out of the City of London after Brexit, he said: IMF managing director Christine Lagarde has been giving her press conference ahead of the fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting in Washington. And in the wake of UK prime minister Theresa May calling for the benefits of globalisation to be shared by all, Lagarde said: The value of British government debt is falling today, matching sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. This has pushed up the interest rate, or yield, on 10-year gilts to 0.89%, from 0.82% yesterday. That implies it would cost the government more to issue new debt. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market continues to improve. Just 249,000 US citizens filed new claims for unemployment benefit last week, down from 255,000. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the lowest since April, and means the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfour-week moving average\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of new claims has hit its lowest level in over 40 years;. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely to help the US dollar strengthen, and mean more pain for the pound. Over in Germany: Deutsche Bank has announced plans to cut 1,000 jobs in its domestic market, as part of a restructuring plan. This takes the total of jobs being cut to 9,000, including 4,000 in Germany itself. The restructuring is meant to cut Deutsche\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s costs, and help it build up its capital reserves. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still no word on the ongoing negotiations with the US authorities over a fine for mis-selling toxic mortgage-backed securities before the 2008 crisis. Over in New York, traders are expecting Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares to tumble when trading begins in one hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are down 17% in pre-market trading, after the Recode website reported that Google is unlikely to bid for the social media platform. The pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still falling... down a whole cent today at $1.2640. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK, reckons sterling is being hit hard by speculators who are determined to drive it lower. He says further losses are a real possibility: Bears are out for blood and they want to squeeze every single drop out of this trade. Although this is the most crowded trade on the street today, but it is not preventing them to keep piling up their bets. My biggest worry is that short squeeze can happen soon as we are approaching towards an important level of support which is at $1.25. However, if the selling pressure remains this aggressive, we could easily break this support and we could be looking at the level of $1.22. A wave of selling has just swept the pound down to a fresh 31-year low against the US dollar, just $1.2664. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the weakest level since June 1985, and means sterling has lost more than three cents since Theresa May pledged to trigger article 50 by March 2017. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some chart action from the Financial Times\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Katie Martin: Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser to German investment giant Allianz, says Philip Hammond faces a very tricky mission today. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, El-Erian says Hammond will have to justify Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conference speech yesterday: I would hate to be the chancellor right now. He has a hard job explaining what his prime minister just said. Hammond has three tasks, El-Erian adds: He has to explain the notion of hard Brexit, explain PM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments about the rootless international elite and the harm they create, and explain the criticism of the Bank of England. Wall Street may find some of this surprising, El-Erian adds, given that (in his view) the UK has benefitted a lot from globalisation, and the government has benefitted from the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus programme. Without low interest rates and QE, May would be facing an economic mess, he concludes. Sterling is coming under more pressure, falling by 0.6 of a cent to $1.2690, close to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 31-year low. Paresh Davdra, chief executive of foreign exchange firm RationalFX, says chancellor Hammond may get a sceptical reception from Wall Street bankers today: Philip Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visit to Wall Street later today will see the Chancellor try to convince the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest banks that Britain is open for business. It comes weeks after the Prime Minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own talks with Wall Street bankers and is the latest in a series of international visits from UK ministers in an attempt to allay fears over Brexit and drum up support for new trade. Although previously met with scepticism due to the uncertainty surrounding the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU, Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visit will be the first since the likelihood of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit by early 2017 was confirmed. The Chancellor is expected to tell Wall Street that the UK is still a financial hub for global business. The challenge he will face will be in reassuring banks that the UK is indeed still a safe-bet investment in a week that has seen the pound plunge to a new three decade low against the dollar on the prospect of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit and businesses within the City of London warn that it could cost the city \u00c2\u00a338 billion. Whilst a timetable for Brexit makes Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job easier in some respects, it remains to be seen if Wall Street can be convinced by him.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound has dropped by 0.25% today but is still clinging onto the $1.27 level. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s above yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 31-year low, despite worries about a hard Brexit. Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s broadside at ultra-low interest rates appears to be propping up sterling. Over in Greece, the unemployment rate has dropped to a four-year low, but remains far too high. The Greek jobless rate dipped to 23.2% in July from 23.4% in June \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the lowest since March 2012, but more than double the eurozone average after years of austerity. The pound continues to bob around the $1.273 mark, as traders wait for news of Philip Hammond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meetings in New York. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about half a cent above the 31-year low struck on Wednesday. Angela Merkel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments about freedom of movement being intrinsic to the EU haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eased concerns about a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. And Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attacks on the wealthy \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcglobal elite\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 have also left City investors feeling vulnerable. Chris Turner, the head of currency strategy at ING, explains: May has pushed her party way across the centre ground \u00e2\u20ac\u201c taking issue with self-serving individuals and businesses and appealing to the non-metropolitan voter. That does not bode well for financial services in Brexit discussions. (Thanks to Reuters for the quote) Newsflash from Berlin: the German chancellor Angela Merkel is telling industry leaders that Brexit is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153watershed moment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the EU. Merkel also says negotiations won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be easy and will determine what access each side has to the other\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market. Talks cannot start until Britain triggers article 50, she says. The chancellor also warns that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s four freedoms of movement \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for labour, capital, services and goods \u00e2\u20ac\u201c can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be split up. If Europe doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stick to the position that full access to the internal market is conditioned on freedom of movement, Merkel says, each member state will start doing what it wants. Earlier today, Germany reported that factory orders jumped by 1%, thanks to a surge of domestic orders. This suggests that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t being dragged back by Brexit fears (yet, anyway). City traders are speculating about how long Mark Carney will remain as Bank of England governor, after Theresa May attacked the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s loose monetary policy stance yesterday. Carney is expected to decide by the end of 2016 whether to do five years at the Bank (the original plan), or sign up for an extra three years. He arrived in July 2013. May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism could, perhaps, encourage Carney to exit gracefully in 2018 after all. Or he might decide that London remains the place to be, as the Brexit story plays out. May surprised the City by telling the Conservative party conference that ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing had disproportionately helped the rich. Charalambos Pissouros, a senior analyst at IronFX Global, told Reuters that this could signal a change of approach to monetary policy: In our view, this suggests that once (BoE chief) MarkCarney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s term is finished at the BoE, he may be replaced by someone more hawkish on policy. One of the prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advisers has hinted that the government is considering using the fiscal levers of spending and borrowing to generate growth. George Freeman told Newsnight: We have to think about, with money available at nought percent (how to) ... drive an industrial strategy, get infrastructure built. We need to make sure we are looking at all the mechanisms to making sure that money flows properly. Fears that the City will lose its EU \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpassporting rights\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 have undermined the pound since June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum. Britain is already running a sizeable current account deficit of about 6% of GDP, due to the persistent gap between imports and exports. So if London financial companies are locked out of the EU, Britain will suffer a fall in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinvisible earnings\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. That could be compounded by a drop in physical exports, depending on the trade terms that Britain agrees with the rest of the world. Desmond Lachman, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, fears that the current account deficit will get even worse, pushing the pound down. He writes: There appear to be at least two reasons to believe that market fears about the consequences of a hard Brexit for continued large capital flows to the UK are not misplaced. The first is that, were the UK no longer to have ready access to Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s single market for its exports, it would lose its attractiveness as a location for foreign companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 European investments. This was precisely the point that the Japanese government made at the September G20 meeting in China \u00e2\u20ac\u201c when it publicly warned its UK counterparts of the likelihood that Japanese companies would relocate out of the UK in the event of a hard Brexit. The second reason is that a hard Brexit would almost certainly result in the loss of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfinancial passport\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that City of London financial institutions currently enjoy for accessing the European market. A Financial Conduct Authority report in September suggested that as many as 5,500 UK financial firms could be affected by such a loss of passport rights. Major international banks including JP Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs have warned that, if the City loses its financial passport, they will need to conduct at least part of their European operations from outside the UK. A key point that those in favour of a hard Brexit overlook is that a rapid drying up of foreign capital flows to the UK would have dire consequences for domestic living standards. A further currency dip would raise import costs and increase inflation. Moreover, there is a likelihood that domestic economic policy would need to be tightened \u00e2\u20ac\u201c both to contain inflation and to make room for a large narrowing in the external current account deficit that foreigners would no longer be prepared to finance. UK households would be forced to reduce their consumption levels painfully, while businesses would be forced to cut back on their investment plans, to the detriment of future UK growth prospects. More here. HSBC has knocked up a handy chart showing some of the possible relationships that Britain could have with the EU (and what it is giving up): Philip Hammond needs to reassure Wall Street that London still wants to be a major financial centre, says the currency expert Kit Juckes of Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerned that the pound hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t managed even a small rally this week, even though the latest economic data has been quite encouraging: The FX market, for one, needs a lot of reassurance. Sterling really ought to have managed some sort of short-covering rally in the last day or two, as the market slowly gives up all hope of a further rate cut in 2016. From here, in the absence of new news and with the major (depressing from the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s point of view) speeches from the Conservative party conference behind us, the fall in the pound versus the US dollar will probably be slow. But steady ... Politics, eh? Ouch! Shares in easyJet have fallen by 6% in early trading, and the Brexit vote is party to blame. The budget airline has told shareholders that it expects pre-tax profit to fall by about 28% this year, due to the slump in the pound, recent terror attacks and industrial action. My colleague Angela Monaghan has the details: The British airline said currency movements would cost the company \u00c2\u00a390m in the full year, largely because of the the sharp fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote on 23 June. EasyJet reports in pounds, but mosts of its costs are in dollars and euros. It buys fuel in dollars and pays air traffic costs and landing charges on its many European routes in euros. The Wall Street Journal has a grim chart this morning showing how the pound is close to its weakest level (when measured against a basket of currencies): London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has opened without drama, with the FTSE 100 index gaining 10 points to 7,041. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about 63 points below its record closing level. Bank shares are among the risers, after officials from the International Monetary Fund tried to downplay worries about Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial health yesterday. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, is scrambling to New York today in an attempt to reassure America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest banks about Brexit. He is due to meet with Wall Street powerbrokers (the kind of elite savaged by Theresa May yesterday). He will say London plans to keep its position as the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading financial centre once the break from the EU is complete. Hammond will arrive hot from the Tory conference and is expected to say: One of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great strengths is the ability to offer and aggregate all the services the global financial services industry needs. This has not changed as a result of the EU referendum and I will do everything I can to ensure the City of London retains its position as the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading international financial centre. Whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s British employers or US firms who support thousands of highly skilled jobs in the financial sector, we are listening and taking the time to understand the issues thoroughly, in advance of opening negotiations with the EU. We will continue to welcome the best and brightest talent and organisations from around the world, including the US. While the government has not finalised its future approach to our relations with the EU, the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position is clear; we want the best deal for trade in UK goods and services, including our world leading financial services industry.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be meeting with top executives from Citi, BNY Mellon, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and others with operations in the City. A report this week warned that a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 could wipe out 70,000 jobs and cost \u00c2\u00a310bn in tax receipts. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the worst-case scenario, if City firms lose their passporting rights, which let them sell services across the EU. Wall Street executives will want to hear that their concerns are taken seriously, following Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attack on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153citizens of the world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd yesterday. They could also press Hammond on the idea that UK-based companies should provide a list of any foreigners on their books ... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Concerns over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU continue to weigh on sterling this morning. The pound has sidled back to the $1.271 mark in early trading, close to the 31-year lows plugged yesterday. Against the euro, sterling is close to a five-year low at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.135. This week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tumbles have already forced Britain to surrender the title of fifth-largest economy (in local currency terms) to France. Yesterday, the prime minister, Theresa May, promised to build a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153global Britain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after Brexit, telling the British public: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Come with me and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll write that brighter future.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But is the UK going to lose its prized membership of the single market, in return for immigration controls? Analysts at PNC Bank explain why this is a worry: May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position substantially increases the possibility that the UK will give up its right to export financial and other services to EU markets in exchange for control over immigration \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exports of services to the EU account for more than 4% of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP, so trade barriers to them would cause a serious negative shock to the British economy. Also coming up today.... Global policymakers are gathered in Washington for the International Monetary Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual meeting. World investors are pondering whether America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank might raise interest rates in November, following strong service sector data yesterday. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also wondering whether the European Central Bank could start to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153taper\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd its bond-buying programme soon. In the City, budget airline easyJet, defence firm BAE Systems and furniture group DFS are reporting results. On the economic front, Germany has just reported a 1% jump in factory orders (more on that shortly). And at 1.30pm, we get the latest US weekly unemployment figures. That will set the scene for tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly jobs report. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day ...",

For example, suppose the agent is a manager whose actions influence her own firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price, but not share prices of other firms. Does that mean that the manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay should depend only on her firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price?</p> <p>The answer is no. Since share prices reflect other factors in the economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c outside the manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s control \u00e2\u20ac\u201c simply linking compensation to the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price will reward the manager for good luck and punish her for bad luck. It is better to link the manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay to her firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price relative to those of other, similar firms (such as those in the same industry).</p> <p>A related result is that the harder it is to observe the manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s effort \u00e2\u20ac\u201c perhaps due to many distorting factors blurring the relationship between her effort and the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the less the manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay should be based on performance. In industries with high risk, payment should thus be relatively more biased towards a fixed salary, while in more stable environments it should be more biased towards a performance measure.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fb6fcbe4b03b4fd4fa5e8b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-10T10:47:42.021Z\">11.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">How Nobel prize winner shows failings of private prisons</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Oliver Hart</strong>\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s research work has included a damning assessment of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private prisons.</p> <p>He shows that the pressure to cut costs is too great, leading to unacceptable drops in quality. At the core is the issue of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcincomplete contracts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 -- the fact that contracts aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t detailed enough to cover every nitty-gritty point.</p> <p>The Royal Swedish Academy say:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Another application of Hart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s theory of incomplete contracts concerns the division between the private and public sectors. Should providers of public services, such as schools, hospitals, and prisons, be privately-owned or not? According to the theory, this depends on the nature of non-contractible investments. Suppose a manager who runs a welfare-service facility can make two types of investment: some improve quality, while others reduce cost at the expense of quality. Additionally, suppose that such investments are difficult to specify in a contract. If the government owns the facility and employs a manager to run it, the manager will have little incentive to provide either type of investment, since the government cannot credibly promise to reward these efforts. If a private contractor provides the service, incentives for investing in both quality and cost reduction are stronger. A 1997 article by Hart, together with Andrei Shleifer and Robert Vishny, showed that incentives for cost reduction are typically too strong. The desirability of privatisation therefore depends on the trade-off between cost reduction and quality. In their article, Hart and his co-authors were particularly concerned about private prisons. Federal authorities in the United States are in fact ending the use of private prisons, partly because \u00e2\u20ac\u201c according to a recently released U.S. Department of Justice report \u00e2\u20ac\u201c conditions in privately-run prisons are worse than those in publicly-run prisons.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fb6e66e4b03258bcac636b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-10T10:34:07.404Z\">11.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">The Official Announcement</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The event in Stockholm has now wrapped up, so let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recap with the official announcement:</p> <h2>The Prize in Economic Sciences 2016</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2016/press.html&amp;object=kva&amp;to=http://www.kva.se/en/\">The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences</a> has decided to award the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2016 to<br></p> <p><strong>Oliver Hart</strong><br>Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA</p> <p>and</p> <p><strong>Bengt Holmstr\u00c3\u00b6m</strong><br>Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA</p> <p><em>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153for their contributions to contract theory\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</em></p> <h2>The long and the short of contracts</h2> <p>Modern economies are held together by innumerable contracts. The new theoretical tools created by <strong>Hart</strong> and <strong>Holmstr\u00c3\u00b6m</strong> are valuable to the understanding of real-life contracts and institutions, as well as potential pitfalls in contract design.</p> <p>Society\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s many contractual relationships include those between shareholders and top executive management, an insurance company and car owners, or a public authority and its suppliers. As such relationships typically entail conflicts of interest, contracts must be properly designed to ensure that the parties take mutually beneficial decisions. This year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s laureates have developed <em>contract theory</em>, a comprehensive framework for analysing many diverse issues in contractual design, like performance-based pay for top executives, deductibles and co-pays in insurance, and the privatisation of public-sector activities.</p> <p>In the late 1970s, Bengt Holmstr\u00c3\u00b6m demonstrated how a <em>principal</em> (e.g., a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shareholders) should design an optimal contract for an <em>agent</em> (the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO), whose action is partly unobserved by the principal. Holmstr\u00c3\u00b6m\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s <em>informativeness principle</em> stated precisely how this contract should link the agent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay to performance-relevant information. Using the basic principal-agent model, he showed how the optimal contract carefully weighs risks against incentives. In later work, Holmstr\u00c3\u00b6m generalised these results to more realistic settings, namely: when employees are not only rewarded with pay, but also with potential promotion; when agents expend effort on many tasks, while principals observe only some dimensions of performance; and when individual members of a team can free-ride on the efforts of others.</p> <p>In the mid-1980s, Oliver Hart made fundamental contri-butions to a new branch of contract theory that deals with the important case of <em>incomplete contracts</em>. Because it is impossible for a contract to specify every eventuality, this branch of the theory spells out optimal allocations of control rights: which party to the contract should be entitled to make decisions in which circumstances? Hart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s findings on incomplete contracts have shed new light on the ownership and control of businesses and have had a vast impact on several fields of economics, as well as political science and law.

                "bodyText":"That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today, as Oliver Hart and Bengt Holmstrom enjoy a busy day of congratulations and celebrations. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prize winners: Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Harvard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dani Rodrik tweets: Hart and Holmstrom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work may sound a little dry -- all that talk about CEO pay, insurance contracts and privatisations. But their contract theory work is key to understanding some contentious issues. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, explains: Take the question of how executives should be rewarded. Pay packages tend to be a mix of basic salary, bonuses and share options, with the aim of getting the best of those running companies. The best sort of contract, according to the work pioneered by Holmstr\u00c3\u00b6m is one that provides the right balance of risk and incentives. It encourages top staff to innovate without being reckless. A package weighted towards bonuses might be fine for a younger executive with ambitions to be promoted. It might be less good for a chief executive approaching retirement, who might be given the green light to take risky decisions safe in the knowledge that someone else will have to clear up the mess if they go wrong. Holmstr\u00c3\u00b6m clearly thinks companies have not been paying enough attention to his work. After hearing he was a joint winner of this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prize, he said he thought bonuses were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extraordinarily high\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and the contracts too complicated.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Larry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full piece: Although Hart and Holmstrom clearly merit today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s award, their success means that the Nobel prize for economics has only ever been won by one women \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Elinor Ostrom, in 2009. Associated Press have published more quotes from Bengt Holmstrom today: Speaking to reporters in Stockholm by telephone, Holmstrom said he felt very lucky and grateful. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I certainly did not expect it, at least at this time, so I was very surprised and very happy, of course,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. In the 1970s Holmstrom showed how a principal, for example a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shareholders, should design an optimal contract for an agent, like the CEO. His \u00e2\u20ac\u0153informativeness principle\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd showed how the contract should link the agent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay to information relevant to his or her performance, carefully weighing risks against incentives, the academy said. Holmstrom said his incentive to study contract theory came before he was an academic, when he was working for a company in the 1970s that tried to use computers to figure how to make strategic plans. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s when I realized that the issue wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really about the difficulty of coming up with the best plans,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The bigger issue was also to create incentives for people to give the right information that is needed for these plans and incentivize them in general.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As well as the glory (and sudden interest in their research work) Oliver Hart and Bengt Holmstrom will share 8 million kronor, or about $930,000. Paul Krugman, the US economist honoured in 2008, has warmly welcomed Hart and Holmstrom to the Nobel prize winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s club: Economist Justin Wolfers, professor at the University of Michigan, has also hailed the news: While the Economist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Stan Pignal is struck that Oliver Hart moved from the UK to the US in the 1980s Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an excellent explainer about Hart and Holmstrom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work: Contract Theory The Academy also explain how Holmstrom pioneered the early research into executive pay: A central result, published separately and independently by Bengt Holmstr\u00c3\u00b6m and Steven Shavell in 1979, is that an optimal contract should link payment to all outcomes that can potentially provide information about actions that have been taken. This informativeness principle does not merely say that payments should depend on outcomes that can be affected by agents. For example, suppose the agent is a manager whose actions influence her own firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price, but not share prices of other firms. Does that mean that the manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay should depend only on her firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price? The answer is no. Since share prices reflect other factors in the economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c outside the manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s control \u00e2\u20ac\u201c simply linking compensation to the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price will reward the manager for good luck and punish her for bad luck. It is better to link the manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay to her firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price relative to those of other, similar firms (such as those in the same industry). A related result is that the harder it is to observe the manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s effort \u00e2\u20ac\u201c perhaps due to many distorting factors blurring the relationship between her effort and the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the less the manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay should be based on performance. In industries with high risk, payment should thus be relatively more biased towards a fixed salary, while in more stable environments it should be more biased towards a performance measure. Oliver Hart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s research work has included a damning assessment of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private prisons. He shows that the pressure to cut costs is too great, leading to unacceptable drops in quality. At the core is the issue of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcincomplete contracts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 -- the fact that contracts aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t detailed enough to cover every nitty-gritty point. The Royal Swedish Academy say: Another application of Hart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s theory of incomplete contracts concerns the division between the private and public sectors. Should providers of public services, such as schools, hospitals, and prisons, be privately-owned or not? According to the theory, this depends on the nature of non-contractible investments. Suppose a manager who runs a welfare-service facility can make two types of investment: some improve quality, while others reduce cost at the expense of quality. Additionally, suppose that such investments are difficult to specify in a contract. If the government owns the facility and employs a manager to run it, the manager will have little incentive to provide either type of investment, since the government cannot credibly promise to reward these efforts. If a private contractor provides the service, incentives for investing in both quality and cost reduction are stronger. A 1997 article by Hart, together with Andrei Shleifer and Robert Vishny, showed that incentives for cost reduction are typically too strong. The desirability of privatisation therefore depends on the trade-off between cost reduction and quality. In their article, Hart and his co-authors were particularly concerned about private prisons. Federal authorities in the United States are in fact ending the use of private prisons, partly because \u00e2\u20ac\u201c according to a recently released U.S. Department of Justice report \u00e2\u20ac\u201c conditions in privately-run prisons are worse than those in publicly-run prisons. The event in Stockholm has now wrapped up, so let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recap with the official announcement: The Prize in Economic Sciences 2016 The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has decided to award the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2016 to Oliver Hart Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA and Bengt Holmstr\u00c3\u00b6m Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA \u00e2\u20ac\u0153for their contributions to contract theory\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The long and the short of contracts Modern economies are held together by innumerable contracts. The new theoretical tools created by Hart and Holmstr\u00c3\u00b6m are valuable to the understanding of real-life contracts and institutions, as well as potential pitfalls in contract design. Society\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s many contractual relationships include those between shareholders and top executive management, an insurance company and car owners, or a public authority and its suppliers. As such relationships typically entail conflicts of interest, contracts must be properly designed to ensure that the parties take mutually beneficial decisions. This year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s laureates have developed contract theory, a comprehensive framework for analysing many diverse issues in contractual design, like performance-based pay for top executives, deductibles and co-pays in insurance, and the privatisation of public-sector activities. In the late 1970s, Bengt Holmstr\u00c3\u00b6m demonstrated how a principal (e.g., a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shareholders) should design an optimal contract for an agent (the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO), whose action is partly unobserved by the principal. Holmstr\u00c3\u00b6m\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s informativeness principle stated precisely how this contract should link the agent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay to performance-relevant information. Using the basic principal-agent model, he showed how the optimal contract carefully weighs risks against incentives. In later work, Holmstr\u00c3\u00b6m generalised these results to more realistic settings, namely: when employees are not only rewarded with pay, but also with potential promotion; when agents expend effort on many tasks, while principals observe only some dimensions of performance; and when individual members of a team can free-ride on the efforts of others. In the mid-1980s, Oliver Hart made fundamental contri-butions to a new branch of contract theory that deals with the important case of incomplete contracts. Because it is impossible for a contract to specify every eventuality, this branch of the theory spells out optimal allocations of control rights: which party to the contract should be entitled to make decisions in which circumstances? Hart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s findings on incomplete contracts have shed new light on the ownership and control of businesses and have had a vast impact on several fields of economics, as well as political science and law. His research provides us with new theoretical tools for studying questions such as which kinds of companies should merge, the proper mix of debt and equity financing, and when institutions such as schools or prisons ought to be privately or publicly owned. Through their initial contributions, Hart and Holmstr\u00c3\u00b6m launched contract theory as a fertile field of basic research. Over the last few decades, they have also explored many of its applications. Their analysis of optimal contractual arrangements lays an intellectual foundation for designing policies and institutions in many areas, from bankruptcy legislation to political constitutions. Contracts really, really matter, says one of our new Nobel laureates: Here are some practical examples of the issues which Hart and Holmstr\u00c3\u00b6m\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work can help answer: Oliver Hart has revealed that he was lying in bed, wondering if his chance had gone, when the phone burst deliciously into life.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the official tweet: Q: Did you ever expect to win this prize? Bengt Holmstrom says that other people have talked about it, but he certainly did not expect it. An excited Bengt Holmstr\u00c3\u00b6m is on the phone now. He confirms that he feels very happy about having his life\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work recognised today. Asked what he makes of large bonuses awarded under modern-day contracts (a key part of his research), Bengt Holmstr\u00c3\u00b6m said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My personal view is they are too complicated today\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Taking questions from reporters, Bengt Holmstr\u00c3\u00b6m also said he felt \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very lucky and very grateful\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the prize committee, to his family and to his colleagues. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now taking questions in Swedish too.... In summary, Hart and Holmstrom have given us the tools to accurately examine contracts and see if people, governments and businesses are getting good deals: Oliver Hart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work has examined the issue of privatising public services -- and how governments can achieve high quality and low costs. Government ownership of key services can create \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcweak incentives, but is private ownership better? According to Hart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work, it depends on: the extent to which cost reductions hurt quality the important of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153non-contractible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd innovation competition between providers. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an area of economics called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153incomplete contracts\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd -- addressing the fact that agreements often don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 specify actions and payments for all possible contingencies Bengt Holmstrom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work includes the thorny issue of executive pay. The Swedish Academy are explaining that it examines the issue of overpaying a CEO just for being \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclucky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (ie, if the oil price doubles). And tying bonuses to profits can also backfire, if it encourages short-term thinking. [given CEO pay has spiralled ahead of workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pay in recent years, perhaps we should all pay closer attention to Holmstrom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work...] Britain can celebrate today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s award, as Oliver Hart was born in London. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spent his academic career in America, though, and is the Andrew E. Furer Professor of Economics at Harvard University. Harvard say that: Hart works mainly on contract theory, the theory of the firm, corporate finance, and law and economics. His research centers on the roles that ownership structure and contractual arrangements play in the governance and boundaries of corporations. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his Harvard biography. Bengt Holmstrom was born in Finland, but has also been based in the US. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently the Paul A. Samuelson Professor of Economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who call him a: ..microeconomic theorist, best known for his research on the theory of contracting and incentives especially as applied to the theory of the firm, to corporate governance and to liquidity problems in financial crises. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his MIT biography Hart and Holmstrom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work is basically about balancing the needs, and demands, of the people or organisations who agree a contract. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153risks versus incentives\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcprinciple agent problem\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. (Ie, if you have fire insurance, why do you care if it burns down). The Acadamy are explaining that Oliver Hart and Bengt Holmstr\u00c3\u00b6m\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work focuses on contracts such as insurance claims, salaries, property rights, etc. This may not sound terribly exciting, but this work is crucial for understanding the modern economy. Goran Hansson, secretary general of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, is announcing the winner now... This year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prize is going to.... Oliver Hart of Harvard, and Bengt Holmstr\u00c3\u00b6m of MIT for their contributions to contract theory. The Academy says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153(Their work) lays an intellectual foundation for designing policies and institutions in many areas, from bankruptcy legislation to political constitutions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd You can watch today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement at the top of this blog (or there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a web feed here) The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences has even been criticised by one former winner. Friedrich von Hayek, the Austrian/British economist whose work found favour with many right-wing politicians, argued that the award could give economists too much authority: (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s via The Economist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Soumaya Keynes, whose relative John Maynard Keynes never scooped this award (as he died before it was created). People are gathering at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm, ready for the official announcement: Guessing Nobel Prize winners is devilishly tough, but the shortlist of possible winners includes: Olivier Blanchard, former top economist at the International Monetary Fund, for his work on improving economic models Edward Lazear, of Stanford University, for his work on using employee incentives to improve productivity. Marc Melitz, professor of political economy at Harvard, for his work on free trade. There are more details here: Good morning. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s get one thing out of the way first\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Yes, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, not one of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcproper\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Nobel prizes which were dished out last week. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still the biggest prize in Economics, awarded to illustrious names such as John Hicks, Jan Tinbergen, John Nash, and Joseph Stiglitz. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a controversial award. Economics can sometimes feel like maths for argumentative people, but critics argue that its proponents aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcproper scientists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, as they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re trying to understand social behaviour not physical laws. Anthropologist Joris Luyendijk argued last year that putting economics on a pedestal leads to trouble\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The problem is not so much that there is a Nobel prize in economics, but that there are no equivalent prizes in psychology, sociology, anthropology. Economics, this seems to say, is not a social science but an exact one, like physics or chemistry \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a distinction that not only encourages hubris among economists but also changes the way we think about the economy. A Nobel prize in economics implies that the human world operates much like the physical world: that it can be described and understood in neutral terms, and that it lends itself to modelling, like chemical reactions or the movement of the stars. It creates the impression that economists are not in the business of constructing inherently imperfect theories, but of discovering timeless truths. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fair point\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6but if we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve learned one thing since the 2008 financial crisis broke, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that the world needs a better grasp of the economic mechanisms that underpin society. And some Sveriges Riksbank Prize winners have made very significant contributions; from Nash\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work on game theory to Jean Tirole\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s research into market power, and how to regulate big businesses. And last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s winner, Angus Deaton, was rightly recognised for his work charting global developments in health, wellbeing and inequality. The announcement is due around 11.45am in Sweden, or 10.45am in the UK....",

Investors took fright at the prospect of a hard Brexit and the currency has declined more than 6% against the dollar since then.</p> <p>A flash crash last Thursday, when the pound fell by 6% in 10 minutes, heightened concerns that investors had lost faith in sterling as a major currency. A year ago a pound bought $1.55.<br></p> <p>However, the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline had the opposite effect on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading share index. The FTSE 100 touched a new intra-day record of 7,129.83 during afternoon trading, although it closed nearly 60 points lower after a late bout of selling, below the record closing figure of 7,104 reached last year. The driving force for the UK market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent surge has been the <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/2016/oct/10/pound-continues-to-fall-against-dollar-and-euro-amid-hard-brexit-fears\">rapid decline in the pound</a>, which has boosted the value of companies that earn much of their revenues in dollars.</p> <p>Michael Saunders, a former investment banker who joined the monetary policy committee in August, said Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s large current account deficit was adding to the anxiety about the ability of the nation to pay its way once it quits the European Union.</p> <p><a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/2016/oct/04/weak-post-brexit-growth-forecast-likely-wrong-bank-michael-saunders\">Saunders said the current account</a>, which measures the balance of trade, cash transfers and investment income with other countries, was already undermining confidence in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to pay its way before the EU referendum.</p> <p>Speaking to MPs on the treasury select committee, Saunders warned it was now a major issue and compounding the already weak sentiment on currency markets towards sterling.</p> <p>Saunders told MPs:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Given the scale and persistence of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current account deficit, I would not be surprised if sterling falls further, but I am fairly agnostic as to whether any further depreciation is likely,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd </p> </blockquote> <p>Saunders, who joined the MPC from the US investment bank Citi, where he was chief economist, said investors were weighing up the implications of Britain leaving the EU.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The work done by the International Monetary Fund and the OECD suggests that the long-run effects of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU is that growth will be lower. If all we are doing is adjusting to a new equilibrium, that is not a concern.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote> <p>Only if the pound plummets or triggers falls in other markets would the Bank of England need to consider cutting rates to bolster confidence and growth, he added.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153If such a scenario were to materialise then, provided inflation expectations and pay growth remain well-contained, I would expect the mpc to largely look through any such direct effects on inflation of sterling weakness, even if they extend for several years.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote> <p>But the lower pound, which reduces the cost of UK goods and services sold abroad, could boost exports and offset much of the anxiety caused by the Brexit vote.</p> <p>A fall in imports would also help to reduce the current account deficit, he said, adding that the government could take advantage of the current depressed situation to boost growth with extra spending.</p> <p><a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/politics/2016/oct/09/theresa-may-rules-out-commons-vote-on-single-market-exit\">Several Tory MPs, including supporters of the Leave campaign, have warned that leaving the single market</a> will harm the economy and have demanded ministers make every effort to negotiate continued access.<br></p> <p>But the hardline taken by Downing Street and an equally robust response from European leaders, who have emphasised the free movement of labour as a pillar of the single market, have heightened concerns in the City that Britain will eventually leave all the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major institutions.</p> <p>Kathleen Brooks, research director at financial betting firm City Index and Forex.com, says traders fear the UK could be dragged back by Brexit uncertainty.</p> <p>She told BBC News that: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The weakness in the pound is really a sign that investors don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have confidence in a post-Brexit UK economic outlook.

In addition, we face added uncertainty over the US Election -there is a strong chance that if Hilary comes into power the US Dollar could gain a lot of strength on the back of that. In regards to the long-term, I think we could see the pound make a recovery, as we begin to see what a post-Brexit UK looks like. The biggest obstacle for the poundcurrently is the uncertainty and anxiety that surrounds the nature of divorce proceedings from the EU.

                "bodyText":"And finally, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my colleague Philip Inman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s summary of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drama: The pound endured another day of pressure from investors on Tuesday after continued jitters on the foreign exchange markets pushed it down more than two cents to $1.21. Sterling recorded its worst four-day performance since the Brexit vote as a Bank of England official said he expected the pound to fall further in the coming weeks, driven by the referendum result and the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit with the rest of the world. The exchange rate with the US dollar stood at $1.30 last week when Theresa May opened the Conservative party conference and appeared to put regaining control of immigration above staying inside the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s single market free trade area. Investors took fright at the prospect of a hard Brexit and the currency has declined more than 6% against the dollar since then. A flash crash last Thursday, when the pound fell by 6% in 10 minutes, heightened concerns that investors had lost faith in sterling as a major currency. A year ago a pound bought $1.55. However, the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline had the opposite effect on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading share index. The FTSE 100 touched a new intra-day record of 7,129.83 during afternoon trading, although it closed nearly 60 points lower after a late bout of selling, below the record closing figure of 7,104 reached last year. The driving force for the UK market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent surge has been the rapid decline in the pound, which has boosted the value of companies that earn much of their revenues in dollars. Michael Saunders, a former investment banker who joined the monetary policy committee in August, said Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s large current account deficit was adding to the anxiety about the ability of the nation to pay its way once it quits the European Union. Saunders said the current account, which measures the balance of trade, cash transfers and investment income with other countries, was already undermining confidence in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to pay its way before the EU referendum. Speaking to MPs on the treasury select committee, Saunders warned it was now a major issue and compounding the already weak sentiment on currency markets towards sterling. Saunders told MPs: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Given the scale and persistence of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current account deficit, I would not be surprised if sterling falls further, but I am fairly agnostic as to whether any further depreciation is likely,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Saunders, who joined the MPC from the US investment bank Citi, where he was chief economist, said investors were weighing up the implications of Britain leaving the EU. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The work done by the International Monetary Fund and the OECD suggests that the long-run effects of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU is that growth will be lower. If all we are doing is adjusting to a new equilibrium, that is not a concern.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Only if the pound plummets or triggers falls in other markets would the Bank of England need to consider cutting rates to bolster confidence and growth, he added. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If such a scenario were to materialise then, provided inflation expectations and pay growth remain well-contained, I would expect the mpc to largely look through any such direct effects on inflation of sterling weakness, even if they extend for several years.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But the lower pound, which reduces the cost of UK goods and services sold abroad, could boost exports and offset much of the anxiety caused by the Brexit vote. A fall in imports would also help to reduce the current account deficit, he said, adding that the government could take advantage of the current depressed situation to boost growth with extra spending. Several Tory MPs, including supporters of the Leave campaign, have warned that leaving the single market will harm the economy and have demanded ministers make every effort to negotiate continued access. But the hardline taken by Downing Street and an equally robust response from European leaders, who have emphasised the free movement of labour as a pillar of the single market, have heightened concerns in the City that Britain will eventually leave all the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major institutions. Kathleen Brooks, research director at financial betting firm City Index and Forex.com, says traders fear the UK could be dragged back by Brexit uncertainty. She told BBC News that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The weakness in the pound is really a sign that investors don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have confidence in a post-Brexit UK economic outlook. They think Brexit is going to be very negative for the UK economy, and UK GDP could contract going forward.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for tonight. Do tune in tomorrow for more coverage of the pound, the financial markets, the global economy and more.... Remember, tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ructions aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t JUST about Brexit. The dollar has hit an eight-month high against a basket of currencies, on speculation that US interest rates are heading higher soon: Some more thoughts from Duncan Weldon of Resolution Group: The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s John Gapper is concerned that parliament doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have its eye on the ball.... This is a positively grim day for the pound, which just stuck its nose below the $1.21 mark as today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relentless selloff continues. More reaction to the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent slump. Except, your average emerging market currency has performed an awful lot better than the pound this year. Brazil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Real, for example, has surged by almost 25%. Sterling is struggling to find a floor tonight \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it just touched $1.2107, a decline of almost 2.5 cents against the US dollar today alone. Kathleen Brooks, Research Director at City Index and Forex.com, says traders fear the UK could be dragged back by Brexit uncertainty. She told BBC News tonight that: The weakness in the pound is really a sign that investors don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have confidence in a post-Brexit UK economic outlook. They think Brexit is going to be very negative for the UK economy, and UK GDP could contract going forward. If we have many more days like today, then talk of a Sterling Crisis won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem far-fetched. So let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quickly recap, as City traders take a breather. The pound has suffered another day of heavy losses, shedding two cents against the US dollar to $1.214, and one euro cent to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.098. The selloff was triggered by fresh worries about the cost of a hard Brexit, after leaked Treasury papers suggested leaving the single market would ultimately cost \u00c2\u00a366bn in lost tax receipts. That forecast has been criticised by pro-Brexit ministers, who accuse the Treasury of scare-mongering. Labour, though, fear that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153jobs, livelihoods and public services\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are at risk. Two leading bankers, from Citi and Morgan Stanley, have warned they could start to move jobs out of London in 2017. Rob Rooney, CEO of Morgan Stanley International, was blunt about the consequences fo a hard Brexit: It really isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t terribly complicated. If we are outside the EU and we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have what would be a stable and long-term commitment to access the single market then a lot of the things we do today in London, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have to do inside the EU 27. And two Bank of England policymakers have issued warnings about the impact of Brexit. Michael Saunders, of the Monetary Policy Committee, predicted that the pound could fall further. And Anil Kashyap of the Financial Policy Committee warned that Britain could suffer a budgetary black hole if well-paid City jobs move overseas. The weak pound did push shares in London up briefly, to a new all-time high. But then a late selloff sent the FTSE 100 into the red. Analysts say the pound is also being squeezed by the recent strength of the US dollar, which is benefitting from speculation that Hillary Clinton will win next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential election. Paresh Davdra, CEO of RationalFX, predicts a lot more volatility for sterling... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the short term, I think we will see the pound continue to slide. A lot of what has been happening has been in reaction to political events, namely any update on Brexit that comes from the government. This week we have seen the first evidence from the Prime Minister that Britain is heading for a clean break from the EU \u00e2\u20ac\u201ctraditionally the least desirable option for the economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201cwhich has been a major factor behind the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump. As we get closer to Article 50 being invoked, I think we will see the pound continue to fall further. In addition, we face added uncertainty over the US Election -there is a strong chance that if Hilary comes into power the US Dollar could gain a lot of strength on the back of that. In regards to the long-term, I think we could see the pound make a recovery, as we begin to see what a post-Brexit UK looks like. The biggest obstacle for the poundcurrently is the uncertainty and anxiety that surrounds the nature of divorce proceedings from the EU. But once we overcome that, we should begin to see the trend reverse. Until then however, it will likely continue to a bumpy ride for the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound is also suffering a late rout against the euro, as Brexit fears thump sterling again. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fallen by one euro cent, or around 1%, to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.098. Crumbs, make that $1.2153 -- which means the pound has lost two cents against the US dollar today! The pound is ploughing new lows, and is now down 1.75 cents at $1.2177. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a new 31-year low, if you exclude the odd flash-crash last Friday... Sterling is now at an eight-year low against a basket of major currencies. And if it weakens much further, we could hit 40-year lows, according to Reuters journalist Jamie McGeever. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff means the pound has suffered its worst four-day run since late June, and the aftermath of the EU referendum vote. Back then, sterling was worth around $1.48. It has now shed around 17.5% of its value since. The selloff has intensified since Theresa May declared that she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll trigger article 50 by the end of March. The pound has dropped by 7 1/2 cents, or nearly 6%, since the start of the Conservative Party conference, from $1.2975 to $1.22-ish. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a really sharp decline, as investors have faced up to the prospect of Brexit taking place by spring 2019. May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promises of immigration controls also pushed the pound down, as traders anticipated a Hard Brexit, which would deprive UK firms of membership of the single market. My colleague Aditya Chakrabortty has written a scorching piece about the sterling slump. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: So let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s have some ugly facts. First of all, the crash in the pound is a reminder of one overriding danger that some of us have been warning about for years: Britain does not pay its way in the world. It buys far more goods and services from other countries than it sells to them. That deficit is made up entirely by what Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, has called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the kindness of strangers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Which is fine, for as long as those foreign strangers consider London a safe haven for their cash. That shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be taken for granted now that Britain is about to take a giant political and economic leap into the dark \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and sterling has already plunged further this year than the Argentinian peso. Remember, Whitehall is only beginning to think seriously about the mechanics of leaving the EU: years of this mayhem are still to come. Ah, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re told: but all this currency weakness is just brilliant for British exporters. It makes their goods so much cheaper to sell abroad. True, but that is to overestimate the bag of bones that is the British manufacturing sector 30 years after the Thatcher revolution. Back over in Dublin, the Irish government has unveiled a series of measures designed to protect the economy from a Brexit shock. It aims to protect foreign investment, boost tourism and reduce the exposure of farmers in the wake of the collapse of sterling. Under the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Getting Ireland Brexit Ready\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd programme, announced by the finance minister, a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rainy day fund\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will be built up from surplus budgets for use as a contingency for public services in the event of a shock to the economy after Brexit Day, expected in 2019. A special \u00e2\u201a\u00ac150m loan fund to help farmers with cash flow and short term borrowings is to be established amid concern many are struggling to cope with the sharp decline in the value of their exports to the UK, A special tax relief programme designed to help foreign investors with the smooth movement of staff from the US and elsewhere is to be extended until the end of 2020. This programme will allow employers to relocate state from overseas offices with minimal tax complications. A reduced nine per cent VAT rate is to be retained in the tourist sector to assist the competitiveness of the hospitality sector which is heavily dependent on UK tourists. The government says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The measure acts to secure and embed investment, which can lead to sustainable growth and strengthens Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s innovative capabilities.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd At the same time the government has released a sector by sector analysis of the impact Brexit could have on trade with Britain, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest trading partner. Agri-food and computer services are among the most exposed sectors. The Revenue commissioners have also been asked to scope out how potential customs with the UK and with Northern Ireland would work. Unveiling the package, finance minister Michael Noonan said the Brexit vote posed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153important challenges for the Irish economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and it needed to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153protect the progress\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd made to the economy since the crash of 2010. Breaking: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has failed to hit a new closing high, as the City frets about the costs of a hard Brexit. A late afternoon selloff sent the FTSE 100 down by 0.38%, or 26 points, to 7070 points. It had earlier hit a new all-time high of 7129 points (as covered here). Retail stocks rallied, with Next up 4% and Marks &amp; Spencer up 3.2%. But mining stocks fell, as the strengthening US dollar pushed down commodity prices. Now, in theory, the weak pound should have driven the FTSE 100 higher. But it appears that Brexit worries have pushed shares price down, especially predictions that leaving the single market would create a fiscal black hole. Top bankers from Citi and Morgan Stanley also dented confidence, by warning they could quit the City of London next year. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx explains: A lunchtime surge saw the FTSE smash through to 7129; now it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s back hovering below 7100, that midday burst of energy proving to be brief. Perhaps reports that both Citi and Morgan Stanley have stated they will leave London if Britain appears to be heading for a hard Brexit have weighed on investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 appetite for the UK index; perhaps it was a bout of profit-taking. Either way the FTSE couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hold onto its highs for long. Wall Streeet is also in the red, with the Dow down around 1% after aluminium firm Alcoa disappointed the markets. Chris Beauchamp of IG says investors are also driving the US dollar higher, because they expect American interest rates to rise before Christmas. The blame for the general \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrisk off\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 mood can be attributed partly to Alcoa, whose disappointing figures have put US markets on the defensive, but overall the equity rally is being knocked by a rising US dollar, as traders rush back to the greenback thanks to soaring expectations of a move by the Fed in December The pound is hitting new lows against the US dollar in late London trading. It has now shed almost 1.5 cents today, to just $1.221. That partly reflects fears over hard Brexit. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also due to the fact the US dollar is strengthening against most currencies. Worth noting that the euro is also having a bad week. Traders are piling into the US dollar in anticipation that American interest rates might rise in December. Fujitsu says that its 1,800 planned job cuts are not a response to the Brexit vote, and it remains committed to the UK (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hot off the Reuters terminal) The pound is taking another pummelling, now down its lowest point of the day at $1.223. It was briefly lower on Friday, during the flash crash that drove sterling to fresh 31-year lows. Bad news for UK workers at Fujitsu. The Japanese electronics firm is planning to cut up to 1,800 jobs as part of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctransformation programme\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s via the Press Association. No word if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit-related.... Global stock markets are turning a little sour now, dragging the FTSE 100 away from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record high. US aluminium firm Alcoa has disappointed investors, by missing revenue and profit forecasts today. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a downbeat start to the latest earnings season, leaving Wall Street traders unimpressed. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says: Expectations were that we will finally get a quarter when we can be confident to say that earning season will give us a number which will make the foundation a little more stronger for the US economy. But the number released from Alcoa was simply just a disaster and has made investors angry who are willing to liquidate their position. So, all the main markets are now in the red: The pound is still looking weak, too, down almost one cent today at $1.228 The government won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be lured on whether we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in a full-blown sterling crisis, or not, reports Paul Waugh of Huffington Post. Personally, I think $1.20 might be the trigger point for some serious \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sterling Crisis\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd headlines; so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still a few cents away. Two senior bankers have warned that they could start moving jobs out of the City, perhaps next year, if Britain appears to be heading for a hard Brexit. Speaking at a London conference today James Bardrick, the boss of Citi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK operation, said his bank could trigger its contingency plan by early next year. Bardrick said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How do we and when do we start making decisions ... knowing the plan is ready to go ... it could be in the first quarter of 2017.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rob Rooney, CEO of Morgan Stanley international, gave a blunt warning that jobs would have to move back into the EU, if Britain quit the single market. As Rooney put it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It really isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t terribly complicated. If we are outside the EU and we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have what would be a stable and long-term commitment to access the single market then a lot of the things we do today in London, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have to do inside the EU 27.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (thanks to Reuters for the quotes). This is what Bank of England policymaker Anil Kashyap was banging on about this morning, when he predicted a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153non-trivial\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd impact on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal plans if lots of well-paid City jobs moved overseas. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market surge is only a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchollow victory\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, argues Laith Khalaf of financial services group Hargreaves Lansdown. He says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being driven by currency movements rather than a fundamental improvement in UK companies. Nonetheless UK investors will still be cheered to see a boost to their pension pots and ISA valuations, as it represents a genuine increase to their wealth in pounds and pence. The concern will be that a reversal in fortunes for the currency could see the gains wiped off as quickly as they appeared. That may well be the case, though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to see anything in the foreseeable future that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to propel the pound back to its former glory. Having smashed through the intraday record high, City traders are now wondering if the FTSE 100 will do the double and close at a record high. And with two and a half hours to go, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nip and tuck, frankly. The Footsie has dipped back a little, since hitting 7129 points two hours ago. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now just 7097, compared to an alltime closing high of 7104 points. This is good, from the Press Association: The Irish government also warned that the Brexit vote is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a real risk\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the Republic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, due to the close trade ties. Dublin has already trimmed its growth forecast for 2017, as this statement from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2017 Budget explains: During the delivery of his budget to the Dail (Irish parliament) this lunchtime Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Finance Minister Michael Noonan was quite bullish in defending the Republic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s controversial low corporation tax regime. Despite the EU ruling that Apple owed billions in tax thanks to the taxation policy in Ireland, Noonan told the Dail: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 12.5% corporation will not be changed and nobody in Europe or anywhere else is asking for it to be changed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd On the Republic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s international tax strategy, Noonan says it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153restates our commitment to meet international tax principles and how our corporate tax regime remains fair but competitive into the future.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Overall he has announced around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac300m in tax cuts mainly for the lower paid. Around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.7bn will be allocated to extra spending for the public services. Back in Dublin, crash barriers have been erected to prevent any surge of protestors demonstration over today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Irish budget 2017. So far there has been little sign of many demonstrators unlike in the days of the last recession when thousands congregated in Molesworth Street over austerity cuts and deals to recapitalise Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s busted banking system. (via US student Keela Sweeney) Neil Wilson of ETX Capital agrees that the weak pound is the main factor driving the FTSE 100 to an all-time high today. Brexiters might point to the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise as a sign of strength but this is very much a story of sterling weakness boosting foreign earnings \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which account for around two-thirds to three-quarters of FTSE 100 company revenues. Having said that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains largely come from UK-focused stocks like Next, Whitbread, Marks &amp; Spencer, Travis Perkins and Taylor Wimpey. He also believes that Bank of England policymaker Michael Saunders may have helped push shares higher, during his testimony to MPs (highlights are here) We also got comments today from one Bank of England policymaker that the MPC would not be too fussed if inflation overshoots \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the market seems to have taken this as a clear indication that rates are staying on the floor for a while yet. A weak pound and lower-for-longer interest rates is generally good for equities. Duncan Weldon, head of research at City firm Resolution Group, points out that the FTSE 100 isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a great barometer of the UK economy. The index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10 biggest companies are (in order), Royal Dutch Shell, HSBC, Unilever, BP, British American Tobacco, GlaxoSmithKline, BHP Billiton, AstraZeneca, Vodafone and Diageo. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two oil giants, two pharmaceuticals firms, a global bank, a tobacco firm, a consumer goods titan, a major mining company, an international drinks business and a major telecoms group. Ben Chu of the Independent is tweeting some interesting graphs about the FTSE: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re calling it a record high... but The Telegraph\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tara Cunningham points out that the Footsie is 6% down this year, when priced in US dollars. That means UK shares are attractive for American investors, another factor that has driven the market up since the Brexit vote. Boom! The pound is falling further as lunchtime approaches in the City, driving shares in London up to their highest ever level. The FTSE 100 index has just smashed through to a new all-time intraday high, up 30 points at 7129. That breaks the previous record set in April 2015. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being driven by retailers such as Next (+4.2%) and Marks &amp; Spencer (+3.1%), plus building companies. The smaller FTSE 250 index, which contains more UK focused companies, has gained 0.7% - close to the record high struck last week. But there is a proviso.... share prices are partly being driven up by the weakness of the pound (which makes overseas earnings more valuable). And the pound is continuing to slide today, now down another cent at $1.225. This graph, from Bloomberg, shows how the FTSE 100 has pushed higher as the pound has weakened since June: Chris Beauchamp, Chief Market Analyst at IG, says the weak pound is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153working its magic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on share prices again. UK investors will once again be cheering the impact of a falling pound, as the drop in sterling once again works its magic on the FTSE 100. The index has hit its all-time high, although this will doubtless bring out the legions armed with their charts of the FTSE rebased into a variety of currencies to paint the index in a less flattering light. Of course, most UK investors will simply be pleased to see their portfolios rise, and will worry about the currency later. Good numbers from luxury firm LVMH have helped Burberry to rise steadily this morning, with the stock touching its highest level since August 2015. There are also protesters outside government buildings in Ireland today, ahead of the budget: A local entrepreneur and founder of a Irish startup company called Parkio has welcomed Dublin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to halve capital gains tax for entrepreneurs, to 10%, to help cushion the impact of the Brexit vote. His accountant had estimated he was going to be paying approximately 33%. (thanks to journalism student Lucas Nolan) Back in Ireland, the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new budget is now expected to contain some measures to counteract and indeed exploit the impact of Brexit. There will be additional funding for the Republic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Industrial Development Authority, which over four decades has attracted multi-national corporations from Dell to Apple, Microsoft to Google to the country. The extra money for the IDA will enable it to try and woo even more global hi-tech giants to low corporation tax Ireland (12.5%) especially those companies who are worried that the UK out of Europe means Britain is no longer a beachhead into the EU single market. It is part of moves to portray Ireland globally as the only English-speaking country still in the the EU and mainly for the benefit of American hi-tech multi nationals in particular. One potential \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBrexit shock absorber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget is the dramatic halving of capital gains tax for home-grown entrepreneurs from 20% to just 10%. This is another move designed to boost indigenous Irish firms to cope with any potential collateral damage Brexit could cause to the Republic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. Anil Kashyap refuses to say whether he thinks the pound is likely to suffer further falls over the next few years. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have to resign from the University of Chicago if I started forecasting currency moves, Kashyap tells the Treasury committee -- we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re known for our position that the market sets these prices. The newest member of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Policy Committee adds: Until we see what the relations are between the UK and the EU, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very hard to know where any of this is going to settle Q: But what about if we knew we were getting a hard Brexit? Then the pound would probably weaken further, Kashyap. But it still depends exactly what \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit means\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Q: Hard Brexit is taken to mean a swift exit from the EU, and a fallback to WTO rules..... Kashyap replies that this could have serious consequences for the Treasury: If you lose a bunch of financial services jobs... then the fiscal consequences of that is non-trivial, as those jobs are so high paying, and [generate] so much tax. 3.7% of total UK employment is in financial services, and 11.5% of fiscal revenues come from financial services, he adds. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to lose lots of that before you have a hole in the budget that could be meaningful. And that could have some knock-on effects for the exchange rate. Reminder: A leaked Treasury paper has predicted that the UK could eventually lose \u00c2\u00a366bn of tax revenues after Brexit: The Treasury Committee is now questioning Anil Kashyap, a US academic who is joining the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Stability Committee. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not best pleased that Kashyap is planning to miss one FPC meeting due to teaching commitments at the University of Chicago (but to be fair, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s squeezing his teaching commitments into just 10 weeks). Kashyap is also being quizzed about the huge fine hanging over Deutsche Bank. Is that a threat to financial stability? Kashyap argues that letting banks get away with malpractice would be a bigger threat to stability. And he denies that the problems in the European banking system start with US fines. He blames low growth, and badly capitalised banks -- such as in Italy. If the size of the problem in Italy was as small as some people have claimed, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have fixed it by now, Kashyap adds. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the end of Michael Saunders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 session at parliament, to rubberstamp his appointment to set interest rates on the Monetary Policy Committee. The big news is that Saunders thinks the pound could extend its recent losses since the Brexit vote. He told MPs that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Given the scale and persistence of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current account deficit, I would not be surprised if sterling falls further, but I am fairly agnostic as to whether any further depreciation is likely.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Also: He thinks the Bank will \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclook through\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 the inflationary consequences of the weak pound. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not terribly worried by the speed of the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline, arguing that the currency is adjusting to the reality of Brexit. He thinks the slump in sterling could push import prices up by 13%, potentially pushing inflation up by 1.5 percentage points a year. He thinks the UK economy will grow faster over the next few quarters than previously thought, but this doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell much about the long-term. Saunders said: I think the economy will do better over the next few quarters. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that tells you about the long run effects. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important not to make judgements on the long run based on the short run view. What the economy does in the next few years is crucial. Q: Is the Bank of England now \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcout of ammunition\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to stimulate the economy? Saunders says not. Interest rates could be cut again (although they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re already only 0.25%), and the Bank could also boost its asset purchase scheme (buying bonds with newly created money). We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve still got tools, if needed, he insists. Michael Saunders say the UK economy will probably perform better than expected over the next few quarters (echoing a point he made in a speech last week). But that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell us much about the long-term effects of Brexit. Q: Were the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warnings before the EU referendum justified? Saunders only joined the Bank of England this summer, so he was still working in the City during the Brexit vote. He says most City experts expected a Brexit vote to lead to a weaker currency and lower growth, but no-one knew if this would lead to financial instability. So as a player in the market, Saunders was reassured by Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments -- as it showed the Bank would act to stabilise the markets. The Brexit vote isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only thing pushing the pound down, Michael Saunders adds. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current account deficit (around 6% of GDP) is also weighing on sterling. And Saunders admits that he wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be surprised to see the pound fall further! He also explains that a 20% drop in the pound (slightly more than what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen since June) would probably push import prices up by 12-13%, which would add 4 percentage points to inflation over a few years. That could mean inflation is 1.5 percentage points higher than otherwise at its peak (so 3.5% rather than 2%, for example). And Saunders thinks the Bank of England could \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclook through\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 this, rather than raise borrowing costs to squeeze it out. Q: Are you worried about the recent volatility in the pound? Michael Saunders says sterling is adjusting to the reality that Britain is leaving the European Union, and the likely impact on growth. If the speed at which the currency falls creates ripples in other asset markets, then that is a problem. But...if we are just adjusting to a new equilibrium, then the speed of the adjustment is not a problem. Saunders also insists that the Bank does not have any target for the pound, or a level where it would intervene to support sterling. The Bank has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153long ago learned its lesson\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd here, he smiles (a reference to Black Wednesday in 1992 when speculator George Soros forced the pound out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism). Over in parliament, new Bank of England policymaker Michael Saunders is being questioned by the Treasury Committee. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being streamed live here. Saunders has been asked about Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent criticism of the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus policies, for making people who own assets richer, but penalising savers and the poor. He defends the current policy of record low interest rates, plus a quantitative easing programme. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think we at the Bank of England can tackle the distributional effects of monetary policy. We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t set interest rates for different groups. If the Bank raised interest rates to support savers, then the economy would be weaker, unemployment would be higher, asset prices over time would be weaker, and over time, interest rates would eventually be lower too, Saunders claims. Q: So should you set QE and monetary policy blind to the distributional effects? Yes, Saunders replies, unless those distributional effects obstruct the impact of monetary policy. Big news out of South Korea: Samsung is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153permanently halting production of its Galaxy Note 7. Killing off the smartphone is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153drastic step\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Bloomberg, after several customers reported that replacement devices have caught fire. Bloomberg explains: After halting sales of the new versions of the large-screen smartphone that failed to fix exploding batteries, Samsung finally pulled the plug on a key product that was supposed to compete with Apple Inc.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s iPhones and other high-end smartphones during the U.S. holiday shopping season. Production will stop, Samsung said in a statement Tuesday. At $1.229, the pound has shed almost seven cents against the US dollar since Theresa May announced she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d trigger article 50 by next March. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fall of around 5%, in less than seven trading days, and means the pound is now 17% lower than on referendum day. Reuters reckons the pound is suffering its worst four-day run since immediately after the Brexit vote. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bad for import prices, and Brits heading abroad. But Peter Rosenstreich, head of market strategy at Swissquote Bank, believes exporters should soon benefit. A Brexit is definitely not the end of the world. Moreover, the devalued pound will see exports gain momentum within the next few month. Over in Germany, investor confidence has risen this month: John McDonnell MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Chancellor, has responded to the warning that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd could cost the Treasury \u00c2\u00a366bn a year in tax revenues. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Losing access to the single market would be devastating for jobs, livelihoods and our public services yet the Tory government are prepared to take this desperate step, despite being warned by their own experts of the consequences. The British people voted to leave the European Union and all sides must respect that decision, but what they certainly didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t vote for was economic misery and the loss of jobs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd After coming tantalisingly close to a new alltime high, the FTSE 100 has now shed all those early gains. Despite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff, sterling isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the worst-performing currency today. That honour has been grabbed by the South African rand, which just tumbled by 3% against the US dollar. There are reports that finance minister Pravin Gordhan has been issued with a summons for fraud, over a surveillance unit which was set up when he led the national tax agency. South African government bonds, and bank shares, are also falling in value. Over in parliament, MPs on the Business Committee are holding a session on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial strategy. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll hear from former chancellor George Osborne, former deputy PM Lord Heseltine and Sir Vince Cable, who ran the BIS department before the last election. Our Politics Live blog is tracking the action: The UK jobs market is also suffering from the Brexit vote, according to recruitment firm PageGroup. Gross profits at its UK division fell by 4.7% in the last three month, it told the City today. PageGroup blames on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fragile market conditions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd following June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum, particularly in the financial services sector. Steve Ingham, PageGroup\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO, says: In the UK, confidence levels remained fragile and below levels seen earlier in the year.... With the prevailing uncertainty in the UK, the challenges in some of our other larger markets and the unpredictable nature of the current cycle, we remain cautious in our short-term outlook. The official unemployment data since the Brexit vote has been quite encouraging, with the jobless rate still just 4.9%. But the claimant count did rise in August, suggesting some weakness. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a while since we last had a full-blown currency crisis, everyone panicking because the pound is falling through the floor. Well, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re having one now. So says John Humphrys, Today Programme presenter, with a certain amount of relish. But is it really a crisis? Gerard Lyons, former chief economic advisor to Boris Johnson, says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not. He believes we should welcome the cheaper pound. Sterling has been seen as overvalued for some time - and the scale of the current account deficit, at 7%, is huge. In an era of low inflation and low growth, a weaker pound is a good thing, Lyons adds. But Ngaire Woods, professor of Global Economic Governance at the University of Oxford, is much more concerned. The cost of importing machines, or medical equipment for the NHS, from the US has immediately gone up, she says, and that will hurt the economy down the road. Firms also face new uncertainties --over the future of foreign workers, and the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future trade links \u00e2\u20ac\u201c says Woods, adding: Here at Oxford University we have top international professors saying they might not move to Oxford.... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget day in Ireland and the first for the new coalition led by Fine Gael but propped up by Independent members of the Dail, and supported for the first time in terms of the national financial plans by the main opposition party Fianna Fail. Irish budgets of recent past have been cost-cutting austerity driven events as the last Fine Gael-Labour government sought to restore the black hole in Irish public finances caused by the banking crash and the collapse of the Celtic Tiger economy. In recent years Ireland has been the leading country in the EU in terms of growth but the state is still borrowing heavily on international markets to pay for its public services. There are some small give-away measures in this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget and they include: An extra \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5 per week for the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pensioners. An additional \u00e2\u201a\u00ac900 per year to each child if he or she is in 40 hours of childcare per week. Extra spending for an additional 1,000 nurses and 800 more garda officers. A 50 eurocent hike in the price of cigarettes.  A reduction of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5 in the cost of prescription charges for the over 70s. All in all they are modest adjustments and extra spending indicating the cautious approach taken by Finance Minister Michael Noonan. He presents his budget to the Dail at 1pm and it will be interesting to see if he introduces any other measures aimed at absorbing future shocks to the economy caused by Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s planned exit from the European Union. With the UK still Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest trading one commentator in Dublin yesterday even called for the creation of an Irish Minister in charge of Brexit-affairs given the impact the British leaving the UK may have on the Republic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. Neil Wilson of City firm ETX Capital is alarmed by the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sharp moves\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the value of the pound this morning. He fears that Brexit angst could drive sterling down to $1.20. GBP/USD crashed through the $1.23 handle to around 1.2284, its lowest level since last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gyrations. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not unreasonable to think that ferocious flash crash was just a very tentative toe in the water and the pound is now plunging headlong into the abyss. Sterling seems to be looking for a level and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really unclear where that could be and so bargain hunting is a risky game to play at the moment. The $1.20 handle earmarked by many before the referendum is definitely in play as everyone seems to be short sterling at present. The weak pound is helping to drive the London stock market close to record highs. The FTSE 100 index of top blue-chip shares has risen by almost 20 points, or 0.25%, to 7118 points. That would be a record closing high, and is only 6 points away from the all-time intraday high. Exporters, such as fashion firm Burberry, are benefitting from the cheapness of sterling. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also good for mining companies, who earn their money in dollars. Sterling is now at its weakest level since the financial crisis broke out, when measured against a basket of other top currencies. Reuters has the details: Trade-weighted sterling hit a nearly-eight-year low of 74.0 at the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first morning print of the index, which measures the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s broader strength. It was also half a percent weaker at 90.51 pence per euro. Some traders cited a Financial Times report that Russian bank VTB may move its European hub to Frankfurt, Paris or Vienna as having added to worries of financial sector cutbacks inLondon due to Brexit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is nothing to go on on the data front today, but concerns surrounding our ever increasing current account deficit have reignited discussion around the widespread impact such a hole can create,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Tobias Davis, head of corporate treasury sales at Western Union in London. Kit Juckes, currency expert at Societe Generale, fears that the weakness of the pound could spread to other assets, such as government bonds and shares. In real effective terms, sterling is 10% lower than it was in 1992 after leaving the ERM and is now weaker than it was after Lehman. Press comment is now shifting to embracing the positive effects of a weak pound and in due course that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be true but any further weakness from here might simply reflect loss of confidence and be bad for UK assets (gilts, equities, house prices, you name it...) in general. Although a weak pound means Britain is poorer, it could also help the economy ride out the Brexit storm. Ashoka Mody, the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former deputy-director for Europe, has told the Daily Telegraph that we should be celebrating sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump. Mody argues that the pound was overvalued before June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote, and has simply dropped to a more suitable level. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is desirable from every point of view. The idea that Britain is in crisis or is on its knees before the exchange rate vigilantes is ludicrous. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK economy is rebalancing amazingly well. It is a stunning achievement that a once-in-fifty-year event should have gone to smoothly.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here. The pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness is being exacerbated by traders piling into the US dollar. The dollar is in demand, as Donald Trump is seen as increasingly unlikely to become US president in November. Tape recordings of Trump boasting about groping women have dealt another blow to his campaign, prompting more top Republicans to withdraw their endorsements: Kathleen Brooks of City Index says Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153crash and burn\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is boosting the dollar, The latest election polls in the US suggest that Hillary Clinton is extending her lead over Donald Trump, which is considered dollar positive. The most senior Republican in Congress, Paul Ryan, has abandoned Trump after the latest debate against Clinton, further signs that his campaign is losing momentum at this crucial stage of the election race. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s looking like another bad morning for sterling, as the British currency continues to weaken in the face of Brexit worries. The pound has dropped by over half a cent this morning to $1.229 -- which would be a 31-year low, if you ignored the flash crash that sent sterling tumbling on Friday. Sterling has also lost fresh ground against the euro, down 0.33% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.106. This latest selloff follows reports that Britain could lose \u00c2\u00a366bn of tax revenues each year if the UK takes the plunge with a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the story: Leaked government papers suggest that leaving the single market and switching to World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules would cause GDP to fall by up to 9.5% compared with staying in the EU. The draft cabinet committee paper seen by the Times is based on forecasts from the controversial study into the predicted impact of quitting the EU published by George Osborne in April during the referendum campaign. Although the then chancellor faced widespread criticism over the report, the Treasury stands by its calculations, according to the Times. The documents says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Treasury estimates that UK GDP would be between 5.4% and 9.5% of GDP lower after 15 years if we left the EU with no successor arrangement, with a central estimate of 7.5%. Some pro-Brexit ministers have dismissed the report, saying the Treasury is being unduly pessimistic and going over the top. Sam Coates, the Times journalist who broke the story, explains that the report uses the same Treasury forecasts produced in April. This may heighten concerns among businesses that they could be locked out of the single market by March 2019.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Coming up today.... Brexit fears continues to swirl around the City this morning, as the pound continues to be buffered by concerns over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit strategy from the EU. Overnight, Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s VTB Bank has become the first big lender to publicly say it will move its European headquarters out of the UK. Herbert Moos, deputy chairman, told the Financial Times that VTB is now eying up Frankfurt, Vienna and Paris as alternative sites for its European hub. Moos says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We did have bigger plans for the London office, but after Brexit we are scaling them down and building them up elsewhere. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our board will decide where by the end of the year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Brexit pushes VTB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Europe HQ out of London That kind of talk is likely to weigh on UK assets, as all the major banks plan their own strategies... Brexit will also be on the minds of MPs on the the Treasury Select Committee. They will be questioning Michael Saunders, the new member of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee, from 10am. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll then hear from Anil Kashyap, who is joining the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Policy Committee. Saunders has already said that the UK economy has performed better than the Bank expected, since the Brexit vote. Also coming up.... Tech giant Samsung is in a full-blown crisis, after pulling all its Galaxy Note 7 smartphones from sale around the globe. Several customers have reported that replacement devices have overheated, or caught fire: The oil price has hit a one-year high overnight, after Russia backed the output curbs proposed by the Opec cartel. Oil ministers are gathering in Istanbul this week for the World Energy Conference, so further developments are possible. Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government is presenting its budget today; the first since Britain voted to leave the EU. And European stock markets are expected to dip in early trading, after London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 closed at a 15-month high last night. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

That reduces the stress in the system, meaning firms won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to post as much capital or buy as much insurance.</p> <p>Cunliffe then, politely, rubbishes the idea that derivative contracts need to be cleared in the jurisdiction of the currency that they are issued in.</p> <p>Currently, London clears contracts priced in euros, dollars, and yen (for example).</p> <p>It you make multi-currency infrastructure impossible, then the cost of clearing derivatives will go up.</p> <p>And fragmenting the system could create financial stability risks, if the current set-up in London is replaced by several smaller operations.</p> <p>He says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I can understand the politics around this, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re taking technically about multi-currency infrastructure.</p> <p>If we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re talking about going to a world where you have to clear in the jurisdiction of issue, then the costs are going to go up in a pretty big way.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Q: So are you saying that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unlikely that euro clearing will move out of London to the EU, if it was a rational decision?</em></p> <p>I think the system works well now, Cunliffe replies diplomatically.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T10:24:49.798Z\">at 11.24am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fe04bde4b01d9dd2c90200\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T09:50:41.496Z\">10.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Cunliffe: City jobs could move to New York after Brexit</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"20682ee343a0b11cffe65f464b5e38a258851ed1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20682ee343a0b11cffe65f464b5e38a258851ed1/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wall Street, in New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wall Street, in New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Lennihan/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>City jobs are more likely to move to New York than to Europe, if Britain loses access to the single market, Sir Jon Cunliffe argues.</strong><br></p> <p>The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy governor tells the House of Lords committee that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not plausible that London banks would move their operations to other European capitals.</p> <p>The current system is simply too complex, and reliant on other industries, so can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t simply be copied.:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial ecosystem being replicated elsewhere in the foreseeable future, in one place in the European Union.</p> <p>It takes an awful lot of time, human capital, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s based around the interaction of financial services and other services.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>The idea that this ecosystem can be transplanted to Europe in the foreseeable future is highly unlikely.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cunliffe then cites research showing that a quarter of the value of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctransaction chain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 comes from other financial firms who take part in the transaction, and another quarter comes from non-financial companies such as lawyer.</p> <p>You need those things to be able to work together seamlessly.</p> <p><strong>And in New York, that already happens.

                "bodyText":"After another volatile day, the pound now seems to have settled around the $1.22 mark. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a cent higher than last night, but still close to the record low struck after Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout. The City has a lot to digest -- from the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s refusal to hold a vote on triggering article 50 to warnings that City jobs could move to New York if the UK leaves the single market. So here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest news story on the financial implications of Brexit: A brief rally in the pound was quickly reversed on Wednesday after the government refused to make tariff-free access to the European Union\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s single market a red line in Brexit negotiations with Brussels. Investors sold the pound after Brexit minister David Davis told MPs it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not black or white\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd whether the UK would stay in the single market. Sterling fell two cents to $1.21 on the currency markets in afternoon trading, reversing a jump to $1.23 overnight that followed Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concession for parliament to hold a debate on the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stance on talks with the EU. The U-turn in agreeing to a debate initially lifted markets, but the refusal of ministers to clarify the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position provoked a swift reversal in sentiment and the pound ended the day at $1.22. The pound has tumbled since last week when in her party conference speech May appeared to put taking control over immigration above retaining access to the single market on the current tariff-free terms. According to Bank of England figures, which compare the pound to a basket of major currencies, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency has fallen to its lowest level since the 1970s, when records began. The figures show that the value of sterling has fallen to below the levels seen in the aftermath of the 2008 banking crisis and the slump in the pound in 1992 that followed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Black Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the European Union exchange rate mechanism. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow (unless sterling has a major wipeout tonight, in which case I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll fire this blog up again,..) GW The FT have an interesting Brexit story tonight. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re reporting that Brussels wants the UK to stump up \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20bn in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdivorce payments\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, to cover commitments in the EU budget - from pension contributions to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share of large projects. That could spark a major row that could make it harder to agree an amicable split..... The story is here (behind the FT paywall), and here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the top line: Unilever and Tesco aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only companies struggling to come to terms with the slump in sterling. Other businesses chiefs, including the boss of BT, have also warned that prices are going to rise as firms pass on higher import costs to consumers. The Press Association also noticed that the pound shed its early gains after David Davis began outlining the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit plans (in rather limited detail). My colleague John Harris can see the big picture: The clash between Tesco and Unilever over the weak pound is causing a stir on social media: And one for foreign exchange traders... The pound is clinging onto today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s modest gains, after the minutes of the last meeting of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank policymakers was released. The minutes show that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153several members\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the Federal Reserve favour raising US interest rates \u00e2\u20ac\u0153relatively soon\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, if the economy keeps performing as expected. However, others favoured hanging fire a bit longer, to see how inflation and employment play out. So, nothing too sensational. The prospect of a rate hike in December is helping the dollar to strengthen, but the pound is still up around one cent at $1.2222. As if Britain didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have enough to worry about, the slump in the pound means you may not be able to pick up a jar of Marmite from Tesco. A row had broken out between the supermarket chain and consumer goods giant Unilever, over who should shoulder the impact of the weaker sterling, which has pushed up the cost of raw materials. My colleague Sarah Butler explains: Tesco is running short of stocks of a range of household brands from Marmite to Comfort fabric conditioner after a row with its major supplier Unilever. It is understood that Unilever has halted deliveries to Tesco after a dispute over price. The food, toiletries and household goods supplier has been attempting to raise prices across a wide range of goods by about 10%, blaming the falling value of the pound against the euro and the dollar. Some products are now unavailable on Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website, and in short supply in the aisles, as Sarah adds: In different areas of the country a number of Unilever brands have sold out. They include Persil, Surf, Dove, Comfort, Ben &amp; Jerry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ice cream, Elmlea, Colman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Helmann\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Marmite, Knorr, Bertolli, Flora, Comfort and Pot Noodle. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs has created a stir, by predicting that sterling could shed another 7%. The pound has already dropped by around 17% since the EU referendum; Goldman points out that 25% slumps aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t terribly uncommon.... A reminder, the UK parliament debate on Brexit is being covered in our politics live blog here: Meanwhile the pound has edged up a little, and is now 0.9% better at $1.2228. Ahead of the minutes from the latest US Federal Reserve meeting, and as the pound recovers slightly but remains close to its record lows, European markets have ended the day lower. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: A small recovery in US markets at the beginning of the session is already beginning to fizzle out, while the US dollar is doing well ahead of Fed minutes, on the expectation that the account of the most recent meeting will show a committee still keen to raise rates. As has been the case for the week thus far, attention has focused mainly on sterling, thanks to the absence of heavy-hitting UK data. The pound continues to lose ground, testing the water below $1.22 again, although indications that the UK government may have to navigate Parliament before activating Article 50 have helped to stem downside in cable today. In a quiet session the main event, Fed minutes, is still to come, and could yet reverse the weakness in equities and the relatively sparky performance of the dollar. Of particular note this afternoon is a possible breakout in dollar/yen which is finally trying to move meaningfully above Y104. 2016 has been, by and large, a year of yen strength, but it will be music to Shinzo Abe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ears if the Japanese currency finally begins to fall. After all, if the UK can do it, why not Japan? On the European markets, the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 46.87 points or 0.66% at 7024.01 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.51% to 10,523.07 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.44% at 4452.24 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.02% to 16,470.28 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.08% at 8686.5 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.16% to 586.24 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 31 points or l0.18%. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story on the debate in parliament, with MPs warning the government that the current uncertainty is hitting businesses and markets. Rowena Mason reports: A string of Tory and Labour MPs have warned David Davis, the Brexit secretary, that businesses and financial markets are being spooked by his lack of a plan for leaving the EU. Claire Perry, a Conservative former minister, said on Wednesday she was extremely concerned about the state of the pound and accused him of putting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153narrow ideology\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ahead of the national interest, while Ken Clarke, the former chancellor, said no foreign companies would invest until there was more clarity about the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future relationship with the outside world. Chris Philp, a Tory backbencher, urged the Brexit secretary to give away more details, saying there was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153danger some [businesses] may take decisions in the next two or three months\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to pre-emptively scale back investment and move jobs. Others to raise concerns included the serial rebel Anna Soubry, a former business minister who attended cabinet, who demanded a yes or no answer as to whether the UK would be in the single market. The Brexit secretary said it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not black or white\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd whether the UK would stay in the single market and parliament could not expect to be given every detail of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans for leaving. Davis said the government had a mandate to get the best possible deal but insisted he could go no further than talking about overarching aims because revealing the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top priority would prove \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extremely expensive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The full story is here: The pound is back below $1.22 as the lift from the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promise of a Brexit debate fades, and the US currency strengthens on the growing expectation of a rate rise from the Federal Reserve before the end of the year. Sterling is currently at $1.2193, up 0.6% on the day having earlier climbed as high as $1.2325. Against the euro the pound is up 1% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1075. A Treasury official has sought to ease fears about the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future in a post-Brexit world. Reuters reports: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial services sector will be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153high priority\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the government when it negotiates the terms of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new relationship with the European Union, the most senior official in the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance ministry said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK economy and UK exports are quite services-heavy, and financial services are an important part of that. So I think we will be very keen indeed to make sure the final agreement gives the proper place to financial services within that,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tom Scholar, permanent secretary at the Treasury said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So it will have a high priority in our discussions,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said in a hearing before the lower house of parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Treasury Committee on Wednesday. Top bankers warned on Tuesday they could start moving staff abroad as early as next year if there is no clarity on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s access to the European single market once it leaves the EU. On the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s moves today, Connor Campbell at Spreadex said: Though not as perky as at lunch time the pound has nevertheless held onto its earlier gains this afternoon. In the face of US investors keen to buy the dollar as Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential campaign disintegrates, and a speech from Brexit minister David Davis that erred on the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 side of things, the pound managed to rise 0.7% against the greenback and 0.8% against the euro this Wednesday. A slight comedown from its morning highs, then, but nevertheless the kind of respite sterling was crying out for by the end of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading. Of course Brexit is not the only thing influencing currencies at the moment, the dollar in particular. The greenback is strengthening on the prospect of a possible US interest rate rise this year, with Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead in the US presidential race deemed to be something which could allow the Fed to move. The minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting, which left rates unchanged, will therefore be scrutinised for clues as to what the Fed members are thinking. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The US dollar has continued to be the primary beneficiary of this uncertainty hitting its highest levels since March, as markets look to the potential for a rate rise in December ahead of the publication later today of the latest FOMC minutes, where we will get further insight into the level of the dissent about last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to hold rates steady. We know the doves were able to win the argument this time, however we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how wide the divisions were and whether any other members felt compelled to go with the dissenters, but harboured enough doubts to hold back and wait a little bit longer. If the minutes point to any waverers on the dove front then the US dollar could well take another leg higher. Some choice words from ex-chancellor Kenneth Clarke: Time for some charts. This one shows how the pound has suffered a volatile few days \u00e2\u20ac\u201c starting with Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flash crash, and continuing with last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rout. And this one, from fastFT, shows how the pound hit an all-time low against a basket of currencies last night (the data only goes back to mid-1880s). The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mehreen Khan says: According to a trade-weighted index measuring sterling against a basket of its trading peers, the pound has now slumped to its lowest on record, stretching beyond the introduction of free-floating exchange rates in the 1970s, back to the mid-1800s according to data compiled by the Bank of England. The pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s effective exchange rate, which is weighted to reflect the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade flows, hit a low of 73.38 on Tuesday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c weaker than the depths hit during the financial crisis, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ejection from the European Rate Mechanism in 1992, and its decision to leave the Gold Standard in the 1930s. The pound lurched back below $1.22 as the government outlined its Brexit strategy -- although David Davis didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t shed much new light on the situation. Secretary of state Davis promised to get the best possible terms for the UK as it leaves the EU, but refused to say whether, for example, it had ruled out retaining membership of the single market. Instead, Davis said he could only outline the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153overarching aims\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have been pretty clear on the overarching aims. Not the detailed aims. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not even at the point that that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible. Davis insists this is sensible, as the government isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t planning to trigger article 50 for several months. But this lack of detail could disappoint the financial markets as they try to get a grip on Brexit. So, the pound is now only up 0.6% against the US today, meaning it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close to the all-time record low hit yesterday. Remember, the deputy governor of the Bank of England has already warned today that markets don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cope well with political uncertainty.... Christopher Vecchio of DailyFX.com reckons that investors are fretting about Brexit again, after a brief respite this morning... British government debt is also dropping in value, hitting its weakest level since the end of June. The yield (or interest rate) on 10-year gilts has risen to 1.06%, from 0.98% last night. Yields rise when prices fall, so this means investors are selling gilts, pushing up the cost of servicing Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national debt and financing the deficit. Another day, another bout of sterling volatility.... Eek, the pound is now shedding some of its earlier surge. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now up just one cent, at $1.22, having hit $1.23 earlier. Investors may be watching parliament, where David Davis, secretary of state for exiting the EU, has insisted no party will get a veto on Brexit. A fascinating debate is underway in the House of Commons now, as MPs discuss how they will scrutinise Brexit. Keir Starmer, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow secretary for exiting the EU, is arguing that parliament must get a vote on the terms of leaving the European Union. Other members are agreeing, including former attorney general (and Conservative MP) Dominic Grieve: Andrew Sparrow is live-blogging the whole thing: We know that the pound hit a record low last night, but which way might it move next? Kallum Pickering, senior UK economist at German bank Berenberg, suggests sterling could suffer fresh losses if Brexit negotiations get off on the wrong foot. The latest leg down for sterling reflects the shift in market expectations towards a hard Brexit following recent comments from Prime Minister May and her cabinet. Has sterling found a bottom? That depends on how Brexit negotiations play out. If the UK and EU clash noisily in the forthcoming negotiations or if the UK goes for a \u00e2\u20ac\u2122hard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, a risk we cannot rule out, sterling is likely to continue to sink further. But... If the UK and the EU agree to part ways in an amicable manner, and if the UK secures good terms for post-Brexit trade, sterling is likely to rebound along with the UK economic outlook Confidence among Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s food industry has been rattled since the Brexit vote, a new survey has found. Although the weak pound should help exports (making Mr Kipling cakes, Marmite and Scottish shortbread more affordable abroad), manufacturers are worried that they could face new tariffs once Britain leaves the EU. The EU referendum vote has forced international investors to get up to speed on the intricacies of the UK parliament, the EU single market, the untested article 50, and scrutinise every Brexit-related headline out of London and Brussels. The Financial Times columnist Janan Ganesh suggests markets should calm down.... An important point: The pound has kicked on a little, back towards $1.23, after prime minister Theresa May told MPs she will aim for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153maximum access\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the EU single market. May says she is determined to achieve the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153right deal for the UK.....operating in and trading with\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the European market. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, though, criticised the government for lacking a clear Brexit plan. Our Politics Live blog has full coverage of Prime Minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Questions: This chart confirms that the pound plunged to a record low last night: Newsflash: Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brutal selloff drove the pound down to its lowest ever level against a basket of other currencies. New data from the Bank of England shows that trade-weighted sterling crashed through its previous seven-year low during last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading, to depths not seen before. This index values the pound against a group of other currencies including the US dollar, yen, and euro. And it hit 73.383, on the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s index, tipping through the 73.495 plumbed in December 2008 as Britain crashed into recession and several banks were bailed out. This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally means the pound has now pulled back from this nadir, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still a serious warning about the impact that Brexit has had on the pound. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still close to a near-31 year low against the US dollar, and close to a six-year low against the euro today. Mike Bird of the Wall Street Journal has a good take: The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s broad effective exchange rate index for the pound shows that the currency is now worth less than it was at the height of the 2008-09 financial crisis, or in the aftermath of Black Wednesday, when sterling left the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. Given the pound has declined from its once strong position throughout the last century, the current level means it has never traded lower against its trading partners. Reuters has more details too: Trade-weighted sterling index hits record low on Tuesday- BoE While I was watching Jon Cunliffe, Lloyds Banking Group announced it is cutting more than 1,300 jobs. Sir Jon Cunliffe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session at the House of Lords has now ended. Here are the key points from the Bank of England deputy governor: Markets are struggling to handle the political uncertainty created by Brexit. This could trigger further volatility as Britain heads to the EU exit door. There would be worrying consequences if Britain lost its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceuro clearing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 business to Europe, as some politicians demand. Costs of finance could go up, and financial instability could increase. City jobs are more likely to migrate to New York, rather than into the European Union, after Brexit. It won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be easy to replicate the passport system that allows UK firms to offer financial services across the EU. The current \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfrictionless\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 system will be lost, which could hurt the UK and Europe. Financial services firms need clarity about Brexit, and time to adjust. If they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get it, they may be forced to trigger contingency plans. Q: What are the prospects of the UK continuing to have influence over the regulation of financial services in the EU, and globally, after Brexit? Sir Jon Cunliffe says the UK won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have influence from inside on the making of EU regulation, once it has left. We will necessarily lose influence, if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not an EU member you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be inside the machinery making EU law. But he expects the EU to maintain its commitment to international standards. I hope, presume, and will devote considerable effort to ensure Britain still influence those global standards, Cunliffe adds. Q: Would the Bank of England ever \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmark the card\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of ministers over Brexit? Cunliffe says the Bank doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have that power, but it has a responsibility to monitor the UK financial system and make its views known. Onto the Brexit buzzword - uncertainty. Q: How will the Bank respond if politicians make pronouncements in the run-up to Brexit? Cunliffe repeats that markets have a general problem with political uncertainty, and there will be a lot of political noise around Brexit. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Financial Policy Committee is assessing the financial stability implications of Brexit, and will report on them through its regular publications, in the usual way. Ditto for the Monetary Policy Committee. Q: Is there a contradiction that banks want certainty, but they also want Brexit resolved quickly? Cunliffe says that: No matter how it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arranged, we just need a smooth and orderly progression from where we are to where we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going, wherever that is, so firms can plan and execute those plans. There are lots of ways we could proceed, but they are political choices. Q: But take Nissan. They won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait three years before taking an investment decision.... That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true of financial firms as well, Cunliffe says. They have have shareholders... and if there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not certainty they may need to execute plans and prepare for the future anyway. You could reach a tipping point, and go ahead before you know the full details of Brexit. Q: Is there a serious risk that the euro clearing market could move out of London? Sir Jon Cunliffe says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spent most of his career on this subject, and apologies for giving a long answer (don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry, Sir Jon, this stuff matters....) He says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unusual to see heads of state talking about something as technical as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceuro clearing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. So there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a political significance to this, which may determine the outcome. [Background: French president Francois Hollande said in June that the UK won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to keep its euro clearing business after Brexit]. But on the technical issue -- euro clearing relates to the process by which banks clear complex derivative contracts priced in euros. He explains that after the 2008 financial crisis, regulators insisted that derivatives contracts are cleared centrally, so that they could see the state of play, and if any firms are getting in trouble. You avoid what happened in the financial crisis, where as the prices of assets move quickly, counter-parties make margin calls on other counter-parties, and the situation deteriorates quickly. Cunliffe says he was at the G20 meeting in Pittsburg when regulators decided to do this, and it was the right thing. But it needs central clearing, so you can net the risks. In other words, financial firms can \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 off their margin calls, balancing contracts where are up, or down, and only post the balance. That reduces the stress in the system, meaning firms won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to post as much capital or buy as much insurance. Cunliffe then, politely, rubbishes the idea that derivative contracts need to be cleared in the jurisdiction of the currency that they are issued in. Currently, London clears contracts priced in euros, dollars, and yen (for example). It you make multi-currency infrastructure impossible, then the cost of clearing derivatives will go up. And fragmenting the system could create financial stability risks, if the current set-up in London is replaced by several smaller operations. He says: I can understand the politics around this, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re taking technically about multi-currency infrastructure. If we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re talking about going to a world where you have to clear in the jurisdiction of issue, then the costs are going to go up in a pretty big way. Q: So are you saying that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unlikely that euro clearing will move out of London to the EU, if it was a rational decision? I think the system works well now, Cunliffe replies diplomatically. City jobs are more likely to move to New York than to Europe, if Britain loses access to the single market, Sir Jon Cunliffe argues. The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy governor tells the House of Lords committee that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not plausible that London banks would move their operations to other European capitals. The current system is simply too complex, and reliant on other industries, so can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t simply be copied.: I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial ecosystem being replicated elsewhere in the foreseeable future, in one place in the European Union. It takes an awful lot of time, human capital, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s based around the interaction of financial services and other services. The idea that this ecosystem can be transplanted to Europe in the foreseeable future is highly unlikely. Cunliffe then cites research showing that a quarter of the value of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctransaction chain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 comes from other financial firms who take part in the transaction, and another quarter comes from non-financial companies such as lawyer. You need those things to be able to work together seamlessly. And in New York, that already happens. So some services could shift over the Atlantic, Cunliffe suggests. Cunliffe warns that both sides could lose out if Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial services sector loses the right to offer services across the EU, as it can today. He says: If barriers are put up between London and Europe, forcing banks to hold more capital...then that will put up the cost of finance, and financial services , on both sides of the Channel. Q: Is there scope for an early deal that would allow the City to keep these \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfinancial passports\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, or some similar service? Cunliffe says there are currently 350,000 passports in operation (I think he means in the City) and most are outbound from the UK (for example, a London firm could offer insurance across the EU). He cites a recent report that found \u00c2\u00a350bn to \u00c2\u00a360bn of UK revenue was related to EU services, some of which would be lost without passporting rights. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a significant issue. Cunliffe repeats that those passports can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t continue if Britain isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the single market, but the system could potentially be replicated. The committee ask Cunliffe for his views on the terms of Brexit, and whether a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbespoke\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 deal would help the financial services industry. Cunliffe says that the single market currently allows UK financial firms to offer services \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrelatively frictionlessly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 across the EU, by using the passport. That will be lost, if Britain isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a member of the single market, and sharing laws with other EU countries. If we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not in the single market, that means the current way that that relatively frictionless interactions take place won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t continue. That doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean it cannot continue, but it will need arranging in a new way. Currently, retail banking services don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rely on the EU single market, but \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwholesale services\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 do. So any \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbespoke deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to protect the City would have to understand how those passporting permissions are used, and by who. Q: What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the impact of the plunge in sterling? Cunliffe: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no numerical relationship between the fall in a currency and a rise in inflation. The important issue is why the exchange rate is changing. If it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s moving because of uncertainty over the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future trading relationship with Europe, that could suggest that economic demand could be weakening. But he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give a more detailed answer... Q: Has sterling over-reacted, or is it the right response? Cunliffe won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give a view on whether the markets are right, or wrong. They are processing news about the outcome. Then, he warns that global investors are disconcerted by Brexit, because it is a political issue which can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be easily fitted into their economic models. Markets find political uncertainty very difficult....And the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the European Union will be the product of political processes here and in other countries. Sir Jon Cunliffe says there is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153great uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd over the extent to which companies will leave the City, because of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU. Recent economic data has been more encouraging than feared before the referendum. But uncertainty over the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future trade links will weigh on business investment, he cautions. Cunliffe says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a great fan of terms like \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit - you need to dig down into the details to see exactly what it means for, say, financial service firms in London (who can offer services across the EU today). And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important that Brexit doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t distract company management from wider financial stability issues. Cunliffe also says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important that companies have enough time to adjust to the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new relationship with the EU. Sir Jon Cunliffe, deputy governor of the Bank of England, is testifying to the House of Lords EU Financial Affairs Sub-Committee, about Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impact to financial services. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being streamed live here. Cunliffe is explaining about how the Brexit vote was a shock, but one which the financial markets absorbed without disaster. The financial system is more robust to the shocks from market news, and the like. But there is still great uncertainty over the timing of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU, and the details, Cunliffe continues. And the deputy governor then warns that we could see more more \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmarket induced financial events\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as Brexit negotiations get underway. And he cites last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sterling \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcFlash Crash\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as an example, adding. I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rule out.... as more news comes in, that there is potentially stress in markets. Q: So are you making more preparations ready for article 50 to be triggered in March 2017? Cunliffe says the BoE did a lot of contingency work before the referendum, and that work is still being used. Of course, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in dialogue with other central banks, he adds. Sterling just had a little wobble, after the newswires flashed up that Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokeswoman has said MPs won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a vote on whether to trigger article 50. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a surprise, of course. But it shows how edgy the markets are right now. The pound is now hovering around $1.227, up 1.5 cents today. City traders are hoping that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Opposition Day debate about Brexit scrutiny will provide some colour about the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy. Peter O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Flanagan, head of trading at Clear Treasury, says the markets are currently pricing in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153worst case scenario\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for Brexit. The pound is still the worst performing currency across the globe this year and liquidity in the pound remains weak, but any talk around Brexit that might be deemed slightly positive provides scope for a relief rally. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest news story, explaining how Theresa May has agreed to allow MPs \u00e2\u20ac\u0153full and transparent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd scrutiny of the process to exit the European Union. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s by Rowena Mason and Heather Stewart, who explain why the PM changed course (sending the pound leaping overnight). May had been facing her first government defeat over the motion on Wednesday, as a number of Conservatives indicated they were prepared to vote with Labour to demand greater public debate over the Brexit negotiating strategy. The concession does not go as far as specifying that MPs should get a formal vote on article 50 or any Brexit deal and slightly amends Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s version to say the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negotiating position must not be undermined. However, it does mean there will have to be a substantive parliamentary debate on No 10\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy at a later date before the UK embarks on Brexit. One Tory MP said this means the Commons will have to broadly approve the negotiating position before article 50 is invoked. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, said it was a significant U-turn and Labour would force the government to be accountable over Brexit. She told BBC Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today programme that the opposition would not let ministers \u00e2\u20ac\u0153go into a locked room and come out with some plan that they want to keep secret\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Morgan Stanley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of currency strategy, Hans Redeker, welcomes the news that Theresa May will allow a debate on Brexit strategy. He says: After weeks of tough rhetoric pushing sterling into a trading environment closer to an emerging market currency, the government may aim to stabilise markets, with its rhetoric and suggestions now possibly shifting in tone,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, Redeker also questions whether MPs will really be given proper scrutiny. There is a fine line to walk as May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Conservative Party wants a clean split from Europe. In addition, giving in too much, even before Article 50 negotiations have started,shifts the negotiation advantage towards the EU. Hence, the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rebound should be limited and followed by a decline.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Despite jumping by almost two cents this morning, the pound is still worth less than first thing yesterday morning. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because sterling was duffed up in the foreign exchange markets last night, plummeting through the $1.21 mark. The pound then soared back overnight, following reports that Theresa May would allow MPs more Brexit scrutiny. Mike Bird of the Wall Street Journal has the details: Despite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally, the pound is still around 5% weaker than before the Conservative Party conference, where Theresa May promised to trigger article 50 within six months. The recent slide in sterling, and the alarming \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflash crash\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 last Friday, must have caused some concern in Downing Street (even though a weaker pound should help the economy rebalance). The Financial Times reports today that some senior Tories have admitted privately that the weak pound could create serious political headaches. Mrs May said last week that the fundamentals in the British economy were strong and that the economy had grown more strongly than many had expected after the June 23 Brexit vote. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We see sterling moving in different ways at different times,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. But some Tory MPs warn that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153imported\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd inflation will erode living standards and undermine Mrs May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to help the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ordinary working-class\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britons who saw the Brexit vote as a cry for help. The rising cost of fuel, food and foreign holidays are already being felt by families described by Mrs May as those who are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just getting by\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Labour has called for pro-Brexit ministers to apologise. This chart, from Capital Economics, suggests the pound has been \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcoversold\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 recently, compared to what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect based on likely interest rate moves. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sterling rally may not last, according to Neil Wilson, analyst at City firm ETX Capital. He reckons the pound will suffer more volatility, as the political drama around Brexit continues to play out. Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision last night to allow the House of Commons a debate on the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit plans before triggering Article 50 seems to have allayed some of the concerns about a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that had dominated since her speech at the Conservative Party conference. Bank of England policymakers had also appeared to talk the currency lower. But if traders think the mood is turning bullish for the pound, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re mistaken. The bears are still very much in control and this relief rally looks like a dead cat bounce London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has dipped in early trading, sending the FTSE 100 index down by 21 points (or -0.3%) to 7049. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly due to this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sterling rally. A stronger pound isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t great news for internationally-focused companies, who earn most of their earnings in foreign currencies. Oh in other words: The pound is also enjoying a good morning against the euro, up over 1% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.108. Asa Bennett of the Daily Telegraph has a good explanation of how MPs are being allowed more scrutiny of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit plans. This is from his morning email: The Government may not want to give a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153running commentary\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on its Brexit strategy, but MPs are very keen for Parliament to have its say. Some Tory MPs are among them, with Stephen Phillips warning ministers that they would be acting like a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tyranny\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to negotiate Brexit without consulting Parliament. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That really is a democratic deficit,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd writes Philip Johnston in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s paper. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Actually, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not mince words. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dictatorship.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit means Brexit, James Kirkup adds, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153but Parliament is Parliament\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Labour is hoping to exploit this concern by pushing an Opposition Day motion today calling for Parliament to be able to scrutinise the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit plan before Article 50 is triggered, and offering 170 questions for ministers to answer. It looks like the Opposition has scored a direct hit, as the Government moved last night to table a surprise amendment offering MPs extra Parliamentary scrutiny of the Brexit process in order to prevent Tory MPs from rebelling, which Labour has trumpeted as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one hell of a climbdown\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Paul Donovan of Swiss bank UBS confirms that this \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsurprise amendment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 has help the pound to rally. He writes: The UK government indicated that Parliament may have a say on its negotiation stance ahead of the exit discussions with the EU. The change in the nuance of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position has halted the seemingly inexorable decline of sterling. Markets are once again the idle playthings of politicians\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 whims. The pound is rallying hard this morning, following signs that the government will allow MPs more scrutiny of its plans to leave the European Union. Sterling has gained more than 1.5 cents this morning, popping back over the $1.23 mark as traders give the pound new vote of confidence. Last night, it fell as low as $1.208, on fears that a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 would hurt the UK economy. So what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s changed? Well, overnight, Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government has accepted that MPs should be allowed a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153full and transparent debate on the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to leave the EU\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This proposals comes from the opposition Labour party, which is demanding \u00e2\u20ac\u0153proper scrutiny\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans in Parliament before Article 50 is triggered, in March 2017. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposal will be debated in parliament today, and May has already signalled that she will allow such a debate But she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also added an amendment, insisting that such scrutiny shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t \u00e2\u20ac\u0153undermine the negotiating position of the government\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Effectively she doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want her hands tied during the Brexit negotiations by MPs back in London. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also NOT allowing MPs a formal vote on whether to trigger article 50. But still....Labour MP Keir Starmer says this is a victory for MPs who have been demanding proper parliamentary scrutiny of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans for Brexit. The prospect of MPs giving the Brexit plan more scrutiny has reassured investors, as it could limit the prospects of a damaging \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 which would see the UK banished from the single market. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite a turnaround for the pound, after four days of chunky losses: What a difference a day makes, the pound is the top performer in the G10 on Wednesday, rising by more than 1.3% versus the euro, and 1% versus the US dollar. The trigger was a surprise announcement from Prime Minister Theresa May that she will allow Parliament to vote on her plan to take the EU out of the European Union. This will allow the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s elected representatives to scrutinize Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans for Brexit. It has triggered a relief rally in the pound on Wednesday, as it could potentially limit the prospect of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd taking the UK out of the single market, which has been a major concern for some investors and the business community in recent days. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be watching the pound closely again, after last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heavy losses sent sterling down below the $1.21 mark last night. Overnight, a government advisor has warned that leaving the EU customs union would have a significant negative impact on the UK economy, in the long term. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s added to concerns that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial sector will suffer badly from Brexit, if banks start to shift jobs out of the City. Bank of England deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe should give his views this morning; he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testifying to the House of Lords from 10am on Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impact on the UK financial services business. And airline group Monarch is just announcing a new \u00c2\u00a3165m funding deal that should keep it running. More on that shortly....",

                "body":"<p>Justifying poor policy often makes politicians say dumb things, and yesterday we saw a classic case by the minister for finance, Senator Mathias Cormann, as he attempted to argue that a tax cut for people earning over $80,000 was necessary to encourage part-time workers make the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153additional effort\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to work full-time.</p> <p>The policy to increase the threshold of the 37% income tax bracket from $80,001 to $87,001 is notionally about reducing bracket creep.</p> <p>Bracket creep occurs when due to a wage rise you move into a higher tax bracket. In effect, it is a tax increase by stealth. For example, a person earning $79,000 who got a 2% wage rise to $80,580, goes from paying a marginal tax rate of 32.5% to 37%.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2016/oct/13/coalition-embarrassed-by-mistaken-support-for-labor-vote-politics-live\">Coalition embarrassed by mistaken support for Labor vote \u00e2\u20ac\u201c politics live</a> </p> </aside>  <p> But we need a bit of context. They would only be paying 37% tax for the $579 they earned above $80,001, the rest would be unchanged.</p> <p>The tax changes mean that now instead of going into a higher tax bracket, this person would remain with a tax rate of 32.5%. It makes a difference of $26 a year less in tax.</p> <p>The biggest tax cut anyone will get is those who earn over $87,001 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they will get a cut of $315 a year, or $6 a week.</p> <p>Some economists care about bracket creep because they believe it is a deterrent to work \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in effect you will choose not to work extra hours or cut back on your hours to avoid the higher tax bracket. And as result, workforce participation is reduced.</p> <p> It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a nice argument, but it works better in theory than in practice.</p> <p>In reality, what studies have found is that people keep working the same amount, they just try to reduce their <em>taxable</em> income by either reducing non-wage income or using new ways to increase their income deductions.</p> <p>But most people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t earn over $80,000, let alone $87,000.

                "bodyText":"Justifying poor policy often makes politicians say dumb things, and yesterday we saw a classic case by the minister for finance, Senator Mathias Cormann, as he attempted to argue that a tax cut for people earning over $80,000 was necessary to encourage part-time workers make the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153additional effort\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to work full-time. The policy to increase the threshold of the 37% income tax bracket from $80,001 to $87,001 is notionally about reducing bracket creep. Bracket creep occurs when due to a wage rise you move into a higher tax bracket. In effect, it is a tax increase by stealth. For example, a person earning $79,000 who got a 2% wage rise to $80,580, goes from paying a marginal tax rate of 32.5% to 37%. But we need a bit of context. They would only be paying 37% tax for the $579 they earned above $80,001, the rest would be unchanged. The tax changes mean that now instead of going into a higher tax bracket, this person would remain with a tax rate of 32.5%. It makes a difference of $26 a year less in tax. The biggest tax cut anyone will get is those who earn over $87,001 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they will get a cut of $315 a year, or $6 a week. Some economists care about bracket creep because they believe it is a deterrent to work \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in effect you will choose not to work extra hours or cut back on your hours to avoid the higher tax bracket. And as result, workforce participation is reduced. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a nice argument, but it works better in theory than in practice. In reality, what studies have found is that people keep working the same amount, they just try to reduce their taxable income by either reducing non-wage income or using new ways to increase their income deductions. But most people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t earn over $80,000, let alone $87,000. As a result, this measure is greatly targeted to the wealthy. It was on this point that Cormann found himself selling economic snake oil. While debating the legislation yesterday in the Senate, the Greens Senator, Peter Whish-Wilson, asked Cormann who would receive the benefit of the tax. He replied that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the government is focusing on average full-time wage earners, and no average full-time wage earner will miss out on this tax cut.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Now this is some pretty sneaky use of language. Cormann is right to suggest that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no average full-time wage earner\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will miss out. The current average \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ordinary\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd full-time earnings is $78,832 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c requiring just a 1.5% increase to get to $80,000 by the end of 2016-17. But the average wage is a very skewed way to look at income. If you have nine people earning $50,000 and one person earning $150,000 then the average earnings of that group is $60,000 even though only one person in the group earns at least that amount. And when talking about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153average full-time workers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd things get even more skewed because 63% of all full-time workers are men, and their average wage is much higher than that of women. The current average total full-time earnings for men is $88,223, while for women it is just $71,245. So when Cormann talks of average full-time workers, he is really talking average male full-time workers. And while \u00e2\u20ac\u0153average\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sounds like you are talking about someone on middle income, it is actually talking about the top third of wage earners. In 2013-14, when the average annual full-time earnings was $78,972, the median taxable income for men was $62,000, and for women it was just $47,284: In that year, just 35% of men had a taxable income above the average full-time amount, and just 17% of women: So in no way are those earning $80,000 on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153middle incomes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But rather than suggest the tax cut was designed to benefit such workers, Cormann yesterday tried to spin it as a marvel of incentives for part-time workers. He argued of the policy that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the whole purpose is to provide an incentive for part-time workers to work more hours without being penalised with a higher tax rate. That is the whole point\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The whole point. Seriously. He continued by suggesting, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we want families to be encouraged to stretch themselves to put in an additional effort, but not to be penalised with a higher tax rate as a result\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. OK, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work this through. Cormann is suggesting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the whole point\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of this tax cut, which is costing $4bn over four years, is to encourage people who are now working part-time to go full-time. He also believes they can do this just by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stretching themselves\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. OK then, let us pretend we have a woman working part time and earning $48,000 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the current average earnings for all women (and thus a very well paid part-time position). If, by some dint of luck and hard work, she was able to get a full-time job that paid $87,000, her after tax income would go from $41,333 to $67,178 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a 63.3% increase. Cormann would have you believe that because in the past her after-tax income would have gone up by 62.3% to $66,863, that part-time worker would have been less willing to take on the job. Please. The only part-time workers who would in any way be affected by this tax cut are those earning $79,000, and who through working more hours would earn above $80,000. Not exactly a key group in need of assistance. Rather than affecting those already earning close to 40% more than what the median worker in Australia earns, bracket creep is much more of an issue for those on low incomes, who will lose welfare benefits and go above the tax-free threshold. The key issue of labour force participation is about getting people back into the workforce. Does Senator Cormann really believe we have such a problem with part-time workers not taking full-time jobs earning over $80,000 that we need to spend $4bn to solve it? When asked to provide evidence that the tax cut would actually create any incentive for part-time workers, Cormann merely drew attention to Treasury modelling, which provides no modelling whatsoever regarding increased labour participation, let alone a shift from part-time to full-time. But if that is what Cormann argues is the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153whole point\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, then that is the basis by which the policy and the government should be judged.",

The trend so far suggests that, over the year as a whole, receipts could undershoot by \u00c2\u00a314bn.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>The next few months might however contain some better news on receipts. The recent rise in income tax on dividend income is likely to have led to some owner-managers bringing forward their dividend payments. As a result we can expect strong growth in income tax receipts on dividend payments to arrive around the self-assessment deadline at the end of January. Therefore a better estimate for receipts this year is for an undershoot of \u00c2\u00a38bn, driven by with weak receipts from income tax and National Insurance on earnings, and from VAT on purchases.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd </p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>On 23 November, the new chancellor will present his response to a much changed economic outlook at the Autumn Statement.

Nick Davies, head of residential development at Stirling Ackroyd, says the slowdown in sales is due to a shortage of homes coming onto the market.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While the demand for homes continues to grow and interest rates are at a record low, the lack of properties available is reducing sales and driving up house prices. If government wants to support the property sector and help first-time buyers, they will need to increase the circulation of homes on the market. </p> <p>In order to achieve this, they first need significantly step-up the construction of new homes - David Cameron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Government built the fewest new homes of any administration since the 1920s. Theresa May must do better. More also needs to be done to encourage older people to consider downsizing, freeing up more homes for families and younger buyers. Reducing Stamp Duty rates would provide a greater incentive to move home, increasing the flow of properties onto the market and ensuring house prices remained stable.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5809fbf4e4b055209adafe26\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-21T11:31:01.723Z\">12.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Burberry shares jump on Coach merger report</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Burberry shares have jumped more than 5% to \u00c2\u00a315.27 after financial blog Betaville (citing sources) reported that US rival Coach was working with investment bank Evercore on a potential merger with Burberry.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b3e5aab5f9014796aeacf634cef1085af453f75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b3e5aab5f9014796aeacf634cef1085af453f75/0_188_3508_2105/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Burberry at Castleford\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Burberry at Castleford</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Burberry</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-21T11:32:23.844Z\">at 12.32pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5809f7f8e4b005f21833bc79\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-21T11:24:18.417Z\">12.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Property conference MIPIM UK, a three-day event (the UK offshoot of the annual Cannes conference) draws to a close today.

We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had some technical issues here, hence the long silence. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has published its analysis of the UK public finance figures. Thomas Pope, a research economist at the respected think tank, said: At the half way point in the financial year, tax receipts have disappointed while central government spending has been slightly lower than official forecasts for the year imply. Overall, borrowing looks set to be higher than the OBR forecast in March, possibly by a reasonable margin. The trend so far suggests that, over the year as a whole, receipts could undershoot by \u00c2\u00a314bn. The next few months might however contain some better news on receipts. The recent rise in income tax on dividend income is likely to have led to some owner-managers bringing forward their dividend payments. As a result we can expect strong growth in income tax receipts on dividend payments to arrive around the self-assessment deadline at the end of January. Therefore a better estimate for receipts this year is for an undershoot of \u00c2\u00a38bn, driven by with weak receipts from income tax and National Insurance on earnings, and from VAT on purchases.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd On 23 November, the new chancellor will present his response to a much changed economic outlook at the Autumn Statement. Borrowing looks likely to be larger this year than his predecessor expected in March, which will make the challenge he faces more difficult. The full analysis is on the IFS website. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s have a look at the markets. The FTSE 100 index is trading 25 points higher at 7051.89, a 0.36% gain. It has been hovering around this level most of the day. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has slipped 0.03% to 10,699.45 while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC is down 0.16% to 4532.31. On currency markets, growing expectations of a Fed rate hike in December mean that the dollar is on course for its third consecutive week of gains, measured against a basket of currencies. The dollar index is up 0.27% at 98.581. Amid worries over a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hard Brexit,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sterling is sliding against the dollar, losing 0.6% to $1.2182, as Theresa May attends her first EU summit. Against the euro, the pound is flat. The UK public finances worsened unexpectedly in September, with the government borrowing \u00c2\u00a310.6bn rather than \u00c2\u00a38.5bn as forecast by the City. There was a rare fall in corporation tax receipts. This knocked the public finances further off course and will present a headache for chancellor Philip Hammond, who is preparing for the autumn statement on 23 November. Meanwhile, Brian Murphy, head of lending at the Mortgage Advice Bureau, says: The data released this morning from HMRC suggests a healthy level of transactions for last month, given the context that the average property transaction will take 12 to 14 weeks to conclude, meaning that the data compiled for September completions is based on those who would have committed to their purchase in late June or early July, e.g. directly after the referendum result. August completions reflect purchases which were started in May, which is typically a busy month as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the tail end of the Spring market, rather than June which generally sees the start of the summer holiday hiatus, and September 2015 was exceptionally busy due to pent up demand following the General Election. Looking at the bigger picture... we would anticipate that by the end of the year, the total number of residential property transactions could stand at around 1.2m. This would certainly be in line with 2014 and 2015 levels, and a substantial increase on transaction volumes in 2011, 2012, 2013. Here is some reaction to the fall in property transactions in September, reported earlier. Nick Davies, head of residential development at Stirling Ackroyd, says the slowdown in sales is due to a shortage of homes coming onto the market. While the demand for homes continues to grow and interest rates are at a record low, the lack of properties available is reducing sales and driving up house prices. If government wants to support the property sector and help first-time buyers, they will need to increase the circulation of homes on the market. In order to achieve this, they first need significantly step-up the construction of new homes - David Cameron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Government built the fewest new homes of any administration since the 1920s. Theresa May must do better. More also needs to be done to encourage older people to consider downsizing, freeing up more homes for families and younger buyers. Reducing Stamp Duty rates would provide a greater incentive to move home, increasing the flow of properties onto the market and ensuring house prices remained stable. Burberry shares have jumped more than 5% to \u00c2\u00a315.27 after financial blog Betaville (citing sources) reported that US rival Coach was working with investment bank Evercore on a potential merger with Burberry. Property conference MIPIM UK, a three-day event (the UK offshoot of the annual Cannes conference) draws to a close today. It was attended by 3,000 investors, housing experts and developers. The conference focused on how the property market will be affected by the Brexit vote. The organisers noted that Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government has stressed the commitment to boosting housing and developing infrastructure. Industry analysts say that despite uncertainty caused by the referendum, the weak pound is attracting international investors. Sir Howard Davies, chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland, echoed these comments when he opened the conference on Wednesday, saying sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide had made the UK more attractive to dollar investors. But Davies also predicted slower economic growth post-Brexit, and noted that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the froth has gone off the London property market\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as a number of banks are preparing to move operations elsewhere in the EU. Guy Hands, the financier who founded buyout firm Terra Firma, was quite blunt in stating: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nobody has any real idea of what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to happen\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the property market. But he pointed to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153chronic housing shortage,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd estimated at about 1.2m homes. He also challenged the notion that the eurozone could claim London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial crown, saying US banks were more likely to relocate to New York than Frankfurt or Paris. The Unite union said it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deeply concerned\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about Bombardier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Belfast workforce, which is involved in every Bombardier line of production. Canadian plane and train maker Bombardier has announced another big round of redundancies, the second this year. The company said today that it would cut a further 7,500 jobs globally over the next couple of years, or 10% of its workforce. This includes 2,000 job losses in Canada. Bombardier chief executive Alain Bellemare told Reuters: We understand these are difficult decisions ... but in the end what we are going to be left with is a leaner, stronger organisation. Returning to the dire government borrowing figures... Commercial property deals are also down, to 9,670. This is a 3.9% fall from the August number and 3.8% below September 2015. The number of residential property transactions in the UK fell to 93,130 last month, according to seasonally adjusted figures from HMRC. The number is down by 4.3% compared with August, and 11.3% below last September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PricewaterhouseCoopers, says the public borrowing figures were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a bit of a cold shower for the chancellor after the recent run of generally favourable post-referendum economic data\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It is therefore looking increasingly difficult for the Chancellor to meet the OBR forecast from March that total public borrowing in 2016/17 will be \u00c2\u00a355.5 billion, which would require borrowing in the second half of the year to come in at just \u00c2\u00a310 billion. A more likely outcome based on the available data is that the budget deficit this year will come in at around \u00c2\u00a365-70 billion. We would not, however, expect the Chancellor to take any immediate action in the Autumn Statement to correct this budget deficit overshoot, as this could be counterproductive and further weaken the economy. Instead we would expect some increase in planned public sector investment over the next few years, allied to a commitment to eliminate the current budget deficit (excluding net investment) before 2020 and to keep the ratio of public sector debt to GDP on a gradual downward path in the medium term.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Howard Archer, chief European and UK economist at IHS Markit, says of the borrowing figures: This highlights the fact that the Chancellor has limited room for fiscal stimulus in the Autumn Statement if he is to maintain credible adherence to fiscal discipline. Both the Prime Minister and Chancellor have stressed the need for fiscal responsibility. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote to leave the European Union clearly put the fiscal target for 2016/17 out of reach and the longer-term targets are now clearly off the table as the Theresa May government has acknowledged by abandoning the target of a budget surplus by 2019/20. Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at economic consultancy Capital Economics, expects government borrowing to overshoot the OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecast of \u00c2\u00a355.5bn for the fiscal year by around \u00c2\u00a317bn. The latest outturn puts the public finances well off track to meet the OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s March forecast. Even before the vote to leave the EU, the OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal forecasts were looking optimistic. But the weaker economic prospects over the next few years as a result means that these forecasts are likely to be revised substantially in the Autumn Statement next month. Indeed, we think the OBR will present the Chancellor with forecasts for borrowing that are about \u00c2\u00a325bn higher in 2019/20 than the previous forecast. However, this shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t trouble the Chancellor too much. In fact he has already suggested that he will allow an easing of the fiscal squeeze in the near term in order to provide the economy with some support. Austerity is far from over, but the fact that the economy is now not set to face a significant ramping up of the pace of fiscal consolidation over the next few years is another reason to think that growth won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t slow too sharply. The bigger September deficit means that borrowing for the first six months of the year is \u00c2\u00a345.5bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c down nearly 5% from the same period last year, but closer to the \u00c2\u00a355.5bn forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility for the entire year. Hammond has indicated that he will reduce the deficit more slowly than his predecessor George Osborne, to help the economy weather the shock of the Brexit vote in June. The latest figures, and the likelihood of weaker tax revenues if the economy slows in the wake of the referendum, pile further pressure on the chancellor, as he prepares for his autumn statement on 23 November. The UK ran a budget deficit of \u00c2\u00a310.6bn in September, much bigger than expected. This is a major setback for Philip Hammond, the chancellor, ahead of his autumn statement next month. The budget shortfall was 14.5% higher than in September last year, and wrongfooted City economists who had expected the public finances to improve (to an \u00c2\u00a38.5bn deficit). Receipts from corporation tax and property transactions both fell in September, compared with a year ago, while VAT receipts grew at a slower pace. The Office for National Statistics said it was the first fall in corporation tax revenues seen in the month of September since 2009. It was unable to provide a reason. The growth in VAT receipts was the slowest for the month of September since 2012. The euro remains under pressure, trading at its lowest level against the dollar since March, after Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments on quantitative easing yesterday. As UBS Wealth Management\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Paul Donovan put it: The first rule of Fight Club is you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t talk about tapering. The second rule of Fight Club is you DO NOT talk about tapering. The ECB did not talk about tapering. The ECB did not talk about talking about tapering. The ECB will probably taper its quantitative policy. Back to BAT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed takeover of Reynolds, a $47bn deal. Guy Ellison, head of UK equities at Investec Wealth &amp; Investment, said: The timing is a surprise, but the strategic rationale makes perfect sense, pivoting BAT further towards the high value US market, consolidating some strong brands and Reynold\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position in next generation tobacco. Despite relatively modest synergies, the deal is still seen adding value for shareholders in the first full-year after completion. The ball is now in the court of Reynolds board and shareholders to consider the offer. The ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest survey of economists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 long-term inflation expectations shows they remain near the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but GDP growth is expected to be weaker than previously thought. Inflation is currently running at 0.4% but is expected to rise to 1.8% by 2021, in line with previous projections, the survey of 47 forecasters showed. Inflation has been below the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target of nearly 2% for years amid high unemployment, high debt levels, weak services and falling oil prices. The economic growth outlook appears to have worsened, with economists now predicting 1.5% growth for 2018 and 1.6% for 2021, each 0.1% percentage points lower than three months ago. However the growth outlook for this year has improved, with the survey predicting 1.6% expansion this year, above the previous forecast of 1.5% growth. It is still slightly below the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own forecast of 1.7%. The other big news is that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s competition watchdog will investigate online betting firms and whether they are treating customers fairly. They could face fines and be forced to change their practices. Alexandra Topping writes: The Competition and Markets Authority will investigate allegations that online bookmakers are using the small print of contracts to change the odds on winning bets so less money is paid out, to limit the amount successful gamblers can bet and to deny some users access to promotions. The companies have been issued with notices requiring them to give evidence. If companies are found to be in breach of consumer law, the CMA can take enforcement measures against them. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our full story on BAT wanting to buy out US rival Reynolds, the main corporate story of the day. Reynolds owns Pall Mall, the biggest US low-cost brand, Newport, the top-selling menthol cigarette, and Camel, a mid-market name that is the third-biggest seller in the US. Turning to the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finance figures for September, out at 9.30am UK time, Investec analyst Chris Hare has sent us his thoughts. The main measure of the government deficit, PSNB, came in at \u00c2\u00a310.5bn in August. This was a touch larger than we had expected, but still represents a year-on-year borrowing decline of \u00c2\u00a30.9bn. Were borrowing to continue to improve at this pace for the remainder of the financial year we would be looking at an outturn of \u00c2\u00a364.7bn, close to \u00c2\u00a310bn above the OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s March Budget forecast of \u00c2\u00a355.5bn. Over time, we expect a post-referendum slowdown in economic activity to weigh on tax receipts. So the fiscal year borrowing overshoot will probably be larger than described in the thought exercise above. But in the near term, the post-Brexit vote economy seems to have held up rather well. So we are forecasting another (\u00c2\u00a30.4bn) year-on-year decline in borrowing, with a PSNB outturn of \u00c2\u00a38.9bn. Portugal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-year government bond yields are holding around 3.23%, near a six-week low of 3.16%, as analysts are expecting Lisbon to pass a crucial ratings review, according to Reuters. Canadian credit ratings firm DBRS will review Portugal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investment-grade debt rating after market close. A downgrade would mean that the country would not be able to participate in the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s asset purchase programme. But analysts were confident that DRBS will keep the rating unchanged, after the Portuguese government pledged budget deficit cuts for next year. However, the rating outlook could be lowered from stable to negative \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and this would make a rating cut more likely at the next review in six months\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time. European markets have defied spreadbetters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 predictions and opened higher, after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pro-stimulus talk from ECB president Mario Draghi. Only the Italian market has turned negative. FTSE 100 in London up 0.09% at 7033.77 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax up 0.07% at 10,708.46 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC up 0.16% at 4547.24 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex up 0.2% at 9080.20 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE Mib down 0.16% at 17,113.36 The euro has fallen to its lowest level against sterling since the 7 October flash crash: it has dropped to 88.96p, down 0.2% on the day, as markets digest yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ECB comments, which pointed to more quantitative easing in December. British American Tobacco has swooped on US tobacco firm Reynolds with a $47bn offer \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a mega deal that would bring together Newport, Kent, Camel and Pall Mall cigarettes and create the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest listed tobacco company. The UK group already has a 42% stake in Reynolds and wants to buy the remaining 57.8% for $47bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c $20bn in cash and $27bn in shares. BAT shares rose 2.3% to \u00c2\u00a349.14 on the news. BAT also said it had performed well in the first nine months of the year, driven by its focus on key brands Dunhill, Lucky Strike and Rothmans. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the day after the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly meeting. Markets reacted positively to the press conference, with stocks finishing higher, but are expected to open slightly lower today. What did we learn yesterday? ECB president Mario Draghi hinted that the central bank could announce more QE in December. He also indicated that an abrupt end to the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.7tn asset purchase programme was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unlikely\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. However, the governing council did not discuss extending QE or tapering at the meeting. The euro jumped initially before hitting a four-month low. Portugal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government bond yields are hovering near six-week lows, ahead of a key review by Canadian ratings firm DBRS, out after markets close. Lisbon is expected to survive the test. If it were to be downgraded it would fall out of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s QE programme. Asian and US stocks were mostly lower overnight as the price of oil slid, with the dollar hitting a seven-month high against a basket of currencies. The dollar index touched 98.564, the highest level since March. The Hong Kong stock market closed as typhoon Haima drew closer. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei fell 0.3%, the South Korean exchange lost 0.37%, Australian stocks shed 0.2%, Singapore fell 0.6% and the Shanghai market was 0.06% lower. The main piece of data today is the UK public finances, which are expected to show a a slight improvement. Economists are predicting that public sector net borrowing came in at \u00c2\u00a38.2bn in September, from \u00c2\u00a310.5bn in August. We will also get consumer confidence figures for the eurozone for October at 3pm UK time.",

                "bodyText":"Higher borrowing costs and lower tax receipts could deprive Philip Hammond of up to \u00c2\u00a314bn when he presents his autumn statement next month, denying him vital funds to boost the economy after the Brexit vote, a leading tax and spending thinktank has warned. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that an unexpected downturn in the public finances in September was likely to be repeated in the next few months and bust the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual borrowing limits set earlier this year. Thomas Pope, an economist at the IFS, said the Treasury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s room for manoeuvre would be tight after figures for the first six months of the financial year showed tax receipts had failed to match projections by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Borrowing looks set to be higher than the OBR forecast in March, possibly by a reasonable margin. The trend so far suggests that over the year as a whole receipts could undershoot by \u00c2\u00a314bn.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Pope said income from other sources could limit the hole in the Treasury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget to \u00c2\u00a38bn, but it could nevertheless act as a brake on plans to support a wide range of infrastructure projects and provide incentives for businesses to invest. The IFS report followed a collapse in corporation tax receipts to the lowest level since 2009 that helped widen the budget deficit in September to \u00c2\u00a310.6bn. A slowdown in the growth of VAT receipts was also blamed for pushing the deficit \u00c2\u00a31.3bn higher, or 14.5%, than the same month last year and above the \u00c2\u00a310.5bn recorded in August. City analysts, who had expected an \u00c2\u00a38.5bn shortfall, said the OBR would need to rip up its pre-Brexit vote forecasts after a run of projections from all the major economic institutions showing GDP growth and tax receipts slowing next year. In recent months Hammond has sent conflicting signals about the likely size and scope of extra spending to compensate for the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit negotiations and forecasts of growth for next year that have halved from around 2.2% to nearer 1%. Immediately after the vote he ripped up George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal rule of achieving a budget surplus by the end of the parliament, and talked about the need for extra spending to create jobs and improve the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s infrastructure. But he has sought to dampen expectations by emphasising that he is constrained by volatile international money markets, which could drive up the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borrowing costs if he is seen to be reckless. Hammond said on Friday: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have already made significant progress in bringing the public finances under control, reducing the deficit by almost two-thirds since 2010, but our debt and deficit remain too high. We remain committed to fiscal discipline and will return the budget to balance over a sensible period of time, in a way that allows us the space to support the economy as needed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The weak September figures took the budget deficit to \u00c2\u00a345bn for the first six months of the year, down nearly 5% from the same period in 2015. The Office for National Statistics could not offer a reason for the dive in corporation tax receipts. Paul Hollingsworth, a UK economist at Capital Economics, said if the public finances continued on the current trend, borrowing would overshoot the OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecast of \u00c2\u00a355.5bn for the financial year by about \u00c2\u00a317bn. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Even before the vote to leave the EU, the OBR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal forecasts were looking optimistic.

I remained in school for another year thinking I could wait it out. Boy, was I wrong. I ended up going to graduate school hoping to wait out the storm again. Turns out, that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help much either.

I have done consultant research, bussed tables, worked in an emergency room and even spent a year working at a Florida beach bar all while applying for applicable jobs in my field that came with benefits.

I am still a Florida registered voter so maybe my vote counts (if it does not end up on a beach somewhere). I plan to close my eyes and vote for Clinton.

Today, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m an executive assistant for a CEO. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m better off because my first job after being a stay-at-home mom for 13 years paid $50,000 and I was thrilled. In 2016, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m now at $75,000 so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve taken some job risks but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s paid off.</p> <p>But everything else \u00e2\u20ac\u201c my cost of living \u00e2\u20ac\u201c seems to have absolutely skyrocketed. I literally live paycheck to paycheck. I have two kids in college and I pay their auto, health insurance and cellphones. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crazy and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a tad frightened for the world they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll enter soon.

I always wanted to vote for the first woman, too. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re too sleazy for me. Trump scares the shit out of me. I was leaning toward him in the beginning because I do think a business person might bring a fresh perspective but, Jesus, not now.</p> <p>I think I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll write in Bernie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name.

The economy was in a total nosedive. Obama wasted no time approving large measures to stop the bleeding. I work in real estate investing. Real estate where I live has returned to 2007 prices and as a result, we have enjoyed a good ride of appreciation of homes we have bought over the last eight years.</p> <p><strong>Who will you be voting for?</strong> I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t vote for the current Republican candidate under any circumstances. He is not fit to be a CEO, much less a president. I would be fine with things staying as they are so Hillary doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t concern me that much.

Both parties make big promises which I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to be fulfilled. But at least Trump does discuss trade, jobs and manufacturing. If Congress agreed with a fraction of his bluster it might improve the economy.<br><br>But I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll NOT be voting for HRC because she is corrosive, divisive and corrupt to the core.

I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have health insurance.</p> <p>I have a master\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s degree in education, a BA, speak three languages, and I am a veteran with combat experience, yet don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a full-time job or meaningful part-time work. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make more than $15,000 a year. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unlikely that at 53 I will ever work full-time again.

Forgotten.</p> <p><strong>Who will you be voting for?</strong> Not voting, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care.</p> <h2>Leslie from Wilmington, North Carolina</h2> <p><strong>Are you better off today than you were in 2008? </strong>I am worse off than I was in 2008.</p> <p><strong>Why?</strong> I had to close the company. I went from earning $70,000 a year to now working two jobs, one full time for $37,000 a year and one part time (evenings and weekends) to bring my salary to $41,000. My health insurance costs have skyrocketed. Food is more expensive. I have a home that I cannot sell as I am still underwater. I had to use all my savings to help pay for my daughter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s education so she is not lumbered with loans when she graduates.</p> <p><strong>Who will you be voting for? </strong>I hate them both. I do feel that if Clinton is elected it will be the same, no change in the housing market, no change in income, no change in healthcare costs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just more of the same. It is appalling and tragic that we have two awful people to choose from. It just shows the level of corruption and dysfunction in this country.</p> <h2>Jacob Lutz from Portland, Oregon</h2> <p> <strong>Are you better off today than you were in 2008?</strong> I am about the same. <br></p> <p><strong>Why?</strong> In 2008, I was a student and a cashier at Kmart. I was transitioning from foster care to adulthood while balancing a part-time job with my first and last attempt at higher education. I was overwhelmed with the responsibility of college and surviving on $6.75 an hour but managed to survive thanks to my home state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s support system for foster children and lack of financial burden.</p> <p>Today, I am a motorcycle technician and make around $30,000 a year and owe $20,000 in student loans. I also pay $200 a month for health insurance and bills on top of barely supporting myself. The stress is still the same but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve gotten better at handling it. Lowering my hopes and expectations significantly has helped too.<br></p> <p><strong>Who will you be voting for?</strong> I had more faith in Bernie than Hillary regarding the economy but since he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not an option, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m with her.

I also used a lot of my savings to pay off my son\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s college law school loans as he has been unable to find even an entry-level job in the law profession.</p> <p>I had a successful, lifelong, professional career that disappeared overnight, and was unable to find comparable work because of my age and the terrible state of the economy.</p> <p>I think my efforts to navigate my way through the economic downturn likely mirror those of so many others. It isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just the loss of decent paying jobs that has been an issue. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also the erosion of savings meant for retirement. Also the enormous debts that have been run up for financial bailouts and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cheap money\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd used to inflate the stock market will have to be faced eventually.<br><br>I believe the entire political establishment has been complicit in what has happened.

I felt optimistic that it was a possibility. Now I just feel used and betrayed.</p> <p><strong>Who will you be voting for?</strong> I will be voting for Jill Stein because she represents the only real choice that exists.

Boy, was I wrong. I ended up going to graduate school hoping to wait out the storm again. Turns out, that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help much either. After graduating as a highly skilled student, finding full-time employment was about as easy as finding affordable living in Manhattan. Since then, I worked just about everywhere. I have done consultant research, bussed tables, worked in an emergency room and even spent a year working at a Florida beach bar all while applying for applicable jobs in my field that came with benefits. I finally have a job, but the amount of debt I have acquired and the amount of job insecurity I still feel has me on edge about as bad as 2008. Who will you vote for? I am absolutely terrified of what is to come November 8. I am still a Florida registered voter so maybe my vote counts (if it does not end up on a beach somewhere). I plan to close my eyes and vote for Clinton. My biggest fear is that an economic bubble worse than 2008 is coming and that I will go back to bussing tables and serving drinks again. Lori from Denver, Colorado Are you better off today than you were in 2008? I am better off than I was in 2008. In 2008, I just started working after an awful divorce. My ex-husband was a homebuilder and laid off in the crash and there went my maintenance and child support. Today, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m an executive assistant for a CEO. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m better off because my first job after being a stay-at-home mom for 13 years paid $50,000 and I was thrilled. In 2016, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m now at $75,000 so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve taken some job risks but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s paid off. But everything else \u00e2\u20ac\u201c my cost of living \u00e2\u20ac\u201c seems to have absolutely skyrocketed. I literally live paycheck to paycheck. I have two kids in college and I pay their auto, health insurance and cellphones. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crazy and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a tad frightened for the world they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll enter soon. Not sure they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll ever be able to buy a home, at least here in Colorado. Who will you be voting for? I literally despise the Clintons so I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t vote for HRC. I always wanted to vote for the first woman, too. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re too sleazy for me. Trump scares the shit out of me. I was leaning toward him in the beginning because I do think a business person might bring a fresh perspective but, Jesus, not now. I think I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll write in Bernie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what else to do. Kurt Johnson from Woodstock, Georgia Are you better off today than you were in 2008? I am better off than I was in 2008. The economy was in a total nosedive. Obama wasted no time approving large measures to stop the bleeding. I work in real estate investing. Real estate where I live has returned to 2007 prices and as a result, we have enjoyed a good ride of appreciation of homes we have bought over the last eight years. Who will you be voting for? I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t vote for the current Republican candidate under any circumstances. He is not fit to be a CEO, much less a president. I would be fine with things staying as they are so Hillary doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t concern me that much. The Senate and House will keep her from making any changes for better or worse so I can stomach another four years until a respectable Republican runs in 2020. Willard from San Jose, California Are you better off today than you were in 2008? I am better off than I was in 2008. The economy is in far better condition. Housing has recovered. Who will you be voting for? The economy will play a role with how I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll vote. Both parties make big promises which I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to be fulfilled. But at least Trump does discuss trade, jobs and manufacturing. If Congress agreed with a fraction of his bluster it might improve the economy. But I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll NOT be voting for HRC because she is corrosive, divisive and corrupt to the core. On account of her, and with the current administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s help our trust in the Department of Justice has been destroyed. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be voting Trump. Eric from Framingham, Massachusetts Are you better off today than you were in 2008? I am worse off than I was in 2008. I have not had a steady income since I left teaching in 2012. I lost my home to Wells Fargo and now live with a friend. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have health insurance. I have a master\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s degree in education, a BA, speak three languages, and I am a veteran with combat experience, yet don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a full-time job or meaningful part-time work. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make more than $15,000 a year. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unlikely that at 53 I will ever work full-time again. So what, another 20-plus years of this meaningless existence? When people do that horrible \u00e2\u20ac\u0153thank you for your service\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd [thing], I want to scream and tell them that serving my country as a soldier and my community as a teacher were the worst mistakes of my life. I should have gone into business, gone for my self and not the greater good, and been selfish and greedy instead. Left behind, no. Forgotten. Who will you be voting for? Not voting, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care. Leslie from Wilmington, North Carolina Are you better off today than you were in 2008? I am worse off than I was in 2008. Why? I had to close the company. I went from earning $70,000 a year to now working two jobs, one full time for $37,000 a year and one part time (evenings and weekends) to bring my salary to $41,000. My health insurance costs have skyrocketed. Food is more expensive. I have a home that I cannot sell as I am still underwater. I had to use all my savings to help pay for my daughter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s education so she is not lumbered with loans when she graduates. Who will you be voting for? I hate them both. I do feel that if Clinton is elected it will be the same, no change in the housing market, no change in income, no change in healthcare costs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just more of the same. It is appalling and tragic that we have two awful people to choose from. It just shows the level of corruption and dysfunction in this country. Jacob Lutz from Portland, Oregon Are you better off today than you were in 2008? I am about the same. Why? In 2008, I was a student and a cashier at Kmart. I was transitioning from foster care to adulthood while balancing a part-time job with my first and last attempt at higher education. I was overwhelmed with the responsibility of college and surviving on $6.75 an hour but managed to survive thanks to my home state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s support system for foster children and lack of financial burden. Today, I am a motorcycle technician and make around $30,000 a year and owe $20,000 in student loans. I also pay $200 a month for health insurance and bills on top of barely supporting myself. The stress is still the same but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve gotten better at handling it. Lowering my hopes and expectations significantly has helped too. Who will you be voting for? I had more faith in Bernie than Hillary regarding the economy but since he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not an option, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m with her. I still believe Hillary knows how to listen to what people are wanting and has the clout in Washington to get more done. Peter Berry from Seattle, Washington Are you better off today than you were in 2008? I am worse off than I was in 2008. I no longer have a good, well-paying job and benefits. I was forced by circumstances to use up a good portion of my retirement savings to relocate and survive. I also used a lot of my savings to pay off my son\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s college law school loans as he has been unable to find even an entry-level job in the law profession. I had a successful, lifelong, professional career that disappeared overnight, and was unable to find comparable work because of my age and the terrible state of the economy. I think my efforts to navigate my way through the economic downturn likely mirror those of so many others. It isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just the loss of decent paying jobs that has been an issue. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also the erosion of savings meant for retirement. Also the enormous debts that have been run up for financial bailouts and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cheap money\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd used to inflate the stock market will have to be faced eventually. I believe the entire political establishment has been complicit in what has happened. I worked on Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first election campaign and contributed quite a bit of my own money believing the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hope and change\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd message. I felt optimistic that it was a possibility. Now I just feel used and betrayed. Who will you be voting for? I will be voting for Jill Stein because she represents the only real choice that exists. The Democrats and Republicans are the same in virtually every meaningful respect and do not represent the interests of the average person at all. The definition of a wasted vote is voting for either of them.",

Now that the pound has stopped its freefall (for now at least), perhaps the index as a whole is beginning to look a tad overpriced. Certainly, it has shown little inclination to get back to its recent highs, with ongoing Brexit uncertainty making the UK less attractive versus a eurozone economy that appears, on the basis of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI numbers, to be looking much more attractive.</p> </blockquote> <p>The final scores showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 finished down 34.07 points or 0.49% at 6986.40</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.47% to 10,761.17</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac climbed 0.36% to 4552.58</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB was up 0.81% to 17,305.77</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 1.27% better at 9216.2</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.15% to 593.13</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 76 points or 0.42%.</p> <p>Meanwhile the pound is down 0.25% at $1.22 and a similar amount lower against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1206.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-580e1f73e4b0c146d58914a2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-24T14:52:01.804Z\">3.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>UK prime minister Theresa May has said she is disappointed with developments in the EU-Canada trade deal.</strong></p> <p>Speaking in parliament she said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I share everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointment in the stalled talks between the EU and Canada.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>But she said the problems would not have a bearing on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own negotiations about leaving the European Union, saying the UK was not seeking to replicate an existing model but build its own.</p> <p>More on the prime minister in parliament in the politics live blog:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/24/theresa-may-hosts-brexit-summit-for-scottish-welsh-and-northern-irish-governments-politics-live\">Nicola Sturgeon says first Brexit meeting was deeply frustrating \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Politics live</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-580e1a4ae4b024af0e451afa\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-24T14:31:21.956Z\">3.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US and European markets climb but FTSE fades</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Most stock markets continue to move higher, with the FTSE 100 the notable exception.</p> <p>Helped by M&amp;A deals and better than expected manufacturing data for October, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up around 0.47% while in Europe Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is 0.8% higher and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.65%.</p> <p>But after an early increase the FTSE 100 has fallen by 0.37% and is now back below the 7000 level in the wake of mixed data from the CBI.

                "bodyText":"Crude prices are under pressure again after Iraq said it wanted to be exempt from any agreement by Opec to cut production. Markets had been hoping a meeting next month by producers would agree an output deal to support the sliding oil price. Opec announced plans last month to cut output, but details of how it would reach this target and how much individual producer countries would cut were expected at a meeting in Vienna in November. But comments from Iraq over the weekend added to the general uncertainty as to whether any agreement could be reached after all. Brent crude is currently down just over 2% at $50.71 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate is the same amount lower at $49.78. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, does not seem to have given up yet on an EU-Canada trade deal: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our report on the latest developments in the EU-Canada trade deal. Jennifer Rankin writes: The European Union\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hopes of signing a free-trade agreement with Canada this week appear to have gone up in smoke, after Belgium announced it could not sign the treaty because of opposition from regional parliaments. The collapse of the talks highlights the pitfalls that may await the British government when it seeks to negotiate a trade deal with the EU after Brexit. The Belgian prime minister, Charles Michel, announced on Monday that Belgium was not ready to sign the EU-Canada trade pact, following emergency talks between the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s federal and regional leaders. The Belgian stalemate means Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, is expected to postpone a trip to Brussels this Thursday, when he was due to sign the treaty. Officials are assessing how the trade pact can be revived, but next steps remained unclear. Donald Tusk, the head of the European council, is due to speak to Trudeau later on Monday. Tusk had given Belgium an ultimatum of Monday night to sort out its problems, but emergency talks in Brussels in the afternoon showed the treaty remained stuck. Paul Magnette, Wallonia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minister-president, who has led opposition to the deal, said his position had not changed. He had failed to show up for crisis talks with the European commission on Sunday, according to Michel. The full report is here: A spate of takeover deals, notably AT&amp;T\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a370bn offer for Time Warner, and better than expected eurozone and US manufacturing PMIs have lifted most markets at the start of the trading week. But, partly due to mixed UK factory orders, the FTSE 100 has failed to hold on to early gains, and ended below the 7000 level. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: The FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early gains have turned to ashes, with the index falling into the red over the course of the afternoon. Both the US and Europe have trimmed their gains, but the fall for London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief index is the standout feature of the day. Now that the pound has stopped its freefall (for now at least), perhaps the index as a whole is beginning to look a tad overpriced. Certainly, it has shown little inclination to get back to its recent highs, with ongoing Brexit uncertainty making the UK less attractive versus a eurozone economy that appears, on the basis of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI numbers, to be looking much more attractive. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 34.07 points or 0.49% at 6986.40 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.47% to 10,761.17 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac climbed 0.36% to 4552.58 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB was up 0.81% to 17,305.77 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 1.27% better at 9216.2 In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.15% to 593.13 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 76 points or 0.42%. Meanwhile the pound is down 0.25% at $1.22 and a similar amount lower against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1206. UK prime minister Theresa May has said she is disappointed with developments in the EU-Canada trade deal. Speaking in parliament she said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I share everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointment in the stalled talks between the EU and Canada.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But she said the problems would not have a bearing on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own negotiations about leaving the European Union, saying the UK was not seeking to replicate an existing model but build its own. More on the prime minister in parliament in the politics live blog: Most stock markets continue to move higher, with the FTSE 100 the notable exception. Helped by M&amp;A deals and better than expected manufacturing data for October, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up around 0.47% while in Europe Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is 0.8% higher and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.65%. But after an early increase the FTSE 100 has fallen by 0.37% and is now back below the 7000 level in the wake of mixed data from the CBI. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The markets [are] continuing to be propelled by the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better than expected PMI readings. The US was the latest to chip in with a decent manufacturing release this Monday, the flash figure coming in at an 11 month high of 53.2 against the 51.6 forecast. This ended up helping out both the dollar and the Dow Jones; the former took 0.1% off the pound, while the latter jumped nearly 100 points after the bell to approach 18250. Over in the Eurozone the DAX and CAC held onto their morning growth, the German and French indices rising 0.9% and 0.8% respectively. The FTSE, meanwhile, remained the Western anomaly, slipping by 0.2% as investors continued to react to this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s troublesome CBI industrial order expectations slide. More from Reuters on Belgium\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure to agree the EU-Canada trade deal: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We cannot give a yes,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Paul Magnette, the premier of the Wallonia region, told reporters as he emerged. He said the main problems remained not with Ottawa, which has already agreed to modifications in the deal, but with the EU authorities. Other Socialist-led regions, including bilingual capital Brussels, are ranged behind the Walloons, while Dutch- and German-speakers back Michel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liberal-led federal coalition: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have a Yes from the federal, Flemish and German-speaking communities and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a No from the others,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Flanders premier Geert Bourgeois after the meeting at Michel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s residence lasting less than an hour. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a real shame,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the center-right leader said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re the laughing stock of the whole world. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bad for Wallonia, for Flanders, for Belgium, for Europe, for the whole world.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Michel said it was too early to say Ceta was dead and that the Walloons and he were still open to dialogue but that he must inform Tusk that Belgium was not in a position to consent now to a deal that all 27 other EU member states are ready to support... Ceta supporters say it would increase trade between the partners by 20 percent and boost the EU economy by 12 billion euros ($13 billion) a year and Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s by C$12 billion (US $9 billion). Walloons have concerns about the threat of surging pork and beef imports from Canada and an independent court system to settle disputes between states and foreign investors, which critics say allows multinationals to dictate public policy. Many EU leaders suspect the local government in Namur is using its devolved powers to play domestic politics. Dutch language Flemish newspaper De Morgen said on Monday that the Magnette\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stance was both a matter of principle and opportunism, a chance to boost his reputation and to become leader of the center-left in Belgium. Strong domestic demand is one key factor behind the better than expected US PMI figures, according to IHS Markit chief business economist Chris Williamson. He said: Manufacturing showed further signs of pulling out of the malaise seen earlier in the year, starting the fourth quarter on a solid footing. Both output and new orders are rising at the fastest rates for a year amid increasingly widespread optimism that demand will pick up again after the presidential election, which has been commonly cited as a key factor that has subdued spending and investment in recent months. There are also signs that the drag from cost-cutting policies of deliberate inventory reduction is moving into reverse. Inventory-building should therefore provide an extra boost to the economy in the fourth quarter. Weak export growth, attributable to the strong dollar, and lacklustre hiring remain big areas of disappointment, and highlight an ongoing dependency on domestic demand and a need to keep labour costs low amid a still-uncertain economic and political outlook. More signs of strength in the US economy. The Market US manfacturing PMI for October has come in at 53.2, well above the 51.5 expected by analysts. It compares to final figure for September of 51.5. This is the highest manufacturing PMI figure since October 2015. The better than expected figure adds to the idea that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates before the end of the year, pushing the dollar higher and US Treasury bond prices lower. Merger Monday has given US stock markets an early lift, ahead of a spate of major results later in the week, including from Apple and Boeing. AT&amp;T\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a370bn offer for Time Warner is not the only deal on the table. Broker TD Ameritrade plans to pay $4bn for Scottrade Financial Services, while aircraft component maker Rockwell Collins is offering $6.4bn for B/E Aerospace. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 114 points or 0.6% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.45% higher and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.64%. Bullard also said: The St. Louis Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conclusion is that a single 25-basis-point increase in the policy rate\u00e2\u20ac\u201cfrom 38 to 63 basis points\u00e2\u20ac\u201cwill get us very close to the Taylor rule value over the forecast horizon. [The Taylor rule provides a recommended setting for the FOMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy rate based on current values of observable macroeconomic variables, according to Bullard] Ahead of the latest US manufacturing data for October, a Federal Reserve member has repeated his belief that one further interest rate rise is all that is necessary for the moment. St Louis Federal Reserve president James Bullard told a conference in Arkansas: The current policy rate setting is just 38 basis points, extraordinarily low by postwar historical standards. The Federal Open Markets Committee is considering raising the policy rate to a somewhat higher level, [but] the St. Louis Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate path projection is much flatter than the rest of the Committee. The bottom line: Low interest rates are likely to continue to be the norm over the next two to three years. Hopes that Belgium would back a European Union trade deal with Canada appear to have been dashed, putting the agreement in jeopardy. Belgian prime minister Charles Michel said he had told EC president Donald Tusk today that the country could not sign the deal because he had failed to get agreement from regional authorities, notably Wallonia. The EU had given Belgium\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s federal government until late on Monday to secure backing for a deal, or a summit to sign the Ceta agreement planned for Thursday would be cancelled. But according to Reuters, Michel said to reporters after meeting regional leaders: I have officially told Tusk that we have no agreement. He said he was still open to further talks with Wallonia and said it was too early to say whether Ceta, which has been in negotiations for several years, was dead. But Tusk is now expected to contact Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and call off Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s planned summit. The omens had not looked good ahead of the meeting between Michel and the leaders of five regional authorities , with Wallonia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s premier Paul Magnette criticising the deadline placed on the deal. He said (quote from Reuters): Every time you try to put an ultimatum it makes a calm debate and a democratic debate impossible.. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need an ultimatum. We will not decide anything under an ultimatum or under pressure. Magnette says the deal is bad for Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s farmers and gives too much power to global corporate interests. The latest Guardian Brexit dashboard has just been released, and it shows that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is starting to lose momentum as the impact of June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum is felt. The dashboard is a comprehensive assessment of conditions in the UK economy, and it highlights that living standards are being squeezed as the slump in sterling hits people in the pocket. My colleague Angela Monaghan explains: The dashboard for October shows that four of the eight categories have performed worse than expected, two were as expected, and two were better. Inflation jumped more sharply than expected to 1%, the highest level in almost two years, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit with the rest of the world widened, as growth in imports rose faster than exports, and retail sales were flat as shoppers were put off by higher clothing prices and exceptionally warm September. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the story: Economist Danny Blanchflower fears that Britain is facing an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153oncoming Brexit tsunami\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, while PwC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Andrew Sentance is more positive. Here are their takes: And you can see the full dashboard here: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a recent-ish photo of Cyrus Mistry: Cyrus Mistry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock exit from Tata today is causing a real stir. My colleague Graham Ruddick says it has implications for steelworkers in South Wales, whose future has been in doubt since Tata announced plans to sell, or shut, it. The Economist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Stanley Pignal reckons Mistry paid the price for Tata\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent struggles. Now this is interesting... Tata, the Indian manufacturing giant, has just announced the departure of its chairman, Cyrus Mistry. Ratan Tata, who ran the company for two decades, is stepping in while a permanent successor is found. In a brief statement, Tata says: Tata Sons today announced that its Board has replaced Mr. Cyrus P. Mistry as Chairman of Tata Sons. The decision was taken at a Board meeting held here today. The Board has named Mr. Ratan N. Tata as Interim Chairman of Tata Sons. The Board has constituted a Selection Committee to choose a new Chairman. The Committee comprises Mr. Ratan N. Tata, Mr. Venu Srinivasan, Mr. Amit Chandra, Mr. Ronen Sen and Lord Kumar Bhattacharyya, as per the criteria in the Articles of Association of Tata Sons. The committee has been mandated to complete the selection process in four months. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not immediately clear why Mistry is off, but Tata\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s somewhat-sprawling operations have been struggling to keep pace with rivals. The group is involved in steel, automobiles, consultancy, power, and mobile telecoms.... Bang on cue, AT&amp;T and Time Warner are defending their merger (which they claim is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153perfect match\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) The US stock market is expected to follow Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead, and open higher today. The benchmark S&amp;P 500 index is tipped to jump by 0.5% when trading begins (at 2.30pm BST). AT&amp;T\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to acquire Time Warner for $85bn has given Wall Street a dose of merger fever, even though the deal has been criticised by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, and Democratic vice-presidential pick Tim Kaine: Some reaction to Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit price hike: Brexit may mean Brexit, but it also means businesses paying a lot more for using Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s products. The tech giant is hiking the cost of its enterprise software, by up to 22%, in response to the slump in the pound since June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum. It starts in January. As my colleague Alex Hern points out, other technology products and services have also spiked in cost recently: Newsflash: UK factories have suffered a fall in industrial orders this month. The CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly survey of manufacturers shows that the balance of orders fell to -17 this month, down from -6 in September. That suggests that factories are finding things a bit tougher this month. But... they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also more upbeat about future prospects. The CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business optimism index has risen to -8, from a positively gloomy -47 in September. And the balance of firms reporting higher exports rose to +8 over the last three months. Perhaps the most interesting line is that the weak pound isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t being cheered too loudly. Almost half the exporters surveyed said the fall in sterling was bad for their business (even though it should make their products more attractive in foreign markets). Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report shows that the prices paid by UK factories for their materials jumped at the fastest rate in three years, and are expected to continue growing at above their long-term average over the quarter ahead. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI chief economist, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 are optimistic about export prospects and export orders are growing, following the fall in Sterling. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, the weaker Pound is also feeding through to costs, which are rising briskly and may well spill over into higher consumer prices in the months ahead. Back in the City, shares in UK defence firm Cobham have slumped by 17% this morning after it hit investors with its second profit warning in six months. Cobham is languishing at the bottom of the FSTE 250 leaderboard, after it warned that revenues and profits continue to miss expectations. More here: Eurozone investors are also cheered by political developments in Spain, where right-wing leader Mariano Rajoy has the green light to form another administration. After 10 months of deadlock, Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s socialist party has decided not to oppose a confidence vote, meaning Rajoy should be clear to form a minority government. The move is unpopular with some left-wing politicians, who feel they shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t prop up Rajoy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PP party (which is facing a flurry of corruption charges). But the prospect of a stable government in Madrid, after two inconclusive elections, is encouraging traders to buy Spanish debt. This is driving down Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bond yields, meaning it can borrow at cheaper rates: The euro is struggling back from its lowest level in seven months. The single currency is hovering around $1.089, having earlier fallen as low as $1.086 - its weakest point since the EU referendum. The pound is little changed this morning, at $1.224 against the dollar. Caxton FX analyst Alexandra Russell-Oliver explains: Expectations that the Fed will move on interest rates by the end of the year, likely in December, have contributed to dollar strength. The euro remains relatively under pressure in light of ongoing stimulus from the European Central Bank. The pound continues to be driven by ongoing Brexit uncertainty ahead of the triggering of Article 50 by next March, particularly concerns that the UK will pursue a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hard\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI report also shows that eurozone firms are hiking prices this month, for the first time in over a year. Markit says: With demand firming, companies were increasingly able to charge higher rates to customers. Average prices charged for goods and services rose for the first time since August 2015. Higher prices were often a reflection of the need to pass rising costs on to customers. Average input costs increased at the steepest rate for 15 months, linked mainly to higher commodity prices, notably oil-related, as well as rising wage costs. October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflash\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 PMIs suggest the eurozone is growing at a quarterly rate of around 0.4%, says Markit. That would beat the 0.3% recorded between April and June, but is still rather unspectacular. Dutch financial blogger Jeroen Blokland believes that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI survey shows the European Central Bank should start reining in its stimulus programme: The ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s QE programme is due to run out next March. Last week, president Mario Draghi hinted that it could be extended, perhaps in December. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economist Marcus Wright on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI report: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Julien Lafargue, European equities strategist at JP Morgan, on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s healthcheck on the eurozone economy: According to the flash PMIs estimates, after a difficult summer, the Eurozone is accelerating again at the start of the 4th quarter. The improvement in Services in Germany is particularly encouraging as this had been an area of concerns recently. The focus is now likely to switch to inflation dynamics with input costs in Germany rising at the fastest pace in nearly 1.5 years and backlogs of work in the Eurozone accumulating at the fastest rate for over 5 years. Although we believe this would be premature, this might trigger renewed concerns about the ECB having to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153taper\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd its quantitative easing in the coming months. [Tapering = cutting the size of the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stimulus programme, which is currently buying \u00e2\u201a\u00ac80bn of new bonds each month] Boom! Eurozone companies are growing at their fastest rate this year, as they put the shock of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote behind them. Firms are benefitting from a surge in new orders, encouraging them to take on more staff to deal with a growing backlog of work. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the message from Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly healthcheck on the eurozone economy, just released. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flash composite Purchasing Managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Index, which measures activity in the sector, has jumped to 53.7 from September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 52.6. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the highest reading since December 2015, and much stronger than expected. Here are the details: As we covered earlier, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI hit a three month high this week, while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories have made a welcome (and long-awaited) return to growth. The eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing and service sectors both posted a rise in new output, at the highest rate since the start of this year. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says the future looks quite bright: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The eurozone economy showed renewed signs of life at the start of the fourth quarter, enjoying its strongest expansion so far this year with the promise of more to come. With backlogs of work accumulating at the fastest rate for over five years, business activity growth and hiring look set to accelerate further as we head towards the end of the year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI is consistent with a quarterly GDP growth rate of 0.4%, led by a 0.5% pace of expansion in Germany. Modest growth of 0.2-0.3% is being signalled for France, but there are various indicators which suggest that France will enjoy stronger growth in coming months, including a marked build-up of uncompleted work. More to follow.... Some early reaction: This is from Fred Ducrozet of Swiss bank Pictet: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Maxime Sbaihi: European stock markets are rallying in early trading, led by France after its factory sector returned to growth. The French CAC has gained 0.65%, while in London the FTSE 100 is up 44 points, or 0.6%, at 7064. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx says: Finally crawling out of contraction territory the French manufacturing PMI hit a 10 month high of 51.3 this morning; the services sector wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so strong, however, slipping from 53.3 (revised down from 54.1) to 52.1 month-on-month. Germany, meanwhile, beat estimates on both counts; its manufacturing PMI came in at a 32 month peak of 55.1, with the services reading at a 3 month high of 54.1. This allowed the DAX and CAC to post some decent gains this Monday, rising 0.7% and 0.8% respectively. German companies have also beaten expectations, reporting their strongest growth in three months. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Flash Germany Composite Output Index has jumped to 55.1 in October, up from September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 16-month low of 52.8. Factories reported their biggest leap in activity in almost three years, while service sector firms also picked up. That suggests Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector has put its recent slowdown behind it. Firms also reported that new orders grew at their fastest rate this year Oliver Kolodseike, Economist at IHS Markit said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The German economy has entered the fast lane again at the start of the fourth quarter, with output growth accelerating from September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent low. The improvement in the PMI in October lifts hopes that the weaker expansions we have seen in the past two months were just a temporary soft patch, rather than the beginning of a serious slowdown. Encouragingly, French business expectations have strengthened this month, with more bosses planning to spend more on advertising and new projects: Markit says: Some panellists were buoyed by the latest increases in demand, while planned rises in investment and marketing were expected to boost overall activity. Less encouragingly, French firms are still cutting staff: On the employment front, staffing levels were marginally lower for the fifth time in 2016 so far. Both manufacturing and services sectors recorded slight drops in employment, although the fall in manufacturing was the lowest recorded in eight months of job shedding. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s snap summary of the French PMIs: France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector has given the markets an early-morning lift, by reporting that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve posted their strongest growth this year. Factory output has hit its fastest rate since March 2014 this month, raising hopes that the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-largest economy is picking up. This pushed the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflash\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 French manufacturing PMI, produced by Markit, up to 51.5 in October, from 49.7 in September. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 10-month high, ending a long run of contraction. Any reading over 50 shows growth, so this indicates that French factories are enjoyinga decent enough autumn. However.... service sector growth slowed to a three-month low; meaning the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccomposite PMI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 actually dipped a little, to 52.2 from 52.7. Paul Smith, senior economist at IHS Markit, says the data is encouraging: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Although growth slipped slightly in October, the latest data revealed a number of positives for the French economy, especially on the manufacturing side with rising exports supporting a marked uplift in output. With signs of intensifying capacity pressures and service providers indicating expectations for near-term growth, the outlook for the rest of 2016 looks reasonably positive.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Next up, German PMI..... There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relief in the eurozone today, after Portugal successfully held onto its investment-grade credit rating on Friday night. There had been fears that rating agency DBRS would slash Portugal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating in to junk territory, which would have had serious consequences for. But instead, DBRS maintained Lisbon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BBB rating with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd outlook, despite earlier expressing concerns over low growth and high debt. That has sent Portugal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bonds rallying this morning, driving down the yield on 10-year debt to a six-week low of just 3.08%. If Portugal had been downgraded by DBRS, it would no longer have been eligible for the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quantitative easing programme. That would have driven up borrowing costs, and raised fears that the eurozone crisis was heating up again. Portugal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government welcomed the move, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision increases our own and the markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 confidence in the policies chosen for the country.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But.... Fitch, S&amp;P and Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s have already slashed Portugal into junk territory, expressing fears over its slow growth rates and high public debt. So Lisbon isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t out of the woods yet. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be a big week for economic data. On Thursday, we learn how the UK economy performed in the last three months, immediately after the Brexit vote. Economists expect growth to slow to 0.3% or 0.4%, from 0.7% in April. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a significant slowdown, but not as bad as some forecasters had predicted during the referendum campaign. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says it would be: ...not bad considering the doom and gloom about the UK economy, some may say. However, there are a few signs that Brexit is starting to weigh on the UK economy. Business investment is expected to be weak, and we expect another quarter of growth heavily reliant on the consumer. Going forward, we see consumer confidence flagging once Article 50 is triggered at some point early in Q1 next year. Then on Friday, we get US GDP figures for the third quarter. Growth is expected to speed up, to around 0.6% quarter-on-quarter. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets explains: This is an immensely important week in terms of economic data and we may see some serious firecrackers which lightens up some bonfire. We could potentially see massive swings in the forex and equity markets as investors scrutinized the third quarter GDP number for the US economy which is due at the end of the week. What traders want to know is that if the US economy is regaining traction. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much UK economic news today, apart from the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regular healthcheck on UK industry (published at 11am BST). We also get a flash view of the European economy from 8am to 9am, when the latest surveys of manufacturing and services companies in France, Germany, and the wider eurozone are released.

Our correspondent Helena Smith reports. <br><br></p> <blockquote> <p>Barely days after the race for the White House, the outgoing president will visit Athens on November 15 in what was described as a tour aimed at reaffirming support \u00e2\u20ac\u0153for economic reforms that reduce inequality.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>The US president has voiced barely disguised frustration with austerity policies he has blamed for economic stagnation and slow growth in Europe. Greek officials in the leftist-led government are hoping Obama will push for debt forgiveness when he goes on to hold talks with the German chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin so that the Greek economy, currently locked in its worst slump in modern times, can be put on the path to recovery.</p> <p>The IMF, like Washington, both believe that with a debt load in excess of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac300bn the Greek economy is unsustainable. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras has recently racheted up the rhetoric, saying a debt deal should be wrapped up by December when Athens completes a second review of the economy with international inspectors representing its bailout creditors at the EU and IMF. His appeals were rebuffed by both Merkel and her French counterpart when he met them on the sidelines of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU summit in Brussels. Berlin, the main provider of bailout funds to date, has argued that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problen is not one of debt but competitiveness. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-580f8a99e4b0219a00d387cf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jilltreanor\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-25T16:40:56.305Z\">5.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Still with Brexit, and Ireland is making a pitch to provide a home for a key regultor.

But the vote for Brexit means the regulator which oversees banks in the remaining 27 countries of the EU is likely to need a new home. Ireland has now made a formal pitch to take on the regulator, best known for conducting its stress tests on banks. Michael Noonan, minister of finance said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While the UK continues to be a full member of the EU until the negotiations for their exit have been completed, preparations must be made for eventualities such as the relocation of certain European agencies such as the European Banking Authority.

                "bodyText":"Carney has now finished so here are some of the key points. In the wake of criticisms from various politicians, he said investors would want a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153risk premium\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to buy UK assets if the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence was questioned. But markets should not expect this to happen. It was up to the government to set a target for price stability which the Bank would then decide how to reach. On his own future, he said it would be a personal decision as to when he would step down from the Bank and not related to politics. Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent slump had less to do with monetary policy, he said, and more to do with the announcement of the timetable for Article 50 and the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perception of how discussions on Brexit would unfold. He said there were various contingency plans in place for banks to leave London if they saw fit. On QE he expressed sympathy for savers who have been hit by the programme, but said the Bank was not slavishly relying on QE. He defended the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s purchase of corporate bonds, including McDonald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. On negative rates, he said there was something unnatural and a confidence effect. Meanwhile the pound has recovered some ground after its earlier sudden slump, which was blamed variously on the strong dollar, comments from chancellor Philip Hammond suggesting more QE and nervousness ahead of Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appearance at the House of Lords. It is now down 0.3% at $1.2195 after falling as low as $1.2084 - its worst level since the flash crash earlier this month. Its recovery is partly due to Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s measured performance and his attempts to reassure on QE, his own future, and worries over the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence. With the slight recovery in the pound, the FTSE 100 has lost much of its earlier gains but still ended up 0.45% at 7017.64. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Over to Greece, and the White House has confirmed that president Barack Obama will be visiting the country in November in what officials hope will be the biggest push yet to secure debt relief for the country. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports. Barely days after the race for the White House, the outgoing president will visit Athens on November 15 in what was described as a tour aimed at reaffirming support \u00e2\u20ac\u0153for economic reforms that reduce inequality.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The US president has voiced barely disguised frustration with austerity policies he has blamed for economic stagnation and slow growth in Europe. Greek officials in the leftist-led government are hoping Obama will push for debt forgiveness when he goes on to hold talks with the German chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin so that the Greek economy, currently locked in its worst slump in modern times, can be put on the path to recovery. The IMF, like Washington, both believe that with a debt load in excess of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac300bn the Greek economy is unsustainable. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras has recently racheted up the rhetoric, saying a debt deal should be wrapped up by December when Athens completes a second review of the economy with international inspectors representing its bailout creditors at the EU and IMF. His appeals were rebuffed by both Merkel and her French counterpart when he met them on the sidelines of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU summit in Brussels. Berlin, the main provider of bailout funds to date, has argued that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problen is not one of debt but competitiveness. Still with Brexit, and Ireland is making a pitch to provide a home for a key regultor. Jill Treanor writes: It is not so long ago that European Banking Authority moved to new offices in London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Canary Wharf. But the vote for Brexit means the regulator which oversees banks in the remaining 27 countries of the EU is likely to need a new home. Ireland has now made a formal pitch to take on the regulator, best known for conducting its stress tests on banks. Michael Noonan, minister of finance said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While the UK continues to be a full member of the EU until the negotiations for their exit have been completed, preparations must be made for eventualities such as the relocation of certain European agencies such as the European Banking Authority. Ireland has a significant financial services sector, efficient transport links to other European capitals and the capacity to absorb the European Banking Authority\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s re-location to Ireland. Our interest in hosting the EBA demonstrates the continued importance Ireland places in well regulated financial services. As a country with experience in providing links to banks and companies in the UK market, Ireland provides an ideal new home for the staff of the EBA.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ireland has made no secret of its ambitions to take any exiles from London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial services sector. Lord Hollick ends by saying a question has been sent in during the proceedings by a pensioner who wants to know what he should invest his savings in. Carney replies that when he can have the answer sent in, he will give a reply. And with that, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s over. Question: Why are you opposed to negative interest rates? Do you feel comfortable with size of derivatives on bank bal sheets Carney says on negative rates, uncomfortable with effect on bank balance sheets and lending possibly being tempered or reversed. In UK the building societies are an important part of system and they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have alternative supply of finance. On top of that, there is something unnatural to negative rates to some people and there is a confidence effect. In terms of derivatives, reforms put in place have substantially reduced risks. Question: If the MPC had known about fall in sterling in August would they have done same stimulus measures ? When does depreciation start becoming serious? Carney says committee always takes into account exchange rate movements and the reasons, and its effect on inflation. Prior to referendum, the way we talked remained most appropriate - we have to balance supply, demand and exchange rate. Since timing of Article 50 became clear, sterling has been influence by market perceptions of [future with EU]. If exchange rate has depreciated and UK supply capacity is weakened by Brexit, it will push up inflation. Question: What is concerning central bankers at the moment other than Brexit? Carney says the balance of monetary, fiscal and structural policy, and that monetary policy has been overburdened. Fair bit of time needs to be spent on that. In terms of biggest risk, China. It is going through a series of transitions, manufacturing to services, from bank based lending to market based finance, flexibility of exchange rate. They are all happening simultaneously. Chinese authorities have done an exemplary job in managing this, but there are challenges. In recent years the pace of growth has been faster than the speed limit, effectively a product of debt through shadow banking sector. Challenge is to sustainably and safely decelerate the rate of growth. Question: when will the recent fall in sterling affect inflation? Carney says the recent uptick in inflation is the product of a few factors but not, net, sterling. Mainly energy prices and clothing prices. Relatively quickly we will see the effects of the sterling depreciation. By the spring [inflation will be] 1.5% to 1.8% annualised with an important contribution [from currency]. We do not have a target for the exchange rate. But it is a factor which influences the stance of monetary policy, and will take into account over next week as we make our policy decision. Question: Given government can borrow at low rates and investing, shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t they take advantage of that? Carney says have to be careful in fiscal policy about what is temporary and what is baked in system. I agree, given interest rate, relative return on a project doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to be that high when there is tax revenues and an asset alongside it. But those decisions are decisions of the government. Question: Is monetary policy now too loose and fiscal policy too tight? Carney says adjusting fiscal policy is much slower than adjusting monetary policy, it needs budget, legislation. So there is a need to understand the fiscal policy of the government and take it into account. Appropriate for chancellor and governor to discuss how the economy is and what should be done. Away from Carney and back to the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide. Neil Wilson, markets analyst at ETX Capital said: There is no clear reason for the dip but once the run on the pound starts these days it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to find buyers at any natural or obvious levels...It just goes to show how bearish the sentiment is around the pound at the moment. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take a lot to send sterling south at the moment. Of course it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good news for all those dollar earners on the FTSE 100, which rallied strongly on the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall before a big bought of profit taking around 15:20-30 pared the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains. Question: Is there too much uncertainty now for forward guidance to be useful? Carney says it is useful in certain circumstances, in the exit from unconventional policy. Lamont: Why are you now buying corporate bonds? Carney says this provides a different channel of stimulus. It is more powerful pound for pound than QE. We are buying neutrally, companies important to UK economy. [Lamot: McDonald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s?] Yes, it is part of the UK economy, providing jobs. It encourages issuance in that market, also frees up bank balance sheets to lend to smaller businesses and households. Lamont: QE has been described as a mixture of fiscal and monetary policy. So independence of central banks has already gone. If Treasury has to approve each tranche of QE, then independence is surely compromised? Carney says the decision is made by the MPC, the Treasury makes decision on Bank balance sheet independently. I have to explain to chancellor the rationale, and he or she will want to be satisfied on that before putting balance sheet forward. Can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t conceive of circumstance where chancellor would not provide that. Question from Lord Lamont: Back to QE, how long will it go on. Is it still effective. The distortions are becoming larger, especially in bond market. Companies are cutting dividend to fund pension liabilities. My fear, this will only end in tears. Carney says he does not share that view. The package in August had four elements, part of the reason was to provided stimulus but also to show we would not slavishly rely on QE. After the first QE programme, they tend to have less of an influence on asset prices. The August announcement has as large an impact as any, [because it was part of a package]. On side effects, we are mindful of side effects. We did look at impacts on pension funds, insurance companies, margins and profitablity of banks and building societies, to satisfy ourselves sum of side effects did not outweigh positives. Case was strong so we pursued it. On pension funds, the challenge is as much due to a lag in equity performance compared to yields elsewhere. So its a broader problem. {Lamont: QE helping that problem} Carney says its whether you think QE is responsible for low rates. [He clearly doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t] The concerns about risks in the global environment are quite elevated. Question: is there anything to be done to make sure the City remains the pre-eminent financial centre post-Brexit? We start from a position where it is Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial centre. [On euro clearing moving from London] there is no need for currency clearing to take place in the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jurisdiction. It is broader discussion in the political realm. From our point of view, we need to retain world class supervision and regulation. We need to ensure - issue for government and private sector - that non-euro activity continues to grow in London. We need to come to some sort of broader agreement on aspects of wholesale finance. Yes some business would migrate, but City will grow other business from elsewhere. Carney says he expects the EU to give serious consideration to equivalence of UK financial regulation. Carney says we do not want to have our hands tied to import ad infinitum financial rules made elsewhere. The pound has recovered some ground during the course of Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appearance so far. Having fallen as low as $1.2084 earlier, and recovering to $1.2121 as he began, it is now at $1.2135, still down 0.7% on the day. Question: is BBA irresponsible suggesting banks are ready to leave imminently? There is much uncertainty, and in an environment where profitability is stretched. Some may take decisions earlier than others. There are discussions [to be held with the EU], it would be precipitate to make decisions [before then]. Question: any evidence banks are planning to relocate out of London? Carney says as supervisor of banks, we are aware of contingency plans at various stages of readyness. Some would be in a position to adjust activities within the next year if they saw fit. Question: US rates are expected to rise, does that not depress the pound. The Bank has also failed to meet its inflation target. Carney says there were four elements to August\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s package, sterling barely moved, the market understood what we were doing. When does sterling move, asks Carney. When it becomes clear on the timing of Article 50 and the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perception on the relationship between UK and EU. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit early to determine that. PM says she will get best deal, there have been no discussions. But the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perception influences a perception of the supply situation of the econmy. That perception may well be mistaken. We have to take account of where sterling is and how persistent it will be. The 6.5% movement in currency since the Conservative party conference has largely been driven by a single factor, not monetary policy. As for US, there has been an increased perception that Fed will raise rates by the end of the year. That has contributed to generalised dollar strength. But with sterling it is more the perception of that fundamental factor. [On the inflation target] in terms of the undershoot, the explanation was huge moves in oil and commodity prices. The judgement the MPC has to make, we see inflation rising above target in year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2 and 3, due to depreciation of sterling in the first half of this year, so our judgement is how quickly we return inflation to target. Should we raise rates in August and get it to 2%, at the cost of jobs and income in the economy. Or is it wiser to look through that exchange rate move and help economy adjust. In the view of every member, it was the right course of action to provide stimulus at that point. Why cut interest rates after Brexit when suggested not beforehand? Carney says monetary policy would depend on supply, demand and the exchange rate. The balance of those forces which effect the path of policy. The MPC decision is not automatic. There were scenarios when.. appropriate response would have been to tighten. But in fact the balance was consistent with the Bank supplying more stimulus to support the economy during a period of adjustment. That stimulus has its limits. The balance can shift. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t target exchange rate, we target inflation..but we are not indifferent. Question. There has been talk about Carney leaving. What are the factors for Carney staying or going? Carney says he needs time to reflect, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an entirely personal decision. No one should read into it anything about government policy, past, present, intentional. Baroness Wheatcroft question: On the prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments, she said monetary policy was an effective emergency measure and a change has to come. Does that mean monetary policy? Carney says he does not think she meant a change in monetary policy. Question: how long will it take to get there (normal interest rates etc)? The framework is there, we fully understand if not welcome criticism of how we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing our job to get to inflation target. With time as the government prosecutes its discussions with EU, uncertainties will reduce. There are broader forces in global economy which may take longer to dissipate. Carney says it is frustrating to have interest rates so low for so long. He says he has sympathy with savers, but says the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focus is on its remit to get inflation where it needs to be. Change inflation target to help savers? Carney says to target a specific group is not consistent with helping widest range of people and supporting whole economy. Lord Hollick, the chair, asks about the prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns about the effect of QE and those who have lost out, and what the Bank could do to help. Carney says since QE, jobs have been created, GDP has grown. That is not due to QE, but the stance has helped the UK economy during a difficult period. Different groups will benefit in different ways. Between 2009 and 2016, most have benefited, although some more than others. We do recognise those who rely on savings have seen lower returns. Carney says the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence has stood the test of time. If it was called into question he would expect to see a risk premium on UK assets, particularly the currency, gilts and inflation expectations. He said markets should have no reason to expect that [risk premium]. There is not a debate in parliament to change remit. If the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goal or remit was adjusted, the MPC would discharge that remit. He said comments by individual politicians on policy would have no effect on how it discharges its responsibility. Mark Carney is now beginning his testimony and is talking about monetary policy. He says monetary policy has been overburdened, it is the principal if not sole vehicle to provide stimulus to the UK. He welcomes the government is signalling a resetting of the balance between monetary, fiscal and structural policy. Sterling continues to fall ahead of Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony shortly. It has fallen as low as $1.2082, its lowest since the flash crash earlier this month, and while the strength of the dollar and the uncertainty about what Carney will say are factors, comments from chancellor Philip Hammond earlier may also be helping to push sterling lower. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s renewed slide seems to have stemmed from comments made by Philip Hammond, who not only warned that EU leaders may focus on political rather than economic issues when discussing the Brexit, but also that, when asked about the possibility of more QE, pointed out that no quantitative easing request has ever been rejected. This seems to have spooked the pound, which had actually been on a decent run of form in the past few trading sessions, and that is before Mark Carney gives his latest Brexit update in front of the House of Lords later today. The return of the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perilous trading was good news for the FTSE. The UK index had been lacking a certain spark in the last few days; now it finds itself 50 points higher, firmly above 7000 and not too far away from its all-time peak. The weak US consumer confidence figures could pose a problem for Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen. Mike Read, co-founder of trading network Pelican, said: Consumers in the US could be forgiven for harbouring slight trepidations about the future, amid a controversial presidential campaign and global economic uncertainty, but Fed Chair Janet Yellen will be concerned to see the first signs of this mounting pessimism taking effect. Observers have long earmarked December as when the Fed will raise rates again, but 2016 has been a year of surprises and many traders may now be getting cold feet at the prospect of Yellen holding off until the new year. Paul Sirani, Chief Market Analyst at Xtrade, still thinks a December rise is on the cards: Consumer confidence rose in September to its highest level in nine years, but that positivity has proven short-lived for Fed Chair Janet Yellen following a worse than expected October reading. Although the U.S. economy is performing well on the whole, Yellen has been singled out for criticism by presidential candidate Donald Trump, who claims she is keeping interest rates low for political reasons. And it seems highly unlikely that she will pull the trigger before the Presidential race in November, with a December rise more likely. The US presidential election has dented consumer confidence, according to a new survey. The University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment fell by 3.6% month on month to 87.9. Year on year the fall was 2.3%. This was the lowest level since last September and the second lowest in the past two years. The survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist Richard Curtin said: It is likely that the uncertainty surrounding the presidential election had a negative impact, especially among lower income consumers, and without that added uncertainty, the confidence measures may not have weakened. Prospects for renewed gains, other than a relief rally following the election results, would require somewhat larger wage increases and continued job growth as well as the maintenance of low inflation. The fall in sterling has given a boost to the FTSE 100, which is now up around 70 points or 1%. Full as it is of exporters and dollar earners, the leading index has tended to move higher as the pound weakens. In contrast, the more domestic focused FTSE 250 is up just 0.07%. Meanwhile the Dow Jones Industrial Average has opened slightly lower, down around 13 points. Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony could see further pressure on the pound, says Caxton FX analyst Alexandra Russell-Oliver: Sterling has dropped, partially as a result of pressure on the pound ahead of Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony this afternoon (3:35pm) and partially due to dollar strength following above-forecast housing data. There is the risk of further sterling weakness/volatility during Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony, which will focus on the economic consequences of the Brexit vote. Cable is trading around 1.2125, near its October 11 lows, which marked its lowest levels since 1985 (excluding the flash crash drop). Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down over 0.7% against the dollar and over 0.6% against the euro since 1:30pm. This afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sudden drop in the pound comes ahead of an appearance by Bank of England governor Mark Carney before the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee (there is a live TV link here.) A week before the Bank of England unveils its latest monetary policy decision - following the hint last time that a rate cut was possible - Carney is likely to be quizzed on the state of the economy and whether another cut is necessary. With prime minister Theresa May criticising quantitative easing and various politicians making negative comments about the Bank, Carney may also repeat his insistence that the Bank is independent in its decisions. (He must have been pleased to hear Chancellor Philip Hammond defend this very thing last week.). He is also likely to be asked about his future, given that he said he would decide by the end of the year whether to leave in 2018 or stay on longer. Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, said: The markets will primarily be looking for any hints that Carney and co. at the BOE have plans to cut interest rates further. The market has pretty much priced out the prospect of a near-term rate cut from the BOE, but a dovish tone from Carney could see the market start to re-price the prospect of a cut, and the pound could take a hit. Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony comes at an interesting time, as relations between the BOE and the government remain tense after the PM appeared to criticize QE, and threaten the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence. It also comes as Carney has two months to decide whether or not to leave the BOE in 2018, or stay on until 2021, he will make a formal announcement by the end of the year. If Carney voices concerns about the deteriorating relationship with the government then this would be the worst outcome for the pound in our view, as the last thing an already Brexit-frazzled foreign exchange market needs now is discord between the UK authorities. It could also make it more likely that Carney will quit his post in 2018, right in the middle of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit negotiations. As a reminder, the House of Lords committee has said it expects to ask the following questions: Are ultra-low interest rates fuelling inequality and threatening the independence of central banks? Did the Bank misjudge the short-term impact of Brexit prior to the referendum? What impact will the fall in the value of the pound have on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy and the inflation target? Will a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit lead to job losses in the City of London? How and when will quantitative easing be unwound? The sudden fall in the pound may be due to other factors, some believe: And it is not just the dollar: sterling is down 0.7% against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.116. The US currency has moved higher after a rise in house prices. The Federal Housing Finance Agency home price index climbed 0.7% in August compared to the previous month. And it has jumped 6.4% from August last year. The strength of these latest figures will add to the idea that the US Federal Reserve could hike interest rates again before the end of the year, probably in December. The news has seen the pound drop around 1% to a weekly low of $1.2116 against the dollar before recovering a little to $1.2128. The euro has hit a seven and a half month low against the dollar. Bad news from Wall Street. Caterpillar, the construction equipment and machinery maker, has cut its sales forecast. The firm, famous for its bright yellow cranes, diggers and trucks, warned that business is tough as potential customers delay purchases, amid mediocre global growth prospects. Chief executive Doug Oberhelman says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Economic weakness throughout much of the world persists and, as a result, most of our end markets remain challenged.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Caterpillar cut its projected revenues in 2016 to $39bn, down from $40.1bn. It also fears that next year will be hard to, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While we are seeing early signals of improvement in some areas, we continue to face a number of challenges.... We remain cautious as we look ahead to 2017, but are hopeful as the year unfolds we will begin to see more positive momentum.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the first time this year that Caterpillar has sounded gloomy. It cut its earnings forecast in July, citing Brexit as a threat to global growth. Twenty two years after joining John Lewis as a graduate trainee, Paula Nickolds has just made it to the top of the high street firm, as its first ever female chief. John Lewis has announced that Nickolds, currently their commercial director, has been promoted to one of the biggest jobs in UK retail. She will replace Andy Street, the outgoing MD who is bidding to become mayor of the West Midlands. Chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At a time of transformation in the retail sector, Paula\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s progressive and dynamic leadership is just what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s needed for the next phase of modern retailing. As a partner with 22 years\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 service, I know just how special the John Lewis Partnership is. Driven by our unique business model, and with innovation in our DNA, I am immensely excited to lead John Lewis on the next stage of our journey.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Nickolds says she got hooked on retail as child, visiting Marks &amp; Spencer stores with her father (who worked for M&amp;S). Nickolds joined John Lewis in 1994, and made it to the board in 2013 as buying and brand director. That would have included overseeing the retailers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Christmas adverts, including this classic: Hammond is asked whether he would approve another bout of quantitative easing, if the Bank of England wanted to stimulate the economy again. The chancellor says that the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bond-buying scheme has been highly effective so far, and hints that he would not obstruct another dose if needed. No request for quantitative easing has ever been refused, and I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see why it would be different in future. Worth remembering that Theresa May, the PM, criticised QE earlier this month for making the rich richer..... Philip Hammond has also been asked about the possibility that Brexit will cost London the ability to handle \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceuro clearing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (the settling of derivative contracts priced in euros). The chancellor says that the European Central Bank has already tried, and failed, once to move euro clearing into the eurozone. He says that euro clearing is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not easily separated from other activities in London\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but it also only makes up a relatively small part of total jobs and business in the City. Philip Hammond has also warned MPs that European leaders could prioritise political issues over economic ones, in the upcoming Brexit negotiations. Over in parliament, chancellor Philip Hammond has pledged to prioritise the needs of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial sector, during EU exit talks. Hammond told MPs that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I certainly have been seeking to reassure financial services businesses that we will put their needs at the heart of the negotiation with the European Union. We understand their needs for market access. We also understand their needs to be able to engage the right skilled people.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Last week, the head of the British Bankers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Association warned that banks could start shifting jobs out of London early next year, because they fear losing their rights to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpassport\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 services across the EU. Some experts have suggested Britain could secure access to the customs union, in return for continuing to pay into the EU budget. That might address the passporting issue, but might alarm Brexit supporters who hoped to make a clean break with Europe.... Eurozone officials have finally given the green light to unlock Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next aid tranche, worth \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.8bn. This comes two weeks after finance ministers agreed that Athens had hit the milestones laid out in its 3rd bailout. Klaus Regling, the head of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout fund, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to disburse 2.8 billion euros ($3.0 billion) to Greece is a sign that the Greek people are steadily making progress in reforming their country.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, has been hosting a meeting about the refugee crisis - which is putting extra strain on the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finances. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s calling for a better system to help migrants, and a new pro-growth economic strategy for Europe. If German business chiefs are really feeling more confident, they could consider spending some of their huge cash piles. According to the Wall Street Journal, German companies are sitting on around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac450bn of cash - but are proving reluctant to invest it. And there are fears that this could hamper growth, just when Europe desperately needs to boost activity and create jobs. The WSJ says: The problem isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t unique to Germany. Companies in other developed countries have also been investing less since the financial crisis. But Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s low investment is striking given the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relatively robust economic performance\u00e2\u20ac\u201despecially compared with other European countries\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand its record-low unemployment. Advocates of higher corporate investment say German parsimony is troubling, because the economy depends to such a large degree on research- and capital-intensive industries. It risks weakening the ability of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest industrial power to grow and create jobs in future, with negative consequences for all of Europe. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need to be careful that Germany doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fall behind technologically because of persistently low investment,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Reinhold Festge, head of the German engineering-sector association VDMA, which represents over 3,100 midsize companies. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full piece: After its recent wild turbulence, sterling seems to have calmed down a little. The pound is stubbornly stuck around the $1.22 mark this morning, as currency traders await Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony at the House of Lords. Arnaud Masset, market analyst at Swissquote Bank, says: Sterling remains under substantial pressure as investors continued to expect harsh consequences amid the UK decision to leave the European Union. Eek. Shares in troubled Italian bank Monte dei Paschi have just been temporarily suspended after plunging by 23%. They had jumped in early trading, after it announced plans to sell \u00e2\u201a\u00ac28bn of bad debts and shrink its operations (see earlier post). The jump in German business confidence has driven Frankfurt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main share index, the DAX, up to a new 2016 high. Chris Beauchamp of IG says: A healthy reading from the German IFO report has buoyed risk appetite. This jump in German business confidence comes a day after Markit reported that German companies are growing at their fastest rate since July. Pernille Bomholdt, senior analyst at Danske Bank, reckons Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is growing fast -- at a quarterly rate of 0.8% City analysts are welcoming the surge in German business confidence this month. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets believes it will have a positive impact on the whole eurozone: The German IFO data has provided further evidence that the economic engine of the eurozone is picking up steam. There is no doubt that there will be spill over effects of this in other eurozone countries and the economic picture will look a lot more better there. The German economic data has helped the sentiment and traders are falling more in love with equities. The news has also provided a support for the Euro. Anthony Cheung of Amplify Trading points out that it follows a strong reading in September: And data firm Markit also believes the German economy is improving. German bosses are more upbeat about current trading, and their future prospects, according to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report from IFO. The current economic conditions index rose to 115 from 114.7. And the future expectations index jumped to 106.1 from 104.5. The jump in German business confidence this month shows that the shock of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum has dissipated, according to Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe. Wohlrabe told Reuters that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Brexit vote has been digested.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wohlrabe added that Wallonia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to throw a large spanner into the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deal with Canada has not dampened Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy either. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy is bouncing back from the shock of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum vote, according to the latest healthcheck from the IFO thinktank. IFO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business climate index, which surveys 7,000 German business leaders, has hit its highest level since April 2014. That shows executives are increasingly confident about their prospects, despite the uncertainty over Brexit, and the looming US election. Ifo head Clemens Fuest says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The upturn in the German economy is gathering impetus.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd IFO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business climate index hit 110.5 in October, up from 109.5 in September, beating expectations of an unchanged reading. Construction firms and manufacturers are particularly upbeat. After many months of anguish, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest bank may finally be turning the corner \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but at the cost of thousands of jobs. Monte dei Paschi has agreed a turnaround plan, that will see it sell off \u00e2\u201a\u00ac28bn of bad debts and raise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn in fresh capital. It is also planning to cut 2,600 jobs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one in 10 workers - and close 500 branches. New CEO Marco Morelli hopes to complete the capital raising by the end of this year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although it could be disrupted if the Italian government loses a crunch referendum on constitutional reforms. The bank also posted a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.15bn loss for the last quarter, as bad debts continue to drag it down. But investors may have faith \u00e2\u20ac\u201c shares are up 2.6% this morning, and have gained almost 60% in recent weeks: The euro is hovering close to last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seven-month low, as investors digest the breakdown of talks with Canada over a new trade deal. Mark Ostwald of ADM Investor Services agrees that Mark Carney will be quizzed about his future this afternoon: Mr Carney testifies to the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee, where he will doubtless resolutely defend the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence, though he may face some awkward questions about whether he will extend his term to the full eight years, and indeed whether he will complete his initial five year term. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main stock markets are following Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead, and are all up in early trading. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue-chip FTSE 100 index has inched higher in early trading, gaining 25 points to 7011. Mining companies are rallying, after Chinese iron ore futures prices hit a six-year high overnight. Anglo American is leading the way, up 3%. It told shareholders this morning that its on track to hit its production targets this year (apart from coking coal, which it trimmed slightly). Whitbread are the biggest faller, though, dropping by 3%, despite posting a 5.4% rise in profits so far this year. It told the City that demand at its Premier Inn hotels and Costa Coffee shops was solid. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aiming to open another 3,700 new Premier Inn rooms in the UK by the end of the financial year, and 250 new Costa Coffee shops worldwide. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx says: It seems that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appetite for average coffee and cheapish hotel rooms hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t diminished since the referendum result, though of course it goes without saying that on the Brexit front it is still early doors. Yet investors weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready to send the stock any higher, however. There are two reasons why the US dollar is strengthening, according to Bloomberg. 1) America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector strengthened this month, according to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Markit PMI. 2) A top US central bank official has predicted that interest rates will be hiked several times in the next year. Bloomberg says The gauge of the greenback\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strength remains near to its highest level since March after a preliminary U.S. purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index rose and Fed Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans said it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely that interest rates will be hiked three times by the end of 2017. The yen fell 0.2 percent. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Evans probably had a stronger impact than the PMI on the strength of the dollar,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Kyosuke Suzuki, head of currency and money-market sales at Societe Generale SA in Tokyo. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t many senior Fed officials who have come out with specific numbers of expected rate increases. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s providing a tailwind for the dollar.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has hit a new six-month high today, as investors drive down the yen against the US dollar. The Nikkei jumped by 0.75% today, extending recent gains, to close 130 points higher at 17,365 points. That means it has gained 16% since the slump after the Brexit referendum. It was pushed upwards by a surge of money into the US dollar, which is close to a seven month high against a basket of currencies. The dollar is benefitting from growing confidence that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in December. That weakened the yen, which is a big boost for Japanese exporters -- and should also help fight deflation. There was also optimism, after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data showed Eurozone companies growing at their fastest pace this year. That could bode well for global growth, and mean more demand for Japanese exports. Commodity prices are rallying too, as Reuters explains: There were also tentative hopes rising prices for steel and some industrial commodities - zinc surged to a five-year peak and iron ore reached its highest since mid-2014 - could pick up the pulse of inflation globally. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Brexit supporters have been gunning for Mark Carney ever since the Bank of England governor warned that voting to leave the EU would cause \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmaterial\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 damage to the UK economy. Four months after the referendum, Carney faces a grilling from the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee about the historic vote to leave the EU, starting at 3.35pm today. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be facing (among others) two former chancellors, Alastair Darling and Norman Lamont. Rather sportingly, the Committee have already published their key questions: Are ultra-low interest rates fuelling inequality and threatening the independence of central banks? Did the Bank misjudge the short-term impact of Brexit prior to the referendum? What impact will the fall in the value of the pound have on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy and the inflation target? Will a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit lead to job losses in the City of London? How and when will quantitative easing be unwound? Carney should feel free to cite the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit dashboard, which shows how rising inflation is hitting the economy: Of course, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another question that needs addressing....how long will Carney stay at the Bank of England? His contract runs out in summer 2018, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been talk of extending it until 2021. But the recent criticism from politicians, from Theresa May downwards, may have stung Carney and made him consider seeking new pastures.... Also coming up today... The latest IFO survey, due at 9am BST, will show how Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is faring this month. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting financial results from transport firm National Express, hotels-to-coffee shops group Whitbread, car showrooms firm Pendragon and flooring firm Carpetright, plus a production report from mining giant Anglo American,",

Leaving the EU will also significantly diminish the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capacity to influence EU policy on key sectors of the U.K. economy, such as financial services, that are vital to the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic performance.</p> <p>Brexit could also, over time, diminish sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role as a global reserve currency. Since the referendum, sterling has depreciated against the dollar by more than 17%, at one point reaching a 31-year low.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3083964fca582527138f7bfbec22541e4a340740\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3083964fca582527138f7bfbec22541e4a340740/164_2_2073_1244/1000.jpg\" alt=\"UK prime minister Theresa May in Parliament this week\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">UK prime minister Theresa May in Parliament this week</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>In early October, Prime Minister Theresa May announced that the government will invoke Article 50 of the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Lisbon Treaty no later than March 2017. This decision will be followed by at least two years of negotiations on the terms of EU departure. While two years may suffice to negotiate a successor treaty that will have to be endorsed by European national parliaments and the European parliament, and could face referendums in one or more member states, the process could take much longer.</p> <p>The risks of an inconclusive or detrimental outcome are also material. While some believe the U.K. can arrive at a beneficial agreement with the EU, others take the view that the remaining EU members will have no incentive to accommodate the U.K. Rather, their focus will be on detering other potential departures and containing the rise of their own national eurosceptic movements.</p> <p>In particular, it is not clear if the EU will permit the U.K. access to the single market on existing tariff-free terms, or impose tariffs on U.K. products. Further arrangements regarding the export of services, including by the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important financial services industry, are even more uncertain, in our view.</p> <p>Given that curtailing immigration was a major motivating issue for leave voters, it is also uncertain whether the U.K. would agree to a trade deal that requires the country to accept the free movement of labor from the EU. The negotiation process is therefore fraught with potential challenges and vetos, making the outcome unpredictable.</p> <p>We also believe that the divisions, both within the ruling Conservative Party and society as a whole over the European question, may not heal quickly and may hamper government stability and complicate policymaking on economic and other matters.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a64b67309f7f2c0444f9b0e1b8f06fa12cd3c9c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a64b67309f7f2c0444f9b0e1b8f06fa12cd3c9c5/0_39_1638_1165/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon .\" width=\"1000\" height=\"711\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon .</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>In addition, we take the view that the Scottish National Party will push for another referendum on Scottish independence, given that the Scottish population voted overwhelmingly in favor of remaining within the EU. Such a move will have consequences for the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s constitutional and economic integrity. Northern Ireland is another source of potential issues.</p> <p>These multiple and significant challenges will be very demanding and will detract from macroeconomic goals, such as maintaining growth and consolidating public finances. The lack of clarity while negotiations ensue will also significantly deter private investment. At the same time, we continue to recognize many of the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s institutional strengths. </p> <p>The U.K. benefits from its flexible and open economy and, in our view, has prospered as an EU member. We believe that the U.K. economy has been able to attract higher inflows of low-cost capital and skilled labor than it would have without the preferential access that EU membership delivers. In our opinion, significant net immigration into the U.K. over the past decade helped its economic performance.

                "bodyText":"And back with Uber, here is our roundup of the tribunal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments, from Shane Hickey: On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back next week. And on whether and when it might chance its views, S&amp;P said: We could lower the rating if we conclude that sterling will lose its status as a reserve currency or if public finances or GDP per capita weaken markedly beyond our current expectations. In addition, we could lower our ratings if significant constitutional issues arise and create further financial and economic uncertainty. We could revise the outlook to stable if investment and economic growth remain above our expectations, while negotiations with the EU prove amicable and not significantly detrimental to the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy and trade. S&amp;P is also forecasting a slowdown in the UK from next year: Given Brexit uncertainties and the likely fall in investment, we are forecasting a slowdown in 2017-2019, with GDP growth averaging 1%. The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s asset purchase plan and the Monetary Policy Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to reduce the base rate have helped growth in the short term, but we expect reduced investment to begin to weigh on growth over our forecast period. Warming to its theme, S&amp;P added: The negative outlook reflects our opinion that the recent decision to exit the European Union (the destination for 44% of the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goods and services exports) poses a potential risk to the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national income, as well as its fiscal and external balances. We also see heightened risks of a deterioration in external financing conditions in light of the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high gross external financing requirements (as a share of current account receipts and usable reserves). Complex and protracted negotiations between the U.K. and the EU could, in our opinion, pressure the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial services sector (which is a major contributor to employment and public receipts). We also think Brexit could create challenging constitutional issues if it results in a second referendum on Scottish independence. Leaving the EU will also significantly diminish the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capacity to influence EU policy on key sectors of the U.K. economy, such as financial services, that are vital to the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic performance. Brexit could also, over time, diminish sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role as a global reserve currency. Since the referendum, sterling has depreciated against the dollar by more than 17%, at one point reaching a 31-year low. In early October, Prime Minister Theresa May announced that the government will invoke Article 50 of the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Lisbon Treaty no later than March 2017. This decision will be followed by at least two years of negotiations on the terms of EU departure. While two years may suffice to negotiate a successor treaty that will have to be endorsed by European national parliaments and the European parliament, and could face referendums in one or more member states, the process could take much longer. The risks of an inconclusive or detrimental outcome are also material. While some believe the U.K. can arrive at a beneficial agreement with the EU, others take the view that the remaining EU members will have no incentive to accommodate the U.K. Rather, their focus will be on detering other potential departures and containing the rise of their own national eurosceptic movements. In particular, it is not clear if the EU will permit the U.K. access to the single market on existing tariff-free terms, or impose tariffs on U.K. products. Further arrangements regarding the export of services, including by the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important financial services industry, are even more uncertain, in our view. Given that curtailing immigration was a major motivating issue for leave voters, it is also uncertain whether the U.K. would agree to a trade deal that requires the country to accept the free movement of labor from the EU. The negotiation process is therefore fraught with potential challenges and vetos, making the outcome unpredictable. We also believe that the divisions, both within the ruling Conservative Party and society as a whole over the European question, may not heal quickly and may hamper government stability and complicate policymaking on economic and other matters. In addition, we take the view that the Scottish National Party will push for another referendum on Scottish independence, given that the Scottish population voted overwhelmingly in favor of remaining within the EU. Such a move will have consequences for the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s constitutional and economic integrity. Northern Ireland is another source of potential issues. These multiple and significant challenges will be very demanding and will detract from macroeconomic goals, such as maintaining growth and consolidating public finances. The lack of clarity while negotiations ensue will also significantly deter private investment. At the same time, we continue to recognize many of the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s institutional strengths. The U.K. benefits from its flexible and open economy and, in our view, has prospered as an EU member. We believe that the U.K. economy has been able to attract higher inflows of low-cost capital and skilled labor than it would have without the preferential access that EU membership delivers. In our opinion, significant net immigration into the U.K. over the past decade helped its economic performance. EU membership has also enhanced London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position as a global financial center. The ratings agency said: In our opinion, Brexit presents a significant risk to the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s track record of strong economic performance, and to its large financial sector in particular. The leave result has also led to a less predictable and stable policy framework for the U.K... The outlook remains negative, reflecting the continued institutional and economic uncertainty surrounding Brexit negotiations, and what arrangements will emerge post-departure. S&amp;P has issued its latest update on the UK following the Brexit vote, and it has kept its rating at AA with a negative outlook given the future uncertainties. As we reported earlier, S&amp;P had cut the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rating by two notches on the Monday after the referendum result. Back with stock markets, and European shares have ended on an uncertain note. French and Spanish GDP figures gave some support while stronger than expected US growth increased the chances of a Federal Reserve rate rise before the end of the year. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 9.69 points or 0.14% at 6996.26 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.19% to 10,696.19 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 0.33% at 4548.58 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.59% to 17,324.23 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.04% at 9201.3 In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.13% to 588.67 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 71 points or 0.39%. So what effect could the Uber decision have on the gig economy? Crowley Woodford, employment partner at Ashurst, reckons a huge one: This decision could be the beginning of the end for the gig economy as we know it and will have wide implications for a number of employers beyond Uber, inevitably leading to a flood of further claims. Labour is tabling an amendment to the Digital Economy Bill, which is currently going through Parliament. The amendment, if it is accepted on Tuesday, would extend employment rights to workers at firms like Uber who operate in the gig economy. The clause, tabled by shadow digital minister Louise Haigh, would change the law so that workers at companies who provide a service to customers through a digital \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcintermediary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 such as Uber are defined as employees of that business. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tribunal ruling only applies to Uber and the US-based company plans to challenge it anyway. Louise Haigh said: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThis amendment will, for the first time, enshrine in statute the rights of workers in the digital economy; the right to be designated as employees and their right to sick and holiday pay so that if companies like Uber try to wriggle out of their responsibilities by appealing this extraordinarily welcome decision today, they will have nowhere to go.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a piece from Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady, general secretary of the TUC, on the Uber verdict: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a response from the government. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, said: The Government is committed to building an economy that works for all. We are keen to ensure our employment rules keep up to date to reflect new ways of working, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why the Government has asked Matthew Taylor to conduct an independent review into modern working practices. Clearer rules are needed to determine whether someone is an employee, a worker or self-employed, says Citizens Advice. Chief executive Gillian Guy said: The fact it takes an employment tribunal to decide whether these drivers are self-employed shows that proving employment status is an extremely complicated and costly process. For many people struggling at the sharp end of insecure work, such as in false self-employment, taking such a case is simply not an option - not least because of employment tribunal fees of up to \u00c2\u00a31,200. To address this Citizens Advice is keen the government considers introducing an effective online test people could use which would determine their employment status. It is encouraging to see the government is keen to tackle the challenges brought by insecure work. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very positive that the Prime Minister has announced an independent review of modern employment and that the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) committee is to investigate the rights and treatment of non-permanent staff. The full Uber judgement and the reasons for the decision are online here. The courts have done their job with the Uber ruling but the UK Parliament will have to step in to set laws for the new economy, says Torsten Bell at the Resolution Foundation: As a country we have two ways of resolving legal uncertainty \u00e2\u20ac\u201c our courts and Parliament. The first of these has done its work today, and will be called up to do so again on this and related topics in the years ahead. But in the end it is Parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job to opine on how our law should be updated to respond to developments in the real world. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good that both the Business Select Committee and the government themselves have launched reviews of existing employment legislation, although as with all reviews it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what is actually done with them that matters. New technology is by and large a good thing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but the old fashioned wish for certainty in what the law means for the jobs we do, pounds we earn and tax we pay remains as important as ever. The courts can do their bit to interpret our law in the face of changes, but in the end it is for government and Parliament to give us a law fit for that new world. The full piece is here. Not just minium wage and holiday pay, but also a company pension could be on the cards for Uber drivers after the tribunal decision. Tom McPhail, head of retirement policy at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: This is great news for anyone working in the gig economy as it means they are more likely to be eligible for a workplace pension, with all the attendant benefits and in particular the highly valuable employer contribution. It is also going to be a challenge for Uber and employers like them, in deciding what specific pension terms they want to offer their employees. They have some latitude on earnings definitions and deferral periods but however they deal with this, it is going to cost them time and money. Back with Uber, and the tribunal decision must not discourage firms from using the self-employed, according to trade body IPSE. Chris Bryce, chief executive of the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self Employed, said: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision gives Uber drivers clarity around their relationship with Uber, subject to Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intended appeal. As far as IPSE is concerned self-employment means you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in control, and that must remain a positive choice. If companies want to control exactly how or when their workers do the actual work, they must not shirk their responsibility to provide employment protections and pay their employer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Insurance Contributions too. If they want to engage workers on a freelance basis, then they must be business-like in that relationship. We will be studying the full judgement carefully to consider its implications, but this ruling may have an impact on the wider gig economy. The recently launched review of employment practices takes on even greater urgency and importance in light of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling. However, Government must be careful not to dissuade firms from making use of the highly-skilled, on-demand flexible workforce as a whole. The vast majority of people who work this way made an active choice to do so and cherish their self-employed status. Athough... here is a sign of a weaker US economy. The University of Michigan consumer confidence index has come in weaker than expected at 87.2 in October. This is lower than the initial estimate of 87.9 and forecasts of 88.1, and is well below September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure of 91.2. Back with US GDP for a moment, and Wall Street has moved ahead in early trading, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up around 30 points or nearly 0.2%. The strong growth figure means it is increasingly likely the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates before the end of the year, in December if not ahead of the election. Alex Lydall, head of dealing at Foenix Partners, said: The US took a giant step towards the execution phase of interest rate hikes this afternoon after an aggressively positive Q3 growth print registered at 1.5%. With the Fed already being split on those in favour of a rate hike last month, progress appears to be pointing towards a post-election hike at year-end. Meanwhile more on those soybeans: Although Uber is appealing the tribunal decision, a number of commentators have said it could open the door to further claims. Alan Price, employment law director at advisory group Peninsula, said: Whilst this decision is only at employment tribunal level... the case could have large consequences for businesses run on a similar model. There is already a related claim supported by a different union in the pipeline against the courier firm City Sprint. Not only could this decision lead to an influx of tribunal claims, but it can lead to large financial penalties for businesses who have not given staff their correct legal rights. Aye Limbin Glassey, employment partner at Shakespeare Martineau, said: The ruling will not only impact Uber but a whole number of other industries and businesses which use self-employed workers. It is by no means the end of the issue - continued pressure from trade unions calling for tighter regulations means that the Uber ruling will likely be a catalyst for further scrutiny. The very nature of a business like Uber is the flexibility it offers. However, employment practices cannot be left unregulated and rights of workers and employees cannot be ignored unless businesses are willing and ready to face the backlash of legal and reputational repercussions. It is stark reality that the application of employment rights will often mean that companies are unable to adopt the agility needed to support its success. With consumer convenience the driver of many fast-growing businesses, it is likely that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see more businesses of this nature coming to market and using self-employed workers will become a greater concern for companies. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our report on the Uber verdict, from Hilary Osborne: Drivers for Uber have won a landmark case after employment tribunal judges ruled that they were not self-employed and should be paid the national living wage. The case could open up the technology firm to claims from all of its 40,000 drivers in the UK, and force other companies in the so-called gig economy to review the way that they are employing staff. It is likely that the firm will appeal against the finding. The ride hailing app had argued that the drivers were independent contractors who are self-employed and can choose where and when they work. But an employment tribunal in London found that this was not the case. The full story is here: The Uber ruling is disappointing for its 40,000 drivers and consumers alike, according to the Adam Smith Institute. Sam Dumitriu, head of projects at the think tank, said: Nearly 80% of Uber drivers preferred being self-employed and being their own boss, saying in a recent poll that they wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t trade that status for some of the benefits like holiday pay, pension contributions and the National Minimum Wage. Uber drivers typically earn well above the National Living Wage. Across the UK, the average driver earns \u00c2\u00a316 an hour, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s after Uber has taken their commission, but before you factor in extra costs like insurance, petrol and car payments. One you factor that in it comes to around \u00c2\u00a312 an hour, still well above the minimum wage. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s higher for drivers in London and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s higher for drivers who work at peak times like Saturday evening. Consumers will see prices rise and a less stable, predictable service. And this doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just hit Uber. It threatens other new business models like Deliveroo and Amazon Prime Now. Unions are understandably delighted to have won today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s case against Uber. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an important step towards cleaning up the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgig economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (which relies on temporary, often low paid, workers). \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The GMB deserve huge credit for a shining light on conditions at Uber and winning this landmark action. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This case has exposed the dark side of so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflexible\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 labour. For many workers the gig economy is a rigged economy, where bosses can get out of paying the minimum wage and providing basics like paid holidays and rest breaks. O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady adds that Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government also needs to take action to prevent workers being exploited: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What is happening at Uber is just the tip of the iceberg. Lots of people are now trapped in insecure jobs, with low pay and no voice at work. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need the government to get tough on sham self-employment. The Taylor review of employment practices must be a no-holds-barred investigation. And it must recognise the important role trade unions can play in ending precarious working.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Uber ruling could trigger a wave of claims from workers at other companies. Frank Ryan, employment lawyer at legal firm Vardags, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a landmark decision which is guaranteed to have widespread implications: for Uber itself, its workers, the paying public, black cab drivers and other workers in the so called gig economy. While each case turns on its own facts, this is essentially a green light for others in the gig economy to come forward and make similar claims. Ryan also argues that consumers could end up paying more for cab rides: While potentially good news for black cab drivers, who have always struggled to compete with Uber and who will already have been encouraged by the Mayor of London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s package of reforms for the taxi sector, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ultimately bad news for the consumer. It is surely unavoidable that Uber will look to pass the resultant increased costs onto the paying customer. Uber has swiftly responded, saying it will appeal against the UK tribunal ruling that its drivers should be treated as employees. It argues that most drivers are happy with the current situation. Jo Bertram, regional general manager of Uber in the UK, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tens of thousands of people in London drive with Uber precisely because they want to be self-employed and their own boss. The overwhelming majority of drivers who use the Uber app want to keep the freedom and flexibility of being able to drive when and where they want. While the decision of this preliminary hearing only affects two people we will be appealing it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: Back in London, the lawyers representing a group of Uber drivers say they have won a court case, at which they argued that the workers are employed by the taxi hire firm. The ruling means that Uber drivers will be entitled to employment benefits, and could be a major moment in the evolution of the new \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 economy. They say: The London Central Employment Tribunal has found that a group of Uber drivers are workers and are entitled to receive the National Minimum Wage and holiday pay. In a landmark ruling that follows a hearing in July, which will affect tens of thousands of Uber drivers, the Employment Tribunal has ruled today that a group of Uber drivers are not self-employed but are workers who are entitled to essential workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rights including to be paid the National Minimum Wage and receive paid holiday. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full statement: Historic victory for Uber drivers as Tribunal finds they are entitled to basic workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rights The US economy has regained momentum, says Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics. He writes: The stand-out in the third quarter was the 10.0% surge in exports. Admittedly, some of that surge was due to a one-off spike in soybean exports, which will be reversed in the fourth quarter, but it is still a welcome sign that the dollar appreciation in 2014 and 2015 is no longer weighing on exporters. Overall, net exports added 0.8% points to GDP growth. After being a sizeable drag on growth for the preceding five quarters, inventories added a further 0.6% points. But....Ashworth also points out that not everything was rosy: Consumption growth slowed to 2.1%, residential investment contracted by 6.2% and equipment investment fell by 2.7% Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at City trading firm Xtrade, believes US interest rates are now likely to rise in December. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The last time US GDP growth surged past two per cent the Federal Reserve raised interest rates. With today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s numbers flying above that watermark, history may be about to repeat itself. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy is being fuelled by a buoyant jobs market, strong levels of consumer spending and healthy trade. If the indicators continue to point upwards for the US then Fed Chair Janet Yellen will look to stop things boiling over. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Many believe that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big bump in growth will assure a December rate rise, but with a US election just weeks away, nothing is certain.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd What does this stronger growth mean for US interest rates? On balance, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect that stronger growth raises the chances that the Federal Reserve hikes borrowing costs at its December meeting. Investor Adrial Miller thinks to: But....Anna Stupnytska, global economist at Fidelity International, argues that some Fed policymakers could make a case for holding rates again: At 2.9%, the US economy has just posted its strongest growth rate in two years! That should be a boost for the Democratic Party, as they head into November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s elections. More detail... Business fixed investment (in, say, factories) rose by an annual rate of 1.2%. However, spending on new equipment dropped by 2.7%; the fourth quarter running where companies cut back. Government spending picked up a little, adding 0.09% to the GDP rate. US growth last quarter was driven by a surge in exports, including soybeans, and more companies choosing to restock their inventories. Exports increased by 10%, at a 10 percent rate, the biggest rise since the fourth quarter of 2013. And businesses piled up new stock at an annual rate of $12.6bn, compared to running them down at a rate of $9.5bn in Q2. That suggests that firms are more optimistic about growth prospects. But consumer spending has eased back. It only grew by 2.1%, compared with 4.3% three months ago. Some instant reaction to the better-than-expected US growth figures: Breaking: The US economy grew by an annualised rate of 2.9% in the last three months, stronger than expected. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big jump on the 1.4% annualised growth recorded between April and June, and suggests America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is strengthening. A 2.9% growth rate is the equivalent of just over 0.7% on a quarter-on-quarter basis, so America is growing faster than Britain (+0.5%). More to follow! What should we watch out for in the US GDP report? Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some ideas: Will growth burst over the 2% mark, and even threaten 3%? Will consumer spending continue to drive growth? Will businesses keep spending on research and intellectual property? R&amp;D spending spiked sharply in the second quarter, so it could have faded. Will companies restock their inventories? They ran them down in Q2, which held back growth Will government spending fall? It did earlier this year - another reason Q2 growth was weak. This preview has more details: Tension is building in the markets as investors await the first estimate of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth in the third quarter of 2016, in 30 minutes time. The US GDP report is due at 8.30am New York time, or 1.30pm in the UK. Wall Street expect the US economy grew by an annualised rate of around 2.5% in July to September, up from 1.4% in the second quarter of 2016. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the equivalent of a 0.6% quarterly rate. Economist reckon that consumer spending, and rising exports, drove growth up in the last three months. The figures are eagerly awaited, as they could determine whether the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates in December; they could also influence next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s elections too. Paresh Davdra, CEO and Co-Founder of RationalFX, sums it up Growth is expected to have picked up from the previous quarter, and there is speculation that good figures could mean an interest rate hike before Christmas. With the US Presidential election less than 2 weeks away, all eyes will be on the current state of the economy and the effect it could have on an election which is likely to have a large effect on global markets depending on the result. As was the case in the lead up to the EU Referendum, this could potentially be a nervous time for economists, currencies and markets alike.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Although we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had French, Spanish and Austrian GDP today, we have to wait until Monday to learn how the wider eurozone fared over the summer. Economists are predicting another quarter of unspectacular growth, of around 0.3%. A lot depends on Germany and Italy, of course, and their GDP report isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t formally released until November 15! Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight has some predictions: We expect German GDP expansion to have come in at 0.3-0.4% quarter-on-quarter, which would be in line with the 0.4% quarter-on-quarter expansion seen in the second quarter. Additionally, we expect Italian GDP to have crept up just 0.1% quarter-on-quarter having been flat in the second quarter. Austria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has racked up another quarter of solid growth, with GDP increasing by 0.4% in the July-to-September period. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from 0.3% in Q2, with consumer spending pushing growth higher. Heads up (2): Rating agency Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is expected to publish a review of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating tonight. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not expecting any major action, as little has really changed since the EU referendum. But you never know.... S&amp;P hit the UK with a double-notch downgrade on the Monday following the Brexit vote (just as the English team exited the European Championship ignominiously with a defeat to mighty Iceland). Jordan Rochester of Nomura says: The rating.. is perhaps unlikely to be changed today given the S&amp;P\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stated criteria as to what would lead to a downgrade further have not yet taken place (public finances to deteriorate, GDP per capita to fall, GBP to lose its reserve currency status, Scottish Referendum \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the sequel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or other significant constitutional issues) Heads up (1): A court will rule this afternoon whether taxi-app firm Uber has breached UK law and not provided drivers with basic employment rights. The case goes to the heart of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 economy; Uber argues that the drivers are self-employed, while unions say that they are effectively employed by Uber, so are entitled to holiday pay, sick pay, a guaranteed minimum wage and breaks. The ruling is due at 2pm BST..... Ouch. The pound just had another one of its little moments, dropping sharply to an eight-day low against the euro (at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1117). Sterling is lost all its early gains against the US dollar, hitting a three-day low of $1.2126. The trigger is news from Belfast, where campaigners have lost a court case against the UK government over Brexit. They had argued that Westminster could not begin the formal legal process for leaving the EU without a parliamentary vote. They claimed that using the royal prerogative to trigger article 50 would breach Northern Irish law. But the Northern Ireland high court has just ruled against them. This has weakened the pound, as it removes one obstacle in the path of Brexit. However.... another court case, arguing that MPs must vote on Article 50, is still running in London. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d wrongly expected eurozone inflation data today; turns out that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coming on Monday. Instead, the European Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest economic confidence figures have just landed - showing that firms are the most confident they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been all year. The EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic sentiment indicator rose to 106.3 in October from 104.9 in September, beating expectations of a small decline. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the highest reading seen in 2016. And the business climate indicator rose to 0.55 from 0.44 in September, its highest reading since July 2011. This could be an encouraging sign that the eurozone economy is picking up (despite France missing growth forecasts this morning). Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says: This adds to the evidence that Eurozone economies may well be gaining some growth momentum over the final months of 2016 after activity has stuttered since the first quarter. Indeed, the rise in Eurozone economic sentiment to a 10-month high in October follows on from the purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 survey showing that overall Eurozone manufacturing and services output picked up to a 2016 high in October. This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP data hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t brought much cheer to Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets. The main indices are all in the red this morning, as traders fret about this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bond selloff. In London, the FTSE 100 has dropped 40 points, or 0.6%. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the damage: Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says the sellers are back in charge: Markets cannot seem to catch a break at the moment, for with every rise comes an inevitable drop. He predicts that bonds will remain under pressure (for the reasons outlined earlier): Bond yields are on the rise, following on from an incredible multiyear period of strength in bond prices. In an environment of rising inflation, and an increasingly likely US December rate hike, there is a chance that we will see yields continue to rise for some time yet. Coming at a time when stocks are tumbling, this highlights that the move out of bonds is more to do with economics (which often move inverse to the FTSE) than risk attitudes Analysts at Rabobank are calling the bond market sell-off a\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdbloodbath\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Reuters flags up. John Reid, a market strategist at Deutsche Bank, is also concerned, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bond markets are facing a recurring nightmare at the moment as we continue to see yields rise sharply.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Some investors risk getting their fingers burned. Or worse.... There are some serious moves in the bond market this morning, as investors pull money out of sovereign debt. The yield, or interest rate, of UK 10-year gilts has hit 1.3% for the first time since the Brexit vote. That means the price of the bonds has dropped. Gilt yields have been climbing steadily this month, and that means the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost of borrowing has gone up. Britain isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t alone, though. German 10-year bund yields have hit their highest level since May, while Italian 10-year bonds are at an eight-month high. Rising bond yields implies two things Inflation is going up, so investors want a higher rate of return for holding government debt Investors suspect that central banks will tighten monetary policy soon, after years of buying up government bonds through QE (driving down prices). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a volatile picture, though - this tweet shows how shorter-dated German bond yields jumped, then fell back..... The pound remains subdued this morning, up just 0.15% at $1.218. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost 18% below its pre-referendum values, which is now feeding into import costs... Adam Posen, a former member of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Monetary Policy Committee, is pretty gloomy about Brexit. Asked on Bloomberg TV whether there was anything positive about Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s looming exit from the European Union, Posen replied \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Of course, he added, the economy will survive, the City will survive in a smaller state -- but people will be worse off in 10 years. Posen, who now runs America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Peterson Institute, then elaborated: Brexit is going to be an ongoing source of chronic pain for the UK for many years. It is going to put the UK in many ways back to where it was in the 70s and early 80s. Being uncompetitive, people having less faith in the stability of the regime. The Spanish GDP report is online here. Newsflash: Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy remains impressively immune to the political deadlock that has gripped the country this year. Spanish GDP expanded by 0.7% in the last quarter, new figures show. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another quarter of solid growth, beating France (+0.2%) and the UK (+0.5%), a However, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slightly lower than the 0.8% we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d got use to seeing: On an annual basis, Spain expanded by a healthy looking 3.2%: Spain has been stuck with a caretaker government since January, with two general elections failing to deliver a clear winner. Tomorrow, the Spanish parliament will hold a confidence vote that will decide whether acting prime minister Mariano Rajoy gets a second term. The Socialist party is expected to abstain, paving the way for a new Rajoy administration, despite ongoing opposition to his austerity programme. More here: Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rajoy looks to Saturday vote to form new government France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, Michel Sapin, has admitted that the government may miss its growth targets this year, after this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP figures missed expectations. Reuters has the details: Weaker than expected economic growth in the third quarter makes its harder to reach the French government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth target of 1.5% this year but does not cast doubt on the 2017 goal, also 1.5 %, Finance Minister Michel Sapin said on Friday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It makes it harder to reach 1.5 percent this year, I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deny it, but it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t call into question next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sapin told RTL radio. The economy grew a slim 0.2 percent in the third quarter of2016, undershooting expectations for a stronger rebound after asmall contraction in the previous three months, official data showed earlier, as consumer spending stalled. Another quarter, another loss from Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taxpayer-controlled bank. Royal Bank of Scotland has posted a \u00c2\u00a3469m loss for the last quarter, twice as much as analysts expected. Bad behaviour by bankers is partly to blame; RBS is taking a \u00c2\u00a3425m charge to cover legacy misconduct. It has also run up \u00c2\u00a3469m of restructuring charges, partly due to its struggles to sell its Williams &amp; Glyn branch network. RBS admits that it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t settle this deal by the end of 2017, as it had hoped. CEO Ross McEwan says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve said that 2015 and 2016 would be noisy as we work through legacy issues and transform this bank for customers. These results reflect that noise.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now eight years since the UK government bailed out RBS. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results suggest there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little chance of extracting the taxpayers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 money anytime soon.... More reaction, from Bloomberg economist Maxime Sbaihi: Economists are disappointed that France didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t grow faster in the last quarter. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Holger Sandte of Nordea Market: Bloomberg are also underwhelmed (and also flag up that we should get Spanish GDP today too). Disappointingly, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual growth rate has dipped to 1.1%: France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has been quite bumpy over the last two years, as this graph shows: And growth of 0.2% may not be enough to restore confidence in president Francois Hollande, with a general election looming next year Over on fastFT, Nathalie Thomas says: The deep unpopularity of Mr Hollande, amid weak growth and still high unemployment relative to many of France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU peers, has prompted a desperate search among the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s socialists for an alternative candidate who could possibly be fielded at next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s elections, with the idea of the incumbent president not seeking a second term becoming more palatable. Most of the 0.2% French growth last quarter was due to companies restocking their inventories, says INSEE. Consumers contributed little to growth, with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153household consumption expenditure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd stagnant for the second month running. Investment picked up, with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gross fixed capital formation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rising by 0.3% France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit dragged back growth, says INSEE: Imports sharply bounced back (+2.2% after -1.7%). Exports accelerated to a lesser extent (+0.6% after +0.2%). All in all, foreign trade balance contributed negatively to GDP growth (-0.5 points after +0.6 points). But that was balanced by firms replenishing their inventories, which added 0.6% to the growth rate. NEWSFLASH: France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is growing again, but not by as much as economists hoped. French GDP expanded by 0.2% in the third quarter of this year, figures just released by the INSEE statistics office show. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an improvement on April to June, when the economy disappointingly shrank by 0.1%. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker than expected -- the City was expecting growth of 0.3%. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rather weaker than Britain, which posted 0.5% growth yesterday. More to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After the excitement of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK GDP report, investors are poised for new growth reports from France and the US. French GDP is released any moment, and will give the first clue on how the eurozone performed in the last quarter. Then at 1.30pm BST, we learn how America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy fared in July to September. Economists expect growth to pick up, to an annual rate of 2.5% (from 1.4%). The stronger the reading, the greater the chance of a US interest rate hike before Christmas. A good growth report could also help Hillary Clinton, as the race to the White House reaches its final days. In between, the final estimate of eurozone inflation for October lands at 10am. Royal Bank of Scotland are publishing financial results at 7am, as are airline group IAG. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also be watching the UK car industry, after Nissan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to expand its Sunderland plant despite the uncertainty around Brexit. There may also be ructions in the sovereign bond market too, where prices have been falling for a few weeks now. Expectations of higher inflation are partly to blame, meaning investors are demanding a greater return on government debt. They may also suspect that the era of central bank stimulus may be drawing to an end. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets has the details: UK 10 year gilt yields, pushed up to 1.25% their highest levels since they fell from 1.37% the closing level on the 23rd June, after UK Q3 GDP came in at 0.5%, exceeding market expectations of 0.3%. This economic resilience makes it much less likely that the Bank of England will signal further easing next week at the same time as it publishes its latest quarterly inflation report. German bunds also got caught up in the selloff, with yields hitting their highest levels since May, given the resilience of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s German economic data, along with the prospect that inflationary pressures may be starting to build in the broader global economy. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

And recent events suggests he may have a fine grasp of the dark arts of political spin.</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/31/mark-carney-hasnt-just-played-a-political-game-hes-won-it-hands/\">The Telegraph\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s James Kirkup argues</a> that Carney has played a blinder this month, by using the attacks from Brexit supporters to spark a debate about his future.</p> <p>The key to the saga is Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s declaration last week that his decision on whether to stay or go in 2018 was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153entirely personal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That sent the hare running.... and it got a second burst of speed when various Carney \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfriends\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 suggested he was leaning towards a return to Canada.</p> <p>Kirkup explains how Carney outfoxed his detractors within Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Before the row over his ideological commitment to Brexit blew up, there was a perfectly respectable question to be asked about Mr Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future based on his competence as a central banker. Some of his policies, especially \u00e2\u20ac\u0153forward guidance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about rates, have been less than impressive, leading to confusion instead of the clarity he promised.</p> <p>But the Carney-bashers have allowed that debate to shift from economics into politics, an arena where Mr Carney does rather well. He understood that Mrs May could not afford to have markets and investors (and even some voters) see Brexit Britain as the sort of country where the central bank governor can be purged for failing to pass a political purity test. </p> <p>Simply, it might (just) have been viable to let Mr Carney go for being incompetent, but it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sensible to do so for reasons of politics.

What they symbolise via the authority of their respective offices is stability, relative calm and continuity. Perception and confidence matters, a lot.</p> <p>Tories used to have a better feel for the realities of markets, back when many of them had worked in the City. Now, they seem to think a war on Carney is simply an extension of the Brexit campaign. It is to his credit if he has decided to leave this recent mess in the past and get on with helping guide Britain through Brexit.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/iainmartin1/status/793041410341662720\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Mark Carney set to stay.

                "bodyText":"It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a long old day, and quite a dramatic one as Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future came to a head faster than most experts expected. No-one really predicted that the BoE governor would split the difference between his fans, and his critics, and plump to do an extra 12 months duty at Threadneedle Street. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why the decision has been greeted fairly calmly, with the government insisting it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good news, but businesses understandably concerned about what happens in 2019. Sir Martin Sorrell probably spoke for many business leaders when he said it was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dca pity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that Carney wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be at the helm until 2021. Whatever you think about the European Union, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an argument that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better not to change central bank governors in the middle of the Brexit negotiations. Now, the Treasury has almost three years to find the perfect candidate to replace Carney on 1 July 2019 and help steer Britain into its post-EU future. The immediate reaction from the City is still quite positive, with the pound up 0.6 of a cent at $1.2245. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll may find out one day how hard Theresa May fought to keep Carney, or whether this compromise really suits all parties. We may also find out whether the governor still has serious political ambitions back in Canada. Several commentators, including Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jill Ward, have suggested he has an eye on the next federal elections, which are due in late 2019.... With that, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m wrapping up for the night. Larry Elliott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full story on Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision is now live. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: Mark Carney to serve extra year as Bank of England governor Mark Carney has ended weeks of speculation about his future by agreeing to stay on as governor of the Bank of England until Brexit negotiations with the EU have ended in 2019. Despite being urged by the prime minister, Theresa May, and the chancellor, Philip Hammond, to serve a full eight-year term at Threadneedle Street, until 2021, Carney said he would only agree to remain in place for an extra year. Hestarted in the job in July 2013. The governor said in a letter to Hammond that he had intended to leave the Bank for personal reasons after five years, but the altered landscape for the UK following the vote in June to leave the EU had caused him to change his mind..... Goodnight, and thanks for reading and commenting. GW Elizabeth Martins, an economist with HSBC, has dubbed Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision a halfway house (which is a relief, as I plumped for that term earlier :) ). She says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I guess that markets would have liked to see a 2021 extension, and expected it given indications in the media. But this will go down better than an earlier departure.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s via Reuters) And Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight has given the news \u00e2\u20ac\u0153two cheers out of three\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and suggests Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s detractors should rein themselves in: Now that Mr. Carney has made his intentions clear, it is to be hoped that everyone gives the Governor maximum support, including his critics. The UK faces a very challenging period ahead which will be demanding for all policymakers. Matters will not be helped by sniping at the Bank of England Governor or making statements that seemingly question at the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence Some Bank of England trivia, from Newnight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Lewis Goodall: Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Conservative MP who clashed with Mark Carney at several parliamentary hearings, doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear very happy with tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news. He told Reuters that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think the uncertainty was bad, but I still think he ought to have gone because of his bias over Brexit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Some pro-Brexit Conservative MPs aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t best pleased that Mark Carney will remain at the Bank of England until 2019, says the City AM newspaper. One leading Tory brexiteer told them that: My sense is that if [Carney] is going to stay to 2019 he needs to find a way to row in behind the Prime Minister and start to find a way to be a bit more positive. I would like him to stay and do a good job, and demonstrate some enthusiasm for leaving the EU, seeing as we are going to. More here. Duncan Weldon, head of research at Resolution Group, suggests Mark Carney has played the game rather well.... Adam Marshall, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), is pleased that Mark Carney has decided his future. But he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also concerned that his replacement (whoever she or he is) will take over at a critical time: \u00e2\u20ac\ufffdBusinesses want stability at a time of economic change, particularly at key institutions like the Bank of England. Firms will be reassured that the recent speculation over the timing and nature of Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure has been put to rest. However, the Governor will still be leaving at a sensitive time for the economy - so businesses will want to see a clear and ordered transition plan.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd An interesting reaction from Rupert Harrison of BlackRock, the asset manager. Harrison is a former advisor to George Osborne, who appointed Carney in the first place. British prime minister Theresa May has welcomes Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to extend his term at the Bank of England by one year. May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokeswoman says (via Reuters). \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The prime minister welcomes the governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to stay on beyond his initial five-year term. This is good news for the UK. It will provide continuity and stability at the Bank of England as we negotiate our exit from the European Union and look to take advantage of the opportunities that Brexit will present.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no word on whether May would rather Carney had stayed until 2021. Zing! Andrew Tyrie, the influential chair of parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Treasury Committee, is determined to find out why Mark Carney is only going to serve a six year term. And he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promising to ask the governor a lot of searching questions when they next face each other.... The much needed clarification is welcome. The less uncertainty the better. Still, the Treasury Committee concluded in November 2011 that a non-renewable term of 8 years for the post of Governor was appropriate. The Government agreed, and changed the law in the Financial Services Act 2012, in line with the recommendation. In making this announcement, the Government and the Governor are sticking neither to the timetable set out in the exchange of letters, nor returning to the statute. More uncertainty needs to be avoided. So the decision requires a good deal of examination and explanation, which the Committee will seek when it next sees the Governor in a fortnight. The CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s principal economist, Alpesh Paleja, says Carney has given us a Halloween treat: Sir Martin Sorrell, head of advertising giant WPP, is disappointed that Carney won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay on until 2021. Sorrell told Sky News that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one year is better than nothing... but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing that he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t serve his full term.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Maybe he was a little bit bruised by the criticism, I think unjustified criticism, that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been subjected to,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sorrell said. Sorrell also warned that it will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153touch and go\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as to whether the UK has finished the Brexit negotiations by June 2019. Chris Chapman, a London-based trader at Manulife Asset Management, has told Bloomberg that the City ought to welcome Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Carney is a respected central banker and overall I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say that him staying with the BOE until 2019 would be seen as a positive for the country, but again, near term there are so many other factors weighing on the pound. Grant Lewis, head of research at Daiwa Capital Markets, tweets that Mark Carney is doing Britain a favour: While James Mackintosh of the Wall Street Journal says Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure is well-timed. Sterling has rallied a little following Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement. The pound is up half a cent against the US dollar at $1.224. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up a similar amount against the euro, at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.115. These are small gains, but not enough to stop sterling being the worst-performing major currency this month [it lost 6% in October, after Theresa May announced she would trigger article 50 by March 2017, and prioritise migration control] Ed Conway is two steps ahead of us in the game of fantasy central bank governors: Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dharshini David says Carney has made a sensible decision by staying on for an extra 12 months. Kate Devlin of The Herald points out that Downing Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s charm offensive this morning didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t persuade Carney to do three more years: ITV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris Ship wonders if Mark Carney has half an eye on Canadian politics.... Mark Carney has surprised pretty much everyone by deciding that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll hang around at the Bank of England for another 12 months, until June 2019. It feels like a halfway-house decision, which will disappoint those who hoped he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d stay until 2012. But it may also placate some of his Brexit-supporting critics; as Carney will depart shortly after Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU is completed (assuming Theresa May starts the process in March 2017, as planned). Philip Hammond has sent a rather short reply to Mark Carney. In it, the chancellor says he is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very pleased\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that he will continue as Bank of England governor until June 2019, to provide \u00e2\u20ac\u0153highly effective leadership\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd during this critical time. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full letter which Mark Carney sent to chancellor Philip Hammond tonight, saying he would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153honoured to extend my time of service as Governor for an additional year to the end of June 2019.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd BREAKING NEWS: Mark Carney has decided to staying on as Bank of England governor for another year. The Bank of England has just announced that Carney will remain in post until the end of June 2019, 12 months longer than originally planned. But crucially, Carney is not taking up the option of three more years -- despite Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote of confidence today. Carney says this extra 12 months should cover the period over which Britain leaves the European Union, and will help \u00e2\u20ac\u0153secure an orderly transition\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new relationship with Europe. More to follow! If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just tuning in, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d better explain that the question on the City of London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collective mind is whether Mark Carney decides to stay on at the Bank of England until 2021. Under his original contract, he is due to leave in the summer of 2018, but he has the option to stick in the job for another three years. Some pro-Brexit politicians have heaped heavy criticism on Carney, saying he was discredited for being unduly pessimistic about leaving the EU. But earlier today, Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokeswoman gave him a resounding endorsement, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is clearly a decision for him, but the PM would certainly be supportive of him going on beyond his five years. The PM has always had a good working relationship with the governor of the Bank of England and intends to continue that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carney and May then spoke for around an hour and a half today. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also hearing that a decision on Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future could come this evening.... Investors would probably be reassured if Mark Carney announces he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll stay at the Bank of England for another three years. This is from Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 latest update on the governor: The career plans of a man once dubbed the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153outstanding central banker of his generation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd have gripped financial markets. Some of the recent slide in sterling and rise in government bond yields have been attributed by analysts to the prospect of Carney leaving the BoE. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If Carney was to stay until 2021 that would somewhat reassure markets,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Hetal Mehta, senior European economist with Legal &amp; General Investment Management. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It would be really unwelcome for (finance minister) Philip Hammond to have to find someone new over the course of next year when he will have a million and one other things to worry about.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd While we wait for developments, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a video clip of Mark Carney responding to an MP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s question: Danny Blanchflower, a former Bank of England policymaker, has warned that Mark Carney is the main defence between Britain and chaos. Writing in the Guardian tonight, Blanchflower says: Mark Carney is unequivocally not responsible for the slowing of the UK economy or the fall in the pound. Quite the contrary, he almost single-handedly turned around a potential collapse in output and sentiment in the days after the EU referendum on 23 June. Far from harming Britain, Carney has been the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s saviour. I have criticised the Bank of England governor rather harshly in the past, especially for his claim in August 2015, that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sustained momentum\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the UK economy and rising inflation would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153likely put the decision as to when to start the process of gradual monetary policy normalisation into sharper relief around the turn of this year\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen. But I have changed my mind. Right now we all need to stand behind Carney for the good of the country. Without him, chaos reigns. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full piece. We could get an announcement from the Bank of England tonight, according to Jason Groves of the Daily Mail. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not official, though -- so hopefully it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t interfere with anyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trick or treating.... Over at the Oxford Union, the US treasury secretary is educating students about the problems in the global economy. Jack Lew is running through a familiar litany of problems -- from corporate tax avoidance to worries about migration, and the rise of popularism among those who feel they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting an unfair deal. Our economics reporter Katie Allen is tweeting the key points: Hopefully one of the students will ask Lew why the government he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s served in hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t managed to tackle these problems... That \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpop\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the pound a few minutes ago may simply be due to trading around the 4pm fix - when the value of the pound is recorded each day, City traders tell me. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fix may be more volatile as it is the final reading of the month, so investors may be rebalancing their portfolios. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an explanation of The Fix. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the official (no) comment from Downing Street about today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting between Theresa May and Mark Carney. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This was a scheduled, planned meeting that had been in the diary for a while. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not going to go into the details of the discussions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Curiously, the pound just jumped by half a cent against the US dollar, to $1.2217. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also up half a percent against the euro, to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.114. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear what sparked this mini rally, or whether it will last. Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokeswoman won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say how the meeting with Mark Carney went, alas. The long-term value of the pound will be determined by the terms of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU and the trade deals it secures, not the identity of the Bank of England governor. So argues Neil Wilson of City trading firm ETX Capital, who says Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t distract from the fundamental issues affecting the UK economy. He writes: Investors are selling the pound for a variety of reasons and the whole Carney saga doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t amount to a hill of beans for the currency.... Sterling was the worst performing currency in October, having had its worst month since June, which has more to do with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 talk since the Tory party conference than speculation over Mr Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future. For sterling what really matters is how Britain handles the Brexit process and what direction Theresa May and co plan to take the country in the coming months before invoking Article 50. The chief drivers of the pound value now are political, not which city Mr Carney chooses to live in. (Also if the economy continues to hold up well into next year we could see sterling crank higher.) And while Mr Carney provides continuity and reassurance, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to see him doing an awful lot between now and 2018 that would be different to any other central banker.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Even the satirists are having their say: Unless we get a late rally tonight, the pound is going to rack up its worst month since June - having dropped by over 6% in October. Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec, says the uncertainty over Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future has weighed on sterling. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The talk of Carney not taking up the extra three years after 2018 has rattled investors in what is a very uncertain outlook. Until his decision to stay on is formally acknowledged,markets are correct in treating the situation as uncertain.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carney also waved what looked like an A4 leather binder towards the press pack as he exited Number 10 a few minutes ago: Here you go -- photos of Mark Carney leaving his meeting with Theresa May - with a shy smile for the cameras (but no words, alas) Mark Carney has just left his meeting with Theresa May, according to Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ed Conway. No news on his future yet, though.... Mark Carney hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been slack at the BoE. Since joining in summer 2013 he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s: Launched a new policy of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcforward guidance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on interest rates, changed it, and now put it on the backburner while Brexit plays out. Kept interest rates on record lows for years, and then cut them to just 0.25% after the referendum Shaken up the Bank of England, by holding open days for the public to have their say Launched Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first plastic banknotes (and dipped one in a pot of curry] Made a series of warnings about the dangers of Brexit before June 23, and had to justify them ever since. Our timeline has the full story: Mark Carney has long been rumoured to fancy a career in politics. And recent events suggests he may have a fine grasp of the dark arts of political spin. The Telegraph\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s James Kirkup argues that Carney has played a blinder this month, by using the attacks from Brexit supporters to spark a debate about his future. The key to the saga is Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s declaration last week that his decision on whether to stay or go in 2018 was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153entirely personal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That sent the hare running.... and it got a second burst of speed when various Carney \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfriends\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 suggested he was leaning towards a return to Canada. Kirkup explains how Carney outfoxed his detractors within Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government: Before the row over his ideological commitment to Brexit blew up, there was a perfectly respectable question to be asked about Mr Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future based on his competence as a central banker. Some of his policies, especially \u00e2\u20ac\u0153forward guidance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about rates, have been less than impressive, leading to confusion instead of the clarity he promised. But the Carney-bashers have allowed that debate to shift from economics into politics, an arena where Mr Carney does rather well. He understood that Mrs May could not afford to have markets and investors (and even some voters) see Brexit Britain as the sort of country where the central bank governor can be purged for failing to pass a political purity test. Simply, it might (just) have been viable to let Mr Carney go for being incompetent, but it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sensible to do so for reasons of politics. The Governor saw that and upped the ante accordingly: he could afford to walk away; could Britain afford to have him go? Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest news story on Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future, by economics editor Larry Elliott: Right, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quickly recap before Mark Carney emerges from his meeting at Number 10 Downing Street. The future of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank chief could be decided soon, following a weekend of speculation that has gripped the City. Mark Carney is meeting with Theresa May now, less than a day after the Financial Times reported that he was ready to serve another three years as Bank of England governor. Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokeswoman has already signalled that the government backs Carney, following several days of criticism from politicians who campaigned for Brexit. The spokeswoman said that Carney was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153absolutely\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the right man to run the BoE, saying: The PM has been clear in her support for the governor, the work he is doing for the country. It is clearly a decision for him, but the PM would certainly be supportive of him going on beyond his five years. The PM has always had a good working relationship with the governor of the Bank of England and intends to continue that. As things stand, Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current contract expires in the summer of 2018, but he has the option of a three-year extension. A string of City investors and economists have argued that Carney should stay on, to provide stability at this time. Prominent voices today include Hendrik Du Toit, the chief executive of Investec Asset Management, former BoE policymaker Adam Posen, and Lothar Mentel, CIO of Tatton Investment Management. But Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s critics insist that the governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation has been damaged by his comments in the run-up to June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum, and his actions since. Daniel Hannan, the MEP who played a key role making Brexit a reality, said Carney has made mistakes at the Bank - and needed to stop acting like a politician. He told the Today Programme that: If he does stay, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on the basis that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the rockstar banker who presumes to tell Scotland how to vote, and [instead he] stays narrowly to his brief. Two Conservative MPs, Nicholas Soames and Anna Soubry, also publicly backed Carney this morning. But the pound remains under pressure, and is now down 0.2% at $1.216. Traders say that the criticism of Carney may have undermined the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence, even if he does decide to stay on until 2021. Mark Carney has arrived at Downing Street, and is meeting with Theresa May right now... just a couple of hours after the PM offered the governor her full support. Could an announcement on his future come today?.... This uncertainty over Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future has come at a bad time, says Costas Milas, professor of finance at the University of Liverpool, in a new blog post. With Britain probably entering a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153increasing economic uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the governor needs to reassure himself that he has Downing Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full support, before deciding whether to extend his tenure until 2012. Milas writes: One of the unwritten rules of football is never substitute a player \u00e2\u20ac\u201c let alone your captain \u00e2\u20ac\u201c when defending a corner. Indeed, with Brexit headwinds moving fast(?) our way, this is not the time to replace the Governor. Mark Carney himself should seek reassurances of no further \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfoul play\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by the government so that he confirms his Governorship until 2021. Unless, of course, government officials have already found a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsuitable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 replacement. But then again, would another candidate be willing to risk their reputation on such a demanding job knowing, or at least suspecting, that their predecessor decided to step down partly because of rising tensions and/or interference by government officials? The pound continues to dip, and is now down 0.2% today at $1.215. October really has been a rough month for sterling. It ended September worth nearly $1.30, but began sliding once Theresa May indicated Britain was heading for a hard Brexit. The pound has now lost over 6.3% during the month, making it the worst performing currency... Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch fear that the row over Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future may have caused long-term damage to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation in the markets. They suspect international investors may still be wary of UK assets, even if the governor announces he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll stay on until 2021. They say: At this stage we are not sure even Carney extending his contract would eliminate the extra policy uncertainty: it may be tricky to undo the impression markets have already formed. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s via fastFT: You might expect the pound to have rallied on the back of Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s show of support for Mark Carney. But actually, sterling is still flat today at $1.2170. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that means traders aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t interested in who runs the Bank of England, though. Instead, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re probably waiting for firm news, and also a little alarmed that an independent central bank governor could have faced a campaign to drive him out. With Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote of confidence in the bag, could Mark Carney announce later today that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to serve a full term at the Bank of England? Sam Coates of The Times reckons the story could now move fast.... The BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Laura Kuenssberg reports that Mark Carney is due to meet the prime minister today, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been in the diary for a while..... Theresa May has just slapped down critics of Mark Carney, such as Dan Hannan, says the Sun\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political editor Tom Newton Dunn: Newsflash from Downing Street: Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokeswoman has just given Mark Carney a resounding vote of confidence. The Prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokeswoman has told Westminster reporters that May is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcclear in her support\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for governor Carney, and the work he is doing for the country. And May would also support Carney if he decided to extend his original contract, and stay at the BoE until 2021 (rather than leaving in 2018, as originally planned). But the governor must decide if he wants to do an extra three years. The spokeswoman says: The PM has been clear in her support for the governor, the work he is doing for the country. It is clearly a decision for him, but the PM would certainly be supportive of him going on beyond his five years. The PM has always had a good working relationship with the governor of the Bank of England and intends to continue that. ITV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris Ship tweets from the Lobby: And asked if Carney was the best man for the job, the spokeswoman said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Absolutely.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Huffington Post\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Paul Waugh says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a significant intervention (following weekend reports that Carney might announce his departure date this week). Political and economic journalist Iain Martin has written a good piece about the Carney saga. He points out that our governor is not above criticism. Carney can appear somewhat thin-skinned when his judgement is questioned (a not-uncommon Achilles heel among central bankers, frankly). But still \u00e2\u20ac\u201c undermining the Bank of England governor is a serious business. Especially when we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also seen cabinet leaks undermining chancellor Philip Hammond (for being too pessimistic about Brexit). Martin says this is the equivalent of playing with matches in a petrol station, at a time when the government should be reassuring the financial markets: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in ravens at the Tower of London territory here with Carney and Hammond. What they symbolise via the authority of their respective offices is stability, relative calm and continuity. Perception and confidence matters, a lot. Tories used to have a better feel for the realities of markets, back when many of them had worked in the City. Now, they seem to think a war on Carney is simply an extension of the Brexit campaign. It is to his credit if he has decided to leave this recent mess in the past and get on with helping guide Britain through Brexit. Just in... America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Treasury Secretary has met with top bankers in London, and told them the US hopes to see a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsmooth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brexit process. Jack Lew also argued that politicians need to use government spending (fiscal policy) to boost growth, rather than simply relying on loose monetary policy (low interest rates). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the official \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcreadout\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from the US Treasury office. During the conversation, Secretary Lew underscored the United States is committed to continuing to work with the UK and the EU to ensure sustained economic stability and shared, global prosperity as the UK and the EU negotiate their future economic relationship. The Secretary reiterated that a transparent, smooth and cooperative process that results in a highly integrated economic relationship is in the best interests of Europe, the United States, and the global economy. Secretary Lew added that the United States remains committed to maintaining its Special Relationship with the UK and its strong partnership with the EU. Secretary Lew noted that U.S. economic growth remains solid in the face of headwinds from the global economy. The Secretary added that, looking forward, it is important that leaders make robust use of all policy levers \u00e2\u20ac\u201cmonetary, fiscal, and structural \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to achieve strong, sustainable, and balanced growth and to ensure that the benefits of growth are shared inclusively within countries. Lew met with Jes Staley (CEO of Barclays), Bill Winters (CEO of Standard Chartered), Xavier Rolet (CEO of the London Stock Exchange), James Cowles (EMEA chief at Citigroup), Mark Gavin (European chairman of JPMorganChase), and Gary Campkin (director of TheCityUK). Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future is becoming a litmus test of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence, says the Reuters Breaking Views team: Back in 2012, chancellor George Osborne described Mark Carney as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the outstanding central banker of his generation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as he announced his appointment to the Bank of England. Historians may make a stronger case for the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mario Draghi (who also has a habit of upsetting politicians), but at the time, Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appointment was pretty well received. Indeed, even arch-critic Dan Hannan hailed the move on Twitter:.... US economist Adam Posen fears that the attacks on Mark Carney will damage the whole concept of Bank of England independence: He tweets: Posen is a former member of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy committee, who now runs the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Newsflash: The eurozone economy grew by 0.3% in the third quarter of 2016. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in line with forecasts, and matches the 0.3% growth in the April-to-June quarter. European politicians will be pleased that growth didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t weaken following the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brexit vote. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still a lacklustre recovery; too slow to drag down the unemployment total. Just in! The number of mortgages approved by UK banks has jumped to their highest level since the EU referendum. Mortgage approvals for house purchases rose to 62,932 in September from 60,984 in August, according to new data from the Bank of England. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the highest since June, beating City forecasts of a decline to 60,150. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the latest sign that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t falling into recession, following last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP figures (which showed growth of 0.5% in the last quarter). Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supporters could argue that this vindicates his decision to ease monetary policy after the referendum. His opponents, though, could claim that it simply shows he was simply too alarmist and pessimistic about Brexit. Without a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccounterfactual\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (an alternative universe where Carney takes a monastic silence in the run-up to the vote, and cowers in his office afterwards), we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll never know for sure.... Kit Juckes, currency expert at French bank Societe Generale, says the speculation that Carney would extend his term until 2021 is preventing the pound sliding today. The FT reports that BOE Governor Mark Carney has told friends he is planning to stay on for his full term. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stopped the rot for sterling, for now. Hendrik Du Toit, the chief executive of Investec Asset Management, has just thrown his weight behind the governor: The speculation over Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future began nearly four weeks ago, when prime minister Theresa May criticised the Bank for keeping interest rates so low. That intervention, during May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech to her party conference, appears to have opened the door for Brexit supporters to take a pop at the governor. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services argues that the spat doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reflect well on the government: The stench of UK Conservative Party internecine warfare hangs over Bank of England governor Carney, serving as a reminder why Mrs May once called the Conservative Party the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnasty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 party. Economist Vicky Pryce, of the Centre for Economics and Business Research, has also defended Carney, arguing that his critics are effectively \u00e2\u20ac\u0153criticising the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She reminded the Today Programme that the BoE helped to stabilise the economy after the EU referendum: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mark Carney was absolutely right to be prepared to do something about Brexit. The economy wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be growing anything like as fast as it is if it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for his very immediate intervention in the markets.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s via the Independent) Reminder: the Bank of England provided more liquidity to banks in June, and then cut interest rates and boosted QE in August. Two Conservative MPs have rallied to Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s side. Sir Nicholas Soames hit out at the governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s critics, such as Dan Hannan, accusing them of undermining the UK. Soames also tweeted yesterday: Fellow Tory Anna Soubry has also criticised Hannan this morning, over his comments on Radio Four today. Dan Hannan MEP, one of Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most robust critics, says the governor needs to behave better if he stays on at the Bank of England. He was speaking on that Today Programme this morning. Q: What would you say to Carney, as he decides whether to leave in 2018 or stay until 2021? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say that if you do stay, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to comport yourself as a quiet and discreet public servant who errs on the side of saying too little. Q: But you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like him to resign? Umm. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up to him. But if he does stay, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on the basis that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the rockstar banker who presumes to tell Scotland how to vote, and [instead he] stays narrowly to his brief. Hannan then argues that Carney has brought the current spat on himself, by violating the independence of the BoE. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to engage in straight-forward political argument, and have views that eerily echo the chancellor who appointed you, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t then argue if you get criticised. Hannan claims his criticism isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t personal - saying Carney did a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpretty good job\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 when he was governor of the Bank of Canada. But then he puts the knife in, saying: As a matter of observable fact, he has tended to get things wrong. He cites Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s famous \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcforward guidance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, when he said he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d consider raising interest rates when unemployment fell to 7%, then when real wages started to rise, but he never did.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 He said during the campaign that if we voted leave, unemployment would rise and the economy would stall As a matter of observable fact, unemployment has fallen since the vote and the economy expanded by 0.5% since the vote. Sir Martin Sorrell, the boss of advertising giant WPP, has revealed he wants Mark Carney to remain at the BoE. He told the BBC Breakfast that the governor has handled the aftermath of the EU referendum well: If Mark Carney stays as Bank of England governor, which I really hope he will do, that will help. His prompt action post the Brexit vote I think softened the blow of Brexit. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index of leading shares has dipped in early trading, down 25 points at 6972. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nervousness ahead of the US presidential election, especially given the new FBI inquiry into Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s emails, as well as chatter about Mark Carney. And the oil price is also down, with Brent crude dropping 0.5% to $49.53 after a group of non-Opec members didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree any production cuts at a weekend meeting. Sterling could strengthen if Mark Carney commits to serve a full eight year term at the Bank of England, says Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index She says: The US election saga has been garnering all of the headlines this weekend until one popped up from the FT, which is reporting that Mark Carney is willing to serve an 8-year term at the BOE. This is big news for UK assets, the pound had a mini pop higher during the Asian session, but there could be more to come. If this story is true, then it is a beacon of stability during a period of uncertainty for the UK economy, which should benefit the currency and stocks alike. Brooks reckons the pound could rally back toward $1.25. But she also reminds us that Carney was once dubbed an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, after rejigging his \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcforward guidance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on when he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d raise interest rates. We need confirmation from the BOE that he is staying before we get too giddy with excitement that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd has finally committed to the Old Lady*. * - that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOld Lady of Threadneedle Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122; an old nickname for the BoE The pound jumped back over the $1.22 mark overnight after the Financial Times reported that Mark Carney was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcready to serve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 until 2021. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now dipped a little, to around $1.219, as investors await fresh developments. IHS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, Howard Archer, believes Carney needs to put an end to this speculation soon: The Daily Telegraph\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s international business editor, Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, argues that Britain needs Mark Carney right now: Kleinwort Benson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief investment officer, Mouhammed Choukeir, also believes the City wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be happy if governor Carney quit in 2018. He tells Bloomberg TV that: If Carney were to leave right now, it would add another level of uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.which the market is trying to avoid right now. Q: But hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credibility been damaged by his warnings ahead of the Brexit vote? Choukeir argues that Carney was actually doing the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcprudent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 thing, but this has now turned into a political debate. Lothar Mentel, CIO of Tatton Investment Management, says investors would be very concerned if Mark Carney chooses to leave the Bank of England in 2018. Carney is one of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stabilising factors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd we have in the UK, Mentel tells Bloomberg TV. He thinks the City would be reassured if the governor chooses to extend his term by three years, to 2021. Mentel says: If he decided to go that would be a very, very strong signal that there is not enough support from politicians.... I think the markets would take it quite negatively Mentel adds that the pound could take \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcanother leg down\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and suffer new losses if Carney chose to walk away in two years. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one main topic of conversation in the foggy streets of the City this morning; is Mark Carney going to be driven out by his opponents in the pro-Brexit camp? Yesterday, several UK newspapers reported that Carney was poised to turn down the option of staying at the Bank of England until 2021. Instead, he would simply leave the governorship in summer 2018, when his current five-year term ends. The Sunday Times, for example, declared that: Mark Carney may announce within days that he is to quit his job as governor of the Bank of England amid signs he has become a controversial figure in the post-Brexit debate. Senior City figures who know the governor said they believed it was more likely than not that he would choose to return to Canada in 2018, adding that his family\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s feelings were a concern. He has the option of leaving five years after his appointment, which was in July 2013, or staying for the full eight-year term. Suggestions that he could leave before 2018 were firmly rejected. Earlier this year, Carney suggested he could well stay on until 2021. But since then, he has faced steady, rising criticism from the Leave campaign, following his pre-referendum warnings that a Brexit vote could push the UK into an immediate recession. MEP Daniel Hannan, for example, argues that Carney should quit for having politicised the governorship. Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg and former chancellor Lord Lawson have also criticised him. But late last night, the Financial Times dramatically reported that Carney was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ready to serve\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a full eight-year term (assuming the government want him to, of course). The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris Giles says: Mr Carney is said to be leaning strongly towards staying in his post. He would like to help steer the UK economy through treacherous waters once the government triggers Article 50 in March 2017, starting a two-year clock on divorce negotiations with Brussels. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mid-2018 could be the darkest days for the UK,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said a person familiar with the governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thinking. The issue is likely to dominate this week, as the Bank of England is presenting its quarterly inflation report on Thursday. Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference, at 12.30pm, will be unmissable... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The new week has started with some bad economic news from Germany. German retail sales have fallen at their fastest pace in two years, suggesting that consumer confidence in Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy may be weakening. Retail sales slid by 1.4% in September, missing expectations of a 0.2% rise. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a worrying sign, with Brexit continuing to cast a shadow over Europe. These retail sales figure can be volatile. But Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, thinks we should be concerned: The sentiment is very negative over in Europe and the economic data out of Germany made things even more worse. The retail sales data out of Germany was well below the expectations raising concerns about the domestic growth in the country. The retail sales data always tells us the story about the health of the economy That sets the scene for the main event of the morning; the eurozone GDP reading for the third quarter of 2016. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s due at 10am. Economists expect quarterly growth of 0.3%, which would count as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsteady but unspectacular\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. On Friday, we learned that France only grew by 0.2%, while Spain looked healthier with 0.7% growth. On the corporate front, advertising group WPP is reporting results. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",
