This Bern-based firm, which also uses a branch office in Luxembourg, is at the heart of eBay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most significant operations outside of the US. It holds the key to hundreds of millions of dollars in tax savings the online auction group enjoys each year.</p> <p>Like Google, Apple and other hi-tech multinationals, eBay routes income from customers in many of its largest markets, including the UK, through a European sales hub located in a tax-friendly country. The income can then flow into further controversial tax structures that ultimately wipe huge sums off the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax bills. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/01/uk-losing-millions-vat-non-eu-sellers-amazon-ebay\">UK losing millions in VAT from non-EU sellers on Amazon and eBay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last year, the then British chancellor George Osborne introduced a new punitive tax, known as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/29/googles-tax-deal-with-the-uk-key-questions-answered-chancellor-taxes\">diverted profits tax</a>, designed to target tech businesses artificially shifting UK revenues abroad.

                "bodyText":"Online retailer eBay paid just \u00c2\u00a31.1m in tax in the UK last year, despite telling US investors that Britain was its second largest market, generating revenues of $1.4bn (\u00c2\u00a31.1bn). The company appears to have reduced its tax bill by using a corporate structure that routes advertising fees from hundreds of thousands of British sellers through an overseas company, according to UK filings. The group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main UK unit reported revenues of just \u00c2\u00a3185m last year and tax of only \u00c2\u00a31.1m. Latest accounts for eBay (UK) Ltd, which employs 372 staff, many of them at offices in Richmond, west London, confirm the British subsidiary does not receive a penny of the fees paid by UK sellers that advertise goods on eBay.co.uk. Instead, the UK company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revenues come from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the provision of services to eBay International AG\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, its Swiss parent company. This Bern-based firm, which also uses a branch office in Luxembourg, is at the heart of eBay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most significant operations outside of the US. It holds the key to hundreds of millions of dollars in tax savings the online auction group enjoys each year. Like Google, Apple and other hi-tech multinationals, eBay routes income from customers in many of its largest markets, including the UK, through a European sales hub located in a tax-friendly country. The income can then flow into further controversial tax structures that ultimately wipe huge sums off the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax bills. Last year, the then British chancellor George Osborne introduced a new punitive tax, known as the diverted profits tax, designed to target tech businesses artificially shifting UK revenues abroad. He said such practice had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153abused the trust of the British people\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It later emerged, however, that while some companies, such as Amazon and Facebook, said they would change their tax structures, others \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including Google \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have continued to book UK sales overseas. Last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accounts for Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main UK subsidiary have been filed with Companies House and are due to be released shortly. However, changes to the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s British tax structure are not likely to be apparent from company filings until figures for 2016 are released next year. Figures for 2016 are expected to show a dramatic jump in revenues as income from Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest UK advertisers started to be booked in the UK business for the first time. Some experts, however, have suggested there may not be a huge jump in Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK taxes because of other factors. Latest accounts from eBay (UK) Ltd, published on Friday, suggest the group believes its UK tax structure remains advantageous, despite Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supposed crackdown. When asked by the Guardian whether it was in discussions with HMRC about the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new diverted profits tax, eBay declined to comment. In a statement, it said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In all countries and at all times, eBay is fully compliant with national, EU and international tax rules.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yet again, it seems like another multinational company thinks it can play by different rules to the rest of us. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Tories have dragged their feet for years and voted against tough action to make it harder for firms to avoid UK tax. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time they followed Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead and started taking corporate tax avoidance seriously.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In its annual report, the US parent company eBay Inc confirms that certain subsidiaries have secured favourable tax rulings from authorities in Luxembourg and Switzerland.

                "body":"<p>US telecoms giant AT&amp;T is reportedly in advanced talks to acquire Time Warner, the media company whose star assets include HBO, Warner Brothers and CNN.</p> <p>A deal could come as early as this weekend, according to the Wall Street Journal. Both companies declined to comment.</p> <p>A merger of the two firms would come as telecoms companies have shown an increasing interest in media and tech takeovers. Verizon is currently in negotiations to buy Yahoo and has already bought AOL, owner of Huffington Post.</p> <p>AT&amp;T, the second largest wireless telecoms company in the US behind Verizon, owns a portfolio of mobile, broadband and satellite TV services that it promotes using Time Warner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s entertainment assets, among others.</p> <p>But a deal to buy the Time Warner empire would rival the last major telecoms and media merger, Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2011 takeover of NBCUniversal. It would also awaken memories of another, ill-fated, Time Warner takeover. <br></p> <p>In 2001 AOL took over Time Warner in a deal now regarded as one of the worst mergers in history. It took a decade to unwind the transaction.</p> <p>Time Warner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price rose 9% on the news while AT&amp;T\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dipped close to 3%. Time Warner is valued at $73.5bn, AT&amp;T is valued at $227bn.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eX3u0IlBBO4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eX3u0IlBBO4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Brian Wieser, lead researcher at analytics firm Pivotal, said that the deal was a possibility but would present the new entity with potentially insurmountable difficulties. </p> <p>Wieser said that while the marriage of a producer and a distributor might at first look similar to the successful Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, an AT&amp;T-Time Warner entity presented unique challenges. Other entities, he said, made more sense for the always-a-bridesmaid Time Warner. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153DirecTV and Time Warner in a lot of ways is more similar than Time Warner and AT&amp;T.

                "bodyText":"US telecoms giant AT&amp;T is reportedly in advanced talks to acquire Time Warner, the media company whose star assets include HBO, Warner Brothers and CNN. A deal could come as early as this weekend, according to the Wall Street Journal. Both companies declined to comment. A merger of the two firms would come as telecoms companies have shown an increasing interest in media and tech takeovers. Verizon is currently in negotiations to buy Yahoo and has already bought AOL, owner of Huffington Post. AT&amp;T, the second largest wireless telecoms company in the US behind Verizon, owns a portfolio of mobile, broadband and satellite TV services that it promotes using Time Warner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s entertainment assets, among others. But a deal to buy the Time Warner empire would rival the last major telecoms and media merger, Comcast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2011 takeover of NBCUniversal. It would also awaken memories of another, ill-fated, Time Warner takeover. In 2001 AOL took over Time Warner in a deal now regarded as one of the worst mergers in history. It took a decade to unwind the transaction. Time Warner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price rose 9% on the news while AT&amp;T\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dipped close to 3%. Time Warner is valued at $73.5bn, AT&amp;T is valued at $227bn. Brian Wieser, lead researcher at analytics firm Pivotal, said that the deal was a possibility but would present the new entity with potentially insurmountable difficulties. Wieser said that while the marriage of a producer and a distributor might at first look similar to the successful Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, an AT&amp;T-Time Warner entity presented unique challenges. Other entities, he said, made more sense for the always-a-bridesmaid Time Warner. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153DirecTV and Time Warner in a lot of ways is more similar than Time Warner and AT&amp;T. It looks like a hedge against the commoditization of infrastructure.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Cash rich telecoms companies like AT&amp;T are facing a crisis as their wireless businesses reach maturity and fixed line income continues to erode. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153AT&amp;T is an acquisition machine and interested in empire preservation if nothing else,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Wieser. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Time Warner has always been for sale at the right price.

                "bodyText":"Time for a recap, after a very busy few hours. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has defied fears that it would be dragged into an immediate recession following the EU referendum. The first official healthcheck of growth in the last quarter showed that GDP rose by 0.5% between July and September. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slower than the 0.7% recorded in April-June but faster than expected. The services sector provided all the expansion, though, with growth of 0.8%. Manufacturing, construction and agriculture all shrank, showing that the UK economy remains unbalanced. Interestingly, film and production provided a major boost to growth. That suggests Britain is benefitting from the new wave of streaming services: Chancellor Philip Hammond welcomed the news, saying it shows the UK economy is resilient as it begins Brexit negotiations. But a series of economists have warned that growth will slow further in 2017. Higher inflation will eat into real wages too. In another boost, Nissan has announced new investment plans for its Sunderland plant. The move guarantees 7,000 jobs, and eases concerns that production could be moved to France. Prime minister Theresa May says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a vote of confidence in the UK. But what has the government offered Nissan? Ministers are refusing to give details, but that hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stopped the wider car industry seeking guarantees against damage from Brexit. Labour have warned the government against carving up deals behind closed doors, and instead provide a comprehensive plan for Brexit. And over in Brussels, Wallonia has dropped its opposition to Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new trade deal with Canada. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today, unless anything else major happens. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow with more live coverage, including growth figures for France and the US. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Greg Clarke, the UK business secretary, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t revealing what the government has promised to Nissan. According to my colleague Peter Walker, Clarke just waffled through half a dozen questions on the World At One, despite being repeatedly asked if Nissan has been given a deal. The best we got out of Clarke is this nugget: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no question of financial compensation over tariffs, because we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve said that what is necessary is that we are going to maintain the competitiveness of the sector. But otherwise, it was like a rerun of Just A Minute (but without the humour). Keep an eye on Politics Live for more reaction: Bang on cue.... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car industry is demanding assurance that it will be protected from any trade tariffs or migration curbs following the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement is good news for UK Automotive and jobs, confirming Britain as a leader in automotive production. To secure this position, however, we need government to provide public assurance to investors that our advantages will be maintained \u00e2\u20ac\u201c namely, a competitive business environment, the ability to recruit talent from abroad and the continuation of all the benefits of the single market as we leave the EU.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carlos Ghosn is clutching a piece of paper, promising help from the government if Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU hurts Nissan. So says Reuters, which reports: Britain has given Nissan a written commitment of extra support in the event that Brexit reduces the competitiveness of its Sunderland plant, in return for new production investments by the Japanese carmaker, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. In addition to unconditional investment aid, Britain pledged in a letter to offer further relief if the terms of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European Union exit ended up harming the plant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance, the source said. That explains why Nisson has committed to making the Qashqai and the X-Trail in Sunderland. But surely other carmakers are going to want a similar deal, as Buzzfeed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alberto Nardelli tweets: Our political reporter Jessica Elgot has full details of Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reaction to Nissan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement: John McDonnell, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow chancellor, criticised the deal done with Nissan as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153chaotic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd strategy. In a speech where he had criticised the government for appearing to prioritise financial services over manufacturing and small businesses, said there had been no public discussion of the deal hashed out for the car maker. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We know nothing about it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Are they literally going to decide factory by factory which one gets support? We have to have a comprehensive plan, and this is chaos at the moment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are trying to get a consensus and heal the divisions the referendum brought and we cannot do that with secret deals behind closed doors. It will divide our country once more. The first deal looked like it would be protecting financial services, paid for by others. And now with Nissan, other manufacturers are saying what are we going to get? We have to have a comprehensive plan. What we need is more openness and transparency and accountability.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Unite union are understandably delighted that the 7,000 Nissan jobs in Sunderland are safe, along with thousands more in the supply chain. Unite assistant general secretary Tony Burke says it recognises the UK car industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s world-leading status. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nissan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision is a massive vote of confidence in the skills and expertise of a world-class workforce and testament to their hard work which has made the Sunderland plant one of the most productive in the Nissan family. Burke says the government must now secure tariff-free access to the single market, to help all UK car markets. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Labour MP Matthew Pennycook on the Nissan announcement: More news! The deadlock in Belgium that was preventing the EU signing a trade deal with Canada has been broken! Prime Minister Charles Michel has declared that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an agreement\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd has been reached with the French-speaking communities in Wallonia who sensationally blocked the deal last week. Cecilia Malmstr\u00c3\u00b6m, the Eu trade commissioner, says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an important breakthrough, that could mean the deal can now be signed. Unfortunately, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau has already cancelled his trip to Brussels to sign the deal. (he was due to land today). And he needn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pack his suitcase just yet. European Council chief Donald Tusk says he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be in touch until all the paperwork is definitely ready. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about Nissan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new commitment to Sunderland: John McDonnell, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow chancellor, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed that Nissan have apparently cut a deal to stay in Sunderland. Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Faisal Islam has the details: Nissan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprise announcement came just as McDonnell was giving a speech about the economy, which is rather bad luck for Labour (unless the dark arts of political spin are in play...). Our Politics Live blog has been tracking it though: Prime minister Theresa May says Nissan has given Britain a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vote of confidence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but she doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reveal what promises she has given the carmaker..... Conservative MP Michael Fabricant is rather pleased by Nissan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official! The next Qashqai will indeed be build in Sunderland, despite the uncertainty over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future. Nissan is also pledging to build its next 4x4 X-Trail vehicle there too. And the company also confirms that Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government has given a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccommitment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that the plant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s competitiveness won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be damaged by Brexit. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the official statement: Nissan Motor Company Ltd. today announced, following its Executive Committee meeting, that it will produce the next Qashqai and will add production of the next X-Trail model at its Sunderland, U.K. Plant. Nissan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision follows the U.K. government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commitment to ensure that the Sunderland plant remains competitive. As a result, Nissan will increase its investment in Sunderland, securing and sustaining the jobs of more than 7,000 workers at the plant. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am pleased to announce that Nissan will continue to invest in Sunderland. Our employees there continue to make the plant a globally competitive powerhouse, producing high-quality, high-value products every day,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Carlos Ghosn, Chairman and CEO of Nissan. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The support and assurances of the U.K. government enabled us to decide that the next-generation Qashqai and X-Trail will be produced at Sunderland. I welcome British Prime Minister Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commitment to the automotive industry in Britain and to the development of an overall industrial strategy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Nissan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sunderland plant opened in 1986 and has produced almost 9 million cars since. One in three British cars are produced in Sunderland, which is the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest car plant of all time. In addition, 80% of production from Sunderland is exported to over 130 international markets. More than 2 million Qashqai\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s have been built in Sunderland in less than 10 years. In addition to the 7,000 direct employees at Sunderland, the plant supports a further 28,000 British automotive supply chain jobs. To date, Nissan has invested more than \u00c2\u00a33.7 billion in Sunderland. Sunderland voted decisively to leave the EU back in June, by 61% to 39%. So Brexit voters may feel vindicated by Nissan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision not to move Qashqai production abroad. Paul Brand of ITV tweets: Downing Street will be very pleased by Nissan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move, says City AM editor Christian May. Has Nissan managed to get the UK government to promise compensation, if the EU imposes tax barriers on car imports after Brexit? CEO Carlos Ghosn was pretty clear that he wanted protection from any new tariffs, once Britain leaves the European Union. After meeting Theresa May on October 14, Ghosn said: If there are tax barriers being established on cars, you have to have a commitment for car-makers who export to Europe that there is some kind of compensation. The BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Simon Jack says that Nissan has received \u00e2\u20ac\u0153support and assurances\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government, encouraging it to build the new Qashqai in Sunderland. The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Peter Campbell predicts an official announcement soon: Reuters are reporting that Nissan, the Japanese carmaker, has decided that it will build its next Qashqai SUV in Sunderland. That would be a significant boost for the region, and one of the first major investment decisions since June. The Nissan plant at Sunderland employs around 7,000 people, and is Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest car factory. Last week Nissan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive Carlos Ghosn met prime minister Theresa May, and warned that his company could stop investing at Sunderland unless it was protected from any adverse impact from the Brexit vote. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve called Nissan for comment..... Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth report shows that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexit bogeyman\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet been as scary as initially feared, says Nancy Curtin, Chief Investment Officer at Close Brothers Asset Management. She writes: Any lingering concerns over an immediate collapse in growth in 2016 have been officially put to bed, with output continuing to grow in the first major assessment of domestic activity post-referendum. Supportive monetary policy has played a part, while the softer pound has kept factory orders ticking along. These, along with robust consumption, will be key levers of growth. But Curtin also predicts a slowdown next year: The quarter on quarter slowdown in the growth rate suggests Brexit uncertainty is having some bite, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely the ambiguity around the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU will take some of the steam out of the long-term growth rate, with anaemic growth likely to become status quo while Article 50 negotiations rumble on. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve quickly truffled through today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP report to get some colour on how the UK economy performed 1) Services: The only sector to grow, by a punchy 0.8%. All four sub-sectors expanded (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s distribution, hotels and restaurants; transport, storage and communication; business services and finance; and government and other services). Growth was particularly strong in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153motion picture, video and TV programme production, sound recording and music publishing activities, and computer programming industries\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, apparent.y 2) Industrial production: It suffered a 0.4% contraction. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mainly because manufacturing output shrank by a whole 1%. Energy supply fell by 3.6%, water and waste management dropped by 0.2%, while mining and quarrying increased by 5.2% 3) Construction: Output fell by 1.4%, which is the biggest decline since 2012. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly because construction of new housing fell, for the first time in a year. 4) Agriculture: Philip Hammond has also told the BBC that the UK economy is looking strong, as the EU exit talks loom: TUC general secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady says the government needs to do more to help UK manufacturing (which contracted by 1% after the Brexit vote): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet say what impact Brexit will have on our economy, but these figures show there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no room for complacency. British manufacturing is still struggling, and now faces real uncertainty following the vote to leave the EU. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government must use next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Autumn Statement to boost Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs and wages. This means investing in infrastructure like roads, rail and homes, and raising the national minimum wage.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP report is an important measure of the health of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy after June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s historic referendum. But several economists say the real test of the Brexit vote will come in 2017, not today. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PwC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Andrew Sentance: Geoffrey Yu, head of UK Investment Office at UBS Wealth Management, predicts that growth will keep slowing: Anecdotal evidence supports the view that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re yet to see any meaningful damage as a result of the Brexit vote, at least in the short-term. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Of course, we should not overlook the lingering sense of uncertainty. Though the economy has fared better than initially feared, we expect that economic growth will slow down relative to the early part of this year. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the international payments company World First, says we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have a better picture once Theresa May has triggered article 50: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have called the UK consumer a hardy beast in the past and in Q3 the beast was back. The services sector singlehandedly drove growth to a 15th consecutive positive quarter and while the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclittle evidence of a pronounced effect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from the Brexit vote is being seen yet, we think that it will be as gradually obvious as the year comes to an end. The beast will tire as inflation fires arrows at its increasingly weakening hide.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Thomas Laskey of Aberdeen Asset Management argues that the Bank of England should get some credit for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth report: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The data shows that the UK economy fared well in the aftermath of the EU referendum. It confirms what most investors thought: that sentiment bounced back after the initial shock of the result. Growth was fairly strong, at least in part because the Bank of England restarted its bond buying programme and the fact that changes to investment plans take time to play out. But he predicts slower growth next year: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The outlooks for growth is pretty uncertain. Brexit has the potential to be extremely costly to the UK and the country could be poorer as a result. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already seen this reflected in sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dramatic drop. Growth will probably slow as import costs increase and people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s incomes fall as inflation rises. We are not out of the woods yet by any means.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd You can see the GDP report online, here: Gross Domestic Product, preliminary estimate: July to Sept 2016 Chancellor Philip Hammond says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report shows that the UK economy is resilient, and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwell-placed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to deal with the challenges and opportunities created by the EU referendum. We are moving into a period of negotiations with the EU and we are determined to get the very best deal for households and businesses. The economy will need to adjust to a new relationship with the EU, but we are well-placed to deal with the challenges and take advantage of opportunities ahead.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Anyone remember George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to rebalance the economy and create a March of the Makers? Five year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s later, Britain is as dependent on service sector growth as ever: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has now grown for 15 quarters in a row, and is 8.2% higher than the pre-economic downturn peak in early 2008. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report shows that Britain has not suffered a Brexit shock, according to Joe Grice, head of the Office for National Statistics. Grice says: There is little evidence of a pronounced effect in the immediate aftermath of the vote\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound has rallied a little, to $1.225, as traders welcome the GDP report. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector, which makes up three quarters of the economy, is the only part which grew in the last three months. Service sector output grew by 0.8% in July-September. Construction shrank by 1.4% Agriculture shrank bu 0.7% Industrial production shrank by 0.4% And manufacturing (part of production) shrank by 1% At first glance, this report suggests that the UK economy has shrugged off the immediate shock of the EU referendum. It has grown faster than predicted in the gloomier forecasts ahead of June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote. Remember, the Treasury said the economy would shrink by 0.1% after a Brexit vote. On an annual basis, the UK economy grew by 2.3% during the last quarter. Again, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stronger than expected. HERE WE GO! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by 0.5% in the three months after the Brexit vote. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down from 0.7% in the second quarter of 2016, showing that growth has slowed. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also stronger than the 0.3% which economists has expected. More to follow! The pound has risen back to $1.224... Tension is building, with just four minutes until we learn how the UK economy performed after the EU referendum.... Back in April, the Treasury claimed that the economy would shrink by 0.1% for four quarters in a row, if Britain voted to leave the EU. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP report is the first test of that assessment.... [UPDATE: This forecast may have assumed Britain had triggered Article 50 immediately after the referendum]. A flash of good news from Madrid: the Spanish unemployment rate hit its lowest level since 2009 in the last quarter. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still 18.9%, despite a surge in summer hiring to handle the tourist trade. Economist Rupert Seggins has tweeted a nice graph, showing how uncertainty spiked after the referendum,but has been dropping to less jittery levels since. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Q3 growth report is only \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpreliminary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mainly based on data from July and August. That makes it harder to predict, says Jeremy Cook of World First: Surveys are suggesting a number between 0.1% and 0.4% with consensus estimates looking for a figure of around 0.3% but this is the muddiest figure we will have seen in a while given the collapse in expectations in July and the rebound in August. Manufacturing may be optimistic but services are not sharing in that joy. The pound has dropped by almost half a cent this morning, to $1.2202, as traders await the UK GDP report. Just 45 minutes until we get the UK GDP report for the last quarter! Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Maxime Sbaihi predicts it will get a mixed reception: Although the City consensus is that UK growth fell to 0.3% in the last quarter, some forecasts are plumping for a rosier +0.4%. Ross Finley of Reuters has the details: HSBC are in the camp predicting that UK growth dipped to 0.3% in the last three months. But they aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ruling out a higher figure, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The U.K. economy has held up in Q3, defying expectations of a pronounced uncertainty-driven slowdown following the referendum. Given fairly robust indicators, our forecast is for growth of 0.3% qoq, with risks to the upside.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, has warned that the uncertainty over Brexit is bad for the economy. Speaking on Bloomberg, Lagarde says firms want to know whether London-based banks will lose their rights to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpassport\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 services across the EU single market. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future trade deals are another question mark, making it harder for companies to invest and create jobs. This uncertainty is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not healthy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Lagarde. But she does welcome the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commitment to trigger article 50 by the end of March 2017. One thing we know now is the timetable. So for the next two and a half years nothing changes, but everything is changed. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get too excited if today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP report shows that the economy is still growing, says Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index. She predicts that consumer spending will provide the bulk of the growth in the last quarter, as industry and construction struggles over the summer Industrial production has fallen sharply in recent months; it fell by 0.4% in August. Construction is facing a steeper decline, the latest Office for National Statistics data on construction output has fallen 2% since June. In contrast, the service sector PMI bounced back after a sharp decline in service sector sentiment in July. We expect this pattern to be repeated in the Q3 GDP report. And Brooks also fears that 2017 will be tough, as higher inflation eats into real wages. The Bank of England has slashed its growth forecasts for 2017 to a mere 0.8%, compared with 2.2% for 2016. Consultancy firm PWC is forecasting a gloomier outcome at 0.6% for 2017. The biggest risk for UK growth is a sharp slowdown in business investment that could become more pronounced in the coming months, once the UK government has triggered Article 50. If the UK looks set to lose its access to the single market, then we may see the consumer show signs of stress, which could knock the UK economy seriously off course, and potentially plunge us into recession. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP figures are the most eagerly awaited since the British economy returned to growth four years ago. Eric Lascelles, chief economist at RBC Global Asset Management, says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is an extremely high stakes report \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the British economy appears to have been surprisingly resilient to the Brexit upset. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To be clear, some economic damage is still expected, if not of a recession-inducing magnitude.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s via Bloomberg, who reckon the report will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153swing the mood of consumers and provide a tool for politicians pushing their view on how tough to be when it comes to actually removing the U.K. from the EU\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Good morning. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re about to find out how well, or badly, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy fared in the immediate aftermath of June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s historic vote to quit the European Union. At 9.30am, the Office for National Statistics will whip the official growth figures for the third quarter of this year out of its hat. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expecting to learn that the economy slowed sharply in the July to September quarter. But, GDP probably didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go into reverse, despite fears that a Brexit vote would trigger an immediate recession. Economists predict that the quarterly growth rate probably slowed to around 0.3%, or perhaps 0.4%, down from a healthier 0.7% in the April-June quarter. That would mean that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has been growing for 15th consecutive quarters. The breakdown of the GDP report will also show how the service sector, manufacturers and construction firms all fared during the last quarter. The figures are likely to shift the pound, and move the stock markets, especially if growth is markedly stronger or weaker than the City expects. Other data released since June has suggested that the economy has taken the uncertainty pretty well, with the unemployment rate sticking at 4.9% and consumer spending resilient. As RBC Capital Markets put it: It does seem that the impact of the referendum won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been as immediate as we and many others had initially expected. But, the true impact of Brexit will be seen over years, of course, not months, as Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit tweets: GDP is obviously the main event. But we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also keep an eye on financial results from Barclays and Deutsche Bank, plus cider maker C&amp;C, retailer Debenhams and telecoms group BT.",

Leaving the EU will also significantly diminish the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capacity to influence EU policy on key sectors of the U.K. economy, such as financial services, that are vital to the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic performance.</p> <p>Brexit could also, over time, diminish sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role as a global reserve currency. Since the referendum, sterling has depreciated against the dollar by more than 17%, at one point reaching a 31-year low.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3083964fca582527138f7bfbec22541e4a340740\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3083964fca582527138f7bfbec22541e4a340740/164_2_2073_1244/1000.jpg\" alt=\"UK prime minister Theresa May in Parliament this week\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">UK prime minister Theresa May in Parliament this week</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>In early October, Prime Minister Theresa May announced that the government will invoke Article 50 of the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Lisbon Treaty no later than March 2017. This decision will be followed by at least two years of negotiations on the terms of EU departure. While two years may suffice to negotiate a successor treaty that will have to be endorsed by European national parliaments and the European parliament, and could face referendums in one or more member states, the process could take much longer.</p> <p>The risks of an inconclusive or detrimental outcome are also material. While some believe the U.K. can arrive at a beneficial agreement with the EU, others take the view that the remaining EU members will have no incentive to accommodate the U.K. Rather, their focus will be on detering other potential departures and containing the rise of their own national eurosceptic movements.</p> <p>In particular, it is not clear if the EU will permit the U.K. access to the single market on existing tariff-free terms, or impose tariffs on U.K. products. Further arrangements regarding the export of services, including by the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important financial services industry, are even more uncertain, in our view.</p> <p>Given that curtailing immigration was a major motivating issue for leave voters, it is also uncertain whether the U.K. would agree to a trade deal that requires the country to accept the free movement of labor from the EU. The negotiation process is therefore fraught with potential challenges and vetos, making the outcome unpredictable.</p> <p>We also believe that the divisions, both within the ruling Conservative Party and society as a whole over the European question, may not heal quickly and may hamper government stability and complicate policymaking on economic and other matters.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a64b67309f7f2c0444f9b0e1b8f06fa12cd3c9c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a64b67309f7f2c0444f9b0e1b8f06fa12cd3c9c5/0_39_1638_1165/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon .\" width=\"1000\" height=\"711\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon .</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>In addition, we take the view that the Scottish National Party will push for another referendum on Scottish independence, given that the Scottish population voted overwhelmingly in favor of remaining within the EU. Such a move will have consequences for the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s constitutional and economic integrity. Northern Ireland is another source of potential issues.</p> <p>These multiple and significant challenges will be very demanding and will detract from macroeconomic goals, such as maintaining growth and consolidating public finances. The lack of clarity while negotiations ensue will also significantly deter private investment. At the same time, we continue to recognize many of the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s institutional strengths. </p> <p>The U.K. benefits from its flexible and open economy and, in our view, has prospered as an EU member. We believe that the U.K. economy has been able to attract higher inflows of low-cost capital and skilled labor than it would have without the preferential access that EU membership delivers. In our opinion, significant net immigration into the U.K. over the past decade helped its economic performance.

                "bodyText":"And back with Uber, here is our roundup of the tribunal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments, from Shane Hickey: On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back next week. And on whether and when it might chance its views, S&amp;P said: We could lower the rating if we conclude that sterling will lose its status as a reserve currency or if public finances or GDP per capita weaken markedly beyond our current expectations. In addition, we could lower our ratings if significant constitutional issues arise and create further financial and economic uncertainty. We could revise the outlook to stable if investment and economic growth remain above our expectations, while negotiations with the EU prove amicable and not significantly detrimental to the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy and trade. S&amp;P is also forecasting a slowdown in the UK from next year: Given Brexit uncertainties and the likely fall in investment, we are forecasting a slowdown in 2017-2019, with GDP growth averaging 1%. The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s asset purchase plan and the Monetary Policy Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to reduce the base rate have helped growth in the short term, but we expect reduced investment to begin to weigh on growth over our forecast period. Warming to its theme, S&amp;P added: The negative outlook reflects our opinion that the recent decision to exit the European Union (the destination for 44% of the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goods and services exports) poses a potential risk to the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national income, as well as its fiscal and external balances. We also see heightened risks of a deterioration in external financing conditions in light of the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high gross external financing requirements (as a share of current account receipts and usable reserves). Complex and protracted negotiations between the U.K. and the EU could, in our opinion, pressure the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial services sector (which is a major contributor to employment and public receipts). We also think Brexit could create challenging constitutional issues if it results in a second referendum on Scottish independence. Leaving the EU will also significantly diminish the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capacity to influence EU policy on key sectors of the U.K. economy, such as financial services, that are vital to the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic performance. Brexit could also, over time, diminish sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role as a global reserve currency. Since the referendum, sterling has depreciated against the dollar by more than 17%, at one point reaching a 31-year low. In early October, Prime Minister Theresa May announced that the government will invoke Article 50 of the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Lisbon Treaty no later than March 2017. This decision will be followed by at least two years of negotiations on the terms of EU departure. While two years may suffice to negotiate a successor treaty that will have to be endorsed by European national parliaments and the European parliament, and could face referendums in one or more member states, the process could take much longer. The risks of an inconclusive or detrimental outcome are also material. While some believe the U.K. can arrive at a beneficial agreement with the EU, others take the view that the remaining EU members will have no incentive to accommodate the U.K. Rather, their focus will be on detering other potential departures and containing the rise of their own national eurosceptic movements. In particular, it is not clear if the EU will permit the U.K. access to the single market on existing tariff-free terms, or impose tariffs on U.K. products. Further arrangements regarding the export of services, including by the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important financial services industry, are even more uncertain, in our view. Given that curtailing immigration was a major motivating issue for leave voters, it is also uncertain whether the U.K. would agree to a trade deal that requires the country to accept the free movement of labor from the EU. The negotiation process is therefore fraught with potential challenges and vetos, making the outcome unpredictable. We also believe that the divisions, both within the ruling Conservative Party and society as a whole over the European question, may not heal quickly and may hamper government stability and complicate policymaking on economic and other matters. In addition, we take the view that the Scottish National Party will push for another referendum on Scottish independence, given that the Scottish population voted overwhelmingly in favor of remaining within the EU. Such a move will have consequences for the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s constitutional and economic integrity. Northern Ireland is another source of potential issues. These multiple and significant challenges will be very demanding and will detract from macroeconomic goals, such as maintaining growth and consolidating public finances. The lack of clarity while negotiations ensue will also significantly deter private investment. At the same time, we continue to recognize many of the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s institutional strengths. The U.K. benefits from its flexible and open economy and, in our view, has prospered as an EU member. We believe that the U.K. economy has been able to attract higher inflows of low-cost capital and skilled labor than it would have without the preferential access that EU membership delivers. In our opinion, significant net immigration into the U.K. over the past decade helped its economic performance. EU membership has also enhanced London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position as a global financial center. The ratings agency said: In our opinion, Brexit presents a significant risk to the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s track record of strong economic performance, and to its large financial sector in particular. The leave result has also led to a less predictable and stable policy framework for the U.K... The outlook remains negative, reflecting the continued institutional and economic uncertainty surrounding Brexit negotiations, and what arrangements will emerge post-departure. S&amp;P has issued its latest update on the UK following the Brexit vote, and it has kept its rating at AA with a negative outlook given the future uncertainties. As we reported earlier, S&amp;P had cut the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rating by two notches on the Monday after the referendum result. Back with stock markets, and European shares have ended on an uncertain note. French and Spanish GDP figures gave some support while stronger than expected US growth increased the chances of a Federal Reserve rate rise before the end of the year. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 9.69 points or 0.14% at 6996.26 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.19% to 10,696.19 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 0.33% at 4548.58 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.59% to 17,324.23 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.04% at 9201.3 In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.13% to 588.67 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 71 points or 0.39%. So what effect could the Uber decision have on the gig economy? Crowley Woodford, employment partner at Ashurst, reckons a huge one: This decision could be the beginning of the end for the gig economy as we know it and will have wide implications for a number of employers beyond Uber, inevitably leading to a flood of further claims. Labour is tabling an amendment to the Digital Economy Bill, which is currently going through Parliament. The amendment, if it is accepted on Tuesday, would extend employment rights to workers at firms like Uber who operate in the gig economy. The clause, tabled by shadow digital minister Louise Haigh, would change the law so that workers at companies who provide a service to customers through a digital \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcintermediary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 such as Uber are defined as employees of that business. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tribunal ruling only applies to Uber and the US-based company plans to challenge it anyway. Louise Haigh said: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThis amendment will, for the first time, enshrine in statute the rights of workers in the digital economy; the right to be designated as employees and their right to sick and holiday pay so that if companies like Uber try to wriggle out of their responsibilities by appealing this extraordinarily welcome decision today, they will have nowhere to go.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a piece from Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady, general secretary of the TUC, on the Uber verdict: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a response from the government. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, said: The Government is committed to building an economy that works for all. We are keen to ensure our employment rules keep up to date to reflect new ways of working, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why the Government has asked Matthew Taylor to conduct an independent review into modern working practices. Clearer rules are needed to determine whether someone is an employee, a worker or self-employed, says Citizens Advice. Chief executive Gillian Guy said: The fact it takes an employment tribunal to decide whether these drivers are self-employed shows that proving employment status is an extremely complicated and costly process. For many people struggling at the sharp end of insecure work, such as in false self-employment, taking such a case is simply not an option - not least because of employment tribunal fees of up to \u00c2\u00a31,200. To address this Citizens Advice is keen the government considers introducing an effective online test people could use which would determine their employment status. It is encouraging to see the government is keen to tackle the challenges brought by insecure work. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very positive that the Prime Minister has announced an independent review of modern employment and that the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) committee is to investigate the rights and treatment of non-permanent staff. The full Uber judgement and the reasons for the decision are online here. The courts have done their job with the Uber ruling but the UK Parliament will have to step in to set laws for the new economy, says Torsten Bell at the Resolution Foundation: As a country we have two ways of resolving legal uncertainty \u00e2\u20ac\u201c our courts and Parliament. The first of these has done its work today, and will be called up to do so again on this and related topics in the years ahead. But in the end it is Parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job to opine on how our law should be updated to respond to developments in the real world. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good that both the Business Select Committee and the government themselves have launched reviews of existing employment legislation, although as with all reviews it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what is actually done with them that matters. New technology is by and large a good thing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but the old fashioned wish for certainty in what the law means for the jobs we do, pounds we earn and tax we pay remains as important as ever. The courts can do their bit to interpret our law in the face of changes, but in the end it is for government and Parliament to give us a law fit for that new world. The full piece is here. Not just minium wage and holiday pay, but also a company pension could be on the cards for Uber drivers after the tribunal decision. Tom McPhail, head of retirement policy at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: This is great news for anyone working in the gig economy as it means they are more likely to be eligible for a workplace pension, with all the attendant benefits and in particular the highly valuable employer contribution. It is also going to be a challenge for Uber and employers like them, in deciding what specific pension terms they want to offer their employees. They have some latitude on earnings definitions and deferral periods but however they deal with this, it is going to cost them time and money. Back with Uber, and the tribunal decision must not discourage firms from using the self-employed, according to trade body IPSE. Chris Bryce, chief executive of the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self Employed, said: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision gives Uber drivers clarity around their relationship with Uber, subject to Uber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intended appeal. As far as IPSE is concerned self-employment means you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in control, and that must remain a positive choice. If companies want to control exactly how or when their workers do the actual work, they must not shirk their responsibility to provide employment protections and pay their employer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Insurance Contributions too. If they want to engage workers on a freelance basis, then they must be business-like in that relationship. We will be studying the full judgement carefully to consider its implications, but this ruling may have an impact on the wider gig economy. The recently launched review of employment practices takes on even greater urgency and importance in light of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling. However, Government must be careful not to dissuade firms from making use of the highly-skilled, on-demand flexible workforce as a whole. The vast majority of people who work this way made an active choice to do so and cherish their self-employed status. Athough... here is a sign of a weaker US economy. The University of Michigan consumer confidence index has come in weaker than expected at 87.2 in October. This is lower than the initial estimate of 87.9 and forecasts of 88.1, and is well below September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure of 91.2. Back with US GDP for a moment, and Wall Street has moved ahead in early trading, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up around 30 points or nearly 0.2%. The strong growth figure means it is increasingly likely the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates before the end of the year, in December if not ahead of the election. Alex Lydall, head of dealing at Foenix Partners, said: The US took a giant step towards the execution phase of interest rate hikes this afternoon after an aggressively positive Q3 growth print registered at 1.5%. With the Fed already being split on those in favour of a rate hike last month, progress appears to be pointing towards a post-election hike at year-end. Meanwhile more on those soybeans: Although Uber is appealing the tribunal decision, a number of commentators have said it could open the door to further claims. Alan Price, employment law director at advisory group Peninsula, said: Whilst this decision is only at employment tribunal level... the case could have large consequences for businesses run on a similar model. There is already a related claim supported by a different union in the pipeline against the courier firm City Sprint. Not only could this decision lead to an influx of tribunal claims, but it can lead to large financial penalties for businesses who have not given staff their correct legal rights. Aye Limbin Glassey, employment partner at Shakespeare Martineau, said: The ruling will not only impact Uber but a whole number of other industries and businesses which use self-employed workers. It is by no means the end of the issue - continued pressure from trade unions calling for tighter regulations means that the Uber ruling will likely be a catalyst for further scrutiny. The very nature of a business like Uber is the flexibility it offers. However, employment practices cannot be left unregulated and rights of workers and employees cannot be ignored unless businesses are willing and ready to face the backlash of legal and reputational repercussions. It is stark reality that the application of employment rights will often mean that companies are unable to adopt the agility needed to support its success. With consumer convenience the driver of many fast-growing businesses, it is likely that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see more businesses of this nature coming to market and using self-employed workers will become a greater concern for companies. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our report on the Uber verdict, from Hilary Osborne: Drivers for Uber have won a landmark case after employment tribunal judges ruled that they were not self-employed and should be paid the national living wage. The case could open up the technology firm to claims from all of its 40,000 drivers in the UK, and force other companies in the so-called gig economy to review the way that they are employing staff. It is likely that the firm will appeal against the finding. The ride hailing app had argued that the drivers were independent contractors who are self-employed and can choose where and when they work. But an employment tribunal in London found that this was not the case. The full story is here: The Uber ruling is disappointing for its 40,000 drivers and consumers alike, according to the Adam Smith Institute. Sam Dumitriu, head of projects at the think tank, said: Nearly 80% of Uber drivers preferred being self-employed and being their own boss, saying in a recent poll that they wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t trade that status for some of the benefits like holiday pay, pension contributions and the National Minimum Wage. Uber drivers typically earn well above the National Living Wage. Across the UK, the average driver earns \u00c2\u00a316 an hour, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s after Uber has taken their commission, but before you factor in extra costs like insurance, petrol and car payments. One you factor that in it comes to around \u00c2\u00a312 an hour, still well above the minimum wage. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s higher for drivers in London and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s higher for drivers who work at peak times like Saturday evening. Consumers will see prices rise and a less stable, predictable service. And this doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just hit Uber. It threatens other new business models like Deliveroo and Amazon Prime Now. Unions are understandably delighted to have won today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s case against Uber. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an important step towards cleaning up the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgig economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (which relies on temporary, often low paid, workers). \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The GMB deserve huge credit for a shining light on conditions at Uber and winning this landmark action. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This case has exposed the dark side of so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflexible\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 labour. For many workers the gig economy is a rigged economy, where bosses can get out of paying the minimum wage and providing basics like paid holidays and rest breaks. O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady adds that Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government also needs to take action to prevent workers being exploited: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What is happening at Uber is just the tip of the iceberg. Lots of people are now trapped in insecure jobs, with low pay and no voice at work. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need the government to get tough on sham self-employment. The Taylor review of employment practices must be a no-holds-barred investigation. And it must recognise the important role trade unions can play in ending precarious working.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Uber ruling could trigger a wave of claims from workers at other companies. Frank Ryan, employment lawyer at legal firm Vardags, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a landmark decision which is guaranteed to have widespread implications: for Uber itself, its workers, the paying public, black cab drivers and other workers in the so called gig economy. While each case turns on its own facts, this is essentially a green light for others in the gig economy to come forward and make similar claims. Ryan also argues that consumers could end up paying more for cab rides: While potentially good news for black cab drivers, who have always struggled to compete with Uber and who will already have been encouraged by the Mayor of London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s package of reforms for the taxi sector, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ultimately bad news for the consumer. It is surely unavoidable that Uber will look to pass the resultant increased costs onto the paying customer. Uber has swiftly responded, saying it will appeal against the UK tribunal ruling that its drivers should be treated as employees. It argues that most drivers are happy with the current situation. Jo Bertram, regional general manager of Uber in the UK, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tens of thousands of people in London drive with Uber precisely because they want to be self-employed and their own boss. The overwhelming majority of drivers who use the Uber app want to keep the freedom and flexibility of being able to drive when and where they want. While the decision of this preliminary hearing only affects two people we will be appealing it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newsflash: Back in London, the lawyers representing a group of Uber drivers say they have won a court case, at which they argued that the workers are employed by the taxi hire firm. The ruling means that Uber drivers will be entitled to employment benefits, and could be a major moment in the evolution of the new \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 economy. They say: The London Central Employment Tribunal has found that a group of Uber drivers are workers and are entitled to receive the National Minimum Wage and holiday pay. In a landmark ruling that follows a hearing in July, which will affect tens of thousands of Uber drivers, the Employment Tribunal has ruled today that a group of Uber drivers are not self-employed but are workers who are entitled to essential workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rights including to be paid the National Minimum Wage and receive paid holiday. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full statement: Historic victory for Uber drivers as Tribunal finds they are entitled to basic workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rights The US economy has regained momentum, says Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics. He writes: The stand-out in the third quarter was the 10.0% surge in exports. Admittedly, some of that surge was due to a one-off spike in soybean exports, which will be reversed in the fourth quarter, but it is still a welcome sign that the dollar appreciation in 2014 and 2015 is no longer weighing on exporters. Overall, net exports added 0.8% points to GDP growth. After being a sizeable drag on growth for the preceding five quarters, inventories added a further 0.6% points. But....Ashworth also points out that not everything was rosy: Consumption growth slowed to 2.1%, residential investment contracted by 6.2% and equipment investment fell by 2.7% Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at City trading firm Xtrade, believes US interest rates are now likely to rise in December. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The last time US GDP growth surged past two per cent the Federal Reserve raised interest rates. With today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s numbers flying above that watermark, history may be about to repeat itself. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy is being fuelled by a buoyant jobs market, strong levels of consumer spending and healthy trade. If the indicators continue to point upwards for the US then Fed Chair Janet Yellen will look to stop things boiling over. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Many believe that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big bump in growth will assure a December rate rise, but with a US election just weeks away, nothing is certain.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd What does this stronger growth mean for US interest rates? On balance, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect that stronger growth raises the chances that the Federal Reserve hikes borrowing costs at its December meeting. Investor Adrial Miller thinks to: But....Anna Stupnytska, global economist at Fidelity International, argues that some Fed policymakers could make a case for holding rates again: At 2.9%, the US economy has just posted its strongest growth rate in two years! That should be a boost for the Democratic Party, as they head into November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s elections. More detail... Business fixed investment (in, say, factories) rose by an annual rate of 1.2%. However, spending on new equipment dropped by 2.7%; the fourth quarter running where companies cut back. Government spending picked up a little, adding 0.09% to the GDP rate. US growth last quarter was driven by a surge in exports, including soybeans, and more companies choosing to restock their inventories. Exports increased by 10%, at a 10 percent rate, the biggest rise since the fourth quarter of 2013. And businesses piled up new stock at an annual rate of $12.6bn, compared to running them down at a rate of $9.5bn in Q2. That suggests that firms are more optimistic about growth prospects. But consumer spending has eased back. It only grew by 2.1%, compared with 4.3% three months ago. Some instant reaction to the better-than-expected US growth figures: Breaking: The US economy grew by an annualised rate of 2.9% in the last three months, stronger than expected. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big jump on the 1.4% annualised growth recorded between April and June, and suggests America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is strengthening. A 2.9% growth rate is the equivalent of just over 0.7% on a quarter-on-quarter basis, so America is growing faster than Britain (+0.5%). More to follow! What should we watch out for in the US GDP report? Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some ideas: Will growth burst over the 2% mark, and even threaten 3%? Will consumer spending continue to drive growth? Will businesses keep spending on research and intellectual property? R&amp;D spending spiked sharply in the second quarter, so it could have faded. Will companies restock their inventories? They ran them down in Q2, which held back growth Will government spending fall? It did earlier this year - another reason Q2 growth was weak. This preview has more details: Tension is building in the markets as investors await the first estimate of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth in the third quarter of 2016, in 30 minutes time. The US GDP report is due at 8.30am New York time, or 1.30pm in the UK. Wall Street expect the US economy grew by an annualised rate of around 2.5% in July to September, up from 1.4% in the second quarter of 2016. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the equivalent of a 0.6% quarterly rate. Economist reckon that consumer spending, and rising exports, drove growth up in the last three months. The figures are eagerly awaited, as they could determine whether the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates in December; they could also influence next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s elections too. Paresh Davdra, CEO and Co-Founder of RationalFX, sums it up Growth is expected to have picked up from the previous quarter, and there is speculation that good figures could mean an interest rate hike before Christmas. With the US Presidential election less than 2 weeks away, all eyes will be on the current state of the economy and the effect it could have on an election which is likely to have a large effect on global markets depending on the result. As was the case in the lead up to the EU Referendum, this could potentially be a nervous time for economists, currencies and markets alike.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Although we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had French, Spanish and Austrian GDP today, we have to wait until Monday to learn how the wider eurozone fared over the summer. Economists are predicting another quarter of unspectacular growth, of around 0.3%. A lot depends on Germany and Italy, of course, and their GDP report isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t formally released until November 15! Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight has some predictions: We expect German GDP expansion to have come in at 0.3-0.4% quarter-on-quarter, which would be in line with the 0.4% quarter-on-quarter expansion seen in the second quarter. Additionally, we expect Italian GDP to have crept up just 0.1% quarter-on-quarter having been flat in the second quarter. Austria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has racked up another quarter of solid growth, with GDP increasing by 0.4% in the July-to-September period. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from 0.3% in Q2, with consumer spending pushing growth higher. Heads up (2): Rating agency Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is expected to publish a review of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating tonight. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not expecting any major action, as little has really changed since the EU referendum. But you never know.... S&amp;P hit the UK with a double-notch downgrade on the Monday following the Brexit vote (just as the English team exited the European Championship ignominiously with a defeat to mighty Iceland). Jordan Rochester of Nomura says: The rating.. is perhaps unlikely to be changed today given the S&amp;P\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stated criteria as to what would lead to a downgrade further have not yet taken place (public finances to deteriorate, GDP per capita to fall, GBP to lose its reserve currency status, Scottish Referendum \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the sequel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or other significant constitutional issues) Heads up (1): A court will rule this afternoon whether taxi-app firm Uber has breached UK law and not provided drivers with basic employment rights. The case goes to the heart of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 economy; Uber argues that the drivers are self-employed, while unions say that they are effectively employed by Uber, so are entitled to holiday pay, sick pay, a guaranteed minimum wage and breaks. The ruling is due at 2pm BST..... Ouch. The pound just had another one of its little moments, dropping sharply to an eight-day low against the euro (at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1117). Sterling is lost all its early gains against the US dollar, hitting a three-day low of $1.2126. The trigger is news from Belfast, where campaigners have lost a court case against the UK government over Brexit. They had argued that Westminster could not begin the formal legal process for leaving the EU without a parliamentary vote. They claimed that using the royal prerogative to trigger article 50 would breach Northern Irish law. But the Northern Ireland high court has just ruled against them. This has weakened the pound, as it removes one obstacle in the path of Brexit. However.... another court case, arguing that MPs must vote on Article 50, is still running in London. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d wrongly expected eurozone inflation data today; turns out that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coming on Monday. Instead, the European Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest economic confidence figures have just landed - showing that firms are the most confident they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been all year. The EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic sentiment indicator rose to 106.3 in October from 104.9 in September, beating expectations of a small decline. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the highest reading seen in 2016. And the business climate indicator rose to 0.55 from 0.44 in September, its highest reading since July 2011. This could be an encouraging sign that the eurozone economy is picking up (despite France missing growth forecasts this morning). Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says: This adds to the evidence that Eurozone economies may well be gaining some growth momentum over the final months of 2016 after activity has stuttered since the first quarter. Indeed, the rise in Eurozone economic sentiment to a 10-month high in October follows on from the purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 survey showing that overall Eurozone manufacturing and services output picked up to a 2016 high in October. This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP data hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t brought much cheer to Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets. The main indices are all in the red this morning, as traders fret about this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bond selloff. In London, the FTSE 100 has dropped 40 points, or 0.6%. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the damage: Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says the sellers are back in charge: Markets cannot seem to catch a break at the moment, for with every rise comes an inevitable drop. He predicts that bonds will remain under pressure (for the reasons outlined earlier): Bond yields are on the rise, following on from an incredible multiyear period of strength in bond prices. In an environment of rising inflation, and an increasingly likely US December rate hike, there is a chance that we will see yields continue to rise for some time yet. Coming at a time when stocks are tumbling, this highlights that the move out of bonds is more to do with economics (which often move inverse to the FTSE) than risk attitudes Analysts at Rabobank are calling the bond market sell-off a\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdbloodbath\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Reuters flags up. John Reid, a market strategist at Deutsche Bank, is also concerned, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bond markets are facing a recurring nightmare at the moment as we continue to see yields rise sharply.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Some investors risk getting their fingers burned. Or worse.... There are some serious moves in the bond market this morning, as investors pull money out of sovereign debt. The yield, or interest rate, of UK 10-year gilts has hit 1.3% for the first time since the Brexit vote. That means the price of the bonds has dropped. Gilt yields have been climbing steadily this month, and that means the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost of borrowing has gone up. Britain isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t alone, though. German 10-year bund yields have hit their highest level since May, while Italian 10-year bonds are at an eight-month high. Rising bond yields implies two things Inflation is going up, so investors want a higher rate of return for holding government debt Investors suspect that central banks will tighten monetary policy soon, after years of buying up government bonds through QE (driving down prices). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a volatile picture, though - this tweet shows how shorter-dated German bond yields jumped, then fell back..... The pound remains subdued this morning, up just 0.15% at $1.218. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost 18% below its pre-referendum values, which is now feeding into import costs... Adam Posen, a former member of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Monetary Policy Committee, is pretty gloomy about Brexit. Asked on Bloomberg TV whether there was anything positive about Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s looming exit from the European Union, Posen replied \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Of course, he added, the economy will survive, the City will survive in a smaller state -- but people will be worse off in 10 years. Posen, who now runs America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Peterson Institute, then elaborated: Brexit is going to be an ongoing source of chronic pain for the UK for many years. It is going to put the UK in many ways back to where it was in the 70s and early 80s. Being uncompetitive, people having less faith in the stability of the regime. The Spanish GDP report is online here. Newsflash: Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy remains impressively immune to the political deadlock that has gripped the country this year. Spanish GDP expanded by 0.7% in the last quarter, new figures show. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another quarter of solid growth, beating France (+0.2%) and the UK (+0.5%), a However, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slightly lower than the 0.8% we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d got use to seeing: On an annual basis, Spain expanded by a healthy looking 3.2%: Spain has been stuck with a caretaker government since January, with two general elections failing to deliver a clear winner. Tomorrow, the Spanish parliament will hold a confidence vote that will decide whether acting prime minister Mariano Rajoy gets a second term. The Socialist party is expected to abstain, paving the way for a new Rajoy administration, despite ongoing opposition to his austerity programme. More here: Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rajoy looks to Saturday vote to form new government France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, Michel Sapin, has admitted that the government may miss its growth targets this year, after this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP figures missed expectations. Reuters has the details: Weaker than expected economic growth in the third quarter makes its harder to reach the French government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth target of 1.5% this year but does not cast doubt on the 2017 goal, also 1.5 %, Finance Minister Michel Sapin said on Friday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It makes it harder to reach 1.5 percent this year, I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deny it, but it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t call into question next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sapin told RTL radio. The economy grew a slim 0.2 percent in the third quarter of2016, undershooting expectations for a stronger rebound after asmall contraction in the previous three months, official data showed earlier, as consumer spending stalled. Another quarter, another loss from Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taxpayer-controlled bank. Royal Bank of Scotland has posted a \u00c2\u00a3469m loss for the last quarter, twice as much as analysts expected. Bad behaviour by bankers is partly to blame; RBS is taking a \u00c2\u00a3425m charge to cover legacy misconduct. It has also run up \u00c2\u00a3469m of restructuring charges, partly due to its struggles to sell its Williams &amp; Glyn branch network. RBS admits that it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t settle this deal by the end of 2017, as it had hoped. CEO Ross McEwan says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve said that 2015 and 2016 would be noisy as we work through legacy issues and transform this bank for customers. These results reflect that noise.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now eight years since the UK government bailed out RBS. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results suggest there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little chance of extracting the taxpayers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 money anytime soon.... More reaction, from Bloomberg economist Maxime Sbaihi: Economists are disappointed that France didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t grow faster in the last quarter. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Holger Sandte of Nordea Market: Bloomberg are also underwhelmed (and also flag up that we should get Spanish GDP today too). Disappointingly, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual growth rate has dipped to 1.1%: France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has been quite bumpy over the last two years, as this graph shows: And growth of 0.2% may not be enough to restore confidence in president Francois Hollande, with a general election looming next year Over on fastFT, Nathalie Thomas says: The deep unpopularity of Mr Hollande, amid weak growth and still high unemployment relative to many of France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU peers, has prompted a desperate search among the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s socialists for an alternative candidate who could possibly be fielded at next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s elections, with the idea of the incumbent president not seeking a second term becoming more palatable. Most of the 0.2% French growth last quarter was due to companies restocking their inventories, says INSEE. Consumers contributed little to growth, with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153household consumption expenditure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd stagnant for the second month running. Investment picked up, with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gross fixed capital formation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rising by 0.3% France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit dragged back growth, says INSEE: Imports sharply bounced back (+2.2% after -1.7%). Exports accelerated to a lesser extent (+0.6% after +0.2%). All in all, foreign trade balance contributed negatively to GDP growth (-0.5 points after +0.6 points). But that was balanced by firms replenishing their inventories, which added 0.6% to the growth rate. NEWSFLASH: France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is growing again, but not by as much as economists hoped. French GDP expanded by 0.2% in the third quarter of this year, figures just released by the INSEE statistics office show. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an improvement on April to June, when the economy disappointingly shrank by 0.1%. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker than expected -- the City was expecting growth of 0.3%. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rather weaker than Britain, which posted 0.5% growth yesterday. More to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After the excitement of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK GDP report, investors are poised for new growth reports from France and the US. French GDP is released any moment, and will give the first clue on how the eurozone performed in the last quarter. Then at 1.30pm BST, we learn how America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy fared in July to September. Economists expect growth to pick up, to an annual rate of 2.5% (from 1.4%). The stronger the reading, the greater the chance of a US interest rate hike before Christmas. A good growth report could also help Hillary Clinton, as the race to the White House reaches its final days. In between, the final estimate of eurozone inflation for October lands at 10am. Royal Bank of Scotland are publishing financial results at 7am, as are airline group IAG. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also be watching the UK car industry, after Nissan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to expand its Sunderland plant despite the uncertainty around Brexit. There may also be ructions in the sovereign bond market too, where prices have been falling for a few weeks now. Expectations of higher inflation are partly to blame, meaning investors are demanding a greater return on government debt. They may also suspect that the era of central bank stimulus may be drawing to an end. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets has the details: UK 10 year gilt yields, pushed up to 1.25% their highest levels since they fell from 1.37% the closing level on the 23rd June, after UK Q3 GDP came in at 0.5%, exceeding market expectations of 0.3%. This economic resilience makes it much less likely that the Bank of England will signal further easing next week at the same time as it publishes its latest quarterly inflation report. German bunds also got caught up in the selloff, with yields hitting their highest levels since May, given the resilience of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s German economic data, along with the prospect that inflationary pressures may be starting to build in the broader global economy. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",
