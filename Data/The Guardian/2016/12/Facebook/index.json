Fitch said:</p> <blockquote> <p>The Negative Outlook for the Italian banking sector reflects its increased vulnerability to shocks following the asset-quality deterioration in legacy portfolios... A step-up in pressure from authorities and market participants on the sector to reduce the very high levels of impaired loans has increased urgency and risks for Italian banks.</p> <p>Profitability in the sector is frail. Disposals of non-performing loan portfolios could lead to losses that require additional capital. These are some of the factors driving the 2017 Outlook to Negative from Stable. Problems for a small number of distressed banks raising capital have added to these pressures</p> <p>The \u201cNo\u201d vote at the constitutional referendum has further heightened political uncertainty and possibly reduced the capacity to implement economic reforms. The risks from political instability were one factor that contributed to our revision of the Outlook on Italy\u2019s \u2018BBB+\u2019 sovereign rating to Negative in October.</p> <p>The referendum result could also damage the recapitalisation plans of some Italian banks, most notably Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena and UniCredit, and have negative implications for the broader banking sector, whose attractiveness with investors has already reduced significantly during 2016. The sector\u2019s ability to access the institutional markets for funding and capital, which has become more difficult and expensive this year, could deteriorate further...</p> <p>Significant disposals that materially improve asset quality could be positive for ratings. However, the disposals are likely to result in further provisioning and possibly more capital shortfalls for the banks involved. Portfolio sales could also result in risk-weighted assets rising for the remaining loans if the sales affect loss-given-default estimates at banks using internal rating models.</p> <p>Capitalisation will remain under pressure in 2017 with a weak earnings outlook limiting banks\u2019 ability to build capital. Low interest rates, tepid economic growth and fierce competition for healthy borrowers are challenges for earnings. Profitability could also be dented by restructuring costs as banks focus on cost-cutting.</p> <p>We also believe regulators could require higher capital buffers from Italian banks to compensate for the risk in their large non-performing loan portfolios and for the large portion of Italian sovereign debt held. This could result in additional capital requirements at some banks.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5846dfbae4b015a427f782e5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-06T15:58:38.240Z\">3.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Italian referendum proved a non-event for markets, including emerging markets, because it had effectively been priced in, and at the same time suggested the European Central Bank might well extend its quantitative easing programme this week.

                "bodyText":"A surge in the banking sector has helped lift European markets, as investors once again shrugged off the Italian referendum result and the resignation of prime minister Matteo Renzi. Hopes that the country\u2019s parliament might pass a budget on Wednesday provided some support, as did the continuing optimism that investors might rescue struggling Monte dei Paschi. If that does not happen, there was growing talk that a state bailout could take place this weekend. The idea that the bank would be recapitalised one way or another pushed the Italian banking index 9% higher, its best one day performance since 8 July. Monte dei Paschi itself added 1%, while Unicredit climbed 13%. Elsewhere Deutsche Bank jumped 8% while in the UK, Royal Bank of Scotland rose nearly 6% and Barclays 4.5%. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 33.01 points or 0.49% at 6779.84 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.85% to 10,775.32 France\u2019s Cac climbed 1.26% to 4631.94 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB jumped 4.15% to 17,757.80 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 2.64% higher at 8893.3 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.36% to 622.52 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 19 points or 0.1%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Back with Boeing, and Donald Trump\u2019s tweet saying the company was charging too much to build the new Air Force One - $4bn - and should lose the contract. Boeing has now responded with a statement, saying: We are currently under contract for $170m to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States. We look forward to working with the US Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer. Ratings agency Fitch has moved its outlook on Italian banks from stable to negative for 2017, in the wake of the referendum vote and worries about their ability to recapitalise. Fitch said: The Negative Outlook for the Italian banking sector reflects its increased vulnerability to shocks following the asset-quality deterioration in legacy portfolios... A step-up in pressure from authorities and market participants on the sector to reduce the very high levels of impaired loans has increased urgency and risks for Italian banks. Profitability in the sector is frail. Disposals of non-performing loan portfolios could lead to losses that require additional capital. These are some of the factors driving the 2017 Outlook to Negative from Stable. Problems for a small number of distressed banks raising capital have added to these pressures The \u201cNo\u201d vote at the constitutional referendum has further heightened political uncertainty and possibly reduced the capacity to implement economic reforms. The risks from political instability were one factor that contributed to our revision of the Outlook on Italy\u2019s \u2018BBB+\u2019 sovereign rating to Negative in October. The referendum result could also damage the recapitalisation plans of some Italian banks, most notably Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena and UniCredit, and have negative implications for the broader banking sector, whose attractiveness with investors has already reduced significantly during 2016. The sector\u2019s ability to access the institutional markets for funding and capital, which has become more difficult and expensive this year, could deteriorate further... Significant disposals that materially improve asset quality could be positive for ratings. However, the disposals are likely to result in further provisioning and possibly more capital shortfalls for the banks involved. Portfolio sales could also result in risk-weighted assets rising for the remaining loans if the sales affect loss-given-default estimates at banks using internal rating models. Capitalisation will remain under pressure in 2017 with a weak earnings outlook limiting banks\u2019 ability to build capital. Low interest rates, tepid economic growth and fierce competition for healthy borrowers are challenges for earnings. Profitability could also be dented by restructuring costs as banks focus on cost-cutting. We also believe regulators could require higher capital buffers from Italian banks to compensate for the risk in their large non-performing loan portfolios and for the large portion of Italian sovereign debt held. This could result in additional capital requirements at some banks. The Italian referendum proved a non-event for markets, including emerging markets, because it had effectively been priced in, and at the same time suggested the European Central Bank might well extend its quantitative easing programme this week. So says David Rees of Capital Economics. But he adds: Nonetheless, the political situation in Italy, and indeed the rise of populism in Europe more generally, is something to keep an eye on in the months ahead. Italy\u2019s economy and banking sector are weak, and if the Five Star Movement\u2019s momentum continues to build, it may not be long before an exit from the euro becomes a more realistic concern for investors....Similar fears have rocked emerging market equities in the past, when the Greek debt crisis first came to the fore and Spanish and Italian bonds came under fire in 2012. Italy\u2019s banking sector continues to recover, helped by talk that the country\u2019s parliament might approve its budget on Wednesday, and there could be a state bailout of troubled Monte dei Paschi this weekend. The country\u2019s banking index is currently up more than 7%, its best daily performance since the middle of July. The overall European banking index is up 3%, hitting its highest level since the middle of January. More fallout from Donald Trump\u2019s election - this time affecting UK mortgage rates. Rupert Jones reports: The first evidence has emerged that the era of record-low fixed-rate mortgages may be coming to an end after HSBC withdrew its \u201ccheapest-ever\u201d deal and increased rates on other products. HSBC had been offering a mortgage that allowed customers to lock in for two years at a rate of 0.99%, but this deal has been pulled with immediate effect. The bank\u2019s new mortgage offers are coming in at up to 0.5% higher. The move follows warnings from mortgage brokers that a number of factors, including Donald Trump\u2019s US election win, were set to push up the cost of new fixed-rate home loans. David Hollingworth at broker London &amp; Country Mortgages said: \u201cThe bottom of the market may have been hit. This [announcement] and the broader changes from HSBC, which has been very aggressively priced in the fixed-rate market, could spell the end of the sub-1% fixed rate, but also signals a potential turning point for fixed mortgage rates.\u201d The full story is here: Donald Trump may be casting doubt on Boeing\u2019s Air Force One order, but elsewhere US manufacturers are doing well. New orders for US factory goods rose 2.7% in October, the biggest increase for nearly a year and a half and just above expectations of a 2.6% improvement. The September figure was revised upwards from a gain of 0.3% to 0.6%. The latest figures mark the fourth straight month of increases. But there could be clouds ahead, given the strength of the dollar following Trump\u2019s election victory. Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, said: US factory orders surged... in October, providing manufacturers with plenty of optimism in what has been a turbulent year. Uncertainty surrounds the sector, though, amid renewed strength of the dollar and the incoming president\u2019s trade policy, particularly his approach to China. Donald Trump\u2019s promised fiscal stimulus and the increasing likelihood of raising interest rates has fuelled a greenback rally, and that could starve off exports and hit US factories hard in the new year. And here\u2019s a video clip of Donald Trump outlining his unhappiness with Boeing. Along with the Oval Office, the nuclear codes and the attention of the whole world, winning a US presidential election gives you the power to move the markets. And airline maker Boeing just saw that for itself. Shares in Boeing fell by 1% at the start of trading in New York, after Donald Trump declared on Twitter (where else?) that the firm was charging too much to build the new Air Force One, and should lose the contract. The suggestion that the next US president might take a tough line has worried investors in Boeing (after all, he does have his own Trump Force One). Over in Greece this morning there has been much merriment over the euro group\u2019s decision last night to define the contours of a debt relief agreement for the country long at the centre of Europe\u2019s financial crisis. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens For the first time since economic crisis engulfed Greece just over seven years ago, a sitting government in Athens has felt fit to describe a decision taken in Brussels as a \u201cnational success.\u201d The positive spin and brave faces that have greeted the three bailouts rolled out for Greece, so far, have today been superseded by a genuine sense of relief at the announcement of short-term measures to lighten the country\u2019s mountainous debt load. Many in Syriza, the governing left-wing party, said the move by euro zone partners to shave \u20ac45bn euros off the pile \u2013 the equivalent of 22 percent of GDP \u2013 by extending the repayment period and adjusting interest rates - exceeded \u201cevery expectation.\u201d Addressing reporters today the government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos described the decision both as a \u201csignificant achievement\u201d and \u201cdecisive step for the stabilisation of the Greek economy and complete restoration of confidence.\u201d But as Greece\u2019s political opposition was quick to point out the victory was bittersweet. This might be the first time that the nation\u2019s unmanageable debt burden has been addressed head-on \u2013 and as such can only be seen as rich reward for prime minister Alexis Tsipras - but it comes against a backdrop of calls for Athens to adopt yet more austerity once its current bailout programme expires in mid-2018. Amid signs of a looming showdown with the International Monetary Fund, which says further belt-tightening is the only way to plug the looming fiscal gap and thus ensure its own participation in Greece\u2019s third bailout to date, the spokesman called the demands \u201cirrational.\u201d Athens, he insisted, would neither accept the German proposal for Greece to achieve a primary surplus of 3.5 % through 2028 nor the IMF\u2019s demands for extra measures in 2019 and 2020. Both are expected to dominate talks when auditors representing creditor institutions return to continue negotiating a second review of policy measures set as the price of bailout funds. \u201cGreek society cannot endure more measures,\u201d said Interior minister Panos Skourletis hinting at the battle that is brewing. \u201cThe Greek economy can\u2019t endure them either.\u201d Angelino Alfano\u2019s prediction that Italy could hold a general election in February 2017 didn\u2019t impress the markets, sending shares and bonds down from their earlier highs: But shares are now pushing higher again, following a report that the parliament might approve the 2017 budget on Wednesday, in a confidence vote. That\u2019s sent the FTSE MIB index back up to its earlier highs, gaining 1.7% today. Over in Italy, a political leader has suggested that fresh general elections could be held next February. Interior Minister Angelino Alfano, whose centre-right party is part of Matteo Renzi\u2019s coalition, told the Corriere della Sera newspaper that: \u201cI forecast there will be the will to go to elections in February.\u201d Significantly, Alfano was speaking after having met with Renzi (whose resignation was put on hold by the country\u2019s president last night). Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 take: Alfano rose to prominence as a key ally of Silvio Berlusconi, before dramatically splitting from the former PM in 2013 to form a new party. Italian bonds are still looking stable as traders head for lunch: One fundamental problem with Italian banks is that there are too many of them, says Kathleen Brooks of City Index. She argues that closing some branches would help make the sector competitive, and free up capital for other uses: Italy has more bank branches than pizzerias, in the future it desperately needs more pizza and less banks! She also explains why Monte dei Paschi\u2019s future matters, especially if its cash call fail this week. It\u2019s certainly not as systemically important as other banks, for example Italy\u2019s Unicredit, but Monte dei Paschi\u2019s main problem is that it has become symbolic of Italy\u2019s rotten banking sector that now relies on foreign capital for life support. If the Qatari\u2019s decide against investing in it then it gives a terrible signal to the world about the \u2018investability\u2019 of Europe\u2019s banks. Interestingly, in Europe it is not the systemically important banks that are the biggest risk to the financial sector, but the glut of mid-size banks that hold billions in bad debts that could endanger the health of the bigger banks in Europe, if contagion is to spread. Business confidence in Italy is likely to be hurt by the political uncertainty created by Sunday\u2019s referendum result, and the struggles in the banking sector. Ana Boata, economist at trade insurance firm Euler Hermes, believes 0.3 percentage points could be knocked off growth next year, taking the annual rate down from 0.9% to 0.6%. She predicts that foreign investment will be hit, and Italian firms could suffer high financing costs if their banks remain weak: While there is no need to panic, the resounding \u2018No\u2019 result and political turmoil that has followed could cause a mild confidence crisis in 2017. Even without any spill over to banks or the bond market, we expect -0.3pp of Italian GDP could be shaven off, leaving the economy with the prospect of a mere 0.6% growth next year. \u201cIt will be Italian companies that bear the brunt of a confidence shock, albeit a mild one, which are already contending with some of the worst cash flow conditions in the world \u2013 businesses are waiting on average for 88 days for payment for goods and services. We are likely to see divestment from abroad and tougher financing conditions mean that inward investment levels will stay flat, compared to 2% growth we previously predicted for 2017, and hamper the economy\u2019s chances of recovery.\u201d European banking shares are rallying this morning, as traders look for silver linings in the Italian political upheaval. Almost every bank in the index of major European banks, the Stoxx 600, has gained ground. The prospect of Monte dei Paschi (-2.6%) receiving a dose of state aid this weekend is calming the markets, as this would remove the risk that it might simply collapse. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, has taken his eye of his company\u2019s plunging share price to explain all: One of the biggest worries surrounding the referendum was the impact it could have upon the nation\u2019s banking system, with the likes of Unicredit and Monte dei Paschi in the midst of a recapitalisation and bank rescue plan. Plans to raise substantial funds at Monte dei Paschi have hit the buffers after the \u2018No\u2019 vote and while a likely government bailout may not be the ideal otucome for the bank, it will mitigate the risk of a collapse and contagion in the region, hence the widespread gains across the financial sector today. Eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem has weighed in on Brexit this morning, warning that the UK\u2019s demands are not compatible with a smooth exit from the EU. Our politics liveblog has all the details: Britain\u2019s financial spread-betting firms love to talk about the possibilities created by stock market volatility. But they\u2019ve had a nasty taste of it themselves this morning, after the City regulators announced a crackdown on \u2018contract for difference\u2019 products. CFD\u2019s allow a customer to make big profits if they correctly predict a market move -- or see their nest egg crushed by the stampeding herd if they get it wrong. So today, the FCA announced new rules to prevent \u201cinexperienced\u201d clients from getting burned. It wants to restrict how much leverage a retail customer can take on (to restrict them from taking big positions on a small deposit), and better risk warnings. And no wonder - given that 82% of clients manage to lose money on CFD! All sensible-sounding stuff. But shares in IG and CMC Markets, two of the biggest players, have both plunged by 30% this morning -- showing how profitable these retail investors have been. More here: The pound has hit a two-month high this morning, after chancellor Philip Hammond meets with fellow finance ministers in Brussels. Arriving at the meeting, Hammond told reporters that the UK government hasn\u2019t ruled out paying into the EU budget in return for access to its markets. He said: \u201cWe want to keep all options open.... That is something we would have to look at, looking at the costs and the benefits based on what is in the best interests of the British taxpayer.\u201d The possibility of a so-called Soft Brexit has nudged sterling up to $1.277 this morning, its highest level since early October. European stock markets are remarkably calm this morning. Most stock indices are up in early trading, led by Italy, where the banking index has rallied by almost 2%. Shares in Monti dei Paschi, though, have fallen by 3% in volatile trading, as investors wonder whether its rescue plan can be salvaged by the weekend. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is becalmed, down a few points. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: The FTSE is lacking any macro-momentum bar the continued, and exhausting, Brexit-brouhaha that have been a constant presence since June, meaning it is struggling to significantly break through the levels it has been stuck around for the last few months. Newsflash from Italy: The Rome government will be desperate avoid inflicting bail-in losses on small bondholders, says the Economist Intelligence Unit\u2019s Robin Bew: That could mean breaking EU rules on bank rescues, unless Italy can \u2018bend\u2019 them by finding a way to compensate those small savers. Here\u2019s a handy reminder of how badly Italian banks have fared this year, and how badly Italy has performed this millennium, from the Wall Street Journal. Italian government debt is strengthened in value this morning, showing that the markets remain relaxed about the situation. The rally has pulled down the yield on Italy\u2019s 10-year bonds to 1.95%, down from 1.9% last night, and actually lower than before Sunday\u2019s referendum. The gap between Italian and German debt remains steady too - another sign of market calm. The Financial Times reckons that Monte dei Paschi may have to be bailed out this weekend. It all depends whether Qatar can be persuaded to still back its \u20ac5bn cashcall, even though Italy has been plunged into political limbo. Here\u2019s the key points. Bankers are running out of private-sector solutions for Monte dei Paschi di Siena and have told the Italian lender to prepare for a state bailout this weekend after prime minister Matteo Renzi was felled by a referendum defeat. While financial markets responded relatively calmly to the referendum result, people briefed on the situation said the political upheaval made it \u201cmore difficult\u201d to secure a \u20ac1bn investment from Qatar on which Monte dei Paschi\u2019s \u20ac5bn capital-raising plan hinges. Senior bankers fear that a failure to shore up the bank, which was the worst loser of this summer\u2019s European bank healthcheck, could damage already jittery investor confidence about Italy\u2019s overall banking sector, which is hobbled by \u20ac360bn of bad loans and weak profitability. JPMorgan Chase and Mediobanca, advisers to Monte dei Paschi, have been working with Pier Carlo Padoan, Italy\u2019s finance minister, to persuade the Qatar Investment Authority to pump money into Italy\u2019s third-largest lender. But hope is fading that they can secure a deal by this week\u2019s deadline. Without the cornerstone investment from Qatar, the other parts of the complex plan to fill the bank\u2019s \u20ac5bn capital shortfall are likely to collapse. Reuters is reporting that Italian authorities are standing by to provide \u2018precautionary\u2019 state aid to their oldest bank, Monte dei Paschi, if its rescue plan fails. Intriguingly, this measure could (apparently) allow Rome to get much-needed capital into MPS without triggering European rules forcing some bondholders to take a hit. That would protect those families and pensioners who hold bank bonds. Here\u2019s the story: Measures to allow state aid for Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena are ready but will depend on political developments in coming days, sources familiar with the matter said. The Tuscan lender is looking at the idea of a precautionary recapitalisation which would avoid the triggering of European bail-in rules, one source said. Monte dei Paschi needs to raise 5 billion euros ($5.38 billion) by the end of December to avoid being wound down, but investors are reluctant to back the cash call after Prime Minister Matteo Renzi lost a referendum on Sunday and pledged to resign. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Matteo Renzi\u2019s defeat in Sunday\u2019s Italian referendum continues to reverberate around Europe, even though the outgoing PM has agreed to stay on a little longer to get the country\u2019s 2017 budget passed. The big worry, of course, is Italy\u2019s banks - with their \u20ac350bn of non-performing loans and uncomfortably thin capital reserves. The City is watching to see if Renzi\u2019s defeat has scuppered the plans to recapitalise these institutions using private money; potential investors could well have been scared away by the crisis in Rome. If these efforts fail, then Italy\u2019s government may have to activate bail-in procedures, which would inflict losses on private bondholders. And in Italy, that includes many members of the public. As CMC\u2019s Michael Hewson explains, the Italian banking sector is a serious worry: Any new government technocratic or otherwise is still faced with the unenviable task of either bailing in the Italian banking sector and wiping out a wave of Italian pensioners and savers, or defying Brussels and trying to bail the banks out with taxpayer\u2019s money in contravention of new rules to protect taxpayers. As it is the recapitalisation plan for Monte dei Paschi di Siena is much more problematic now that Renzi has gone given the uncertainty that is likely to come next as we await the shape of any new administration. No one in their right mind is likely to invest in a bank that has already been bailed out three times in the last few years against such an uncertain political backdrop. One thing is certain the events of the last few days make it likely that we will see the ECB extend its asset purchase scheme by at least another six months, beyond March 2017 when they meet later this week. The wider stock markets, though, continue to be quite relaxed about the political situation in Italy. Most European indices rose yesterday, and traders are expecting a quiet morning today. We\u2019ll also be watching Greece, which was last night granted some short-term debt relief by its European creditors. But more seriously, the eurogroup and the IMF are still split over Greece\u2019s fiscal targets, meaning the Fund still hasn\u2019t officially joined the \u20ac86bn bailout programme. Euro zone grants Greece short-term debt relief; no deal with IMF",

                "bodyText":"Online fashion retailer Asos has unveiled plans to hire 1,500 staff at its London headquarters and to double domestic manufacturing of its own-brand clothing. The company, which employs 2,500 people at the site in Camden, north London, said it expected to spend about \u00a338m on additional specialists in technology, marketing, editorial content and retail as it aims to double sales over the next five years. It is investing another \u00a340m in building an additional 40,000 sq ft (3,700 sq metres) at its base at the art deco Greater London House, formerly the Carreras cigarette factory, to house the extra workers. Nick Beighton, the chief executive, said Asos expected to open several more manufacturing facilities in the UK over the next three to four years, in order to double capacity from the two factories which make about 4% of its own-label products at present. The move is good news for UK fashion manufacturing, which was decimated in the 1990s when work moving abroad but has begun to see a renaissance in recent years amid rising costs in China and increasing demand for high fashion made quickly. Asos has been investing in training workers in the capital for more than five years at a factory in Haringey, north London, which employs about 100 people, 40 of whom are stitching dresses for Asos, Marks &amp; Spencer and online specialist Finery. Asos\u2019s UK investment is the latest financial commitment to the UK by a major digital business. It follows significant investment announcements from Facebook and Google, which plan to increase their staff numbers in the UK, despite fears that Brexit would make the country a less attractive place to invest. Alongside a number of British online retailers, Asos has benefited from the drop in the value of the pound, because almost 60% of its sales are outside the UK. Asos said the renovation of its HQ would include new staircases and light wells, a health club, training academy and \u201cquiet zone library\u201d, plus a tech bar and concierge service for staff. Beighton said: \u201cOur people are what make Asos special. We are creating a workspace that fosters creativity, where they can enjoy what they do.\u201d Asos is one of the companies that have come under scrutiny over working practices at their warehouses in recent months, after the Guardian\u2019s disclosure last year that temporary workers at Sports Direct were being paid less than the minimum wage. Neil Derrick, the Yorkshire regional secretary of the GMB union which has led protests against conditions at a warehouse near Barnsley which handles distribution for Asos, said: \u201cWe welcome the announcement of 1,500 new jobs at Asos but not when GMB\u2019s concerns for the workers in Yorkshire have been completely ignored. \u201cThe company\u2019s growth is on back of workers in their Yorkshire warehouse, yet there seems to be a huge disparity between how Asos staff in London and workers in Yorkshire are treated.

                "body":"<p>Has anyone in Downing Street actually realised that Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox has lodged a bid for Sky? If you trawl through newspapers and the internet looking for comments from the government about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/15/rupert-murdoch-sky-bid-pay-tv\">proposed \u00a311.7bn deal</a>, you will not find much.</p> <p>Matt Hancock, the junior culture minister, appeared in the Commons to answer an urgent question from Labour on the matter early last week, and that was it. \u201cAny transaction will be looked at on its merits, on a case-by-case basis,\u201d he said. How insightful.</p> <p>Theresa May, Philip Hammond and Greg Clark, the business secretary, have been silent on the matter. Karen Bradley, Hancock\u2019s boss and the culture, media and sport secretary, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/dec/12/murdoch-sky-bid-culture-secretary-to-answer-urgent-question\">apparently unavailable to answer the urgent question in parliament.</a></p> <p>This all rather surprising when you consider that other investments in the UK from other overseas companies since the vote to leave the European Union have led to swift comments from the prime minister and chancellor praising their commitment to the country. The boss of Softbank, the Japanese company that bought technology group Arm for \u00a324bn, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/jul/18/philip-hammond-softbank-takeover-arm-holdings-overseas-investors\">even posed for photos with Hammond outside 11 Downing Street.</a></p> <p>Now, the government\u2019s silence on this issue may be because Sky shareholders have yet to vote on the proposal, or because it wants to leave the matter to Ofcom and other regulators. Hancock told MPs that the government must be \u201cscrupulously fair and impartial\u201d and that Bradley\u2019s role is \u201ca quasi-judicial one and it\u2019s important she acts independently and is not subject to improper influence\u201d.</p> <p>But that hasn\u2019t stopped the government before. Softbank\u2019s trip to Whitehall came on the day its bid was revealed, before the shareholder vote and before any regulator had cast an eye over the transaction.</p> <p>Instead, the government\u2019s silence looks like an attempt to distance itself from the Sky deal and depoliticise it. May has not even made a clear, public pledge to properly analyse the transaction.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/help/2016/sep/19/how-to-contact-the-guardian-securely\">How to contact the Guardian securely</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In contrast, Gordon Brown, Vince Cable, Tom Watson and plenty of other politicians outside government have had lots to say about the proposal \u2013 mainly that May must ensure that Ofcom conducts a public-interest test on the deal, seriously consider whether the Murdochs are fit and proper people to control Sky and its news operations, or even simply block the proposal.</p> <p>The government\u2019s silence is further evidence that the deal could be railroaded through by 21st Century Fox and Sky before any opposition is allowed to build up a head of steam.</p> <p>Supporters of the takeover claim that much has changed since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/phone-hacking\">Murdoch last tried to buy Sky in 2011</a>. His business has been split in two, with newspaper brands such as the <em>Sun</em> and the <em>Times</em> held within News Corp and the TV and film assets run through Fox. Also, Google and Facebook now dominate the digital advertising market, transforming the outlook for news and content providers.</p> <p>But both of these defences are easily dismantled. Firstly, splitting News Corp and Fox does not change the fact that one family could end up with extraordinary influence over British media. Take a look at the boards of News Corp and Fox \u2013 Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch are the co-chairs of both, while James Murdoch is chief executive of Fox, on the board of News Corp, and chair of Sky.</p> <p>Secondly, recent changes in the media industry simply reinforce the importance of the established news providers emphasising their independence, credibility and quality. If the public question the veracity of what they read in newspapers or see on TV news, then it simply pushes more people to Facebook, Google and fake news.</p> <p>The government must not sleepwalk its way through this issue. The Fox-Sky deal must be rigorously tested, and the Murdochs should be called to appear in front of MPs to make guarantees about the future of the brands they could control.</p> <h2>A short-term boost for US<br></h2> <p>In the weeks since the US presidential election, financial markets have had a change of heart about Donald Trump\u2019s victory over Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>The knee-jerk reaction when the result came in was to assume the worst. Trump\u2019s programme was sketchy but seemed worrisome. He was threatening to get tough with China. He talked about protectionism. He had made minatory noises about the Federal Reserve. Put simply, Trump meant uncertainty, so markets sold off.</p> <p>This mood did not last long. Wall Street bulls quickly discovered a silver lining: Trump\u2019s plan to cut taxes and increase spending on America\u2019s creaking infrastructure.</p> <p>Dealers in New York think looser fiscal policy means stronger US growth, which in turn will lead to higher profits for companies quoted on Wall Street. Hence the surge in the Dow towards the 20,000 mark.</p> <p>The upbeat mood was only briefly interrupted by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/14/us-federal-reserve-raises-interest-rates-second-time-since-2008\">Fed\u2019s interest-rate announcement last week</a>. Wall Street quickly shrugged off the quarter-point rise in borrowing costs and the indication that 2017 would see three further increases.</p> <p>There were two main reasons for this. First, recent form suggests the Fed might not go ahead with next year\u2019s monetary tightening. When it raised rates a year ago, it hinted at four increases in 2016. Only one was actually delivered: the one last week. Second, Wall Street thinks that even if the Fed does go ahead, the economic impact will be modest.</p> <p>In the short term, at least, both assumptions seem reasonable. The Fed is certainly not trigger-happy when it comes to rates and Trump\u2019s fiscal policy should guarantee growth next year. But investors need to be wary. Most of the fiscal boost is going to come through tax cuts, which will inject both demand and inflation into an economy already running up against capacity constraints. At some point in 2017 the Fed will adopt a more aggressive stance. Shares will suffer as the economy slows down.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d083642685df7103f2d5c0ea78d5f6e155ec1e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d083642685df7103f2d5c0ea78d5f6e155ec1e4/0_204_3636_2182/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeff Bezos, chief executive officer of Amazon, during the meeting with Donald Trump last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeff Bezos, chief executive officer of Amazon, during the meeting with Donald Trump last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Tech v Trump? Could be interesting<br></h2> <p>Rarely can so much wealth and power have gathered around one table. In a meeting at Trump Tower last week the president-elect of the United States, Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/14/donald-trump-google-facebook-amazon-microsoft\">held talks with a group of technology bosses</a> that included Tim Cook of Apple, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook, Larry Page and Eric Schmidt of Google\u2019s owner Alphabet, and Elon Musk of Tesla.</p> <p>The executives left claiming it had gone well: Bezos even said he was \u201csuper-excited\u201d about the prospect of working with an \u201cinnovation administration\u201d. But photos of the meeting show a different story. Bezos looked grim, even frightened at times.</p> <p>This is hardly surprising. Trump waged a war of words with Bezos throughout the election, pledging to cause \u201cproblems\u201d for Amazon. He has also criticised Apple for its factories in China. The dynamics between Trump and tech \u2013 which will involve issues of trade, security and manufacturing \u2013 promises to be fascinating.</p>",

Hancock told MPs that the government must be \u201cscrupulously fair and impartial\u201d and that Bradley\u2019s role is \u201ca quasi-judicial one and it\u2019s important she acts independently and is not subject to improper influence\u201d. But that hasn\u2019t stopped the government before. Softbank\u2019s trip to Whitehall came on the day its bid was revealed, before the shareholder vote and before any regulator had cast an eye over the transaction. Instead, the government\u2019s silence looks like an attempt to distance itself from the Sky deal and depoliticise it. May has not even made a clear, public pledge to properly analyse the transaction. In contrast, Gordon Brown, Vince Cable, Tom Watson and plenty of other politicians outside government have had lots to say about the proposal \u2013 mainly that May must ensure that Ofcom conducts a public-interest test on the deal, seriously consider whether the Murdochs are fit and proper people to control Sky and its news operations, or even simply block the proposal. The government\u2019s silence is further evidence that the deal could be railroaded through by 21st Century Fox and Sky before any opposition is allowed to build up a head of steam. Supporters of the takeover claim that much has changed since Murdoch last tried to buy Sky in 2011. His business has been split in two, with newspaper brands such as the Sun and the Times held within News Corp and the TV and film assets run through Fox. Also, Google and Facebook now dominate the digital advertising market, transforming the outlook for news and content providers. But both of these defences are easily dismantled. Firstly, splitting News Corp and Fox does not change the fact that one family could end up with extraordinary influence over British media. Take a look at the boards of News Corp and Fox \u2013 Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch are the co-chairs of both, while James Murdoch is chief executive of Fox, on the board of News Corp, and chair of Sky. Secondly, recent changes in the media industry simply reinforce the importance of the established news providers emphasising their independence, credibility and quality. If the public question the veracity of what they read in newspapers or see on TV news, then it simply pushes more people to Facebook, Google and fake news. The government must not sleepwalk its way through this issue. The Fox-Sky deal must be rigorously tested, and the Murdochs should be called to appear in front of MPs to make guarantees about the future of the brands they could control. A short-term boost for US In the weeks since the US presidential election, financial markets have had a change of heart about Donald Trump\u2019s victory over Hillary Clinton. The knee-jerk reaction when the result came in was to assume the worst. Trump\u2019s programme was sketchy but seemed worrisome. He was threatening to get tough with China. He talked about protectionism. He had made minatory noises about the Federal Reserve. Put simply, Trump meant uncertainty, so markets sold off. This mood did not last long. Wall Street bulls quickly discovered a silver lining: Trump\u2019s plan to cut taxes and increase spending on America\u2019s creaking infrastructure. Dealers in New York think looser fiscal policy means stronger US growth, which in turn will lead to higher profits for companies quoted on Wall Street. Hence the surge in the Dow towards the 20,000 mark. The upbeat mood was only briefly interrupted by the Fed\u2019s interest-rate announcement last week. Wall Street quickly shrugged off the quarter-point rise in borrowing costs and the indication that 2017 would see three further increases. There were two main reasons for this. First, recent form suggests the Fed might not go ahead with next year\u2019s monetary tightening. When it raised rates a year ago, it hinted at four increases in 2016. Only one was actually delivered: the one last week. Second, Wall Street thinks that even if the Fed does go ahead, the economic impact will be modest. In the short term, at least, both assumptions seem reasonable. The Fed is certainly not trigger-happy when it comes to rates and Trump\u2019s fiscal policy should guarantee growth next year. But investors need to be wary. Most of the fiscal boost is going to come through tax cuts, which will inject both demand and inflation into an economy already running up against capacity constraints. At some point in 2017 the Fed will adopt a more aggressive stance. Shares will suffer as the economy slows down. Tech v Trump? Could be interesting Rarely can so much wealth and power have gathered around one table. In a meeting at Trump Tower last week the president-elect of the United States, Donald Trump, held talks with a group of technology bosses that included Tim Cook of Apple, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook, Larry Page and Eric Schmidt of Google\u2019s owner Alphabet, and Elon Musk of Tesla. The executives left claiming it had gone well: Bezos even said he was \u201csuper-excited\u201d about the prospect of working with an \u201cinnovation administration\u201d. But photos of the meeting show a different story. Bezos looked grim, even frightened at times. This is hardly surprising. Trump waged a war of words with Bezos throughout the election, pledging to cause \u201cproblems\u201d for Amazon. He has also criticised Apple for its factories in China. The dynamics between Trump and tech \u2013 which will involve issues of trade, security and manufacturing \u2013 promises to be fascinating.",

Why is it, after all that the IRS is pursuing Amazon and Facebook through the US courts over their European tax structures, but have never challenged Apple?",
