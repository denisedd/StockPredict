                "bodyText":"Right, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. A quick recap. December has got off to a lively start in the financial markets, with big moves in the commodity and foreign exchange arenas. Traders have driven the oil price sharply higher for the second day running. Brent crude has hit its highest level since October 2015, jumping by almost 5% to $54.31 per barrel. Despite questions over compliance, yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Opec deal is being seen as a real game-changer that could push prices higher - meaning fresh inflationary pressures and higher prices at the petrol pumps. The pound has also romped higher today, after Brexit minister David Davis offered the tantalising prospect of the UK paying to access the EU single market. The comments, made in parliament, fuelled hopes that Britain might avoid a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Sterling hit two-month highs, before dipping a little -- and is currently up 0.5% at $1.257. Government bonds have also sold off today, driving up the yield on benchmark US debt. UK borrowing costs also rose, with the yield on 10-year gilts up from 1.5% to 1.51%. And European stock markets have closed in the red: FTSE 100: down 30 points at 6752, -0.45% German DAX: down 106 points at 10534, -1% French CAC: down 17 points at 4560, -0.4% Investors are fretting about Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Italian referendum on constitutional reforms, and Austria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential election (between a far-right candidate and a Green). Get swotting up now! Over on Wall Street, machine and equipment firm Caterpillar briefly suspended its shares today so it could warn that analysts profit expectations are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctoo optimistic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Caterpillar cited various headwinds, such as Brexit uncertainty, Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slow recovery and volatility in the oil price. It also warned that any infrastructure programme from Donald Trump probably wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help its earnings in 2017. This is the key slide from its presentation to analysts: Caterpillar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price has been rising for weeks, on speculation that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to upgrade America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highways, airports and schools will mean more demand for its diggers and trucks. But Wall Street isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too worried by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning; Caterpillar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have resumed trading, up 0.25% on the day. Now this is interesting....oil giant BP has signed off on a $9bn project to expand its Mad Dog oil field in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The decision follows extensive work bringing the cost of the project down (at one stage, it was going to cost $20bn). And it shows that oil firms are prepared to invest in new projects, if they think the oil price makes it worthwhile. BP chief executive Bob Dudley says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This announcement shows that big deepwater projects can still be economic in a low price environment in the US if they are designed in a smart and cost-effective way. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It also demonstrates the resilience of our strategy which is focused on building on incumbent positions in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most prolific hydrocarbon basins while relentlessly focusing on value over volume.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But.... BP can never shake off memories of an earlier project in the Gulf, the Deepwater Horizon disaster at the Macondo oil field in 2010. Eleven workers were killed when the rig caught fire, creating one of the worst environmental disasters ever. Central Bank news! Agustin Carstens, head of the Bank of Mexico, has resigned. Carstens, one of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most experienced central bankers, has been appointed to run the Bank of International Settlements (BIS is basically the central bankers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 central bank). He will leave the Bank of Mexico in July 2017, and start at BIS three months later. Carstens deserves a change of job, having been battling to handle the impact of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pronouncements on the Mexican Peso. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michael McDonough says the news adds extra uncertainty, with Mexico already expected to hike interest rates next month: The top rung of central banking is a little like Formula 1 -- with a small number of candidates moving between a limited number of seats. So Carstens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 appointment may have a knock-on effect on the European Central Bank; board member Beno\u00c3\u00aet C\u00c5\u201cur\u00c3\u00a9 could possible have got the BIS job, but is now free for other challenges... Boom! The Brent crude oil price has just hit its highest level of the year. A barrel of Brent for February delivery just changed hands at $53.79, which is the most expensive since October 2015. Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprise supply cut is forcing traders to rapidly reassess their expectations. Jane Sydenham, investment director at Rathbone Investment Management, calls it a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcknee jerk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reaction to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whilst at present the news is good for the markets, it is much more difficult to say how this will play out in the longer term. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re currently experiencing a knee-jerk reaction, unsurprising since this is the biggest co-ordinated action in eight years. It is likely that this will run on for a little while longer but how the markets price in the unexpected oil inflation is something we are yet to see.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Former cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith, who campaigned for Brexit, has criticised the idea that Britain might make payments to the EU after leaving the bloc. He was responding to David Davis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suggestion that the UK would consider the idea. PA has the story: Prominent Brexit-backer Iain Duncan Smith claimed Mr Davis had given a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153convoluted\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd answer and may have been talking about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bridging arrangements\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to phase out UK contributions to the EU. The former cabinet minister insisted there was no way of reaching a deal to pay the EU for access to the single market. He told BBC Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s The World At One: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My sense is that I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that he was absolutely answering the question that was posed to him. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talking about here is how do you get a deal that allows British and Europeans to access each others\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 markets without the necessity of tariff barriers or artificial barriers against service etc. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s any way in which you can reach a deal whereby you say \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pay some money in and therefore you allow us access\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, because you might as well have tariff barriers at that point.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Other Brexit supporters have also expressed disquiet about this idea in the past; but it all depends on the kind of Brexit deal that Theresa May goes for. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pound rally follows the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best month since 2009. Sterling gained 6% against the euro in November, 1,5% against the US dollar, and almost 15% against the Japanese yen. It may show that the markets are becoming less worried about the UK, following more solid economic data since June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says: Momentum is particularly strong against the yen and its recent performance has been staggering, GBPJPY is up more than 14% since the start of November! Political risks around Brexit are receding, as political risks elsewhere start to bite. The cost to insure UK sovereign debt has fallen sharply since spiking back in June. Good economic news from America: its factory sector is growing at its fastest pace since the Brexit vote. The ISM manufacturing index has jumped to 53.2 in November, from 51.9 in October, which is the fastest rate since June. Firm said they were benefitting from strong domestic demand. A rival survey, from Markit, was also just released. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s even more encouraging, showing activity rising at a 13-month high. No wonder City traders may be looking frazzled: The US crude oil price has hit a five-week high, as traders push it through the$50 per barrel mark. Oil is surging even higher, as commodity traders continue to react to the Opec supply cut deal hammered out yesterday. Brent crude is now up 3% at $53.44 per barrel, a near two-month high, and a really substantial surge from $46/barrel before the Opec meeting. Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to cut output by 1.2m barrels per day looks like a real game-changer. The group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s secretary general, Mohammed Barkindo, is telling Bloomberg TV right now that it was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153historic landmark\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sam Wahab, director of oil and gas research at Cantor Fitzgerald Europe, believes the price could keep rising: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement has truly changed the landscape for oil over the coming years, putting a floor of $50 a barrel under oil prices. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Prior to this agreement, the environment of sub $50 oil was likely to persist, but this move sufficiently addresses the supply/demand dynamics, with some 3.5% of supply being cut from January. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It means 2017 will likely see prices around the $55-$60 a barrel mark, and we may yet see further jumps in prices as soon as next week if the non-OPEC members also agree a production cut at their meeting on Friday 9th December. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally has pushed the pound to nearly a three-month high against the euro. That means it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just 8% below its pre-referendum levels (having been down 15% at one stage). The pound just spiked even higher against the US dollar, after the latest American unemployment figures hit the wires. Sterling hit $1.268, up 1.7 cents, as data showed that the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefit has hit a 5-month high. The initial jobless claims figure rose to 268,000 last week, up from 251,000. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some more reaction to David Davis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments, and the bounce in the pound: Craig Erlam, chief market analyst with retail brokerage Oanda: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The idea that single market is still a priority is a move away from the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 line. Since the two or three major selloffs we saw earlier this year, the Bank of England has changed its stance to holding rates next year, the data has been better and now the rhetoric has softened.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sterling is on the tear this morning on hopes for a soft Brexit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153David Davis said the UK could contribute to the EU budget in return for access to markets and that has fuelled a rally for the pound.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chris Saint, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Currency Service \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rehabilitation is gathering steam, having broken through the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.19 level against the euro today for the first time in almost three months. A surge of nearly 1% versus the US dollar has also lifted the pound back above US$1.26. Gains come amid signs of a more compromising approach to upcoming Brexit negotiations from the UK government, with Brexit minister David Davis saying Britain would consider contributing to the EU budget in return for retaining access to European markets. Our Politics Live blog has full coverage of David Davis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments on Brexit: David Davis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suggestion that the UK could pay for access to European markets after Brexit have also sent the pound rallying against the euro. Sterling has gained nearly one eurocent to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.19, its highest point since September 7th. Caxton FX analyst Alexandra Russell-Oliver says that Davis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments are pushing the pound up. She also points out that the euro is suffering from fears of political instability, with two important votes taking place on Sunday: The pound rally, which has occurred against most major currencies has follows comments from Brexit Secretary Davis, which indicate that the UK may be willing to make trade-offs for access to the single market. The euro is currently under pressure in anticipation of the Italian Constitutional Referendum and Austrian Presidential Election, taking place on Sunday, where shock results could result in further volatility. The pound has surged by 1% this morning after Brexit secretary David Davis suggested that the UK could make payments in return for access to the European markets. The comments have fuelled hopes in the City that Britain might avoid a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial services industry, for example, could retain access to the single market after 2019 (the likely exit date). Our political reporter Jess Elgot explains what happened: David Davis has suggested that the government would consider making contributions to the EU budget in exchange for access to the single market, saying his Department for Exiting the EU would consider all options to get the best deal with the bloc. During questions in the House of Commons, the Labour MP Wayne David asked if the Brexit secretary would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153consider making any contribution in any shape or form for access to the single market\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Davis said the government would look at the options during the article 50 process over the next two years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The major criterion here is that we get the best possible access for goods and services to the European market,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And if that is included in what he is talking about, then of course we would consider it. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s her full story: This chart shows how the pound surged by one and a half cents, or 1.2%, since Davis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments, to $1.2650. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its highest level since the US election three weeks ago. Neil Jones, head of FX hedge fund sales at Mizuho, told Reuters that some traders have been racing to buy the pound -- or unwind bets against sterling. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These headlines suggesting Britain may be able to access the single market are generating substantial sterling demand from traders and investors looking to reduce their short positions and unwind hedges.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Consumers should brace for higher petrol prices soon, warns Michelle McGrade, chief investment officer of TD Direct Investing: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been clear for some time that the low price of oil has been hurting producers. In my view, it was only a matter of time before OPEC decided to cut production. A higher oil price, together with a strong US dollar, makes things tougher for UK consumers because not only will petrol be more expensive, but this could fuel a stronger surge in inflation than originally expected, as inflation is highly correlated to the price of oil. The combination makes for an unwelcome gift just before Christmas. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve checked with the AA about the report that filling up a car will soon cost an extra \u00c2\u00a35. They say that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s based on oil hitting $60 -- so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not there yet. But the 12% jump in the oil price this week is still going to hurt drivers... Back to Opec.... and the oil price is clinging onto today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains, as analysts keep kicking the tires of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal. Brent crude is hovering around $52.50, a 1.2% gain today. That means it has surged by 12% since yesterday morning, just before Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s members sat down and hammered out the supply cuts deal. City traders are pondering: Will Opec members actually deliver the production cuts they signed up to yesterday? Will non-Opec members support the deal by cutting supply (as Opec hopes)? Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says this uncertainty means the oil price could fall back: OPEC has suggested the deal is contingent on getting this 600,000 b/d from non-OPEC \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet know if it could unravel if this doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen. There are lots of pieces in the jigsaw that are yet to fall into place. If OPEC members stick to the script and if non-OPEC comes up with the goods we might be on for further gains in crude. If not this rally could easily lose momentum and fade. And.... the more the oil price goes up, though, the more incentive there is for US shale producers to turn their pumps back on. Bloomberg Gadfly writer Liam Denning reckons this issue will be crucial: Supporting the market in this way hands an opportunity to U.S. exploration and production firms to hedge future production at higher prices and expand their own drilling budgets to fill some of the gap left by Saudi Arabia, Russia and others. Over the next six months, we will see if OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coalition can hold. Assume it does -- a huge assumption at this point -- and in the following six months we will see how much the frackers will do to undermine it. His full take is here: Now this really is a moment..... unemployment across the eurozone has fallen below 10% for the first time in over five years, and is now at a seven-year low. Eurostat reports that the jobless rate fell to 9.8% in October. September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure has been revised down to 9.9% (from 10%). Eurozone unemployment hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been below 10% since April 2011, and October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading is actually the lowest since 2009. Over the last year, unemployment has fallen in 24 of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 28 members. The largest annual decreases were registered in Croatia (from 16.1% to 12.7%), Spain (from 21.2% to 19.2%) and Slovakia (from 11.1% to 9.1%). Italy and France have also reported falls in unemployment, as Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slow-but-steady recovery continues. Economists fear that British factories could hike their prices to help them handle a sharp rise in raw material costs since the summer. George Nikolaidis, senior economist at EEF, says the weaker pound is both a challenge and an opportunity for manufacturing: While the more competitive exchange rate means UK manufacturers are well positioned to capitalise on the recovery in demand in key export markets, higher input costs are coming through the manufacturing supply chain thick and fast to put the squeeze on profit margins. Manufacturers are inevitably looking to pass these costs on to customers adding to the inflationary pressures already building up in the UK economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mike Rigby, head of manufacturing at Barclays also believes consumers will be hit by higher prices next year: Exporters continue to take advantage of a weak sterling but it is increasingly looking like a case of having to take the rough with the smooth as businesses start to pass on higher import costs, which could accelerate inflationary pressures as we enter 2017.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And Jeremy Cook of World First fears that the recent jump in output could be slowing: Breaking: Growth in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector slowed last month, despite the weak pound helping firms export abroad. The UK factory PMI, which measures activity across the sector, has fallen to 53.4, down from 54.4 in October. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker than the City expected, but it does still show that the sector has expanded for four month running -- as the initial Brexit shock quickly ebbed away. Firms reported that output and new orders both expanded at a solid date. Markit, which compiles the figures, also warns that the weak pound is driving up import costs -- as well as making UK goods more attractive to overseas buyers. The effects of the weak sterling exchange rate continued to be felt by manufacturers during November. On the plus side, the boost to export competitiveness led to a further increase in new business from abroad. Companies reported improved demand from the USA, mainland Europe and the Middle East. The negative impact of the exchange rate was felt on the cost side. Average purchase prices rose at a pace close to October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s near six-year record and again at one of the fastest rates in the survey history. The Financial Times has a good piece about how some Opec members are paying a higher price than others to get the deal through: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: Saudi Arabia and its Gulf Arab allies, including Kuwait, United Arab Emirates and Qatar, have agreed to shoulder the bulk of the cuts. They are banking on a quick recovery in price to ensure they do not lose revenues or surrender market share to other suppliers. Iran and Iraq, which sit outside the Gulf bloc in the Middle East, have sacrificed less. Most oil analysts see the limited concessions they made to let the deal succeed as largely face-saving technical measures to placate the Saudis. Other members from Venezuela to Angola, which have agreed to cut part of their output in support of a 1.2m barrel-a-day reduction, have a patchy record of compliance with past deals. Despite Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s price surge, they may need an ongoing recovery to be convinced to do their share. Newsflash: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factor sector has posted its strongest growth in close to three years. Data firm Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly manufacturing PMI has risen to 53.7, up from 53.5 in October. Any reading over 50 shows an expansion, and this is the best reading since January 2014. The sector was driven by the Netherlands, Austria and Spain - while poor old Greece suffered its biggest contraction in a year. Factories also reported that cost pressures are rising sharply, meaning they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re paying more for raw materials. Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s production cut may make that worse.... Dominic Rossi, global CIO equities at Fidelity International, urges caution: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I would not get too excited by the Opec cut. Compliance will be a problem, and the Russians will pump more gas instead. In the meantime, the long-run marginal cost of US shale continues to fall. I would not chase this oil price rally too hard.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd City experts are a little sceptical that Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal will actually push oil prices much higher. Spanish banking group BBVA suggest warn that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153implementing and monitoring\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the deal could be constrained by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153geopolitical factors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (for example, Saudi Arabia and Iran are already backing rival sides in the Yemen conflict) Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ANZ bank point out that US shale producers could boost their own output, keeping a lid on prices. City analyst Louise Cooper questions suggests Iraq can stick to the deal: (Some of Iraq\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil fields are based in Iraqi Kurdistan, to the north of the country, where the peshmerga military forces are based) The Wall Street Journal has created an excellent graphic, showing how Opec has created the current oil glut by pumping harder, while US shale producers have cut back: The WSJ also explains how Saudi and Iran managed to settle on a deal: The member countries were faced with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very deep\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd abyss of low oil prices, and that won out over politics, said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of IHS Markit and a longtime oil-market watcher. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153OPEC is back in business,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mr. Yergin said in an interview. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This will rank as one of their historic decisions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Saudi Arabia and Iran, whose differences blocked a deal that aimed to freeze production earlier this year, made the deal possible by coming to a tortured compromise on production figures. Iran was allowed to increase its production by 90,000 barrels a day, a significant victory for the Islamic Republic as it tries to rebuild its economy after the end of Western sanctions. But the deal allows both Iran and Saudi Arabia to claim a win, by pointing to different sets of numbers. Iran, using production figures generated by OPEC, can say it is raising output, while Saudi Arabia can point to the Islamic Republic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s output figures and say that Iran is agreeing to a cut. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good day for the oil market, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good day for the oil industry,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said after the deal was reached. Shares in energy companies are jumping today too. In London, Royal Dutch Shell and BP are leading the risers on the FTSE 100; a higher oil price should mean higher profits. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says trader are ignoring concerns that the deal may not stick (especially if non-Opec members don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree their own cuts). Long-term apprehension surrounding the deal (and the potential for a pick-up in US shale production) will be thrown to the back of investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 minds as Brent regains a $52 handle and US Crude fast approaches $50 per barrel. How long can the post-deal rally last? Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal is bad news for motorists, as higher crude prices will swiftly lead to more expensive petrol. The front page of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Times declares that it could mean a litre of fuel costs 10p more, which swiftly adds up: Motorists face paying \u00c2\u00a35 more to fill up an average family car after a Saudi-led cartel struck a rare deal to boost the price of oil. Oil prices jumped by 8.9 per cent to $50.45 a barrel yesterday after the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec), which pumps a third of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil, agreed to limit output for the first time in eight years. Motoring groups warned that the agreement was likely to create an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unwelcome Christmas present\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for families by sharply pushing up prices on the forecourt. Petrol fell to 101p a litre in February after oil plunged to $27 a barrel as Iran increased production when sanctions were lifted. Some analysts now predict that oil could rise to $60 a barrel. According to estimates, this could push petrol to a two-year high of 123p a litre, from 114p today. The oil price has extended its gains this morning as the financial markets continue to digest Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s output cut deal. US crude oil smashed through $50 per barrel for the first time in a month this morning. Brent crude - oil sourced from the North Sea - jumped by another 1% to $52.73. Yesterday, oil surged by over 8% as it became clear that Opec had, for once, come up with a plan to tackle the oil glut. Traders are genuinely surprised that Opec members put their differences behind them in Vienna this week, and agreed to cut 1.2m barrels off their daily output, to 32.5m. Russia also caught the experts out; it is backing Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal by promising to trim its own output by 300,000 barrels per day. That means that non-Opec members may, as Opec hopes, chip in with a 600,000bpd reduction. Chris Weston of IG explains that this could give the deal extra teeth: The consensus was that we would get some sort of loose agreement from the collective that kept oil supported, but left the market asking many more questions. What we have seen however has been real meat on the bone, not just from gaining an understanding around production cut allocations from the more tricky OPEC members, including Iran and Iraq, but it seems Russia was so enthused by what they heard that they have increased their own production cut levels from 200,000 to 250,000 to 300,000 a day through the first half in 2017. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Opec members are still in celebratory mood after agreeing their first output cut in almost a decade. The oil cartel defied the sceptics yesterday, by announcing it would slash production by 1.2m barrels per day, in an attempt to tackle the glut of crude oil in the market. As we covered yesterday, this sent the oil price soaring - and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing further gains this morning. Analysts are now wondering if the deal will hold, and what it means for other producers, consumers, and the global economy. Also coming up today... Data firm Markit is publishing its latest manufacturing PMI reports, showing how factories around the globe fared last month. The big news overnight is that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector beat forecasts, expanding at its fastest rate in over four years. This may signal that China is, once again, relying on traditional smokestack \u00e2\u20ac\u0153industries\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd industries for growth, rather than transforming into a consumer-driven economy. We find out how Britain, and Europe, performed in the next couple of hours: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what to watch out for: 9am GMT: eurozone manufacturing PMI 9.30am GMT: UK manufacturing PMI 2.45pm GMT: US manufacturing PMI And there are also signs today that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing market is slowing. The Nationwide building society has reported that prices only rose by 0.1% in November, meaning prices were just 4.4% higher than a year ago.",

Hopes had been high that passage of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcprior actions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c contingent for the conclusion of a second review of the bailed out Greek economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c would have been concluded in time for Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, the last gathering of euro zone finance ministers this year. For prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 government, December 5<sup>th</sup> has been marked as the date debt relief talks could finally start.</p> <p>Instead, the leftist-led coalition has been faced with the daunting task of endorsing yet more austerity, the price of participation of the International Monetary Fund in Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third, 86 bn euro rescue programme. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s protestors, rallying outside the prime ministers offices, are among the thousands who will be hit by cuts expected to apply as of the New Year.</p> <p>But in a move interpreted as an olive branch, the German finance ministry announced today that the euro group would also discuss possible short-term debt measures for Greece at Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. The IMF has long said that euro zone countries must give Greece \u00e2\u20ac\u0153upfront, unconditional\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd debt relief to make it debt burden sustainable and allow the Washington-based organisation to take part in its bailout programme.

Stephen Brown, European economist at the consultancy, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The stagnation of Swiss GDP in Q3 demonstrates the negative impact that deflation and the strong franc have had on the economy. With a plethora of political risks in the euro-zone set to keep the franc strong, exporters are unlikely to get a respite soon... It was the weakest quarter for growth since Q2 2015 and a sharp slowdown from the 0.6% rise recorded in Q2.</p> <p>After stagnating in Q2, consumer spending growth eked out an expansion of 0.1% in Q3. Nevertheless, consumer spending growth has clearly been weak in recent quarters, possibly as a result of consumers responding to Switzerland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deflationary environment by delaying purchases. More encouragingly, investment rebounded by 0.5%. Meanwhile, government consumption edged down slightly, by 0.1%.</p> <p>In addition to the current strong level of the franc, next year exporters will also have to contend with a slowdown in growth and a plethora of political risks in the euro-zone, Switzerland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main trading partner. If just one of those risks were to materialise, it could act as a double-whammy for Switzerland by both exacerbating the euro-zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic slowdown and by prompting a renewed appreciation of the franc due to the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s safe-haven status. In all, then, we expect Swiss GDP growth to slow from about 1.5% this year to 1% in both 2017 and 2018.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d2a716706e3cb0dbe6262507dc6df1fd73069dd7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2a716706e3cb0dbe6262507dc6df1fd73069dd7/0_242_5256_3154/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Switzerland mountain railway, Glacier Express route between Andermatt and Oberalp Pass.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Switzerland mountain railway, Glacier Express route between Andermatt and Oberalp Pass.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: rusm/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58414398e4b015a427f76a69\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-02T09:49:58.127Z\">9.49am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Italian 10-year bond yields are heading for their biggest weekly fall since July, amid referendum jitters.</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-584141cce4b015a427f76a62\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-02T09:48:33.231Z\">9.48am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Construction was better than expected.

Essentially, Renzi wants to reduce the power of the Senate - the upper chamber of parliament, allowing for smoother implementation of legislation and potentially a more stable political system. However, the referendum has turned into a vote on Renzi himself, whose popularity has taken a sharp dip since his election in September 2014.</p> <p>We expect the political fallout to be contained. Even if Renzi resigns, recent history suggests that there is more probability of a technocrat government being installed. If a general election were to happen, the likelihood is that it would result in a fragmented coalition government that would find it difficult to pass legislation, owing to the very parliamentary system that Renzi is trying to reform.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote> <p>But there would be a negative impact on the already struggling economy.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 vote will reduce hopes of advancing the structural reform agenda, resulting in weaker growth for an already struggling economy.

And over in Greece, scores of disabled protestors have been taking to the streets as the governing coalition rushes to complete reforms ahead of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crucial meeting of euro zone finance ministers. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens: Once again the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakest link is in a race-against-the clock to complete reforms demanded by creditors keeping the debt-stricken country afloat. Hopes had been high that passage of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcprior actions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c contingent for the conclusion of a second review of the bailed out Greek economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c would have been concluded in time for Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, the last gathering of euro zone finance ministers this year. For prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 government, December 5th has been marked as the date debt relief talks could finally start. Instead, the leftist-led coalition has been faced with the daunting task of endorsing yet more austerity, the price of participation of the International Monetary Fund in Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third, 86 bn euro rescue programme. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s protestors, rallying outside the prime ministers offices, are among the thousands who will be hit by cuts expected to apply as of the New Year. But in a move interpreted as an olive branch, the German finance ministry announced today that the euro group would also discuss possible short-term debt measures for Greece at Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. The IMF has long said that euro zone countries must give Greece \u00e2\u20ac\u0153upfront, unconditional\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd debt relief to make it debt burden sustainable and allow the Washington-based organisation to take part in its bailout programme. At over 300 bn euro or 180 percent of GDP, Athens has by far the highest debt load in the EU. The IMF would consider 120 percent to be manageable. And Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management, said: With a December hike in the Fed Funds rate fully priced into markets, the latest set of payrolls would have to have been extremely weak to impact expectations. We expect the Fed to hike rates on December 14th and the market will move on to speculating on the timing and direction of the next move. With rising treasury yields impacting mortgage rates, other central banks still easing policy, and uncertainty over the scale and timing of any Trumpflation stimulus, we expect the Fed to remain cautious with the pace of rate hikes next year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, said: The decline in the unemployment rate to a new cyclical low of 4.6% last month, from 4.9% was due to a combination of a 160,000 increase in the household survey measure of employment together with a 226,000 decline in the labour force. The number of involuntary part-time workers fell by 220,000. As a result, the U6 unemployment dropped to an eight-year low of 9.3%, from 9.5%. The upshot is that the labour market appears to be approaching full employment. That said, the 0.1% m/m decline in average hourly earnings, which pushed the annual growth rate back down to 2.5%, from 2.8%, suggests that there is still a little slack left for the Fed to play with. A December rate hike is coming and, assuming that we see a major fiscal stimulus passed in the first half of next year, we expect an additional 100 basis points of tightening from the Fed next year, taking the fed funds target range to between 1.50% and 1.75% by end-2017.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Returning to the US economy, Alex Lydall, head of dealing at Foenix Partners, has a slightly different take on the labour market data. A rate hike in December is unlikely to be derailed from the afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report, but a poor wages number does give Janet Yellen food for thought. The headline figure of 178k was solid - along with a significant decrease in the Unemployment rate to 4.6% - but the premise of extra fiscal stimulus in a Trump era and letting wages naturally increase as the Fed have reiterated, could leave Yellen pondering future hikes if wages stutter. We are still likely to see a 0.25 hike this month, but the speed of next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery could be impacted if wages and participation rates continue to cause a headache. With risk appetite bullish from the OPEC agreement this week, the greenback could likely see some short-term weakness against the majors, with the notable exception of the risk associated this weekend with the Italian Referendum.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Meanwhile, my colleague Katie Allen writes: The Bank of England should be wary of rushing into interest rate rises to curb inflation, according to its chief economist, in a warning that the UK economy is vulnerable to a sharper slowdown next year than current forecasts would suggest. Andy Haldane said he was comfortable with the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current wait-and-see stance on borrowing costs as it weighs up the conflicting forces of a lower pound stoking inflation and the Brexit vote denting business confidence. Here is an interesting point Here is some instant reaction to the US jobs data. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, said: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s positive US job figures, coming on the back of good economic numbers across the board, will further increase the odds of a rate rise at the next Fed meeting in mid-December. The healthy labour market mirrors the momentum we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen in the economy since the summer, which has enjoyed strong PMI figures in both services and manufacturing. However, crucially, the participation rate has not risen, which may take some of the shine off these figures for the Fed. With the US presidential election suspense now behind us, it is Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rhetoric which will be of most interest to investors as they look ahead at what to expect in the new Trump era next year. If as expected, we see a swing towards fiscal stimulus, this may give the Fed greater scope to hike rates further in 2017. Fed decision making will no longer be solely data dependent, but policy dependent also.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Looking at a breakdown by sector, manufacturing jobs fell by 4,000 last month, the fourth monthly decline. Construction rose by 19,000 jobs following a 14,000 gain in October, and retail jobs fell for the second month in a row, by 8,300. As the US economy approaches full employment, monthly job gains have slowed from an average of 229,000 in 2015 to an average of 180,000 this year. The 178,000 increase in new jobs was slightly better than expected. Economists had pencilled in 175,000 jobs and an unchanged jobless rate of 4.9%. However, wage growth has slowed. Average hourly earnings fell 3 cents, or 0.1%, after rising 0.4% in October. This lowered the year-on-year growth rate to 2.5% in November from 2.8% in October, which was the biggest increase in nearly 7 1/2 years. The jobless rate hit 4.6%, the lowest in more than nine years, making it a near certainty that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its meeting on 14 December. The jobs report comes after a run of strong economic data. Breaking news: nonfarm payrolls show 178,000 new jobs were created in the US economy last month, compared with 142,000 in October (revised lower from 161,000). My colleague Sean Farrell has found out more. The owners have sold the property in Whitechapel to an undisclosed buyer, will leave in May 2017 and are in talks about what will happen to the business. It looks like it could be sold \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so it is likely to continue as a business. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest bell foundry which made Big Ben and the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia, is closing. Whitechapel Bell Foundry, which traces itself back to Elizabethan times and says it is the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest manufacturing company, said the decision was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in response to the changing realities of running a business of this kind\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The firm was set up in 1570 during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I and is one of two remaining bell foundries in the UK. It has changed ownership several times and moved sites. The foundry says it is listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest manufacturing company in continuous operation. Owners Alan and Kathryn Hughes said, according to the Daily Telegraph: We have made this decision with a heavy heart, but in response to the changing realities of running a business of this kind. The Bell Foundry in Whitechapel has changed hands many times, but it has always been a family business. My own family has owned the foundry since 1904, but other families have run the firm through its history, which stretches back to 1570.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A statement posted on the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website suggests that perhaps the company will reopen somewhere else. Whitechapel Bell Foundry Ltd announces, with regret, that by May 2017 it will cease its activities at the Whitechapel Road site that it has occupied since its move there in 1738. The company intends to complete work on all projects presently in hand during the coming months. It will not be entering into new contracts for the time being whilst discussions with the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staff and other interested parties regarding the future direction, ownership, and location of the company are ongoing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The dollar, measured against a basket of currencies, has dipped before the US jobs data. The dollar index has slipped 0.1% to 100.92 and is down 0.6% this week \u00e2\u20ac\u201c its first weekly fall in a month. The US currency is also on course for its first weekly decline in four weeks against the euro. The head of watchdog Ofcom has said that British regulators should be given wider powers to block mergers following the Brexit vote \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in particular if a company is strategically important. In a speech to the Institute for Government, Sharon White said Britain should use the opportunity provided by the referendum to beef up the capacities of its regulators. We have the opportunity to introduce a wider set of considerations in merger decisions, including policy or public-interest concerns where a company is deemed to have particular strategic significance for the UK.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But she added this should not lead to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153regulatory creep\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new powers for the sake of it\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She also called for the introduction of new protections for consumers. The US non-farm payrolls report is expected to show steady job growth, with a small pick-up to 175,000 new jobs forecast for November, from 161,000 in October. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, has looked at the markets: More losses for stock markets indicate the nervousness that is taking hold ahead of the Italian referendum. The slow pullback in US markets is also an indication that we are in the traditionally weak period of early December. Berkeley Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s numbers this morning gained the approval of shareholders, with the shares moving higher in early trading. Housebuilders remain one of the more interesting dynamics, with valuations still remarkably low, even if concerns remain about potential drop offs in demand. Non-farm payrolls are not expected to disrupt the steady procession towards a Fed rate hike in December, although wage growth is still not as strong as the Fed would like. We also have the Baker Hughes rig count at the end of the day, at a time when most London traders will either be well on their way home or in the pub. Still, it will be a number worth watching as questions remain over how US producers will act in the wake of the OPEC cut.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Time for a morning round-up. Key US jobs data are out at 1.30pm. Non-farm payrolls are expected to show 175,000 new jobs were created in November, up from 161,000 in October. European stocks are falling ahead of this weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Italian constitutional referendum and Austrian presidential election. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index fell as much as 1.2% and is now 1.1% lower at 337. Wall Street has fared better, where US stocks have hit record highs buoyed by expectations of fiscal stimulus by president-elect Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration. City of London Markets trader Markus Huber said: Many are of the opinion that traders will continue to favour US over European stocks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brent crude oil has been slipping all morning, and is now down 1% at $53.36 a barrel. It has eased from the one-year high hit yesterday following the Opec oil cartel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement to cut production on Wednesday, the first such deal in eight years. The UK construction sector has strengthened, but firms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 costs have also picked up on the back of the weaker pound, hitting a 5 1/2 year high. Here is our full take on the pick-up in UK construction activity. In other news today, train fares in the UK will go up by an average of 2.3% next year, the rail industry has announced. This was quickly condemned as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153another kick in the teeth for British passengers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by the Rail, Maritime and Transport union. The union said travellers already pay some of the highest fares in Europe to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153travel on rammed out and unreliable trains\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. You can read the full story here. Returning to the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction figures, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction. Mike Chappell, global corporates managing director for construction at Lloyds Bank commercial banking, said: As this survey shows, many construction firms, and particularly those at the top end of the supply chain, retain a cautiously optimistic outlook. Their mood has been helped by what was widely seen as a construction-friendly Autumn Statement, which included a new commitment from the chancellor to spend an increased proportion of GDP on infrastructure. This appears to amount to a Keynesian-style recognition that investment in infrastructure can itself help to stimulate the economy. On the flip side there remains some concern about the London market, which is seen as particularly exposed to a post-EU referendum slowdown. Our own research* shows that business confidence across the UK dropped slightly in November after a relatively high reading in October.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Paul Trigg, construction specialist and assistant head of risk underwriting at credit insurance firm Euler Hermes, said: Performance across the construction sector is clearly polarising as housebuilders report healthy profits and a number of high-profile contractors bring in the administrators. We expect the number of insolvencies in the sector to climb through next year. Low margin contracts continue to put serious pressure on company cash flows, with businesses unable to pass on further rises in input costs resulting from inflation. Pressure on cashflow will inevitably impact firms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ability to pay on time throughout the supply chain and construction companies will need to be extra careful when managing their credit books. The Autumn Statement provided some welcome news on both housing and infrastructure, but the industry needs clarity quickly on whether all of this is new money or just a repackaging of previous announcements.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Producer prices in the eurozone have jumped to their highest in more than four years in October as energy prices increased. The European Union\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statistics office said prices at the factory gate in the 19-member currency bloc climbed 0.8% in October, much more than expected. Compared with a year earlier, prices fell 0.4%. The figures will be welcomed by the European Central Bank in its battle against ultra-low inflation. Consumer price inflation has picked up recently and hit a 31-month high of 0.6% in November. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still far below the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target. Capital Economics have sent us their thoughts on the Swiss GDP numbers. Stephen Brown, European economist at the consultancy, said: The stagnation of Swiss GDP in Q3 demonstrates the negative impact that deflation and the strong franc have had on the economy. With a plethora of political risks in the euro-zone set to keep the franc strong, exporters are unlikely to get a respite soon... It was the weakest quarter for growth since Q2 2015 and a sharp slowdown from the 0.6% rise recorded in Q2. After stagnating in Q2, consumer spending growth eked out an expansion of 0.1% in Q3. Nevertheless, consumer spending growth has clearly been weak in recent quarters, possibly as a result of consumers responding to Switzerland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deflationary environment by delaying purchases. More encouragingly, investment rebounded by 0.5%. Meanwhile, government consumption edged down slightly, by 0.1%. In addition to the current strong level of the franc, next year exporters will also have to contend with a slowdown in growth and a plethora of political risks in the euro-zone, Switzerland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main trading partner. If just one of those risks were to materialise, it could act as a double-whammy for Switzerland by both exacerbating the euro-zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic slowdown and by prompting a renewed appreciation of the franc due to the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s safe-haven status. In all, then, we expect Swiss GDP growth to slow from about 1.5% this year to 1% in both 2017 and 2018.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Italian 10-year bond yields are heading for their biggest weekly fall since July, amid referendum jitters. Construction was better than expected. Housebuilding remained the best performer, even though its expansion slipped to a three-month low. Commercial activity bounced back after five months of decline, while civil engineering remained the weakest area. Overall, incoming new construction work was the strongest since March, after declining through the summer in the wake of the EU referendum. Some construction firms noted that their workloads had been boosted by a resumption of projects that were delayed after the Brexit vote. However, there were also reports that the stronger inflation backdrop had led to intense competitive pressures and squeezed margins. The bounceback in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction industry has continued in November, with the sector expanding at the fastest rate since March, according to a survey. Commercial work picked up for the first time in six months. However, cost inflation also picked up and is now the strongest for 5 1/2 years. The purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index from Markit/CIPS rose to 52.8 in November from 52.6 in October. Also on Sunday, Austria holds a presidential election that could see Norbert Hofer of the Freedom Party become the first far-right head of state elected in western Europe since World War II. In Italy, prime minister Matteo Renzi has said he will stand down if voters reject a constitutional reform. But this does not necessarily mean fresh elections. Italian president Sergio Mattarella could ask Renzi to stay, ask another centre-leftist politician to form a new government or try to persuade Silvio Berlusconi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s centre-right party to join or support a caretaker government, as Reuters reports. Jaisal Pstakia, investment manager at Heartwood Investment Management, says: In all probability the Italian electorate is likely to reject Prime Minister Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposals for constitutional reform. Essentially, Renzi wants to reduce the power of the Senate - the upper chamber of parliament, allowing for smoother implementation of legislation and potentially a more stable political system. However, the referendum has turned into a vote on Renzi himself, whose popularity has taken a sharp dip since his election in September 2014. We expect the political fallout to be contained. Even if Renzi resigns, recent history suggests that there is more probability of a technocrat government being installed. If a general election were to happen, the likelihood is that it would result in a fragmented coalition government that would find it difficult to pass legislation, owing to the very parliamentary system that Renzi is trying to reform.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But there would be a negative impact on the already struggling economy. A \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 vote will reduce hopes of advancing the structural reform agenda, resulting in weaker growth for an already struggling economy. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate in 2016 has been one of the weakest among its euro peers, weighed down by high unemployment rates and a stalling credit cycle. Loan growth has fallen back into negative territory and demand is expected to be further constrained by tighter credit standards for both mortgages and corporates.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd European stocks are falling as investors nervously await this weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Italian constitutional referendum. Commodity stocks are among the biggest fallers, with oil prices sliding today, and financial shares are also down. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pan-European Stoxx 600 index is down 1.2%, the lowest in more than three weeks. Simon Smith, chief economist at FX Pro, said: We have the Italian constitutional referendum over the weekend. This has the potential to induce some volatility in the early part of next week. There are still a lot of undecided voters, so although the no side is ahead, the result is not a given. And even if this does come to fruition, a rejection of the reforms would lead to political instability in Italy and quite possibly to early elections.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We are going to spend less on Christmas this year, PricewaterhouseCoopers reckons. Its survey shows the average UK adult expects to spend around \u00c2\u00a3280 on gifts. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the first time the consultancy firm has done this survey, but it says other reports suggest spending was around \u00c2\u00a3300-\u00c2\u00a3400 last year, so this would indicate a dip in Christmas spending. Around 4% of people said they wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t buy any presents. A quarter expect the effects of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote to leave the European Union to have an impact on how much they spend this Christmas. However, the majority (67%) expect no impact at all. More than half (53) said they would make their purchases online this Christmas, compared to 43% in store. In the UK, Berkeley Group, which builds luxury homes in London and the south east, has taken a hit from Brexit uncertainty and rising stamp duty. But the company still made a pretax profit of \u00c2\u00a3392.7m in the six months to October, up 34% from a year earlier. It sold fewer homes but at a higher price \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the average selling price rose to \u00c2\u00a3655,000 from \u00c2\u00a3506,000 last year. However, chief executive Rob Perrins said reservations had fallen 20% in the housebuilder\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first half, similar to guidance given in June. This fall in volume is due to higher stamp duty, the extraordinary attack on buy-to-let landlords \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such an important part of sustaining the London market and increasing the supply of new homes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the uncertainty caused by Brexit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd You can read the full story here. Meanwhile, the Finnish economy expanded 0.4% in the third quarter. The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statistics office revised down an earlier estimate of 0.5%. GDP rose 1.6% from a year earlier. Finland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is slowly recovering following years of stagnation caused by the decline of Nokia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former phone business and the impact of the recession in neighbouring Russia. The Swiss economy has stalled: Swiss GDP figures came out earlier this morning, and showed the economy was flat in the third quarter compared to the second. It grew by 1.3% year-on-year. The figures were worse than expected and the weakest in more than a year, as Switzerland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s export-led economy struggled with the strong franc. Economists had pencilled in 0.3% growth. The Swiss National Bank ditched a cap on the franc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value against the euro almost two years ago. European stocks have opened lower, as expected. FTSE 100 index in London down more than 50 points at 6701.22, 0.77% fall Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax down 0.9% France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC down 0.7% Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex down 0.6% Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE Mib down 0.6% Portugal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PSI20 down 0.4% It emerged earlier this week that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new plastic \u00c2\u00a35 note contains animal fat, which caused a storm on Twitter and the launch of a petition on behalf of vegans, vegetarians and some religious groups. It has been signed by more than 121,000 people. A day later, the Bank of England bowed to the pressure and issued a statement saying that it had asked its polymer supplier, Innovia, to find an alternative. The central bank said that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an extremely small amount of tallow is used in an early stage of the production process of polymer pellets, which are then used to create the base substrate for the five pound note\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The Australian pioneer of the polymer bank note has now waded into the row, saying it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stupid\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that vegetarian and vegans are protesting in the UK about the five pound polymer note containing tallow. Professor David Solomon told the Australian radio station 2GB: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stupid. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s absolutely stupid. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trivial amounts of it in there.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Solomon said polymer notes were extremely hard to forge and had a lot more benefits for the consumer than previous paper notes. It picks up less drugs than paper notes and you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t chop down trees. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more hygienic than a paper note by a long way.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US non-farm payrolls day, always a big event for the US dollar. Analysts are forecasting that 175,000 jobs were created in November, up from 161,000 in October. The Federal Reserve is already widely expected to raise interest rates in December as recent economic data have mostly been strong. Yesterday surveys showed manufacturing grew faster than expected in November. Here in the UK, we will get a monthly industry survey on construction at 9:30am GMT. Oil is drifting lower this morning, after hitting a one-year high following the Saudi-led Opec cartel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement to cut output on Wednesday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the first such agreement in eight years. Russia, the biggest non-Opec oil producer, also agreed to reduce its output gradually. Brent crude is trading at $53.37, down 1%. European stocks are expected to open lower.",

Earlier we listed <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/dec/05/italy-referendum-matteo-renzi-markets-spooked-shares-bonds-eurozone-live?page=with:block-5845296ee4b056d3d56ad74d#block-5845296ee4b056d3d56ad74d\">six reasons why markets did not drop sharply after the Italian news</a></strong>.

But it may represent Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first step along a path towards the euro-zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit door. As a result, we think that the risks for Italian bond yields are skewed to the upside.</p> <p>The outcome prompted little reaction in financial markets. The euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall proved short-lived and the yield of 10-year Italian government bonds rose by just 10bp or so to around 2.0%. This is hardly surprising given that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd vote and subsequent resignation by Prime Minister Matteo Renzi had largely been discounted, and that the risk of an imminent Italian exit from the euro-zone remains very small.</p> <p>So what happens now? Despite doubling in recent months, the 10-year yield is not abnormally high and is a far cry from its level at the height of the euro-zone crisis in 2011. In fact, if anything, it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the yields of other bonds \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have been kept artificially low by the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s asset purchases in the past two years. So there is plenty of scope for it to climb as political events unfold against a backdrop of renewed economic stagnation and ongoing concerns about the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking sector...</p> <p>Admittedly, any substantial rise in the yield will probably depend on a snap election being called, which would give the anti-euro Five Star Movement (M5S) an opportunity to seize power. While we doubt there will be an early election, we cannot rule out the possibility altogether...</p> <p>Granted, the euro-zone authorities are far better equipped to deal with upward pressure on yields today than they were back in 2011/12. However, such support would probably be conditional on certain commitments being made by the Italian government, especially regarding continued membership of the monetary union. This would be a difficult condition to satisfy if M5S, potentially along with eurosceptic allies in other political parties, were to form a government and pledge to hold a referendum on euro membership. So in this case, we think Italian bond yields would surge.</p> <p>Even if the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153best-case scenario\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for bonds came to pass \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where a new Prime Minister were asked to head the existing government relatively quickly and an early election were avoided \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we expect that it would only provide temporary respite for Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bond market given the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s troubles. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5845926fe4b056d3d56ad988\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-05T16:16:10.397Z\">4.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The market may not have gone into meltdown after the Italian vote, but there could be some weakness ahead, not least because of the latest European Central Bank meeting later this week. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>They came, they saw and they voted. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to reject Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s constitutional reforms has not produced the feared apocalypse in global markets. Instead, we have seen European markets trade in positive territory, aside of course from the Italian index, which is still under pressure thanks to its embattled banking sector.</p> <p>Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bounce today definitely has the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrelief rally\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 feeling to it, so in the face of a rising euro and pre-ECB nerves it will be interesting to see whether gains can be sustained in coming sessions. No-one really expected Brexit or Trump, but here the result was priced in, and as a result we may well have to endure some extended weakness now that the initial excitement is out of the way.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58458833e4b015a427f77bea\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-05T15:32:37.313Z\">3.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with Italy, and Reuters is reporting the fate of struggling Monte dei Paschi may not be known for a few days yet:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Livesquawk/status/805795943543173120\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Decision On Monte Paschi&#39;s Recapitalisation Plan To Be Taken In 3-4 Days After Political Situation Becomes Clearer \u00e2\u20ac\u201c RTRS Sources</p>&mdash; Livesquawk (@Livesquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Livesquawk/status/805795943543173120\">December 5, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Potential investors in the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cash call are reportedly waiting to see the political developments before making any commitments.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-12-05T16:17:58.386Z\">at 4.17pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58458444e4b049350cc96196\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-05T15:14:23.954Z\">3.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More on the ISM figures:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/econhedge/status/805789408645550080\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">strong production and employment the standouts within a robust non-manuf ISM report <a href=\"https://t.co/JqzSVclS7T\">pic.twitter.com/JqzSVclS7T</a></p>&mdash; econhedge (@econhedge) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/econhedge/status/805789408645550080\">December 5, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58458233e4b049350cc96189\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-05T15:06:56.759Z\">3.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The US data is likely to increase speculation of an interest rate rise next week.

The government has solicited institutional investors to recapitalise MPS, but many had made investment conditional on a Yes vote. Some will see the result as proof that Italy is incapable of reform, and may pull back. </p> <p>Italy could soon face an agonising choice between three options. One would be to nationalise MPS. The second would be to rescue it under new European Union rules that would heap losses on to investors, among them retail investors who hold most of MPS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s subordinated debt.

                "bodyText":"The euro has continued to hold firm after recovering from its early falls in the wake of the Italian referendum. Against the dollar, it is currently at $1.076, its highest level since the middle of November. Meanwhile the pound is down around 1% against the single currency, at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1812. Italian bond yields, which initially spiked higher, fell back from earlier highs and are currently up around 6 basis points at 1.97%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has called on governments to tackle the problem of inequality around the globe. Katie Allen reports on his speech in Liverpool: The governor.. has issued a rallying cry to policymakers across advanced economies to tackle the causes of a growing sense of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153isolation and detachment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd among people who feel left behind by globalisation. Mark Carney used his first big speech since Donald Trump swept to power in America, to warn that open markets are under threat and that politicians must do more to share out the gains of global trade and the rise of technology. Carney reiterated the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stance that monetary policy could not be held accountable for rising inequality. He gave no new hints on the direction of interest rates in the UK and said rate-setters would continue to trade off the opposing forces of rising prices and uncertainty stemming from the Brexit vote. The main focus of his last speech of an eventful year, was inequality and he described current times as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the first lost decade since the 1860s\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Carney noted the rise in living standards around the world in recent decades and said technological progress had lifted more than a billion people out of poverty. But he recognised those advances had not been felt equally. The full report is here: Despite initial falls after the result of the Italian referendum and the subsequent resignation of prime minister Matteo Renzi, European markets have recovered to end the day higher. Apart that is from Italy itself, which fell back slightly. Earlier we listed six reasons why markets did not drop sharply after the Italian news. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 16.11 points or 0.24% higher at 6746.83 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax jumped 1.63% to 10,684.83 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 1% at 4574.32 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.67% at 8664.7 In Greece the Athens market added 1.03% to 620.29 But Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.21% to 17,050.21. In the struggling bank sector, Monte dei Paschi lost 4% ahead of news of the fate of its rescue plan, while Unicredit dropped 3% On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a new record high of 19,274.85 but is currently off its best levels, up 0.33% at 19233. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bonds are likely to continue to come under pressure despite the - relatively - muted response to the referendum, says Simon MacAdam at Capital Economics: The rejection of the Italian government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s constitutional reforms in Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum is not in itself a game-changer for the bond markets of Italy and the rest of the euro-periphery. But it may represent Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first step along a path towards the euro-zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit door. As a result, we think that the risks for Italian bond yields are skewed to the upside. The outcome prompted little reaction in financial markets. The euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall proved short-lived and the yield of 10-year Italian government bonds rose by just 10bp or so to around 2.0%. This is hardly surprising given that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd vote and subsequent resignation by Prime Minister Matteo Renzi had largely been discounted, and that the risk of an imminent Italian exit from the euro-zone remains very small. So what happens now? Despite doubling in recent months, the 10-year yield is not abnormally high and is a far cry from its level at the height of the euro-zone crisis in 2011. In fact, if anything, it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the yields of other bonds \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have been kept artificially low by the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s asset purchases in the past two years. So there is plenty of scope for it to climb as political events unfold against a backdrop of renewed economic stagnation and ongoing concerns about the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking sector... Admittedly, any substantial rise in the yield will probably depend on a snap election being called, which would give the anti-euro Five Star Movement (M5S) an opportunity to seize power. While we doubt there will be an early election, we cannot rule out the possibility altogether... Granted, the euro-zone authorities are far better equipped to deal with upward pressure on yields today than they were back in 2011/12. However, such support would probably be conditional on certain commitments being made by the Italian government, especially regarding continued membership of the monetary union. This would be a difficult condition to satisfy if M5S, potentially along with eurosceptic allies in other political parties, were to form a government and pledge to hold a referendum on euro membership. So in this case, we think Italian bond yields would surge. Even if the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153best-case scenario\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for bonds came to pass \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where a new Prime Minister were asked to head the existing government relatively quickly and an early election were avoided \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we expect that it would only provide temporary respite for Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bond market given the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s troubles. The market may not have gone into meltdown after the Italian vote, but there could be some weakness ahead, not least because of the latest European Central Bank meeting later this week. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: They came, they saw and they voted. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to reject Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s constitutional reforms has not produced the feared apocalypse in global markets. Instead, we have seen European markets trade in positive territory, aside of course from the Italian index, which is still under pressure thanks to its embattled banking sector. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bounce today definitely has the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrelief rally\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 feeling to it, so in the face of a rising euro and pre-ECB nerves it will be interesting to see whether gains can be sustained in coming sessions. No-one really expected Brexit or Trump, but here the result was priced in, and as a result we may well have to endure some extended weakness now that the initial excitement is out of the way. Back with Italy, and Reuters is reporting the fate of struggling Monte dei Paschi may not be known for a few days yet: Potential investors in the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cash call are reportedly waiting to see the political developments before making any commitments. More on the ISM figures: The US data is likely to increase speculation of an interest rate rise next week. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: An above-expectations uptick in ISM non-manufacturing PMI for November suggests that the US services sector \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which accounts for two-thirds of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic activity \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has remained a robust proposition in the weeks since Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprise election victory... The most immediate implication of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data is its impact on next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FOMC meeting, where Fed Chair Janet Yellen is expected to finally pull the trigger on the first interest rate hike for a year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Despite the worries about Europe and the surprise election of Donald Trump as US president, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service sector put in a strong performance in November. The ISM non-manufacturing PMI came in at 57.2, up from 54.8 in October and better than the forecast 55.4. This is the highest figure since October 2015. Earlier there were also PMI figures from Markit which came in broadly in line with expectations: Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, Michael Noonan, has told reporters in Brussels that the European Central Bank won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks failed. Speaking before this afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurogroup talks, Noonan said: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always a concern when you hear about banks being weak, and some Italian banks are weak. But the president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, is Italian and I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t envisage a situation in which the ECB under Mario Draghi will let the Italian banks get into difficulty. Draghi won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be around for ever to save the Italian banks, though - his term expires in October 2019. Over in the US, the post election market rally continues. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has hit a new peak of 19,261 lead by banking stocks and - with the continuing rise in the crude price - energy companies. The index has slipped back from the record high but is still up around 73 points or 0.3%. The S&amp;P 500 opened 0.4% higher and the Nasdaq Composite 0.5%. Eurogroup finance ministers are now holding talks about Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout, and Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 repeated calls for debt relief. However, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not expecting any major breakthrough today, as the latest review of its bailout programme isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t finished yet. Yikes! Italian banking shares are falling again as the markets watch anxiously for signs that the plan to recapitalise the sector is at risk. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no word yet about Monti dei Paschi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn capital raising plan, following the meeting of investors who had been planning to back the cash call. The eurogroup is also calling on Germany, the Netherlands and Luxembourg to boost their spending to help Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grow. In a statement, they say that the three countries are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153over-achieving\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd their medium-term objectives (ie, running fiscal policy that is too tight). \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Eurogroup acknowledges that these member states could use their favourable budgetary situation to further strengthen their domestic demand and growth potential, depending on country specific circumstances, while respecting the medium-term objective, the national budgetary prerogatives and national requirements.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Asked if Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote is a blow to European reform plans, Dijsselbloem says The referendum took place, the Italian people said no, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear. On a wider level, all European counties need to ensure they have modern judicial systems, political systems capable of taking difficult decisions, and efficient public administrations. The next Italian government will have to consider whether constitutional reforms are needed, he adds. Economist Megan Greene isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t surprised that Italy can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t commit to new budget cuts or privatisations today, as the eurogroup would have liked. Ouch! Jeroen Dijsselbloem singles out Italy as one of eight eurozone members whose 2017 budgets aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t up to scratch. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting agreed that Belgium, Italy, Cyprus, Lithuania, Slovenia, Finland, Spain and Portugal have submitted budget plans that risk non-compliance with the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget rules, the eurogroup chief tells today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference. For seven of those countries, their respective finance ministers all agreed to take new steps to ensure their budgets are in line. But obviously Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pier Carlo Padoan has ducked out of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting to address domestic matters. And Dijsselbloem admits that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impossible\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to expect Italy to commit to new measures right now. We agreed that at this juncture, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s difficult for the Italian government to commit now to new additional measures. The eurogroup invites Italy to take necessary steps in the near future to ensure that its budget is compliant, he concludes. Heads-up. The eurogroup are holding a press conference now, following this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talks (they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re spoiling us with a SECOND press conference tonight). Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem says ministers have been discussing the draft budget plans for 2017. He says the eurozone economy is continuing to recover. Growth is forecast in every member state, and will continue to strengthen. And \u00e2\u20ac\u0153almost all member states\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are expected to achieve the target of keeping their deficits below 3% of GDP. The press conference is being streamed live here Several eurozone finance ministers have played down the dangers posed by Italy, as they gathered in Brussels for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurogroup meeting -- where Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call for debt relief will be discussed. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble said he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see a crisis looming, but insisted that Rome must press on with economic reforms. He told reporters that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is no reason to talk about a euro crisis\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think we have to take this with a dose of serenity. Italy urgently needs a government that is ready to act.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michel Sapin argued that Italian voters hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rejected the EU yesterday: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The referendum was a question on domestic Italian politics... not about Europe, on European policy, or on the place of Italy in Europe.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Eurogroup ministers didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem too distraught by Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall, either, judging by these photos: Thanks to AFP for the quotes. No wonder City veterans talk about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153playing the Forex\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: Writing in the Economist, John Hooper explains why the rescue of Monte dei Paschi bank is now in trouble: Many observers had expected a No vote, if a narrower one, and markets have already priced in some of the risk. But the defeat worsens the problems of Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking system, and particularly of its shakiest bank, Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS), the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third-largest. The government has solicited institutional investors to recapitalise MPS, but many had made investment conditional on a Yes vote. Some will see the result as proof that Italy is incapable of reform, and may pull back. Italy could soon face an agonising choice between three options. One would be to nationalise MPS. The second would be to rescue it under new European Union rules that would heap losses on to investors, among them retail investors who hold most of MPS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s subordinated debt. Or, faced with the prospect of having to impoverish these voters, the government might simply decide to break the rules, whatever the cost to the credibility of the single currency and its nascent banking union. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum result isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the trigger for a new eurozone crisis, insists Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem. Arriving in Brussels to chair today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eurogroup meeting of finance chiefs, Dijsselbloem told reporters in Brussels that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe it is (the start of a new crisis). There is no reason for that. Political instability makes it more complicated for Italy and the euro zone. But it is a new reality we have to work with.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Italy is a large economy, one of the largest in Europe, it has strong institutions. You can see that market reaction so far has been moderate.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The euro has also rallied against the pound this morning. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up around 0.3% today, pulling sterling down to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.189. It had been as high as \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.20 in overnight trading, as Asian markets reacted to the Italian vote. Boom! The euro just hit its highest level since mid-November, as the single currency shakes off Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum result. It just hit $1.07 against the US dollar, or almost 1.5 cents above Sunday night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lows. City analyst Louise Cooper has a few theories as to why: A lot of the political risk of Italy voting No was already priced in. Unlike Trump and Brexit, this was an outcome the pollsters expected. Secondly Italy has a long history of political instability. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation and the possible creation of a technocratic government is not that unusual. Thirdly, Traders and investors learnt from Tump and Brexit, to buy on short term weakness. You could have made 10% out of the FTSE100 and the S&amp;P500 if buying at the bottom and selling just a couple of weeks later. And fourthly no one quite knows where this referendum vote takes us. It maybe could take us eventually to Italy leaving the Euro. But we are a long way from that eventuality. This Bloomberg screen grab shows how some Italian bank shares were hit this morning: City investors are watching Italy nervously for signs that the programme to strengthen its banks is still on track, or veering off course. Matteo Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation increases the risk that the banks can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be rescued with private sector money, and will need an official aid package. And that would be politically awkward, as bond holders must be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbailed in\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, meaning losses for some investors. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear if those losses would extent to retail investors (individual households). We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expecting to hear news within hours from the crucial meeting of investors who had been planning to join the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn cash call for Monte dei Paschi. If that deal falls apart, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest bank might be part-nationalised, says the FT. G+ economist Lena Komileva believes Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defeat could accelerate the push to recapitalise Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks, and encourage Brussels to approve any plan. Matteo Renzi can take some credit for calming the markets today, by promising to resign so swiftly last night. That pledge diluted the uncertainty created by the referendum result, says Carlo Alberto De Casa, chief analyst at ActivTrades: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quick decision to resign was the best thing in this situation for Italy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The next few hours will be crucial for the country, trying to understand if they will go to vote or if there will be a technocrat government to reform the electoral law. Indosuez Wealth Management chief economist Marie Owens Thomsen dismisses talk of a new eurozone crisis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our base scenario is a caretaker government which could be in place before Christmas, and no new elections before 2018. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If indeed things pan out according to our base scenario, there would be little reason for any broad-based turmoil. It is still utterly unlikely that Italy would leave the EU or the euro. So this has helped the euro claw back last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now worth \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.065 again). CNBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Gemma Acton points out that the European Central Bank meets on Thursday, and could reassure the markets by extending its QE scheme by another six months (it expires in March 2017). Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, has pulled out of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting of eurozone finance ministers. That may mean he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be involved in the post-Renzi talks today: Here are a few reasons why the financial markets aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t having an almighty tantrum over Matteo Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation. 1) Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defeat was priced in. After a bad year, opinion pollsters can celebrate getting one vote right. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been predicting for months that the No campaign would win Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum, so investors have had plenty of time to prepare. Lee Hardman, currency analyst at MUFG, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The broader financial market impact has, so far, been relatively limited as evident by only modest gains for traditional safe haven currencies like the yen and Swiss franc. Investors are not expecting financial market stability to be disrupted significantly in the near-term. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The rejection was signalled in advance by the opinion polls \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one likely reason for the limited initial financial market reaction. 2) Italy isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t about to crash out of the eurozone. Greece proved last year that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very hard to check out of the single currency, even if relations with your creditors have hit breaking point. Italy isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t facing funding problems, and the public aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t clamouring for a return to the lira. 3) Super Mario is standing by The European Central Bank has weapons on hand to help Italy, if needed. If borrowing costs spike, the ECB can step in and mop up some bonds. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a short-term fix, but it might deter speculators from taking on Mario Draghi and trying to profit from the political instability. 4) Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote was (partly) about preserving the status quo Renzi was defeated by a broad-ranging coalition which included respected former PM Mario Monti, as well as the radical Five Star Movement. City analyst Marc Ostwald argues that we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see it as just a populist revolt: Their argument that the Italicum would concentrate too much power in the hands of the PM, and thus heightens the risk of the emergence of a Mussolini type figure, while technically undeniable, is still a smokescreen for the preservation of Machiavellian modus operandi that has seen have 64 governments since World War II - it has therefore precisely nothing to do with either the Brexit referendum or Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential victory And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also possible that whoever succeeds Renzi as PM will push through electoral reforms (unless a snap election is called). 5) This might speed up the task of fixing Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks. No-one doubts that the Italian banking sector needs serious repair, to tackle the bad loans that have been lingering since the financial crisis struck. So Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defeat could spur banking bosses into taking tough action, such as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbailing-in\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bondholders and merging with rivals. Claudio Scardovi, managing director of AlixPartners, says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153urgent restructuring and consolidation is needed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There must be a radical restructuring plan for ailing banks, some of which could entail a partial \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bail in\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and liquidation, potentially accompanied by a pre-emptive government recapitalization for an estimated Euros 10-20 billion. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These restructurings are likely to be followed, or accelerated in parallel, by a long overdue consolidation of the Italian banking system through mergers and acquisitions of small and mid-sized banks. 6) Investors could be too complacent, and not thinking of the long-term Many commentators are pointing out that Italy goes through a lot of prime ministers, so Matteo Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defeat isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t all that important. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not totally convinced -- Italy doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a stockpile of reforming politicians to dip into, so Renzi (once seen as The Man to tackle its problems) may be sorely missed. Alberto Nardelli of Buzzfeed (an Italian politics expert) argues that the anti-euro forces have been strengthened: But in the short term, investors have more immediate issues -- like Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU, and Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s imminent arrival in the Oval Office. European Central Bank Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny says we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t panic about Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking sector: He told a news conference in Vienna: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These are problems of individual banks. It is not a problem of the entire banking system. It is therefore important to tell the difference and these are in my view problems that can be solved.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This chart from Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ed Conway shows how the euro has recovered from its tumble on Sunday night, when the Italian exit polls showed that Renzi had lost: Ed also agrees that we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t panic about the selloff in Italian bonds this morning: European economics commissioner Pierre Moscovici has urged investors not to turn Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political drama into a crisis. Moscovici told France 2 television that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a solid country with solid authorities and I have complete confidence that Italy can handle this situation. There is some political instability but the country is extremely stable and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a big economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Moscovici also denied that the result was another snub to the European Union: Nothing to do with it....It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a domestic constitutional amendment in Italy which has not managed to get through. (thanks to Reuters for the quotes) The cost of insuring Italian debt against default has hit a three-year high today, but it remains well below crisis levels. Reuters has the details: Five-year Italian credit default swaps rose nine basis points from Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close to 180 bps, their highest since December 2013, according to data from Markit. Renzi has said he will resign and this may open the door to early elections next year and the possibility of an anti-euro party, the 5-Star Movement, gaining power. Italian banking shares are bouncing back from their early losses. Even Monte dei Pasche has jumped -- perhaps a sign that its \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn rescue plan is still on course? As feared Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main stock market has fallen at the start of trading. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just rebounded, following other European markets higher! Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX has jumped by 1%, and the FTSE 100 is showing solid gains too: This is partly because many investors had expected the Italian public to reject Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s constitutional reforms -- which would have weakened the Senate and given the prime minister more power. And if Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration is succeeded by a coalition, rather than by immediate snap elections, the immediate impact of his defeat may be limited. But in the long term, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deep-seated economic problems remain. Maria Paola Toschi, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, fears \u00e2\u20ac\u0153negative implications\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the Italian economy. Structural issues in Italy have contributed to a prolonged period of low growth and declining competitiveness in recent decades. Renzi and his government pursued a very ambitious programme of reform aimed at addressing some of these issues\u00e2\u20ac\u201dof which the Senate reform that has been voted down in the referendum was a crucial part. The referendum was therefore seen as a political test for the government\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand the No victory was considered a vote of no confidence, putting at risk the survival of the current coalition. The euro is continuing to claw its way back from last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dive, as investors digest Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defeat. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital dubs it a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fairly ordered response\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: A \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcNo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 vote had already been priced in although the scale of the defeat for Matteo Renzi has surprised and leads to the prospect of fresh elections next year. Shares in Monti dei Paschi, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest bank, have slumped by 6% in early trading. Traders are clearly concerned that Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defeat has put the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rescue plans in doubt. Italian media are reporting that investors will meet this morning to decide whether to back Monti Dei Paschi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to raise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn in new fundraising. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets say: Attention now turns to Monte di Paschi, which was due to do a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn recap this week. It will meet the two underwriters this morning to decide whether to go ahead. If they pull out, the expectation is the bank would be nationalised. Shares in Italian banks have fallen sharply at the start of trading in Milan. The main banking index had slid by 3%, hit by fears that the ongoing attempts to strengthen several lenders could be at risk. Unicredit has lost 4%, with many smaller lenders badly hit too: There are particular fears about Monte dei Paschi, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest bank, which is trying to raise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn in new capital and offload \u00e2\u201a\u00ac28bn of bad loans. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says that rescue plan could be at risk: The No result in the referendum has undoubtedly made it harder to attract private sector capital to fill Monte dei Paschi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gaping capital hole, and bring it back up to a standard where it could pass under the low bar of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stress test, which it failed in the summer. The risk is, that investors lose faith that it will be able to do this, which triggers a run on the bank and a full blown financial crisis that starts in the currency bloc, but could emanate around the world. Italian government bonds have been hit in early trading, following Mattei Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defeat in last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum. But the losses aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t massive, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not looking at a full blown crisis here. The interest rates on Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-year government bond has jumped to 2.01%, up from 1.9% on Friday. That means that investors think the debt is riskier, so are demanding a bigger return for holding the bonds. However, this is still a pretty low level -- five years ago, Silvio Berlusconi was forced to resign when Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-year bond yields smashed through 7%. AFS Group analyst Arne Petimezas points out that the gap between Italian and German borrowing costs has widened, but not too dramatically: This may show that investors had \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpriced in\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defeat, as recent opinion polls had predicted the No side would win. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be a volatile day in the European stock markets, after Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime minister announced his resignation after losing yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum on constitutional reforms. Matteo Renzi fell on his sword late last night, deepening Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political turmoil, after nearly 60% of the public voted against his proposed changes. The PM declared that: I take full responsibility for the defeat, He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expected to hand in his resignation to President Sergio Mattarella today: The euro plunged to a 20-month low after Renzi quit, as investors feared that another chapter of eurozone debt crisis drama was opening up. BUT.... the single currency has been clawing back some ground since, and is currently down just 0.5% at $1.053. European stock markets are expected to fall when trading begins at 8am GMT, led by Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main stock index, the FTSE MIB. Financial shares are likely to be hit hardest, on fears that Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation will scupper efforts to recapitalise the Italian banking sector. Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure is being painted as another triumph for anti-establishment, populist parties. But my colleague Stephanie Kirchgaessner explains that many voters had serious concerns about Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to shake-up the constitution: The proposed reforms, in effect, neutered the senate and would have given much more power to Renzi and future prime ministers. The prime minister, who started his political career as the mayor of Florence and was the youngest-ever prime minister when he assumed office in 2014, made constitutional reform a central plank of his premiership and argued for months that the changes would make Italy more stable and likely to adopt tough-but-needed economic and labour policies. But the prime minister did not overcome the steep decline in his own popularity and the mistrust of voters who were disappointed that he could not or did not do more to improve the economy and cut unemployment. For many the plebiscite ultimately became a vote of no confidence in the premier. Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s personality \u00e2\u20ac\u201c jovial but verging on arrogance \u00e2\u20ac\u201c made him seem far removed from the worries of ordinary Italians, some said. Our liveblog has full coverage of the Italian result, which came hours after Austria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential election was won by former Green Alexander Van der Bellen, who defeated the far-right Norbert Hofer. Italy isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only issue today either. Eurozone finance ministers are due to meet this afternoon to discuss Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout programme. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, has already fired a warning shot against those pushing for Greek debt relief. He told the newspaper Bild am Sonntag that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Athens must finally implement the needed reforms.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If Greece wants to stay in the euro, there is no way around it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in fact completely regardless of the debt level.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market action will show us if investors are seriously worried about the eurozone, or can take these latest bouts of turmoil in their stride...",

At the least this makes a quarterly GDP growth outcome of 1% for 4Q17 achievable. And there is precedent for output consistently surging back after weather-related disruptions over several quarters: after a slight 0.2% contraction during the 2011 Queensland floods, which badly disrupted coal export output, GDP growth averaged 1.1% for four straight quarters.</p> <p>However, the level of weather disruption did not appear to be anywhere near that scale on this occasion, and the underlying trend in domestic demand back then was much stronger, as mining capex was in full flight. So much as the RBA governor yesterday positioned for a temporary lull in growth, with inflation very weak <strong>the rebound needs to be fast, and convincing</strong>.

Time for a market update. The dollar is still down around 0.5% at US74.30c as investors weigh up the increased possibility that the RBA will cut interest rates next year. Perhaps even twice, some think. The share market meanwhile, is much more positive and the ASX/S&amp;P200 has put on 0.8% today to sit at 5476.3 points. Stock markets across the region were mostly positive thanks to the Dow Jones average closing at another record high on Tuesday night. The Nikkei was up 0.6%, the Hang Seng 0.35% but the Kospi in Korea is down slightly. Steven Knight of the brokerage Blackwell Global has a broader analysis of the outlook for Australia, which he decribes as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vulnerable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd because of the 12th successive quarterly drop in private investment. He thinks the pick up in oil, coal and iron ore prices in the past six months will cushion any continued lack of investment but the question is what happens when, if seems likely, demand for the big commodities levels off again: This highlights the lack of GDP diversity in the Australian economy and the fact that transition of capital to the services and retail industry has been sluggish at best. Australian growth needs to come from spending, investment and increased employment and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s difficult to see where that is likely to come from with expectations at the currently low level. Subsequently, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP release is likely to be seen as a wake-up call to both the markets and the Reserve Bank of Australia. Although the RBA recently elected to keep the cash rate on hold at 1.50% the reality is that the latest round of data all but assures near term rate cuts. My view is that we are likely to see 50bps shaved from interest rates over the next six months in an attempt to provide some much-needed stimulus. The Guardian columnist Stephen Koukoulas agrees with the folk at Capital. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just filed his thoughts on the GDP figures and points the finger at policy failures by the Coalition and the Reserve Bank \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the former for cutting spending into a downturn in the economy and the latter for failing to spot the threat from deflation quickly enough and leaving rates too high. He writes: Quite obviously, the RBA should have cut interest rates earlier and harder, not least to free up cash flow for the business sector and indebted households but also to take some air out of the Australian dollar, which has been strong against most global currencies. It should and probably will cut interest rates again but will likely wait until its next meeting in February to do so. Better late than never. Staying with rates, and the number crunchers at Capital Economics reckon that the RBA will be forced to cut the cash rate to 1% next year and the dollar will drop below US70c. Although they think the economy will get back to growth in the fourth quarter \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in line with most expectations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they see borrowing costs coming down again. This is only the fourth fall in GDP in 25 years, which highlights that the economic backdrop is not consistent with a big rise in underlying inflation. This supports our view that interest rates may fall from 1.5% to 1% next year, which could drag the Australian dollar below US$0.70. The question of where interest rates will go from here is likely to be much debated from now until the next Reserve Bank meeting in February. Craig James of CommSec said earlier that the GDP print meant that the recent talk of a possible rates hike was off the table. This what he said in his note: The Reserve Bank warned [on Tuesday] that annual economic growth would slow before it picked up in 2017. That is our expectation also. The economy should grow near its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpotential\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rate of 3% in 2017. We continue to believe that interest rates will remain on hold in coming months. But no one will be thinking of rate hikes any time soon. The Coalition will be desperate to avoid Australia entering a slump with another negative print for the fourth quarter. The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prized triple-AAA credit rating is already under threat and Scott Morrison will do his bext with his midyear fiscal and economic outlook on 19 December to persuade the rating agencies and the markets that he has the situation under control. Most analysts, including Shane Oliver from AMP and Craig James from CommSec, agree that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s number is likely to a one-off and that Australia will bounce back into positive territory next time. Ben Jarman at JP Morgan in Sydney is a little more circumspect. While he agrees that the weather-hit building industry should bounce back in the fourth quarter, household spending is weak and could drag on the overall figure. Consumer spending growth is 2% annualised over the last six months. This is occurring at a time where the business surveys have already soured somewhat and retail spending momentum has been fading. The breadth of the contraction in construction activity does indeed seem consistent with weather effects. At the least this makes a quarterly GDP growth outcome of 1% for 4Q17 achievable. And there is precedent for output consistently surging back after weather-related disruptions over several quarters: after a slight 0.2% contraction during the 2011 Queensland floods, which badly disrupted coal export output, GDP growth averaged 1.1% for four straight quarters. However, the level of weather disruption did not appear to be anywhere near that scale on this occasion, and the underlying trend in domestic demand back then was much stronger, as mining capex was in full flight. So much as the RBA governor yesterday positioned for a temporary lull in growth, with inflation very weak the rebound needs to be fast, and convincing. On the early tracking, the bounce-back in 4Q GDP is unlikely to be sufficient to avoid downward revisions in the RBA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s February statement of monetary policy. Great chart courtesy of our friends at Business Insider showing the quarterly dips of the past 25 years. The trade minister, Steve Ciobo, has been speaking about the figures from Jakarta where he is on government business. He admits the numbers are disappointing but the government is focusing on policies to boost economic growth. This is what he told Bloomberg: Trade export deals are a key part of that and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why as a Coalition we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve focused on locking into place very high-quality trade deals between Australia, South Korea, China and Japan. So the number is down and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not what we would expect as ideal but our annualised growth rate still sits above the OECD average. Looking on the bright side, there are good reasons to think that the decline in GDP won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be repeated in the December quarter and that Australia will avoid slipping into recession. The main reason is that the terms of trade improved by 4.5% in the third quarter thanks to rising commodity prices. That trend has continued in recent weeks and should benefit the bottom line when the next round of GDP figures come out in the new year. Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital, said: I see this as a one-off because some of the factors which dragged down growth were reversed in the current quarter. Housing and public investment will bounce back, retail spending has recently picked up pace and the boom in resource exports will resume. Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP has shrunk by 0.5% in the September quarter thanks to a slump in construction output and weak public spending It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only the fourth such decline in the past 25 years The Aussie dollar has sunk 0.5%, buying US74.26c, while the ASX200 shrugs off the news on the hope of more stimulus Treasurer Scott Morrison says the figures \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdemand support for his policies of jobs and growth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Commsec chief economist Craig James says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153perfect storm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The ASX/S&amp;P 200 has taken the poor GDP reading in its stride with miners and banks driving the benchmark index higher today. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently up 32.9 points at 5,461.60, a rise of 0.61%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a result of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bad news is good news\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd paradox that has gripped the financial markets since the end of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central banks started their various money-printing schemes in 2008 ie, the worse the news is from the real world, the more stocks bounce in the hope that the bad news will force central banks to kickstart the economy. Reuters quotes Tony Farnham, an economist with Patersons Securities: The poor GDP data has people expecting more accommodating policy. The accommodation can be either through friendlier monetary policy or alternatively it could be increased fiscal policy, by that I mean increased government expenditure ideally in the capex side and infrastructure side. For more on the bad news/good news conundrum, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some analysis from our economics editor Larry Elliott from earlier in the year. The GDP contraction has taken a chunk out of the Aussie dollar. It has fallen 0.46% against the US dollar to US74.26c. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also fallen against other currencies, including a drop of 0.31% against the pound. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s buying 58.65p at the moment. My colleague Gareth Hutchens has written our main news story on the GDP figures which you can read here. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got lots of reaction, including this from James Pearson, the chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who has called for corporate tax cuts. Australia must not be like the frog in the pot of water that is slowly brought to boil. To regain our competitiveness, and therefore create and sustain jobs, we must encourage our businesses, which employ most Australian workers, to invest and grow. That includes by cutting the burden of company tax to stimulate investment. The 0.5% contraction has surprised a lot of people because the consensus forecast among economists was 0.2%, according to those surveyed by Australian Associated press. TD Securities chief Asia-Pacific macro strategist Annette Beacher told AAP that the Reserve Bank would now be trying to work out whether Australia was halfway to a recession, which is defined by two quarters of economic contraction. I think they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be spending the afternoon figuring out to what extent are these one-offs, and can we get rebound in [the fourth quarter]. Will private consumption rebound, will the dwelling sector rebound, will the public sector rebound? They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be spending more time looking at that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, Beacher said she thought the dips across the different sectors such as construction and federal capital spending, were more likely an unfortunate coincidence that makes a Christmas recession unlikely. Commsec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist Craig James says the figures will turn out to be a blip, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153but a very important blip\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Australians of all stripes have become complacent, he says, and have stopped spending and investing. Infrastructure spending will have to take its place to provide \u00e2\u20ac\u0153momentum\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the economy in the coming months. But overall he blamed the uncertainty generated by Brexit and Trump for the decline in GDP. In the September quarter the economy was hit by a perfect storm. Not only was there the reaction to the UK \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBrexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 vote, there was also the federal election and then there was the uncertainty about the US elections. And clearly, when there is a lot of uncertainty around, consumers and businesses tend to delay decisions to spend, invest and employ. A big fall in public investment also accounted for the bulk of the contraction of activity in the quarter. While spending measures of the economy were weak in the September quarter, income measures were actually quite strong. And the farm sector was also strong in the quarter and should also be a key contributor to growth in coming quarters. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe there are grounds for another quarter of contraction. The shadow treasurer is speaking in Canberra now and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talking about the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deeply disappointing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd figures that Scott Morrison \u00e2\u20ac\u0153could hardly bring himself to mention\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. After a fair bit of qualification he calls it the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153second worst economic performance for 25 years\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and calls on Morrison to take responsibility for the problem. The fact of the matter is that this is just the fourth negative quarter in 100 quarters in Australia. Just the fourth negative quarter since 1991. And in fact, the only other occasions that this has occurred over the last 25 years, there have been very good and clear reasons for it. For example, in 2011 Australia was dealing with Cyclone Yasi. In 2009, the greatest economic downturn since the great depression internationally. And of course the aftermath of the Sydney Olympics. Now, in other words, this is the second worst economic growth result in the last 25 years. Morrison says the figures aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just a wake up call, but rather serve as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153demand\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for everyone else to support his policies for jobs and growth. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more from his opening remarks to the press conference which has just ended: The Turnbull government will never take economic growth for granted, ever. In the 12 months to the end of September our economy grew by 1.8%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down from 3.1% achieved at the end of June. Our growth is still higher than six out of seven G7 economies, second only to the United Kingdom, higher than the US, Canada, Japan, Germany and higher than the OECD average. The contraction recorded in real GDP in the September quarter is not just a reminder, not just a wake up call or a warning about being complacent when it comes to economic growth. It is a demand to support economic policies that drive the investment needed for job security, the hours and wages that hard-working Australians need to cope with the rising cost of living, especially on electricity costs, and that businesses need to survive in a tough and competieve environment. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nationals accounts data demmands the support in the national interest for the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic plan for jobs and growth that we outlined this year. It demands it in the national interest. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, has fronted the media in Canberra to try to explain the dire figures which show the annual growth rate down to 1.8 per cent. The figures are not just a reminder or a wake-up call about being complacent, but rather a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153demand to support economic policies that drive the investment needed to support job security\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Morrison said. The ABS is fairly clear about the reasons for the shrinking of the economy. In its press release on the figures, it says the 3.6% decline in output of the construction industry \u00e2\u20ac\u0153was the largest contributor to the fall in GDP growth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on an industry basis. It said other industries such as financial and insurance services, professional scientific and technical services, rental hiring and real estate services and administrative support services also contributed to the overall decline. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full statement: The volume of activity in the Australian economy decreased 0.5% in the September quarter 2016, the first quarter of negative growth since the Queensland flood affected March quarter 2011. Through the year growth remains positive at 1.8%, reflecting the three previous quarters of growth. Economic activity contracted in a number of areas this quarter. Private investment in new buildings detracted 0.3 percentage points from GDP growth, while new engineering and new and used dwellings detracted 0.2 and 0.1 percentage points respectively. Public capital expenditure detracted 0.5 percentage points from growth as it declined from elevated levels in the June quarter. Net exports detracted an additional 0.2 percentage points from growth. Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s terms of trade rose 4.5% through the September quarter. The reduced building activity is reflected in the output of the construction industry which fell 3.6% for the quarter and was the largest contributor to the fall in GDP growth on an industry basis. A number of other industries also recorded below trend growth, or declined, this quarter, including financial and insurance services, professional scientific and technical services, rental hiring and real estate services and administrative support services. The largest offset to these falls was agriculture which grew 7.5 per cent. Mining production contributed no growth, but maintained its historically high levels of production. Subdued activity in the building industry contributed to a decline in the income of small businesses, with gross mixed income down 5.8%. Private non-financial corporation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gross operating surplus increased 1.2%, supported by stronger mining commodity prices. Compensation of employees increased 1.3%, and real gross national income increased 0.9% for the quarter to be 3.2% higher through the year. The ABS bad news for the Aussie dollar which fell sharply on the news and is currently trading at US74.24c. Stock market investors were more sanguine, however, with the ASX/S&amp;P 200 index up 0.5% on the morning. Good morning and welcome to the live blog on reaction to the surprisingly poor GDP figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics today. They showed that the economy shrank by 0.5% in the three months to the end of September, the first negative quarter for five years and only the fourth for more than two decades. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be bringing you reaction from Canberra and the rest of the country, plus everything from the markets.

Rebecca Piggott, research fellow at NIESR, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Recent economic growth has been driven almost entirely by the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s broad service sector, supported by robust consumer spending.

It said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Fitch Ratings has revised the 2017 sector outlook for Irish banks to stable from positive, as the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote to leave the EU increases uncertainty for the operating environment. Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic recovery should remain strong in the short term, underpinning the stable sector outlook. The rating outlook on Irish banks is positive, reflecting our expectation that improving bank credit fundamentals should outweigh these challenges.</p> <p> Brexit is negative for Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term economic and political prospects, putting pressure on GDP growth and creating uncertainty around relations with Northern Ireland. The extent of any weakening of the bank operating environment, triggered by a slowdown of GDP growth in the UK, sterling depreciation, or potential trade barriers, will become clear only as EU-UK negotiations develop. A deterioration in the operating environment could slow any improvements in the asset quality and capitalisation of Irish banks...</p> <p>Capitalisation, although improving, remains vulnerable. We expect capital ratios to strengthen in 2017, despite pressure from volatility in pension fund deficits and foreign-exchange markets. Fully-loaded regulatory capital ratios remain weaker than international peers, primarily due to large amounts of deferred tax assets; these assets are reducing slowly because of Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s low corporate tax rate and relatively low levels of profitability compared to the size of the balance sheet. Large, albeit reducing, stocks of unreserved problem assets also leave Irish banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 capitalisation more exposed if the operating environment deteriorates.</p> <p> Further improvements in asset quality and capitalisation would improve the banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 risk profiles and may result in ratings upgrades; this is why the ratings outlook for Irish banks is positive. Although uncertainty as regards the operating environment has increased, we believe credit fundamentals will improve in 2017, as the sector continues to work through its backlog of impaired loans. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58480e3fe4b08659393b9c28\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-07T14:24:10.255Z\">2.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>But...

                "bodyText":"Hopes that Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks can be bailed out one way or another - private investors, state aid or the European bailout fund - continue to support stock markets. And the expectation that the European Central Bank may extend its bond buying programme for a few more months is also providing some support. On Wall Street the global surge in banking stocks helped push both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500 to new intra-day peaks, although pharmaceutical shares were under pressure after president-elect Donald Trump said he would look at cutting drug prices. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 1.81% or 122.39 points at 6902.23 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax jumped 1.96% to 10,986.69 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 1.36% at 4694.72 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB rose 2.1% to 18,130.66 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.75% at 8960.4 In Greece, the Athens market added 2.82% to 640.07 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 92 points or 0.48% at 19344, close to the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highs. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. In Greece tensions over reforms are once again mounting with creditors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this time over an IMF demand that shops remain open for business on Sundays. Helena Smith reports: Most EU member states would relish overhauling a relic of old times like the ban on Sunday shopping. In Greece, though, it is the sort of measure that makes for front-page splashes, conspiracy theory and cries of protest. But the International Monetary Fund, in the spirit of further opening up one of the continent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most sclerotic economies, is not letting go. Instead the Washington-based body, which is still negotiating its participation in Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest bailout, has stepped up demands for trade to be liberalised saying shops should remain open on Sundays. Moreover, it argues, the reform will give people work in a nation hobbled by record levels of unemployment. In its splash today, the daily Ethnos newspaper, citing a leaked email from the IMF, reports that closure of an ongoing review of the economy by creditors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the second since Athens received its third bailout last summer \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is now contingent on shops opening up for commerce on Sundays. The organisation wants the measure to be signed and sealed this month. So far the response has been negative. Ministry of finance officials told the paper that, instead, they will push through an amendment that will allow shops in specially defined tourist areas to stay open. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unlikely to pass muster with lenders who have signalled they are going to rachet up the pressure on Greece to enforce the sort of reforms that will make it more competitive. Ideologically, the governing leftwing Syriza party is said to be against the move on the grounds that it will not only benefit bigger stores but is an infringement of basic workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rights. The Greek Orthodox Church has already likened the step to a sin and shop employees, who have already taken to the streets, are girding for further battle. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our full story on Matteo Renzi planning to resign later as Italian prime minister: One of the factors supporting the market rally is the expectation that the European Central Bank could announce an extension of its bond buying programme following its latest meeting on Thursday: [APP is the asset purchase programme] That hope, and optimism that Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s struggling banks can somehow be recapitalised, have combined to send European markets higher, with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax up 1.8%, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac 1.1%, the FTSE 100 1.6% and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB 1.5%. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average has hit a new intra-day record of 19,276, despite concerns about healthcare companies after Donald Trump said he would look at drug pricing. Back in the UK and some good news for steel workers at Port Talbot: Markets continue to be buoyed by hopes of a resolution to Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking problems. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: With the Italian government passing its 2017 budget, and Mario Renzi confirming he will resign this evening, the European markets maintained their banking-boosted growth this Wednesday. The continued lack of fuss following the Italian referendum result, combined with the prospect of a Monte dei Paschi bailout (potentially as soon as this week), has led the European indices to a bevy of highs this afternoon. The CAC is still at an 11 month peak, while the DAX, following a near 200 point rise, is at its best price in exactly a year. The highs hit by the FTSE were a bit less impressive, though its 110 point increase does leave the UK index just 10 points away from 6900, a level it hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen since November 10th. While most of the pan-European growth has been inspired by the rallying banking sector, the FTSE has also benefited from a commodity stock rebound and the latest pound-plunge, with sterling shedding 0.8% against the dollar and 1.1% against the euro. But Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, warned markets could be getting ahead of themselves: Talk that the Italian banking system could be on the verge of a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15bn bailout from the European Stability Mechanism has pushed equity markets in Europe to their highest levels in several months... While the reports of a bailout request have been denied the usual rule of thumb when these sorts of reports do the rounds is that there is usually an element of truth to them, even if we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know the exact mechanics, and markets are responding to that. As with most things the devil is likely to be in the detail, and the likely strings that are likely to be attached to any aid request, if and when it comes. It is here that markets could be getting ahead of themselves. Well it seems Matteo Renzi will not be staying on as Italian prime minister after all and plans to resign this evening now the budget has been passed. He tweeted: AP reports: Italian Premier Matteo Renzi says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll resign now that Parliament has completed approval of the 2017 national budget. Renzi had offered his resignation two days earlier to President Sergio Mattarella following his humiliating defeat in a government-backed voter referendum on reforms. But Mattarella told him to stay in office until passage of the budget law, which was done Wednesday afternoon. Renzi tweeted that he plans to go to the president to resign at 7 p.m. (1800 GMT). Following the poor UK manufacturing figures earlier, comes news that the economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth has flattened in the last few weeks, according to a leading think tank. The National Institute of Economic and Social Reseach has estimated that UK output grew by 0.4% in the three months to the end of November, the same as in the three months to October. But it warned a slowdown was ahead. The think tank said the economy was being supported by the service sector, which was borne out by the earlier weak manufacturing figures. Rebecca Piggott, research fellow at NIESR, said: Recent economic growth has been driven almost entirely by the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s broad service sector, supported by robust consumer spending. In stark contrast, the official figures suggest that the production and construction sectors of the economy have declined over recent months. Looking ahead, we do not expect such buoyant consumer spending growth to persist. Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pronounced depreciation this year is expected to pass through to the consumer prices throughout the course of 2017 and 2018, eroding the purchasing power of households substantially. NIESR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest quarterly forecast published just over a month ago forecast GDP growth of 2% per annum in 2016 and 1.4% in 2017. CPI inflation was expected to reach 3.8% at the end of 2017. Another area likely to be hit by the uncertainty of the UK leaving the EU is the Irish banking sector, according to ratings agency Fitch. It said: Fitch Ratings has revised the 2017 sector outlook for Irish banks to stable from positive, as the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote to leave the EU increases uncertainty for the operating environment. Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic recovery should remain strong in the short term, underpinning the stable sector outlook. The rating outlook on Irish banks is positive, reflecting our expectation that improving bank credit fundamentals should outweigh these challenges. Brexit is negative for Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term economic and political prospects, putting pressure on GDP growth and creating uncertainty around relations with Northern Ireland. The extent of any weakening of the bank operating environment, triggered by a slowdown of GDP growth in the UK, sterling depreciation, or potential trade barriers, will become clear only as EU-UK negotiations develop. A deterioration in the operating environment could slow any improvements in the asset quality and capitalisation of Irish banks... Capitalisation, although improving, remains vulnerable. We expect capital ratios to strengthen in 2017, despite pressure from volatility in pension fund deficits and foreign-exchange markets. Fully-loaded regulatory capital ratios remain weaker than international peers, primarily due to large amounts of deferred tax assets; these assets are reducing slowly because of Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s low corporate tax rate and relatively low levels of profitability compared to the size of the balance sheet. Large, albeit reducing, stocks of unreserved problem assets also leave Irish banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 capitalisation more exposed if the operating environment deteriorates. Further improvements in asset quality and capitalisation would improve the banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 risk profiles and may result in ratings upgrades; this is why the ratings outlook for Irish banks is positive. Although uncertainty as regards the operating environment has increased, we believe credit fundamentals will improve in 2017, as the sector continues to work through its backlog of impaired loans. But... Bloomberg is reporting that Renzi might be having second thoughts about stepping down. They say: Matteo Renzi is wavering on whether to stay on as Italian prime minister despite his resignation offer after Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum defeat, according to a senior state official. President Sergio Mattarella wants Renzi to reconsider his decision in order to provide political and economic stability, said the official, who asked not to be named because the issue is confidential. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story. Newsflash! After a debate today. the Italian Senate just approved the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2017 budget. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the last order of business before Matteo Renzi can formally step down as prime minister. Renzi now also expected to meet with senior members of his Democratic Party this afternoon, to discuss the next steps - including whether he remains as party leader. Back in the markets, European stocks are hitting multi-month highs on continued optimism that Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking sector will receive much-needed fresh capital soon. Every index is sharply higher today, with some traders speculating that the fabled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Santa Rally\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd might be kicking off (stock markets often rally in the run-up to Christmas). Over in Milan, Monte dei Paschi is still having a good day, up 8%, following the reports that the Italian government could take a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2bn stake in the bank. And the suggestions that Rome could turn to the ESM for a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15bn bank bailout continues to calm fears of an imminent financial crisis. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says: Even the prospect of a nationalisation [of Monte dei Paschi], potentially as early as this weekend, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spooking the markets as it may avoid retail bondholders having to take any losses. The FTSE 100 index is now up by 100 points, or 1.5% at 6880 -- a chunky rise. However, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly because the pound fell at 9.30am when October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak UK manufacturing data were released. The German Dax is still at a one-year high, the French CAC is at its highest level since January, and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB it at its highest level since June. EC antitrust commissioner Margrethe Vestager declined to comment directly on the Monte dei Paschi rescue talks. But she did point out that the commission is keen to support citizens who have been missold financial products. That could be significant, as the small retail investors who own Italian bank bonds may argue that they were deceived about the risk of being possibly \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbailed into\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 a rescue. And some analysts reckon the Italian government could circumvent those new bail-in rules by compensating these small investors. Vestager told reporters in Brussels that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One of the things that we are working with is tools to enable governments to compensate for mis-selling of different kinds. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is something we have set up before. We will work with governments again if they want to set up schemes that can allow citizens to be compensated if mis-selling has been taking place.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The European Commission have got a fight on their hands over today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Euribor fines. JP Morgan and HSBC have both announced that reject the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conclusions that they breached antitrust laws, and will fight on to try to prove it. A spokeswoman for JP Morgan (fined \u00e2\u201a\u00ac337m today) says the bank could launch an appeal: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have cooperated fully with the European Commission throughout its five year investigation. We did not engage in any wrongdoing with respect to the EURIBOR benchmark. We will continue to vigorously defend our position against these allegations, including through possible appeals to the European courts.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd HSBC (fined \u00e2\u201a\u00ac33m) is also adamant that it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take part in a cartel: The European Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision relates to allegations of Euribor manipulation and related purported conduct during the course of one month in early 2007. We believe we did not participate in an anti-competitive cartel. We are reviewing the European Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision and considering our legal options. French bank Credit Agricole is refusing to accept that it breached antitrust rules! In a short, sharp statement, it says: Cr\u00c3\u00a9dit Agricole takes note of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision of the European Commission in the Euribor case. Cr\u00c3\u00a9dit Agricole firmly believes that it did not infringe competition law. Accordingly, it will appeal the Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision before the European courts. Payment of the fine will not affect the 2016 financial statements given the provisions set aside previously. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fines mark the end of the euribor scandal, hopefully, Vestager continues. But.... The Commission will not hesitate to investigate and sanction any other cartel it may uncover in the future in the financial industry. Commissioner Vestager is outlining the euribor ruling now. You can watch it live here. She says JP Morgan, HSBC and Credit Agricole all breached antitrust rules by conspiring to rig the euribor rate. The euribor market is means to provide protection from market volatility in euro-denominated securities, Vestager says. If this market is rigged, it will benefit only a few. Traders used IM services and corporate chatrooms to exchange confidential information to distort the euribor rate to serve their own interests, she adds. Euribor was calculated from submissions from individual banks, which created the ability to rig it. Vestager cites one example, from 19th March 2007, in which the cartel members decided they would benefit from a lower euribor rate. So, weeks earlier, they conspired to submit low numbers to the committee which calculated the daily figure. (this will sound depressingly familiar to anyone who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s read about the Libor scandal). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the details of the euribor-rigging fines just announced by the EC. JPMorgan: \u00e2\u201a\u00ac337.2m HSBC: \u00e2\u201a\u00ac33.6m Credit Agricole: \u00e2\u201a\u00ac114.7m Margrethe Vestager, the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s antitrust commissioner, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Banks have to respect EU competition rules just like any other company operating in the single market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd These fines come three years after four other banks were fined over Euribor rigging, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, RBS and Societe Generale. Newsflash! The European commission has fined Cr\u00c2\u00b4dit Agricole, HSBC and JP Morgan a combined total of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac485m for their role in the Euribor fixing scandal. This is the case in which traders were accused of conspiring to rig the official rates at which banks would lend to each other in various currencies (euros, in this case) More to follow.... City experts are pretty unimpressed by the slide in UK manufacturing in October: That disappointing UK manufacturing report has hit the pound, sending it down 0.5% against the US dollar: The Office for National Statistics reports that most areas of manufacturing struggled in October, led by pharmaceuticals, where output shrank by 3.6%. This chart shows how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector weakened in October, after two months of gains: Breaking: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial sector has suffered its biggest fall in output sine 2012. UK industrial production shrank by 1.3% in October, dashing hopes of a 0.2% rise. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly due to the temporary shutdown of the Buzzard oil field in the North Sea. But... manufacturing certainly had a poor month too. Output across manufacturing firms fell by 0.9% in October. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the weakest performance since February, and will raise fears that the economy is weakening. Economist Mark Astley says the figures are much weaker than expected. Investec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Philip Shaw hopes that the underlying picture is better. Every single Italian bank share has risen this morning, led by Monte dei Paschi which is currently 7.7% higher. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout fund has just said that it hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t received a request for help from Italy, and hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t had any discussions about a possible programme. Asked about reports that Rome is planning a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15bn bailout request for its banks, a spokesman for the European Stability Mechanism says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is no request and there are no discussions with theItalian authorities on an ESM loan.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However...this denial doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that Italy isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t preparing a request for help from the ESM, of course.... Looking away from Italy, the big news this morning is that drugs giant Pfizer has been hit with a record fine after the price charged to the NHS for an anti-epilepsy drug was hiked by up to 2,600%. Boom! Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX stock market has hit its highest level in a year, while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC is at an 11-month high. Optimism is rife in the City that a recapitalisation solution for troubled Italian bank Monte dei Paschi is in the pipeline, says Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets However, this could be via Italy applying for a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15bn loan from Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ESM to help recapitalise several troubled banks and not just MPS which would avoid the issue of illegal state aid/bailout. Mizuho strategist Antoine Bouvet says investors are hopeful that Rome will get a grip on the crisis: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite the fact that the probability of early elections has risen, the market is focusing on the banking sector and the fact the government seems to be showing more urgency in dealing with that problem.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However.... financial analyst Dan Davies (who actually owns some MPS shares, bold lad) isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced that a bailout will benefit shareholders. European stock markets are all rallying this morning, with banking stocks boosted by Italian bailout hopes. The main indices are up around 1%, pushing the FTSE 100 up by almost 60 points to 6837. La Stampa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report that Italy may seek European help for its banks is cheering the City: In London, mining stocks are also gaining ground, with Rio Tinto and Antofagasta both up 4%. Shares in Monte Dei Paschi have jumped by 9% at the start of trading in Milan, on hopes that Italy can pull off a rescue package. Other Italian banks are rallying too, driving the whole sector up 3%. Traders are reacting to La Stampa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that Italy could seek a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15bn bailout (even though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just been denied) They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also comforted by Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 overnight report that Italy could take a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2bn stake in Monte dei Paschi, in a bid to: a) encourage private investors to back the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn cash call b) avoid inflicting losses on small retail investors who hold MPS bonds. One source told Reuters that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a de-facto nationalisation with a strong presence by the state that can attract other investors and allow the transaction to be completed. Italian government debt is rallying this morning, pushing the yield (interest rate) on its 10-year debt down to 1.91%, from 1.97%. That has narrowed the gap between Italian and German borrowing costs - a key measure of stress in the eurozone. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s La Stampa newspaper is reporting that Rome is considering seeking a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15bn loan from European authorities, to recapitalise its banking sector. According to the report, Italy would use the funds to shore up several banks, not just Monte dei Paschi. In return, Rome would have to commit to tightening its 2017 budget (which might be tricky, given the political void at present). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an intriguing idea, with one problem....it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just been denied by Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Treasury department. But how could it happen? These funds would come from the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), which is Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout fund. Spain took a similar loan a few years ago, which helped it avoid falling into a financial crisis. The attraction for Italy would that such a loan would come with fewer strings attached than a full-scale bailout. But there would still be some conditions, and monitoring of its banks by Brussels. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Three days on from Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s constitutional referendum, the future of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker banks still hangs in the balance. Monte de Paschi di Siena (MPS), the oldest and most troubled of the Italian banks, is making a final push to persuade investors to back its \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn cash call. But prime minister Matteo Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation may force Monte dei Paschi into seeking some form of help from the state, as investors have been spooked by the uncertainty gripping the Italian political system. Reuters reported last night that the Italian government could take a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2bn controlling stake in MPS, which would lift the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stake up to 40%. That could also provide compensation for the small retail investors who hold some of its bonds. And there is still talk that a public rescue plan could be cobbled together by the weekend, possibly even with some fund from Europe? All may become clearer today... #NoPromises Also coming up today: The European Commission could hit HSBC, JPMorgan and Cr\u00c3\u00a9dit Agricole with multimillion-euro fines later today for rigging the Euribor interest rate benchmark. Australia has sent a shiver through the global economy by reporting that its economy shrank by 0.5% in the last quarter; only the fourth such decline in 25 years. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how the story unfolded: On the economic front, we get: German industrial production for October (just released, more on that shortly) UK industrial production for October. at 9.30am GMT The NIESR think tank estimates UK GDP for September-November, at 3pm GMT",

The ECB is prioritising yield curve steepeners: the policy decision to embed a technical \u00e2\u20ac\u0153taper\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in its 9-month QE programme extension, by scaling down its monthly purchases from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac80bn to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn, to ensure policy continuity, sends a clear signal that there is a limit to how far the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s QE can run and how high the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s balance sheet can grow beyond 2017, before it runs into hard technical, and political, constraints.</p> <p>The ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement of changes to the parameters of the asset purchase programme from January by increasing the maturity range to 1-30yrs from 2-30yrs and buying assets yielding below the deposit rate (\u00e2\u20ac\u20180.4%) for the first time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c also led to a sharp declines in the yields at the short end of the curve, reinforcing a curve steepener bias. The prospect of tapered monthly purchases and lower-for-longer negative yields means that the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reflation channels have shifted in favour of a weaker euro and higher equity markets, with negative discount rates and a cheaper exchange rate clearly benefiting stock valuations.<br></p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-12-08T16:31:13.176Z\">at 4.31pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5849881ae4b08659393ba428\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-08T16:22:45.945Z\">4.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>PS: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also worth checking out the German government bond market tonight.</strong></p> <p>The yield on short-term bunds has fallen deeper into negative territory, meaning prices have jumped because the ECB has now given itself the ability to buy this debt.</p> <p>But the yield on longer-dated bunds has risen, showing that investors are dumping the debt -- showing disappointment that the QE rate has been cut to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn per month.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MxSba/status/806891790297088005\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">CHART: German sovereign curve today vs yesterday.

                "bodyText":"A late newsflash: German media are reporting that the head of the Bundesbank, Jens Weidmann, opposed today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s moves: This explains why Draghi couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say that the decisions to extend QE was unanimous. (and that really is all for tonight!) Lena Komileva of G+ Economics has fired over a useful explanation of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy measures, and the way it has steepened the yield curve on eurozone debt: This is important. The ECB is prioritising yield curve steepeners: the policy decision to embed a technical \u00e2\u20ac\u0153taper\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in its 9-month QE programme extension, by scaling down its monthly purchases from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac80bn to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn, to ensure policy continuity, sends a clear signal that there is a limit to how far the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s QE can run and how high the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s balance sheet can grow beyond 2017, before it runs into hard technical, and political, constraints. The ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement of changes to the parameters of the asset purchase programme from January by increasing the maturity range to 1-30yrs from 2-30yrs and buying assets yielding below the deposit rate (\u00e2\u20ac\u20180.4%) for the first time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c also led to a sharp declines in the yields at the short end of the curve, reinforcing a curve steepener bias. The prospect of tapered monthly purchases and lower-for-longer negative yields means that the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reflation channels have shifted in favour of a weaker euro and higher equity markets, with negative discount rates and a cheaper exchange rate clearly benefiting stock valuations. PS: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also worth checking out the German government bond market tonight. The yield on short-term bunds has fallen deeper into negative territory, meaning prices have jumped because the ECB has now given itself the ability to buy this debt. But the yield on longer-dated bunds has risen, showing that investors are dumping the debt -- showing disappointment that the QE rate has been cut to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn per month. And it was a volatile day in the bond markets, as traders tried to keep up with Draghi Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what you need to know about the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision. 1) The European Central Bank has pledged to pump more money into the eurozone economy until the end of next year, and longer if needed. At today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, its governing council decided to extend its asset purchase scheme (which buys assets from banks with newly created money) by an extra nine months. From April 2017 it will buy \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn of assets each month, down from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac80bn. President Mario Draghi insisted that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy needed more stimulus, help drive inflation and growth back up. There are indications of a somewhat stronger global recovery. However, economic growth in the euro area is expected to be dampened by a sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms and remaining balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors. 2) Draghi said the decision had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very, very broad\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd support - implying that he couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get unanimous backing for the plan. This analysis shows that the changes mean the ECB now shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t run out of eligible assets until 2018: 3) Draghi was adamant that the ECB is not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tapering\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd its QE programme, leaving some City experts a little confused. The ECB president argues that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s changes to not amount to tapering, as there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no plan to stop asset purchases. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The natural way to look at a word like that is to have a policy whereby purchasers would gradually go to zero, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not been discussed or, as a matter of fact, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not even been on the table.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Draghi gave increasingly terse answers to journalists who tried to push him on this issue -- clearly the president doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to provoke a US-style \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctaper tantrum\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by encouraging bond investors to sell up. He insisted that the ECB could boost the pace of asset purchases if circumstances demanded, or run the programme into 2018. But Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced: The problem is that however much Draghi tried, and by the end of the press conference he was not only very irritated by the endless taper questions and stumbling in terms of explanation, he could not refute the point that cutting to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn/month could be a staging post to further cuts, because it is simply not refutable. It may not be their intended path, but it is not out of the realm of possibilities. 4) The ECB also made some important changes to its QE programme, including removing the limit that prevented it buying extremely expensive bonds. The ECB will now consider buying bonds with a yield below its deposit rate (the interest rates charged on bank deposits at the ECB). That deposit rate is a historically low MINUS 0.4% (to encourage banks to get out and lend). So the ECB can now buy more bonds for more than their face value -- meaning it would incur losses when the bonds mature. Why would it do that? Because it widens the pool of potential assets which can be mopped up by the ECB. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says: The ECB had to change its standards for bond purchases to ensure that its QE programme did not disrupt the debt markets. It will now include bond purchases below its own deposit rate, which is already -0.4%. Thus, the ECB will be paying to hold some bonds that will be included in its QE programme. The craziness doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop there, some of those bonds have a negative yield because of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s QE programme in the first place. This meeting has been like a financial version of Alice in Wonderland. 5) Shares up, euro down. The euro has now slid all the way back to $1.061 against the US dollar, down 1.3 cents today, having been pressing its nose against $1.08 before the ECB announcement. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The euro plunged after ECB chief Mario Draghi presented an unexpectedly dovish outlook on monetary policy, hinting that QE could go on for years if required. In fact he even said the QE programme is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcin effect open-ended\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and the overall dovish tone of the announcement means EURUSD is down 1% having risen earlier in the day. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fair to say this is at the dovish end of what markets had expected. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why European stock markets have jumped, welcoming the prospect that the ECB will remain in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceasing mode\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 until the end of next year. 6) Draghi warned against complacency over the impact which the Brexit vote, and Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election win, will have on the eurozone and the financial markets. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is difficult to judge the effect of these big events,not only the election of Mr Trump, but Brexit, the defeat of the Italian referendum. Markets proved much more resilient than people expected them to be. This probably has many reasons, many causes. One of these is certainly the good work that regulators have done ... All these events ... have effects that by their very nature are going to develop their full dimensions in the medium to long term ... these consequences are very difficult to assess now.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Quite. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good moment to end this blog. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW. Frank Engels, head of fixed income at Union Investment, explains why shares have jumped: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ECB decision was a very smart move of Mario Draghi. Lowering the monthly purchasing volume, abandoning the yield floor for security purchases and extending the program\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s maturity should cause the yield curve to become steeper, with the short end firmly anchored. This is a strong support signal for equities, particularly for banks and insurance companies. It is bearish, but not overly bearish for rates, though. We consider today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to be the first step out of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s QE.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Stock markets on both sides of the Atlantic have jumped, as the promise of more cheap money raises spirits on the trading floors. Investors are welcoming the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to extend its QE programme by an extra nine months. The slump in the euro, now down 1% at $1.0634, has also driven up the value of European exporters. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX hit a one-year high, over 11,000 points for the first time since December 2015. The French CAC also hit a one-year high. And on Wall Street, the Dow Jones index, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq index of tech stocks have all hit record highs in early trading. Q: Why didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you decide on an open-ended QE extension, rather than just committing to buying more bonds for another nine months beyond March? Our programme says it goes until December 2017 or beyond, if necessary, and until we see a sustained rise in inflation, Mario Draghi replies. It is, to an extent, open-ended -- it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state-dependent. And finally, Draghi reveals that the ECB has made some changes to its securities lending programme - and will now accept cash as collateral (this wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expected, so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find some expert reaction). And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the end of the press conference. Summary and reaction to follow..... Q: How important is the recent rise in the oil price? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an important change, says Draghi, driven by better demand conditions, better supply conditions, and the reestablishment of some international agreements. There is no doubt that these higher prices will feed into higher inflation, but we must see if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a one-off effect, whether it has any secondary effects, and if it effects inflation excluding energy costs. Q: What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the advantage to doing an extra nine months of QE at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn per month, not \u00e2\u201a\u00ac80bn for six months? Draghi says the ECB wants to ensure a sustained pressure on market prices, without distorting them of course (perish the thought, Mario!) And we want to ensure that the reduction in size does not mean tapering (everyone got that? Good). Q: Your colleague Mr Mersch hinted recently that tapering might be discussed today, but you say it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t discussed. So how should we interpret these conflicting signals? I tell you what happened today, it was not discussed, insists Draghi curtly. Q: So did no governing council member argue for tapering today? Exactly, says Draghi, curtlier. Q: How would you respond to critics who say you have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stifled\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the push towards economic reforms in Europe, by easing monetary policy so much Draghi gives a little sigh, and then replies. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been discussing this for a long time. Our view is different - we think that easing monetary conditions helps governments to implement reforms, he says. Governments can reform their education, judicial, political and legal systems regardless of the cost of borrowing, Draghi insists. Q: How would you respond to claims that you are biased towards Southern Europe countries, such as Italy, by extending your QE scheme? Draghi smiles, and says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no, of course\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the ECB is not biased. Our policies are not very different from other top central banks, he points out. Q: Do you see a risk of a new eurozone crisis next year? Draghi does not. Different countries do have different problems, which should be dealt with stability, but these problems can be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153contained\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Q: Won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the ECB take a loss if it buys government bonds below your deposit rate? Our aim is to ensure price stability, not to make a profit, declares Draghi nobly (explainer: a bond with a yield below zero is trading above its face value, so an investor would not get back all their money when it matures) Q: What can central banks do in this current time of uncertainty? We must keep a steady hand, Draghi declares, giving governments the opportunity to strengthen economic growth and create jobs. Draghi is then asked about the US election. The financial markets have proved \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more resilient\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the shock caused by the Brexit vote, the US election, and the Italian constitutional referendum, says Mario Draghi. But he then warns that the full effects have not played out: All these events, especially Brexit and the new administration in the United States, have effects which by their very nature will develop their full dimensions in the medium-to long term. So we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll certainly see consequently in the medium-to-long term. Draghi says he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect any legal problems following today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s changes to the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s QE scheme. The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcself-imposed boundaries\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that we have changed today are not the ones which were needed to ensure the programme fell within our mandate, he argued. Q: You forecast an inflation rate of 1.7% in 2019 - is that close enough to your target (of close to, but below, 2%). Not really, Draghi replies Q: Why isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t this tapering, Mr Draghi? Tapering implies cutting the purchase programme down to zero, and that hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been discussed, the ECB president replies. Q: You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve said you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll boost the pace of asset purchasing if conditions worsen, so would you cut the pace of asset purchases if conditions are better than expected? We haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t discussed such a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchigh class problem\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 says Draghi dismissively (dispatching the question into the stand for a six). Q: When might the ECB start tapering? Draghi says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisions were taken to ensure the ECB has a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sustained presence in the market\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Q: How worried are you about Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks? The problems in Italy are well known, and will be dealt with by the Italian government. The risk of deflation has more or less disappeared, but uncertainty prevails, says Draghi. And he insists that cutting QE to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn per month in April 2017, from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac80bn, is not a tapering. Tapering has not been discussed today, he insists. Q: What is the economic justification in deciding to start buying government bonds which are yielding less than -0.4%? Draghi says that the ECB has decided to buy bonds yielding less than its deposit rate (currently -0.4%) \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcto the extent necessary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an option, not a necessity. [explainer: the deposit rate is what banks get (or are charged) for leaving cash at the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vaults] Onto questions... Q: Were today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisions unanimous:? There was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very very broad consensus\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd behind today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisions, Draghi replies. I think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a no...and so does Michael Hewson of CMC Markets: It wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a Mario Draghi press conference without a lecture to Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s politicians to pull their socks up. The ECB president calls for the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153swift and effective implementations of structural reforms\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to underpin the recovery. And he wants governments to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153intensify\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd their efforts to create more growth-friendly fiscal policies, while still remaining compliant with Brussels\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 stability and growth pact. Important point: The ECB still sees inflation someway below 2% in 2019, at just 1.7%. That suggests monetary policy will remain accommodative for some time..... The ECB has also updated its economic forecasts, and expects marginally faster growth and higher inflation in 2017: Investors are racing to buy safe-haven German debt, following the news that the ECB has removed the deposit limit floor on its QE programme: And the euro is just as volatile as we warned: Draghi says that the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccalibrations\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 announced today reflect the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153moderate but firming recovery of the euro area economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153subdued underlying inflationary pressures\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The ECB still expects the eurozone economy to recover at a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153moderate but firming\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd pace. And he warns that the risks to the euro economy remain somewhat to the downside, even though the global economy appears to be strengthening. HELLO! Mario Draghi says the ECB is changing the parameters of its QE scheme so that it can buy government bonds which are yielding less than its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdeposit rate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (currently -0.4%). That means it could start buying ultrasafe government bonds (such as German short-term debt) which are too highly priced to fall within QE. Mario Draghi is holding a press conference right now, to explain today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisions. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading out the statement released earlier (which I posted here) It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being streamed live here (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll try to add it to the top of this blog too). Financial blogger Jeroen Blokland shows how the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s balance sheet will swell further next year, thanks to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisions: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s yet more reaction: The ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s task of nursing Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy back to health is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153far from done\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Jennifer McKeown of Capital Economics. She believes the ECB may have to boost QE in 2017: Presumably, the Bank has been encouraged by signs that the economy is performing well in the face of political uncertainty at home and abroad. However, it clearly remains in cautious mode..... In all, we see a significant chance that the ECB will have to increase the pace of its asset purchases again next year. And even if it does not, policy will be far more supportive than in the US, leading the euro to depreciate further. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement is both hawkish and dovish, says Kathleen Brooks of City Index. There is no free lunch at the ECB - they give with one hand, and taper with another! Was the statement dovish or less dovish than expected? The answer is both\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The extension to QE is much longer than we expected, but the tapering announcement is almost hawkish, a mere three days after the Italian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s voted No in its referendum. Government bond yields are rising, with the German 10-year bund up to 0.44%, from 0.34% last night. That means investors are selling eurozone government debt following today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ECB decision, even though the central bank has promised to keep buying bonds for another nine months. William De Vijlder of BNP Paribas says investors are reacting to the cut in QE: The WSJ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris Whittall agrees: Fred Ducrozet of Swiss bank Pictet says that not really tapering, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still not what the markets hoped for. Finance Twitter is all agog at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ECB announcement. Duncan Weldon of Resolution Group gets a mince pie for summing up the QE changes in five words: Danielle Haralambous of the Economist Intelligence Unit reckons the ECB won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move as a formal \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctapering\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets wants to see the details of the QE tweaks mentioned in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement. Carsten Brzeski of ING points out that the ECB is actually promising \u00e2\u201a\u00ac540bn of new QE, not the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac480bn which some investors expected (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn x 9 months vs \u00e2\u201a\u00ac80bn x 6 months) The euro jumped sharply as the ECB announcement hit the wires, but has now dropped back below \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.08. Traders may be noting that the ECB is pledging to run QE beyond December 2017 if needed, or pick up the pace of bond buying again if conditions deteriorate. Basically, it looks like a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdovish tapering\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to me. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full statement from the ECB, announcing that QE will run for an extra 9 months (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve bolded up the key points): Monetary Policy Decisions 8 December 2016 At today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting the Governing Council of the ECB decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.40% respectively. The Governing Council continues to expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases. Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council decided to continue its purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) at the current monthly pace of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac80 billion until the end of March 2017. From April 2017, the net asset purchases are intended to continue at a monthly pace of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60 billion until the end of December 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. If, in the meantime, the outlook becomes less favourable or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment of the path of inflation, the Governing Council intends to increase the programme in terms of size and/or duration. The net purchases will be made alongside reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP. To ensure the continued smooth implementation of the Eurosystem\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s asset purchases, the Governing Council decided to change some of the parameters of the APP, which will be communicated at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference and in a separate press release. Breaking: The European Central Bank has extended its bond-buying programme until December 2017, meaning an extra nine months of quantitative easing. But it has also started to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctaper\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 the scheme -- the ECB will only conduct \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn of QE from April, down from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac80bn previously. It has also left interest rates unchanged, at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. More to follow! Interesting..., bond yields are inching higher as traders brace for the ECB decision, coming any moment. The interest rate on German seven-year bonds has turned positive, for the first time since January [yields rise as bond prices fall]. That suggests they expect Mario Draghi to take a relatively hawkish tone today.... Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election win has changed the landscape for the ECB in two ways, says Unicredit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Erik Nielsen on Bloomberg TV. It has pushed up the yields on government bonds (which tightens monetary conditions), but it has also weakened the euro (which loosens conditions). So the net effect is a small tightening, Nielsen explains. Economist Meg Greene reckons the markets would react negatively if the ECB started trimming its stimulus programme today: European stock markets are clinging onto their gains, as investors anticipate the ECB will announce a stimulus extension shortly. That could mean we see big losses if Mario Draghi disappoints. Also, the details of any announcement could also send shares and currencies into a spin: Joshua Mahoney of IG explains: An extension to QE seems somewhat of a foregone conclusion, with the current programme due to expire in March and no current plan for winding down the scheme in place. With market expectations already factoring in an extension, it is likely that the volatility could come about through any imposition of a tapering plan, with the bank having to find a way to gradually reduce the size of asset purchases as we approach the end of the programme. Right now, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX and the French CAC are up around 0.4%, with Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 up 0.2%. Tension is rising in the markets, with just 45 minutes to wait until the European Central Banks announces its monetary policy decisions from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. JP Morgan Asset Management global market strategist Alex Dryden reckons the ECB will extends its stimulus programme, but trim the amount of bonds it buys with new money: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We expect the ECB will taper and lower their asset purchases to EUR 60 billion per month and extend the program by 6 to 9 months. However, the pressure on them to taper has declined in recent months, thereby increasing the chance that the keep the rate of asset purchasing unchanged and just extend the program by a few months. Rewind to September 2016 and 23% of German bunds were eligible for purchase. That number has now risen to 53% after the November sell-off in bonds. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale reckons Draghi must tread cautiously to avoid spooking investors: ECB President Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s challenge at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Council meeting is to broker a deal whereby he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t disappoint market expectations of an extension of the current (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac80bn per month) asset purchase programme, while satisfying the demands of the more hawkish elements who want the pace of asset purchases to slow given the prospect of rising (but still low) core inflation and steady growth. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fine balancing-act which may be achieved by extending the programme without specifying the pace of buying, or maybe could see an extension with a shorter period of commitment to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac80bn/month. Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit reckons Draghi will both extend and expand QE: Over in Athens thousands have taken to the streets as private and public sector employees stage nationwide protests to mark today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general strike, the tenth this year. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from the Greek capital The year may be winding down and events elsewhere in Europe may have hogged the headlines but in Greece anger, desperation and despair have far from abated. Faced with the prospect of further pay and pension cuts, thousands have joined protests called by unionists. Demonstrators carrying banners decrying labour reforms and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new and old anti-worker measures\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd have been marching through Athens on a day when the country has been brought to a standstill by industrial action that has closed everything from archaeological sites to schools and private enterprises. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153More measures are coming and it is ordinary people, workers, who will pay the price,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Odysseus Trivalas, the acting head of the public sector union, ADEDY, told me as he prepared to participate in one of the rallies. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Lenders are asking for the impossible, for primary surpluses that will be absurdly high for the next ten years. That means there will be more cuts in pensions and wages, more poverty, more despair,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The labour reforms, which include calls to abolish collective work agreements and allow for mass lay-offs, are now at the heart of a controversial bailout review between debt-stricken Greece and its euro zone creditors. In a statement, the private sector union, GSEE, described the measures as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153irrational,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the burden we carry is already unbearable.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Greece needs to conclude the review to continue accessing emergency funding from the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac86bn bailout \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the third to be given Athens since 2010. Inclusion of the country in the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s QE programme by March 2017 - a move seen as vital if Greece is to return to capital markets anytime soon - is also dependent on it. Hit by its worst financial crisis in modern times, Greece is experiencing record levels of poverty and unemployment, at 23.1% the highest in the EU. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial action has been timed to coincide with debate in parliament over next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget, which foresees further tax increases and spending cuts. The leftist-led government is expected to pass the budget in a vote this weekend. Shares in two of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest bookmakers are falling faster than an unlucky punter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bank balance, after MPs announced a clampdown on fixed-odds betting. Fixed-odds terminals are notorious for being highly addictive, with some gamblers becoming hooked on roulette and simulated horse and greyhound races. And a cross-party MPs has concluded that changes are needed. They propose that the maximum stake should be cut from \u00c2\u00a3100 to \u00c2\u00a32, and the speed of the machines should be lowered too. The final report is due in January; today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interim findings have sent shares in Ladbrokes and William Hill down by 7.5%. Newsflash from Brussels: The European Commission has just launched legal action against several countries, including Germany and the UK, over the Volkswagen diesel emissions scandal. Germany, Britain, Spain and Luxembourg are in the dock for not hitting VW with the same sort of tough sanctions which the company faces in America. The EC also wants Germany and the UK to explain why they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t share the findings of their own investigations into VW with the rest of Europe European Industry Commissioner Elzbieta Bienkowska says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153National authorities across the EU must ensure that car manufacturers actually comply with the law.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The countries now have two months to respond; in theory, the EC could take them to the European Court. Shares in UK outsourcing group Capita have hit their lowest since the summer of 2006, after it hit investors with its second profits warning in three months. Capita warned that it faced \u00e2\u20ac\u0153near-term headwinds\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as it announced plans to cut costs and sell of some businesses. It also warned that underlying profits will be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcat least\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00c2\u00a3515m, compared to a previous target of between \u00c2\u00a3535m and \u00c2\u00a3555m. This sent traders scarpering to file Sell orders, sending Capita shares down 7.9% to 519, a decade low. Among other duties, Capita is responsible for providing including electronic tags for the Ministry of Justice, collecting the London congestion charge and the BBC licence fee, and running customer services for several major UK firms. Top ECB watcher Fred Ducrozet predicts the ECB will extend QE by six months at its current rate of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac80bn per month, but retain the option to possibly taper next summer. He says the ECB must tread carefully today, to avoid spooking the markets: Amid growing evidence of a more robust recovery and improved policy transmission, there is a case for a reduction in the pace of asset purchases at some point in 2017, if anything because stocks matter more than flows in the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view. However, signalling an eventual tapering of asset purchases now would almost certainly trigger an unwarranted tightening of monetary conditions, or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctaper tantrum\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, that might jeopardize the recovery and force the ECB to do more. The euro just hit a three week high against the US dollar, at $1.0799. That may show that traders aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expecting Mario Draghi to be too dovish today. Kathleen Brooks of City Index reckons that the ECB may only extends its stimulus programme by an extra three months beyond next March. She says there are two good reasons for Mario Draghi to sound conservative today; a) the eurozone economic data has been quite good recently, and b) the ECB has been running out of eligible bonds to buy. So: We think that Draghi and co. will extend their QE bond purchases out until June 2017 This could disappoint some in the market, who may be looking for an extension until September 2017. Draghi may confirm that there is talk about how and when to taper, but no decisions have been made at this stage. Traders are bracing for Mario Draghi to create a lot of volatility in the markets today. Most economists expect the ECB to announce an extension to its QE scheme today, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no consensus on these details: Length: A six month extension seems likely, but the ECB could go longer, or shorter Volume: Will the ECN stick with its current policy of buying \u00e2\u201a\u00ac80bn of government and corporate bonds each month? Tapering: The ECB could decide to trim the amount of bonds it buys each month The ECB could even delay a decision on QE until its next meeting in January - something that might spook the markets: Sports Direct shares have fallen by 5% at the start of trading, after it reported a sharp drop in profits. The retailer, whose working practices have been heavily criticised this year, told the City that underlying profits are down by 57% over the six months to October 23rd. It pinned some of the blame on the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp decline since the Brexit vote (but this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stopping the company spending $51m on a new plane for corporate business). And chairman Keith Hellawell also launched a broadside at what he called an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extreme political, union and media campaign waged against this company\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I begin to question whether this intense scrutiny is all ethically motivated.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hellawell may be referring to the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s undercover work at its Shirebrook warehouse -- for which my colleague Simon Goodley won a British Journalism award this week. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results also show that Sports Direct has agreed a cosmetics licensing deal with a company run by Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s youngest daughter, Matilda: The Telegraph\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ashley Armstrong tweets: More here: European stock markets have risen at the start of trading, on hopes that the ECB will extend its stimulus programme today. All the main indices are up, with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX hitting a new one-year high. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx says markets have made \u00e2\u20ac\u0153another perky start\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, ahead of the ECB meeting this afternoon. While the previously soaring banking stocks have cooled down somewhat, arguably because Italy has asked the ECB to give it until mid-January to rescue Monte dei Paschi, the DAX and CAC have immediately begun to build on the various highs struck on Wednesday. That is because the Eurozone central bank is likely to announce an extension to its quantitative easing programme later today, with analysts expecting Mario Draghi and co. to move the bond-buying deadline beyond its current March 2017 end-point The Italian government has written to the European Central Bank, demanding that it gives them more time to rescue Monti dei Paschi (MPS), says the Financial Times today. In a stern letter, Rome argues that the resignation of PM Matteo Renzi means it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impossible to finalise the MPS rescue quickly. They want the ECB, which regulates the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks, to give them until mid-January to find the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn which MPS needs. The letter comes from the MPS board, whose largest shareholder is the Italian Treasury. If the request is rejected, MPS could be forced into a state-led bailout within days. The FT explains: A so-called precautionary recapitalisation would involve imposing losses on subordinated debtholders and the indemnification of retail bondholders, the people said. The ECB is due to review the request as early as Thursday. The ECB is understood to be unwilling to reveal its position until a letter is received. But bankers argue the supervisor is under pressure to take a tougher stance on MPS, which failed the European banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 healthcheck in 2014 and 2016, potentially paving the way for the latest stand-off between Italy and EU authorities. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give the extension, the ECB must take responsibility. They will be pushing the button,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said one person. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are only asking for five more weeks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd FT: Italy demands more time from ECB to rescue Monte dei Paschi Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Like a greedy diner on Christmas Day, Mario Draghi has a lot on his plate today as the European Central Bank holds its final meeting of the year. Draghi and his colleagues on the ECB governing council must decide whether to extend their bond-buying stimulus programme, which is on track to run out in March 2017. Will they take the plunge and commit to another six months of quantitative easing, which is currently pumping \u00e2\u201a\u00ac80bn into the eurozone economy each month? That would please the markets, which have grown addicted to regular glugs of ultra-loose monetary policy. But there could be a sting in the tail, if the ECB also talks about \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctapering\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 its QE programme, by trimming the amount it buys each month. That would remind investors that the punch bowl can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be refilled forever. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the timings: 12.45pm GMT/1.45pm CET: ECB announces its monetary policy decisions 1.30pm GMT/2.30pm CET: Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference The ECB must also consider the situation in Italy, where efforts to recapitalise its banking sector are dragging on. Unless there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a breakthough soon, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest lender Monte Dei Paschi could be forced into a state-led bailout. Also coming up... Sports Direct, Mulberry, Capita, and Ocado are all reporting results this morning. The headline news is that Sports Direct has posted a 25% tumble in pretax profits, and accused the media, unions and politicians of a damaging \u00e2\u20ac\u0153campaign\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd against the company. More on that shortly.... And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be watching Russian energy giant Rosneft, after the Russian government sold a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10.5bns stake in the company to a group of investors, including commodities trading firm Glencore.",

                "bodyText":"Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final salary pension funds have slashed their ownership of stock-market listed companies to just 7% of their total holdings following a huge shift in recent years to overseas stock markets and government bonds. The move away from owning UK stocks emphasises how dependent Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s estimated 13.5 million past and present final salary scheme members have become on returns from shares in US, continental and emerging market companies to generate a retirement income. The rapidly ageing membership of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guaranteed, defined benefit pension schemes has also forced a huge shift into government bonds as scheme trustees attempt to reduce the risk of their fund becoming insolvent. According to the annual pension fund health check by the Pension Protection Fund, the 5,794 UK defined benefit pension schemes faced a \u00c2\u00a3780bn deficit at the end of March 2016, little changed on the year before. A combination of falling global share prices and a slump in the interest paid on government bonds offset a flood of special contributions by employers that cost \u00c2\u00a310.5bn in the first half of 2016. The number of active scheme members fell below 1.5 million for the first time, the PPF said, increasing the number of deferred members with a frozen guaranteed payout. German car giant BMW became the latest firm to propose shutting its final-salary pension schemes when it said in September that it would shift the 5,000 staff at its plants in the UK over to its less generous defined-contribution scheme. Tom McPhail, head of retirement policy at the stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, said the \u00c2\u00a3780bn deficit was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153staggering\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and revealed the uphill task faced by employers in meeting their obligations to employees.

                "bodyText":"Elsewhere crude prices have come off their best levels after US drillers added more oil rigs for the sixth week in a row: On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back on Monday. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cabinet has no plans to meet on Saturday to discuss the current banking situation, Reuters is reporting, quoting government sources. But it stands ready to implement an emergency decree on banks if necessary, Reuters adds. Even though Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Monte dei Paschi fell more than 10% on concerns about its refinancing, investors elsewhere remained fairly calm. Ahead of the next big economic event - the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expected increase in US interest rates next week - markets were supported by the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suggestion it would continue acting to help the eurozone economy. Meanwhile the proposed offer by 21st Century Fox for satellite broadcaster Sky helped lift shares in London. Italy unsurprisingly missed out on the gains, given the fall in Monet dei Paschi. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 22.66 points or 0.33% at 6954.21 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax edged up 0.22% to 11,203.63 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.6% higher at 4764.07 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.73% to 18,292.65 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.26% at 9169.6 In Greece, the Athens market dipped 1.26% to 640.09 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 75 points or 0.38%, heading for a new closing high. Ratings agency Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has just downgraded the outlook for seven Italian banks to negative: Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Investors Service has today changed the outlook to negative from stable and affirmed the ratings of seven financial institutions, prompted by the outlook change to negative from stable on the Italian government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Baa2 debt rating... The following banks are affected by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rating actions: Intesa Sanpaolo Spa, Banca IMI Spa, FCA Bank S.p.A., Banca Nazionale Del Lavoro S.P.A., Credito Emiliano SpA, Credit Agricole Cariparma S.p.A., and Cassa Depositi e Prestiti S.p.A. Back to Italy, and Monte dei Paschi has closed down more than 10% after the European Central Bank reportedly refused an extension for a potential private sector fundraising. But other Italian bank shares were not hit as badly: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our story on the Sky bid: Some breaking news: satellite broadcaster Sky has agreed to be taken over by Rupert Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 21st Century Fox for \u00c2\u00a310.75 a share or more than \u00c2\u00a318bn. But Sky said the two sides were still in discussions about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153certain material offer terms\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and there was no guarantee an offer would be made. Sky shares have jumped 31% to \u00c2\u00a310.42. Over in Greece prime minister Alexis Tsipras has taken creditors aback by announcing a Christmas bonus for pensioners surviving on \u00e2\u201a\u00ac800 or less. Helena Smith reports from Athens: It was meant to be a goodwill gesture, announced in the wake of anti-austerity protests at the end of a crippling 24-hour nationwide strike. Instead, prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 declaration of a one off bonus payment to supplement the pensions of some 1.6 million low-income retirees has triggered renewed tensions with the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors. Under scheme \u00e2\u20ac\u201c unveiled in a televised address to the nation late on Thursday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac600m will be handed to pensioners living on living on \u00e2\u201a\u00ac800 or less a month. Greece is under tight stewardship by lenders keeping it afloat. The prospect of another round of pension and wage cuts set as the price of emergency bailout funding has seen Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 own popularity and that of his leftist-led coalition tumble. Responding to the news a commission spokeswoman said Brussels had not been informed of Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 surprise spending spree, the details of which it would have to study. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The program includes clear commitments to discuss all measures related to program objectives with the institutions in advance,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she told reporters this afternoon. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Commission was not made aware of all the details of the announcements before they were made.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprise election victory has not only boosted the stock market, it has also given US consumers more confidence. The initial reading of December\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s University of Michigan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumer sentiment survey came in at 98, up from a revised 93.8 in November and well above expectations of a figure of 94.5. And it was mainly down to Trump. The survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist Richard Curtin said: Consumer confidence surged in early December to just one-tenth of an Index point below the 2015 peak\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhich was the highest level since the start of 2004. The surge was largely due to consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 initial reactions to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprise victory. When asked what news they had heard of recent economic developments, more consumers spontaneously mentioned the expected positive impact of new economic policies than ever before recorded in the long history of the surveys. To be sure, an equal number volunteered negative judgments about prospective economic policies, but the frequency of those negative references was less than half its prior peak levels whereas positive references were about twice its prior peak. There were a few exceptions to the early December surge in optimism, mainly among those with a college degree and among residents of the Northeast [our bold italics], although no group has adopted a pessimistic outlook for the economy. The most important implication of the increase in optimism is that it has raised expectations for the performance of the economy. President-elect Trump must provide early evidence of positive economic growth as well as act to keep positive consumer expectations aligned with performance. Either too slow growth or too high expectations represent barriers to maintaining high levels of consumer confidence. Until specific policies are proposed, there is no reason to alter the 2017 forecast of 2.5% for real consumption. The worries about Monte dei Paschi may be sending the Italian stock market lower - the FTSE MIB is currently down 1.1% - but elsewhere the mood is brighter. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 30 points at 19,644, while Nasdaq composite is up 0.34% to a new peak of 5435. In Europe, the FTSE 100 is up 0.2% while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has added 0.18% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.57%. Commenting on International Personal Finance, Numis analysts said: The [Polish] Ministry of Justice, as opposed to the ministry of finance has, as part of a criminal law change and anti-usury measures, suggested that the interest rate cap in Poland is reduced. There is a 14 day consultation period and the ministry of finance may intervene. Assuming the cap is enacted as proposed it would materially reduce the revenue profile of the Polish business, calling into question the viability of the home credit model. Where under the existing cap IPF would collect \u00c2\u00a3168 from a \u00c2\u00a3100 loan, under the new proposal it would only be able to collect \u00c2\u00a3126. We now value IPF assuming that there is no value in Poland and that includes the capital that is allocated to this division. Elsewhere International Personal Finance, the emerging markets lender, has slumped 30% after it said Polish authorities had published a draft bill cutting the costs lenders can charge on consumer loan agreements. It said was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reviewing the proposal to assess the extent to which the profitability of its Polish business would be affected by the proposed changes.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The proposal reduces the flat level cap of 25% of loan value to 10% and an annual cap from 30% to 10% per annum. This is not the first time the company has been hit by changes in regulation. The debt to equity swap was predicated on a cash call going ahead, and that now looks in doubt, hence the fall in the bonds which were included in the swap. As part of its latest story on Monte dei Paschi, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Repubblica is suggesting the country may pass a decree this weekend allowing state aid. The story (in Italian) is here. Shares in Monte dei Paschi have restarted but fallen to 11.4%, so suspended again. And back to Italy: trading in Monte dei Paschi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares has been halted after they fell 7.3%. Away from Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking problems, and the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office for National Statistics has released details of the gender pay gap in various professions. Its interactive tool to see the gap in your job sector is here. And my colleague Katie Allen has written an analysis: If you are a female traffic warden or probation officer read on for good news. If you are a female chief executive you may want to look away now. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stubbornly wide gender pay gap is well-known. Almost half a century on from the gender pay act, there is still an 18.1% difference in average pay between men and women. Of course, such average figures for all employees tell a narrow story. They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, for example, account for the fact more women work in lower paid jobs or sectors. But now people can quickly look up how things stand between the sexes in their particular job with a new interactive tool from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). It also shows how many women and men work in each role. For example, women classed as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153chief executives and senior officials\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are paid 28.7% less than men in that group, at \u00c2\u00a334.91 per hour versus \u00c2\u00a348.94 per hour for men. Women hold 30% of those jobs. Her full piece is here: News of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rejection of an extension for the Monte dei Paschi fundraising has seen the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares drop 6.6%. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The decision by the European Central Bank to reject Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demand for more time to secure private funding for a bailout of Monte dei Paschi is likely to keep markets apprehensive at the prospect of how any new Italian government might look in the context of dealing with the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking sector, bringing closer the prospect of a possible politically toxic bail-in of retail bondholders. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full Reuters report on Monte dei Paschi: The European Central Bank has rejected a request by ailing Italian lender Monte dei Paschi di Siena for more time to raise capital, a source said on Friday, in a move that piles pressure on the Italian government to bail out the bank. The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third-largest lender, and the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest, had asked for a three-week extension until January 20 to try to wrap up a privately funded, 5 billion euros ($5.3 billion) rescue plan in the face of fresh political uncertainty. The ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supervisory board turned down the request at a meeting on Friday on the grounds that a delay would be of little use and that it was time for Rome to step in, the source said. The Italian government is expected to intervene to recapitalise the bank to avert the risk of it being wound down. The failure of Monte dei Paschi could threaten the savings of thousands of retail investors, ripple across the wider banking sector and provoke a financial crisis in the euro zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third-biggest economy. Italy faces the risk of early elections, and the prospect of an anti-euro party coming to power, after Prime Minister Matteo Renzi quit this week following the heavy defeat of his plan to reform the constitution in a weekend referendum. Breaking: Shares in Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS), are down 2% on reports that the ECB will reject the Italian bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s request for more time to raise capital. The clock is now ticking on the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest bank and it throws open the possibility that the Italian government will to step in to help it find the billions of euros it needs to bolster its capital. Meanwhile more on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s productivity puzzle: Sticking with Ireland, GDP increased by 4% in the third quarter, driven higher by consumer spending and exports. It put the annual growth rate at 6.9%, and left the Irish economy on track to be the fastest growing among its European peers for a third successive year in 2016. Alan McQuaid, chief economist at Merrion Stockbrokers: The government looks on target for its forecasts, the figures are stronger than expected. Consumer spending is holding up well, at this stage there is no sign of a major Brexit hit. Fyffes, the Dublin based grower and distributor of fruit, has agreed to a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac751m (\u00c2\u00a3631m) bid from Sumitomo, which supplies about one in three bananas sold in Japan. Fyffes employs more than 6,000 people and is focused mainly on bananas, pineapples and melons. It has an annual turnover of more than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.2bn. Fyffes shareholders will receive \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.23 a share, representing a 49% premium on the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s closing price on Thursday. The McCann family have run the company for many years, and hold a stake of over 12% according to the Irish Times. Commenting on the deal, chairman David McCann, said the deal would help Fyffes to grow: Our employees, customers, suppliers and joint venture partners will benefit from Fyffes being part of an enlarged group with greater scale, reach and resources to broaden and accelerate delivery of Fyffes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 strategic objectives. Gold is on course for its fifth weekly drop as investors price in a Federal Reserve rate hike next week. Spot gold fell 0.1% to $1,170.06 an ounce, leaving it down 0.6% over the week. The precious metal fell more than 8% in November, and hit a 10-month low on Monday. US Treasury yields have risen since Donald Trump won the US presidential election, which is a negative for gold because it pays no interest. The Bank of England has published its latest quarterly inflation expectation survey. It gives an indication of what the public thinks is happening to prices. When asked what the current rate of inflation is, the median answer given was 2.3%, up from 1.8% in the August survey. (At the last count the official rate of inflation was actually 0.9%.) More than 2,000 people aged 16 and over were surveyed. October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade data was partly flattered by a particular poor performance in September. The ONS admitted on Tuesday an error in trade figures going back to 2015. It meant the trade performance was healthier than previously estimated before the referendum, but worse than previously estimated after the Brexit vote. Full story here: City economists say the stronger-than-expected export performance suggests trade could make a decent contribution to GDP in the fourth quarter: Howard Archer at IHS Markit: Very much on the positive side, the trade performance improved substantially in October as exports jumped 4.6% month-on-month and imports fell 3.6% . This suggests that net trade can make a decent positive contribution to GDP growth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although it needs to be remembered that the data can be highly volatile and subject to significant revisions The hope for the UK economy going forward is that the substantial overall weakening of the pound since the UK voted to leave the European Union in June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum will increasingly feed through to boost foreign demand for UK goods and services. (Archer believes the economy will grow by 0.4% in the fourth quarter, following 0.5% growth in the third quarter.) Scott Bowman at Capital Economics: While the monthly data are extremely volatile, the narrowing in the trade deficit in October sets a solid base for trade in Q4. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, trade should be further supported in the coming months by the fall in sterling seen since the EU referendum, which should improve exporters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 competitiveness and encourage domestic production at the expense of imports. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade in goods deficit narrowed more than expected in October, to \u00c2\u00a39.7bn from \u00c2\u00a313.8bn in September, as exports rose but imports fell. Exports rose by \u00c2\u00a32.1bn to \u00c2\u00a326.8bn, while imports fell by \u00c2\u00a32bn to \u00c2\u00a336.5bn. Policymakers are hopeful that the sharp value in the fall of the pound since the June Brexit vote will boost exports, because it makes British goods cheaper abroad, but the ONS isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced this is what happened in October. Hannah Finselbach, ONS statistician, says: Following the EU referendum the UK trade deficit widened in the third quarter of 2016 and then in October it narrowed again. There remains only limited evidence so far that the depreciation of sterling has led to a marked increase in UK exports. UK construction fell 0.6% in October, disappointing expectations of a 0.2% rise. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t all bad news however, as September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figure was revised higher to 0.9% from 0.3%. It means construction output was 0.7% higher over the year, according to the Office for National Statistics figures. The City regulator is turning its attention to crowdfunding, a rapidly growing sector that lets businesses and individuals raise money from online investors. The Financial Conduct Authority cites several concerns, among them the difficulty for investors to assess the risks and returns of such an investment. Crowdfunding is a massive growth sector, rising from \u00c2\u00a31.7bn of loans, investments and donations in 2014 to \u00c2\u00a33.4bn last year. BrewDog, the self-styled punk brewer, has raised \u00c2\u00a326m from UK beer drinkers using crowdfunding. Read our full story here: Also coming up today are UK trade data and construction output for October. Both will give further clues about how the economy is performing in the final quarter of 2016. Economists are predicting the trade in goods deficit will narrow to \u00c2\u00a311.8bn, while construction output is expected to rise by 0.2% over the month. German exports were weaker than expected in October, rising by 0.5% and not 1% as forecast by economists. It was better than September, when exports fell 1%, but dampened hopes that trade will significantly boost growth in Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy in the fourth quarter. Imports rose 1.3% in October according to the Federal Statistics Office, more than the 0.9% predicted by economists. The jump in imports narrowed Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade surplus to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20.5bn from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac21.5bn in September The FTSE 100 is slightly higher this morning, up 0.1% or five points at 6,397. Elsewhere in Europe, markets are mixed: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: flat at 11,184 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +0.3% at 4,751 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -0.7% at 18,306 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.2% at 9,130 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: +0.2% at 353 Benoit Coeure, executive board member at the ECB, has been speaking to French radio this morning. He says the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprise decision to prolong the programme to next December or beyond, but scale back the pace of purchases, was a vote of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153confidence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the eurozone economy. But he made it clear the bank would do more if necessary, as the eurozone faces a 2017 littered with challenges: There are political risks everywhere, inside and outside of the euro zone. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not up to the ECB to manage political risks, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for the politicians to do. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up to us to draw the economic consequences and the eurozone will still need financial protection to get through 2017, which will be very risky. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei has closed up 1.2% following gains in the US. In Europe markets are on track to make weekly gains following the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision on Thursday to prolong its quantitative easing programme. Investors left scratching their heads as the ECB prolonged the programme but scaled back the pace of monthly purchases to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac80bn might be boosted this morning by EBC official Benoit Coeure, who told French radio this morning policymakers are ready to do more if necessary. In Japan, the Nikkei followed US markets higher, up 1.2% at 18,996. Michael Hewson, Chief Market Analyst at CMC Markets UK, gives this take on markets: Just when you think US stocks may have peaked and can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t move any higher they go and register new all-time highs once again, in what is becoming a fairly regular theme, with the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and the Russell 2000 repeating the trick for the second day in a row. With European markets also posting new multi-month highs as well it would appear that the season of good cheer has come upon us early in the lead up to Christmas, and next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offerings from the US Federal Reserve. Given the result of the Italian referendum it seems completely counterintuitive to be saying that the DAX and the FTSE Mib are on course to post their biggest weekly gains this year, begging the question as to what would have happened if there had been a yes vote and Renzi had stayed? Sometimes markets don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make any sense at all!",

That has created an opening to put a cash offer on the table that is generous by conventional City yardsticks. At \u00c2\u00a310.75-a-share, Sky would be bagged at a valuation that was seen as recently as February but, critically, the price is 40% higher than this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price. Cash bids at that level of premium tend to succeed, especially when there are no other bidders in town.</p> <p>Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independent directors have already agreed the price is fair, which puts 21st Century Fox in a stronger position than News Corporation in 2011. Back then, the independents said they would not accept less than 800p, but the final haggling over price never happened.</p> <p>Could regulators still intervene and block the deal? It is possible. Since 2011, Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland have been folded into the UK company. That means Brussels, which sometimes springs surprises, especially on US companies, could find a way to get involved.</p> <p>But Murdoch will think he has little to fear from the UK end. News Corp pulled its bid in 2011 after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jun/24/phone-hacking-scandal-timeline-trial\">weeks of revelations about phone hacking at the News of the World</a> but he has split his media empire in two since then. The UK newspapers are housed in the company that carries the old News Corp name. This fresh offer comes from 21st Century Fox, the US-listed company that owns a Hollywood studio and the Fox TV network and had nothing to do with phone hacking in the UK.</p> <p>Murdoch has also been around the track on media plurality protections. Back in 2011, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/mar/03/news-corp-bskyb-jeremy-hunt\">Jeremy Hunt, culture secretary at the time, wanted Sky News to be ringfenced to protect its editorial independence.</a> Murdoch was willing to accept that condition at the time and would surely be happy to do so again. He is more interested in ensuring Sky stays in the big league of global media companies as AT&amp;T prepares to buy Time Warner and the newcomers like Netflix and Amazon ramp up their original content. </p> <p>Murdoch will also have noted there was minimal political fuss in the UK when his son James returned as chairman of Sky earlier this year. Outside shareholders in Sky protested at the first opportunity \u00e2\u20ac\u201c <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/13/sky-shareholders-revolt-against-james-murdoch-appointment-chairman-agm\">a majority either opposed or abstained in October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote on the reappointment</a> \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but Westminster barely seemed to notice.</p>",

At \u00c2\u00a310.75-a-share, Sky would be bagged at a valuation that was seen as recently as February but, critically, the price is 40% higher than this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price. Cash bids at that level of premium tend to succeed, especially when there are no other bidders in town. Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independent directors have already agreed the price is fair, which puts 21st Century Fox in a stronger position than News Corporation in 2011. Back then, the independents said they would not accept less than 800p, but the final haggling over price never happened. Could regulators still intervene and block the deal? It is possible. Since 2011, Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland have been folded into the UK company. That means Brussels, which sometimes springs surprises, especially on US companies, could find a way to get involved. But Murdoch will think he has little to fear from the UK end. News Corp pulled its bid in 2011 after weeks of revelations about phone hacking at the News of the World but he has split his media empire in two since then. The UK newspapers are housed in the company that carries the old News Corp name. This fresh offer comes from 21st Century Fox, the US-listed company that owns a Hollywood studio and the Fox TV network and had nothing to do with phone hacking in the UK. Murdoch has also been around the track on media plurality protections. Back in 2011, Jeremy Hunt, culture secretary at the time, wanted Sky News to be ringfenced to protect its editorial independence. Murdoch was willing to accept that condition at the time and would surely be happy to do so again. He is more interested in ensuring Sky stays in the big league of global media companies as AT&amp;T prepares to buy Time Warner and the newcomers like Netflix and Amazon ramp up their original content. Murdoch will also have noted there was minimal political fuss in the UK when his son James returned as chairman of Sky earlier this year. Outside shareholders in Sky protested at the first opportunity \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a majority either opposed or abstained in October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote on the reappointment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but Westminster barely seemed to notice.",

The amount of the award prompted indignation in France. </p> <p>Investigators suspect that the whole process was rigged in favor of Tapie, a business magnate with close connections with political circles, including then-President Nicolas Sarkozy. </p> <p>Civil courts have since quashed the unusually generous award, declared the arbitration process and deal fraudulent and ordered Tapie to pay the money back. </p> <p>Lagarde is accused of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153serious negligence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that allegedly allowed other people in the case to commit a suspected major misappropriation of public funds. </p> <p>Investigating judges say Lagarde committed a series of serious errors when she made the arbitration choice and also, later on, when she refused to challenge the deal, suggesting she may have been influenced by the political connections between Tapie and Sarkozy, according to court documents.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-12-12T16:04:28.341Z\">at 4.04pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-584ec25be4b077e98485026a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-12T15:32:26.275Z\">3.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Despite Lockheed Martin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problem, the S&amp;P 500 index has hit a fresh record high in early trading on Wall Street.</strong></p> <p>The Dow Jones industrial average has also hit a new high, and at 19,776 is getting close to the 20,000 mark.</p> <p>Energy companies are rallying on the back of the oil production cut deal agreed over the weekend.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FoxBusiness/status/808329441202110464\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The Dow touches another record high. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WallStreet?src=hash\">#WallStreet</a>.   <a href=\"https://t.co/50AuEFyHMJ\">https://t.co/50AuEFyHMJ</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/VZj0bMA09Z\">pic.twitter.com/VZj0bMA09Z</a></p>&mdash; FOX Business (@FoxBusiness) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FoxBusiness/status/808329441202110464\">December 12, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-584ebe7be4b0e02f2b16b586\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-12T15:13:05.687Z\">3.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LukeReuters/status/808327698439348224\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">One F-35 \u011f\u0178\u203a\u00a9costs @ $100 million.

                "bodyText":"European stock markets are now closed, so let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wrap up: Financial markets are expecting higher inflation after a group of oil producers sealed their first joint production cut deal since 2001. Brent crude is trading at a 17-month high, up 3.6% or $2 per barrel at $56.27, after 11 non-Opec members including Russia agreed to cut their production by around 550,00 barrels per day. That commitment means Opec will now deliver the 1.2m bpd cut agreed at the end of November, potentially putting a floor under oil prices. However the move has also sparked a selloff in European government bonds, driving borrowing costs higher as investors anticipate a spike in consumer price inflation, and higher interest rates. UK 10-year bond yields hit 1.5% for the first time since March. Mihir Kapadia, CEO and Founder of Sun Global Investments, sum up the situation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The historic OPEC deal over the weekend has led to confidence in the market pushing up to a 5 % surge in Oil prices. Euro Zone government bond yields have risen significantly reflecting among other things an expectation of higher inflation. As Saudi Arabia made greater than expected cuts and non-OPEC countries agreed cuts of 558,000 barrels a day, oil prices peaked at a 17 month high with WTI trading at $54.2 and U.S. Brent rising 4.4% at $56.73 per barrel, steadily clawing out from the slump \u00e2\u20ac\u201c boosting oil stocks and Middle Eastern bonds among other assets. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been drama on Wall Street, where $4bn was wiped off Lockheed Martin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value in early trading after Donald Trump tweeted that its F-35 jets were too expensive. Investors rushed to sell Lockheed shares, as the defence firm rushed out a statement defending the cost of the project and offering to discuss it with the president-elect. Another sign that the president-elect can move the markets with a tweet. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been little progress in the frenzied push to recapitalise Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking sector. That could be a good sign -- Rome\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t given up persuading private investors from injecting fresh cash into Monte dei Paschi (MPS) Italian bank stocks have gained ground today, with MPS closing 3.7% higher tonight. Paolo Gentiloni is being sworn in as Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next prime minister today, so he should soon be able to crack on with tackling the situation. Sources in the Italian Treasury have said that they are prepared to bail out MPS if needed, but hope that the bank can raise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn from investors. A senior ECB policymaker has said the bank has never discussed resorting to helicopter money, in an attempt to stimulate the eurozone economy. Over in Paris, Christine Lagarde has faced judges over claims of negligence during her time as finance minister. And European stock markets have just closed after a fairly unimpressive day. In London the FTSE 100 shed 63 points, or almost 1%, to 6890. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly because the pound had a good day against the US dollar, up almost one cent (bad news for exporters). That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for tonight. Thanks for reading and commenting! GW True to her word, Christine Lagarde has not stayed silent - instead, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s told judges in Paris that she will fight the allegations that she was negligent by allowing the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac400m payment to Bernard Tapie in 2008. Lagarde told the court that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I would like to show you that I am in no way guilty of negligence, but rather that I acted in good faith with only the public interest in mind.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Was I negligent? No. And I will strive to convince you allegation by allegation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (thanks to Reuters for the quotes) Rupert Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempt to take over broadcaster Sky has taken an interesting twist, as my colleague Mark Sweney explains: Advisers on the transaction between Sky and Fox, which is expected to lodge an official bid later this week, are pursuing a so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153scheme of arrangement\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This tactic, which requires Sky to gain approval from investors representing 75% of the voting rights, will ensure that all shareholders against the deal are forced to sell once the threshold is reached. This would protect Murdoch from the unfortunate scenario where he finally claims his prize, but is left with a mutinous rump of investors who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sell their Sky shares. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full statement from Lockheed Martin, defending the cost of its F-35 fighters following Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism. [Lockheed Martin delivered Israel its first two F-35 jets today] My colleague Kim Willsher reports that Christine Lagarde isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t planning to keep silent during her trial: The president of the court asked Lagarde how she intended to defend herself and if she wished to exercise her right to remain silent. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have no intention of keeping silent, madame la presidente,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lagarde replied. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kim\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report: Christine Lagarde\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lawyer has urged the judges at the Plais de Justice to pause her trial for negligence during her time as French finance minister. Associated Press has the latest details from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s court hearing. International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde went on trial Monday in a Paris court, accused of negligence for allowing a huge handout to a well-connected businessman when she was in the French government. Poised and serious, Lagarde took notes as the judge summed up the years-long legal saga that led to charges against her charges she contests. A well-respected pioneer for women in leadership, Lagarde faces up to a year in prison if convicted. A lawyer for Lagarde, Patrick Maisonneuve, pleaded for a delay in the proceedings, arguing that it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make sense for her to face trial while a separate investigation in the broader case is still underway. It is unclear whether the judges will decide Monday on the appeal or adjourn for deliberations. The case revolves around a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac403m ($425 million) payout to tycoon Bernard Tapie in an arbitration deal in 2008 over the botched sale of sportswear maker Adidas in the 1990s, when Lagarde was finance minister. The amount of the award prompted indignation in France. Investigators suspect that the whole process was rigged in favor of Tapie, a business magnate with close connections with political circles, including then-President Nicolas Sarkozy. Civil courts have since quashed the unusually generous award, declared the arbitration process and deal fraudulent and ordered Tapie to pay the money back. Lagarde is accused of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153serious negligence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that allegedly allowed other people in the case to commit a suspected major misappropriation of public funds. Investigating judges say Lagarde committed a series of serious errors when she made the arbitration choice and also, later on, when she refused to challenge the deal, suggesting she may have been influenced by the political connections between Tapie and Sarkozy, according to court documents. Despite Lockheed Martin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problem, the S&amp;P 500 index has hit a fresh record high in early trading on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average has also hit a new high, and at 19,776 is getting close to the 20,000 mark. Energy companies are rallying on the back of the oil production cut deal agreed over the weekend. A Lockheed Martin executive has responded to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attack, insisting that the company has taken steps to cut the costs of its F-35 programme. Reuters has the details: Since the beginning, we have invested hundreds of millions of dollars to reduce the price of the airplane by about 70% since its original costing, and we project it to be about 85 million dollars in the 2019 or 2020 time frame\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, said Jeff Babione, Lockheed Martin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s F-35 programme leader. That hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stopped the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares falling by almos 5% in early trading, knocking almost $4bn off its value. The European Central Bank has never discussed flooding the eurozone with helicopter money. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to ECB board member Beno\u00c3\u00aet C\u00c5\u201cur\u00c3\u00a9, who has just completed an online Q&amp;A about monetary policy. Asked if the ECB could embrace helicopter funding (which means either a) handing the public money, or b) creating money to explicitly fund government spending), C\u00c5\u201cur\u00c3\u00a9 indicated that it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agenda. C\u00c5\u201cur\u00c3\u00a9 also defended the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to trim its QE programme to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn per month of new bond purchases, from April, even though it sees inflation below target in 2019. C\u00c5\u201cur\u00c3\u00a9 also argued that banks shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t grumble too much about record low interest rates -- ultraloose monetary policy does benefit them too: And he gets a bonus mark for playing this delivery too: The president-elect has done it again..... Shares in US defence firm Lockheed Martin are losing altitude in pre-market trading after Donald Trump tweeted that the F-35 fighter jet programme was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153out of control\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd/ Trump is promising to make big cuts once in office, which will wipe 2% off the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price when trading begins on Wall Street in 45 minutes. The F-35 Lightning II joint strike fighter is a stealth jet, designed and manufactured by Lockheed Martin in partnership with other defence firms. Last month the Pentagon awarded Lockheed Martin a $6.1bn contract to produce 57 F-35 stealth fighters -- the ninth batch, and 58% cheaper than the first order. Clearly not enough of a saving for Mr Trump.... The Russian rouble has leapt by 2%, after oil producers hammered out that deal to cut global output by 1.8m barrels per day. One US dollar now buys just 61.2 ruble, the lowest since October 2015 - before fears over Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy hammered the currency: Newsflash: Christine Lagarde has now arrived at the Paris courthouse where she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tried of allegations of negligence (as explained earlier). Security is tight outside the courthouse: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Patrick Maisonneuve, Lagarde lawyer: Officials representing Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors will head back to Athens tomorrow, in another attempt to complete the latest review of its bailout. European Commission officials say they hope to complete the work soon: But...the two sides still seem someway apart, with Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lenders demanding economic reforms to hit its bailout targets. And finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has warned creditors not to be too hardline, urging them to consider compromises. As Tsakalotos put it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Greek expression is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcput water into wine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not an expression I like, because I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like my wine watered down, but you know what I mean, to reach an honest compromise.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Caroline Connan has tweeted from inside France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cour de Justice, where the head of the IMF will face a special tribunal over the Tapie Affair today. Bloomberg also have a snappy summary of the case against Christine Lagarde: Basically, that Lagarde didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do enough to stop a payout to [businessman Bernard] Tapie. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accused of gross negligence in the use of public funds, a rarely used charge brought in cases where the evidence suggests the defendant didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t knowingly participate in activities to defraud the state. According to the indictment, Lagarde got at least two things wrong. First, she gave her go-ahead in October 2007 to the arbitration procedure even though the French investment agency, Agence des Participations de l\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Etat, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153repeatedly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd advised her against it. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also accused of waiving the right to appeal the arbitration decision even though she was told that a possible legal challenge was available.

You can post them on Twitter using the #AskECB hashtag. Italian bank shares are rallying this morning, on hopes that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new government can resolve the problem in its financial sector. UBI Banca, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fifth largest lender, has jumped by over 4% while Unicredit and Banco Populare di Milano have both gained over 2.5% And this is helping Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market to outperform the rest of Europe; Milan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB is the only index up today. The City is hoping that the appointment of Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, will create an opportunity to resolve the crisis. Lena Komileva of G+ Economics explains: Gentiloni\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appointment is expected to mean the current Finance Minister, Padoan, stays in his post to focus on resolving the banking sector. While Monte dei Paschi is teetering on the brink of a collapse, an interim technocratic government is more likely to take on the difficult political capital cost involved in plugging in the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capital gap, by bailing in retail shareholders, with the promise of some fiscal compensation after the next election. The fact that private investors are shunning Italian political risk after the Referendum means that onus lies with the interim government to ensure successful political containment and prevent Eurozone systemic risk. Thus, while investors will continue to dislike uncertainty, the political risk-rewards of a likely compromise with Monte dei Paschi shareholders in the next few weeks, together with the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own backstop mechanisms, means that the situation will likely be contained. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borrowing costs have hit their highest level in around 18 months, as the yield on US Treasury bills rises. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly due to the inflationary impact of the oil deal, and partly due to predictions that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates on Wednesday. Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 source at the Italian Treasury has given more details about how a state bailout of Monte dei Paschi might be handled: European government bonds are taking a bath this morning, amid fears that the deal to curb oil production will drive inflation higher. Prices are falling across the board, which pushes up the yield (or interest rate) on sovereign debt. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-year gilt yield hit 1.5% for the first time since May, up from 1.43% on Friday night. Most eurozone debt is also out of favour. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-year bond yield has hit 0.396%, up from 0.347% on Friday, while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-year yield has hit an 11-month high of 0.919%. And the gap between Italy and Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borrowing costs has widened to its widest level since February 2012 -- the heights of the eurozone debt crisis. Rising bond yields usually signify that the City is expecting higher inflation -- and thus demanding a higher rate of return when buying bonds. Reuters is reporting that Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government is prepared to recapitalise Monte dei Paschi if necessary - but still hopeful that private investors will stump up for the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn cash call. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the story: Italy is ready to pump capital into Monte dei Paschi di Siena if the ailing bank fails to get the money it needs to remain in business from investors, a Treasury source said on Monday. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third-biggest bank is pressing ahead with a plan to raise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn ($5.3 billion) on the market this year,despite political uncertainty in the country after a constitutional referendum triggered a government crisis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is confidence at the economy ministry that Monte dei Paschi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cash call can succeed. If the operation failed, the state would carry out a precautionary recapitalisation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the Treasury source said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s existence and its clients\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 savings will be preserved under any circumstances,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the source added. Last night, MPS reopened its debt-to-equity swap -- which would allow retail investors to convert their bonds into shares. That could help to hit its target of raising \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn in new capital. Over in Italy, shares in Monte dei Paschi (MPS) have jumped by 7.5% at the start of trading. The move came as EU economics commissioner Pierre Moscovici declared that Italy can tackle its banking problems without creating a new crisis. Moscovici was in best \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t panic!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd mode on France Info radio, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is not and there will not be a banking crisis in Italy, there will not be a European financial crisis coming from Italy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have the capacity to deal with the situation and it will be dealt with from both in Italy and at the European level.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still no word on whether private investors will provide MPS with a lifeline, or whether its cash call will fail. Shares in oil companies are jumping this morning as investors anticipate higher profits once the output cuts kick in. Royal Dutch Shell have jumped by 3%, while BP are up 2%. Smaller oil exploration and production are also benefiting, with Tullow Oil up 8% and Cairn Energy gaining 6%. City experts agree that the deal agreed by Opec and non-Opec members are significant. But some suspect that prices may not rise much higher, because America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shale industry has not made promised to make any cuts. Morgan Stanley say this the deal should \u00e2\u20ac\u0153add to bullish sentiment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the market, especially if producers actually comply with the cuts: FXTM Chief Market Strategist Hussein Sayed believes the oil price could push higher -- at which point US shale producers could easily return to the market. With 1.758 million barrels expected to be slashed out of the market, or about 2% of the global oil supply starting January 1, oil prices have more room to rally with Brent potentially crossing above $60 in the next couple of weeks. The market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focus will then switch to compliance with the agreement, and U.S. shale producers who are not a part of the agreement. U.S. rig counts rose by 21 last week to 498, the biggest increase since mid-2015, and the questions now becomes how fast will US shale ramp up production and at what level is it possible to cap the current rally? These production cuts show that Opec and non-Opec members are serious about putting a floor under the oil price, says Naeem Aslam of Think Markets. Saudi Arabia has shown a willingness to bring its oil production below the 10 million barrels a day mark. This is surely a sign that the country is serious about lowering the supply glut on the market. Moreover, this also shows that they are willing to do more than the non-OPEC countries to push the price of oil higher. Traders are also cheering the news that Russia is also going to cut its oil production by 300K barrels a day by May 2017. But Barclays believe prices will fall back during 2017. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are too many moving parts for OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new policy to be sustainable in the long term. The strategy is bound to overshoot, in our view, leading to lower prices in the second half of next year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The oil price is surging this morning, after energy producers hammered out a historic deal to cut output over the weekend. A group of 11 countries who are not part of the Opec cartel collectively agreed to cut output by 558,000 barrels per day, from January 1. That bolsters the production cuts agreed by Opec late last month; they are cutting 1.2m barrels per day in an attempt to cut the worldwide glut in oil and drive prices higher. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the first such deal between Opec and non-Opec members in 15 years. And in further drama, Saudi Arabia also signalled that it might be prepared to make deeper cuts, on top of what it initially pledged. Saudi Oil Minister Khalid al-Falih said after Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I can tell you with absolute certainty that effective January 1, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to cut and cut substantially to be below the level that we have committed to on November 30.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This is having a serious effect on oil this morning, driving Brent Crude and US Crude price to their highest level since last July. Brent, the benchmark for global oil price, is up 4.4% at $56.73 per barrel. Great news for Opec. But if prices stay at the levels, motorists can expect to pay more at the pump, and heating our homes might get pricier too.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Coming up today.... The battle to rescue Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks will continue this week, now that foreign minister Paolo Gentiloni has been chosen to replace Matteo Renzi as prime minister. Executives at Monte dei Paschi, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest bank, are making a final attempt to persuade private investors to back its \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn cash call. If they fail, the bank could soon find itself swept into a bail-in. From Rome, my colleague Stephanie Kirchgaessner reports: Executives at Monte dei Paschi of Siena (MPS) were fighting on Sunday night to salvage a multibillion-euro rescue by private investors in a frantic attempt to prop up the bank. In a statement released after a board meeting on Sunday, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest bank said it would forge ahead with a debt-for-equity swap offer for tens of thousands of retail investors. The offer still requires regulatory approval. If MPS manages to convince investors to go along with the plan, it would help it avoid a government bailout by Italy, which would have far-reaching economic and political consequences. A deal to prop up MPS was thrown into doubt last week after the European Central Bank (ECB) reportedly said it could not have more time to secure the private investment. MPS had sought an extension until 20 January. Also on the agenda: Investors are watching the oil price closely, after producers agreed an output deal over the weekend (more on that shortly). IMF chief Christine Lagarde is appearing before judges in Paris this afternoon, over charges relating to the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac400m payment made to businessman Bernard Tapie when she was French finance minister. Lagarde denies charges of negligence, but could potentially face up to a year in jail and a fine of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15,000 if convicted. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already pleaded her case on France 2 television, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Negligence is a non-intentional offence. I think we are all a bit negligent sometimes in our life. I have done my job as well as I could, within the limits of what I knew.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And traders are also counting down the hours until Wednesday afternoon, when America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank, the Federal Reserve, is widely expected to raise US interest rates. Fed chief Janet Yellen will also face a lot of questions about president-elect Donald Trump, we assume. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

Financial system stability needs to be maintained in a challenging environment. </p> <p> Austria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery has strengthened. In 2016, we project growth at 1.4 percent, an improvement over the average growth of 0.6 percent in 2012-15. Growth has been broad based, driven by private consumption supported by income tax reductions, a recovery in investment, and higher public consumption due to spending on refugees. At 1.4 percent y/y in October, inflation remains low, but is above the Euro Area average (0.5 percent). Employment growth has picked up in 2016, catching up with the rising labor supply driven by migration and higher labor force participation. As a result, unemployment has stabilized recently, although it remains elevated relative to historical levels...</p> <p>A reform package combining structural reforms with deficit-neutral fiscal measures could permanently boost potential GDP by some 3 percent over the medium term. Efficiency gains in public spending would create fiscal space for further growth-supporting policies and ensure the continued decline of public debt.

Is it likely when around 45% of pensioners receive monthly payments below the poverty line of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac665, and almost four million people, that is more than a third of the population, have been classed as being at risk of poverty or social exclusion, that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main problem is that pensions and tax credit allowances are too generous?</p> <p>At the same time, the only reason why more people are exempt from paying income tax is that fewer people have decent incomes. So the IMF that is supposedly rethinking the relationship between development and inequality, and is rightly emphasizing the importance of inclusive growth, seems to be unaware that further reducing pensions and the tax credit allowance cannot but fail to increase both inequality and social exclusion. But at least then the numbers will add up.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>The Greek finance minister emphatically denied that Athens had agreed with the demand of its euro zone partners to pursue a primary surplus of 3.5% of GDP in the post-programme period.</strong></p> <p>Instead, he said the Greek government had offered a compromise solution when euro zone finance ministers held their last meeting on December 5th. <br> \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I laid out the position of the Greek government that high primary surpluses for an economy like Greece and what it has gone through during the crisis make no economic or political sense,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he insisted. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some member states were supporting the position that the 3.5% figure should be preserved for ten years; others were working towards a compromise of five years. The Greek position was that neither would work for Greece and we suggested the compromise of going down immediately to 2.5%, but agreeing with the institutions that the one percentage point reduction from 3.5% should be spent entirely on reducing taxes on small and medium sized enterprises, thus enhancing competitiveness and growth. What was the IMF response? The IMF argued within the Eurogroup that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter to us whether it is three, five or ten years of high surpluses, we will still need to see more measures to make the numbers add up since we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that 3.5% is achievable without such measures\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It did not bother to address our compromise suggestion.</p> <p>So Greece has not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153agreed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to anything yet. However, it is under intense pressure from its creditors to do so. The IMF has done little to alleviate that pressure. Instead of having the courage of its convictions and helping us reduce the size and/or the timespan of the surpluses, it is putting all the pressure on us to specify new austerity measures for 2019 and beyond.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Phew!</strong> And separately, the Athens government has just suggested that talks with its lenders over its bailout programme could be completed early next month.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/dgatopoulos/status/808626581669347332\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Govt Spokesman: Deal with bailout lenders could be in &#39;first few days of January&#39; - Athens still wants IMF in Program<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash\">#Greece</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bailout?src=hash\">#Bailout</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/C3yWKcHcD9\">pic.twitter.com/C3yWKcHcD9</a></p>&mdash; Derek Gatopoulos (@dgatopoulos) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dgatopoulos/status/808626581669347332\">December 13, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-12-13T11:52:06.150Z\">at 11.52am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-584fd7a6e4b077e9848506b6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-13T11:13:20.754Z\">11.13am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Rebecca Long-Bailey MP</strong>, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, is concerned that the cost of living in Britain jumped in November</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153This rise in inflation, following many independent forecasts expecting it to go up further while earnings are set to fall back in coming years, only continues to underline why Labour have been calling on the government to change direction and reverse their cuts to in-work benefits such as Universal Credit, and disabled people on ESA.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-584fd2dae4b0e02f2b16b9b1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-13T11:02:31.447Z\">11.02am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Nick Dixon, Investment Director at investment group Aegon, believes rising inflation will prompt the Bank of England to raise interest rates in 2017:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Low interest rates are reaching the end of the road.

                "bodyText":"With the Dow Jones Industrial Average hovering around 19,900 for the first time and Unicredit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move to shore up its balance sheet supporting banking shares, European markets are on the rise again. Investors have turned positive ahead of the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expected interest rate increase on Wednesday, as the Santa rally continues. the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 78.15 points or 1.13% higher at 6968.57, its highest close since the end of October Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax added 0.84% to 11,284.65 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac climbed 0.91% to 4803.87 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB finished 2.49% higher at 18,827.61, with Unicredit up nearly 16% Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 1.58% better at 9331.3 But in Greece, as a row about its bailout continued, the Athens market dipped 0.1% to 639.71 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 105 points or 0.5% at 19.901. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Back with Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras and his visit to the island of Nisyros: The continuing rise in the US stock market ahead of Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve interest rate decision continues to drag Europe higher. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: There seems no stopping the Dow, as the headline index of US stocks lurches towards the 20,000 mark. The rally was supposed to start from the middle of the month, but with the Fed looming tomorrow, everyone seems keen to jam the index higher now, regardless of the consequences. In reality, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably look back on 2016 as the year when the Santa rally began in November; no one really thought Santa would be a US businessman and TV personality with a penchant for outrageous statements, but in this seventh year of the post-financial crisis rally, we really should be prepared for anything. Perhaps the post-Fed environment will be different, but those expecting a big slump before the end of the year should be prepared for disappointment (and frankly, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d spoil the festive mood anyway). Instead, the next two weeks will most likely see the market drift, before the real work begins anew in January. Meanwhile Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras has further racheted up the pressure by announcing economic relief measures for Greeks living on far flung Aegean isles. Helena Smith reports: Islands which have borne the brunt of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s refugee crisis will henceforth be exempt from a special VAT tax demanded by creditors keeping the country afloat, said Tsipras making the announcement during a flying visit to one of the isles. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Citizens on these islands must feel sure that the state is looking after them,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the leader said speaking from the tiny island of Nisyros this afternoon. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They are shouldering the burden of reception and hospitality and, ultimately, the entire burden of Europe.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The prime minister, who has already raised hackles announcing a one-off Christmas bonus for pensioners surviving on \u00e2\u201a\u00ac800 or less, said his leftist-led government would not buckle under pressure to rescind the measure. The supplement, he insisted, came from money saved. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will keep to the programme completely but we are not going to ask anyone about giving surplus money to those most in need.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Senior government sources said the IMF had repeatedly got it wrong when it came to Greece. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It has gone from being excessively optimistic when it participated [in the last rescue programme] precisely because it wanted to stress its viability to overly pessimistic precisely because it is not participating in it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said one. Emergency funding to Greek financial institutions from the central bank continues to fall, according to new figures. Assistance from the Bank of Greece fell by 2.8% or \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.3bn in November to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac45bn compared to the previous month. Ahead of the US rate decision on Wednesday - with the first hike in a year widely expected - Wall Street is on the front foot again. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has hit a new intra-day high of 19,915, although it has come off its best level to sit at 19901, up 105 points. The S&amp;P 500 has added 0.34% to a new high, while the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.37%. Back with Greece and the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s insistence it was not demanding more austerity. The eurozone appears very unhappy at the fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments, and called for the discussions over Greece not to be aired in public. Reuters reports: Euro zone officials hit back at the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday for publishing an article on the way forward for Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal and economic policy that thrust into the open a row between the lenders over Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bailout. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The European institutions were surprised that the IMF staff published a blog post on the ongoing negotiations with the Greek government as new talks in Athens are starting with the aim of concluding the second review,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said a spokesman for the euro zone bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We hope that we can return to the practice of conducting program negotiations with the Greek government in private.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The IMF article appeared as the Fund and the euro zone struggle to find common ground on Greek policies that would allow the IMF to take part in the latest bailout, the third one since 2010 and now fully financed by the euro zone. The IMF, which a group of countries led by Germany very much want to join the latest program for credibility reasons, says euro zone targets set for Greece are too ambitious and assumptions on reform implementation too optimistic. It said it was against further austerity in Greece and that a primary surplus target of 3.5 percent of GDP in 2018, on which the euro zone insists, risks damaging the nascent recovery. The head of the European Department Poul Thomsen and chief economist Maury Obstfeld said a Greek primary surplus of 1.5 percent in 2018 would be enough and stood a better chance of being sustained for several years. After its latest contribution to the Greek debt crisis, the IMF has also issued its latest thoughts on Austria. In its latest assessment of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s situation it said: Austria is stable and prosperous. Nevertheless, it can still improve its economic performance to ensure a continuing rise in incomes and employment within a stable macroeconomic environment. To this end, a comprehensive package of structural and fiscal reforms can raise low GDP growth and ensure the steady decline of public debt in the long term. Financial system stability needs to be maintained in a challenging environment. Austria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery has strengthened. In 2016, we project growth at 1.4 percent, an improvement over the average growth of 0.6 percent in 2012-15. Growth has been broad based, driven by private consumption supported by income tax reductions, a recovery in investment, and higher public consumption due to spending on refugees. At 1.4 percent y/y in October, inflation remains low, but is above the Euro Area average (0.5 percent). Employment growth has picked up in 2016, catching up with the rising labor supply driven by migration and higher labor force participation. As a result, unemployment has stabilized recently, although it remains elevated relative to historical levels... A reform package combining structural reforms with deficit-neutral fiscal measures could permanently boost potential GDP by some 3 percent over the medium term. Efficiency gains in public spending would create fiscal space for further growth-supporting policies and ensure the continued decline of public debt. Maintaining financial stability is a key component of a stable overall macroeconomic environment. Time for a quick look at the European markets. The moves by Italian bank Unicredit to bolster its balance sheet have lifted the banking sector, while after the excitement of the Murdoch bid for Sky, Italian broadcaster Mediaset is also in demand after France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Vivendi said it planned to raise its 3% stake to as much as 20%. So the pan-European Stoxx 600 index is up 0.74% to an 11 month high. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB is up 1.4%, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac have both climbed 0.51%. In the UK, the FTSE 100 is 0.6% better after stronger than expected UK inflation figures. Ahead of the expected US rate rise on Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is expected to open around 66 points higher. Shareholders in the Bank of Cyprus have overwhelmingly backed plans for a London listing. Some 99.74% have approved the move, which will see the bank keep its listing in Cyprus but abandon its quote on the Athens stock exchange. The bank said the standard listing in London was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a key milestone\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in its recovery since 2013. It added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A holding company has been established in Ireland in order for the Group to be considered eligible for inclusion in the FTSE UK Index Series following a step up to a premium listing at a future date.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It said the London listing would improve the liquidity of its stock and give it access to a wider range of investors capable of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153supporting the Bank in the long-term.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit, and Manos Giakoumis of analyst service Macropolis both sound pessimistic about the Greek bailout: Back in the UK, drivers for the Argos retail chain have called a 72-hour strike in a row over holiday pay. The industrial action could make it harder to get presents from Argos in time for Christmas: Our friends at The Telegraph have published a handy Q&amp;A on the Greek bailout saga, as relations between the various parties appear to deteriorate. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: Right now Greece and the EU have lined up an $86bn bailout, hoping that the IMF will join in. Germany in particular is keen to have the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seal of approval, as it is seen as a sign that the deal is rigorous. Much of the discussion currently focuses on the degree of fiscal tightening that can take place, as the IMF fears the EU is being too tough, while the EU thinks the IMF is too pessimistic over what can be achieved. Those talks will continue into the new year, rather than the IMF joining in 2016 as had been hoped in Brussels and Athens. A short-term deal has been agreed that cancels a planned rise in interest rates on Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debts, and aims to guarantee the current low cost of funds for years to come. But the underlying economy is still in a dire shape - unemployment is above 23pc, and sustained GDP growth remains elusive. In the longer term, the IMF wants major reforms to the Greek economy. This new war of words between Greece and the IMF suggests that the Greek debt crisis, rarely dormant for long, is flaring back into life again. The Wall Street Journal suggests today that early elections are a possibility, if Athens and its creditors cannot agree on what measure to take to ensure Greece is complying with its bailout. The WSJ says: The embattled prime minister Alexis Tsipras, who is due to hold talks with the leaders of Germany and France in the coming days, surprised Greeks and creditors last week with fiscal gifts that were widely seen as preparing the option of elections. He promised 1.6 million pensioners a Christmas bonus of between \u00e2\u201a\u00ac300 ($319) and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac800. He also suspended a planned increase in sales tax for Aegean islands that have received large numbers of Middle-East refugees. EU officials said they would study whether Mr. Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promises are compatible with Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout commitments. Snap elections next year would lead to Syriza\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defeat, party officials expect, and a new government led by the conservative New Democracy party. Syriza officials say their goal in possible elections would be to avoid being crushed\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhich they view as a danger if they hold on too long without concessions from creditors. Gabriel Sterne of Oxford Economics flags up how Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to boost tax receipts have backfired spectacularly since its first bailout: The European Commission has also been defending itself from the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism of the Greek bailout: Breaking away from UK inflation, because Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister has got in touch with us. Euclid Tsakalotos isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happy with the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim last night that it hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been forcing more austerity on Greece. [As explained earlier, the Fund says it shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be blamed for asking if the targets agreed between Greece and the rest of Europe are credible] Tsakalotos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments come as monitors arrive in Athens for fresh talks about the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout programme. From Athens, Helena Smith reports: Greece is being boxed into a corner and the International Monetary Fund is economizing with the truth when it says it is not asking for more austerity but rather is the victim of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bizarre predilection to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153agree\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to higher primary fiscal targets of 3.5% of GDP. That is the verdict of Euclid Tsakalotos, the Greek finance minister who in exclusive comments to the Guardian this morning responded witheringly to the Washington-based body\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assertion that Athens will need to make yet more pension and tax cuts after its bailout programme expires in mid-2018 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a demand that no government, after seven years of relentless recession, could accept or survive. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Oxford philosopher J L Austen was particularly critical of forms of argument that relied on the following technique: there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the bit where you say it, and then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the bit where you take it back. The IMF is particularly open to this criticism,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tsakalotos told me. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In effect it is arguing for Greek pensioners and poorer wage earners to make further economies, while it economizes on the truth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Oxford-educated economist, who was raised in Britain, said in its obsession to make the numbers add up the IMF was now advocating policies that would increase inequality and social exclusion \u00e2\u20ac\u201c contradicting its own self-avowed goal of emphasising the importance of inclusive growth. In their blog overnight, the Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Europe director Poul Thomsen and chief economic counsellor Maurice Obstfeld argued that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greece cannot modernize its economy by boosting funding for infrastructure and well-targeted social programs while exempting more than half of households from income taxes and paying public pensions at the level of the richest European countries.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tsakalotos disputes this claim, arguing that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greek expenditure on both pensions and other subsidies is about 70% of the EU average and 52% of that of Germany. Is it likely when around 45% of pensioners receive monthly payments below the poverty line of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac665, and almost four million people, that is more than a third of the population, have been classed as being at risk of poverty or social exclusion, that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main problem is that pensions and tax credit allowances are too generous? At the same time, the only reason why more people are exempt from paying income tax is that fewer people have decent incomes. So the IMF that is supposedly rethinking the relationship between development and inequality, and is rightly emphasizing the importance of inclusive growth, seems to be unaware that further reducing pensions and the tax credit allowance cannot but fail to increase both inequality and social exclusion. But at least then the numbers will add up.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Greek finance minister emphatically denied that Athens had agreed with the demand of its euro zone partners to pursue a primary surplus of 3.5% of GDP in the post-programme period. Instead, he said the Greek government had offered a compromise solution when euro zone finance ministers held their last meeting on December 5th. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I laid out the position of the Greek government that high primary surpluses for an economy like Greece and what it has gone through during the crisis make no economic or political sense,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he insisted. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some member states were supporting the position that the 3.5% figure should be preserved for ten years; others were working towards a compromise of five years. The Greek position was that neither would work for Greece and we suggested the compromise of going down immediately to 2.5%, but agreeing with the institutions that the one percentage point reduction from 3.5% should be spent entirely on reducing taxes on small and medium sized enterprises, thus enhancing competitiveness and growth. What was the IMF response? The IMF argued within the Eurogroup that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter to us whether it is three, five or ten years of high surpluses, we will still need to see more measures to make the numbers add up since we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that 3.5% is achievable without such measures\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It did not bother to address our compromise suggestion. So Greece has not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153agreed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to anything yet. However, it is under intense pressure from its creditors to do so. The IMF has done little to alleviate that pressure. Instead of having the courage of its convictions and helping us reduce the size and/or the timespan of the surpluses, it is putting all the pressure on us to specify new austerity measures for 2019 and beyond.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Phew! And separately, the Athens government has just suggested that talks with its lenders over its bailout programme could be completed early next month. Rebecca Long-Bailey MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, is concerned that the cost of living in Britain jumped in November \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This rise in inflation, following many independent forecasts expecting it to go up further while earnings are set to fall back in coming years, only continues to underline why Labour have been calling on the government to change direction and reverse their cuts to in-work benefits such as Universal Credit, and disabled people on ESA. Nick Dixon, Investment Director at investment group Aegon, believes rising inflation will prompt the Bank of England to raise interest rates in 2017: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Low interest rates are reaching the end of the road. Inflation is now on the rise and sentiment amongst monetary policy makers is hardening in the UK and US. With expectations that UK inflation will exceed its 2% target in early 2017, we can expect monetary belt tightening during the next 6-9 months. Whilst savers will cheer signals that interest rates will follow suit, mortgage holders are already starting to see the best rates disappear and may want to speak to their adviser about fixing rates quicker than the Bank can make its move.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd You can see the full inflation report here. Andrew Sentance, PwC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, says Britain is now feeling the effect of the plunge in the pound since the Brexit vote. And further price rises are on the horizon, he warns: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Inflation is picking up as expected - to its highest level for over two years. Prices in the shops and on the garage forecourt are starting to reflect the big drop in sterling since the EU referendum result. Clothing prices have risen by over 4% since June and motor fuel prices are 7.4% up on a year ago. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is more inflation coming through the pipeline. The prices of UK manufactures are already 2.3% up on a year ago and the cost of raw materials, energy and other inputs into the manufacturing process are nearly 13% higher than a year ago. We should therefore expect inflation to rise to close to 3% by the end of next year, which will squeeze consumer spending and slow economic growth. We are leaving behind the very favourable world of near-zero inflation which has benefited consumers over the past couple of years. Digging into the inflation report, the ONS points out that some tech firms have been hiking their price because of the weak pound. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key section: Recreation and culture: Prices, overall, increased by 0.5% between October and November 2016, compared with a negligible change a year ago. The upward effect came principally from data processing equipment where prices rose this year but fell a year ago, particularly for peripherals. There have been reports from some IT equipment manufacturers over the last few months of prices being affected by changes in the exchange rate with products generally being priced in US dollars. The ONS is is absolutely right - Apple raised the prices of several MacBook pros by hundreds of pounds in October, for example. The report also contains the surprising news that leather sofas have got pricier: Clothing and footwear: the upward effect came mainly from clothing (in particular women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outerwear) for which prices, overall, increased by 1.6% between October and November this year, compared with a fall of 0.1% between the same 2 months a year ago. Furniture, household equipment and maintenance: Prices, overall, increased by 0.5% between October and November 2016, compared with a fall of 0.2% a year ago. Within this group, the largest contribution to the change in the rate came from prices for furniture and furnishings, particularly leather settees. There was also an upward contribution from non-durable household goods such as household cleaner cream and bleach. Transport: The upward contribution to the change in the rate came from motor fuels, with petrol prices rising by 1.6 pence per litre between October and November this year but falling by 1.5 pence per litre a year ago. Similarly diesel prices rose by 2.0 pence this year but fell by 0.6 pence a year ago. Fuel prices tend to reflect movements in oil prices and part of the increase in oil prices during 2016 to date can be explained by depreciation of sterling against the US dollar. Food and non-alcoholic beverages: Prices, overall, increased by 0.4% this year compared with 0.1% a year ago leading to a small upward contribution to the change in the rate. The main upward effects came from: bread and cereal products such as garlic bread and pizza; and milk, cheese and eggs, particularly milk and yoghurt/fromage frais. These were partly offset by a small downward effect from confectionery. The ONS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of inflation Mike Prestwood, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slight rally in the value of sterling eased the inflationary pressure on businesses importing raw materials but consumer prices continued to edge upwards, due mainly to the rising cost of clothing and fuel.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at city firmi Xtrade, also fears that British households face difficult times: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Inflation has soared to a 25-month high as Brexit uncertainties and sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s devaluation continue to filter through the UK economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These latest figures are expected to limit the buoyant consumer spending which has accounted for the resilience in growth since June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum. Meanwhile, the increasing weakness of the Brexit-hit pound is likely to provide households with a painful few months as rising prices take their toll. The pound has risen almost half a cent since the inflation data was released, to $1.2718. Tom Stevenson, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International, warns that inflation appears to be heading over the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target: Higher inflation means the pound in your pocket won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stretch as far and many will be thinking how they can make their money work harder. There is little evidence so far that rising inflation will translate into much higher interest rates, so anyone with savings still sitting in cash will struggle to generate real returns. To stand any chance of achieving an inflation-adjusted real return they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need to look further up the risk spectrum, investing in bonds issued by companies rather than the Government or moving into stocks and shares. The jump in inflation last month may show that the slump in the pound since the EU referendum is now hitting families. Hannah Maundrell of money.co.uk says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwake-up call\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Household finances have been protected against the backlash of Brexit so far but today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s higher than expected figures show it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finally starting to bite. This is the start of things to come and next year we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be battling rising prices head on. This will get worse mid-way through the year as retailer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forward pricing starts to run out and we have to foot the bill for the real cost of purchases. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is an important wake up call and one we should all bear in mind as we head towards the most expensive time of the year. Blow your budget on Christmas now and you could be setting yourself up for a very difficult year ahead. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no better argument for keeping tabs on your festive spending and only celebrating with cash you can afford to part with.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Duncan Weldon of the Resolution Group shows how the cost of consumer goods is now rising, for the first time in two years: Separate data from Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories shows that their output costs (what they charge for their wares) jumped by 2.2% in November. That may drive inflation higher, once those goods hit the shops. Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Jamie McGeever says it will erode real earnings: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccore consumer prices index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rate, which strips out volatile items like energy and food, has risen to 1.4%. That suggests that underlying price pressures are building. At 1.2%, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate is heading back towards the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target: Almost every category of goods and services pushed the inflation rate up: On a monthly basis, the consumer prices index rose by 0.2% between October and November - with clothing and food prices up during the month. Higher petrol and diesel costs, and a fall in food price deflation, drove UK inflation up last month. The Office for National Statistics says: Rises in the prices of clothing, motor fuels and a variety of recreational and cultural goods and services, most notably data processing equipment, were the main contributors to the increase in the rate. These upward pressures were partially offset by falls in air and sea fares. Breaking! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate has jumped to 1.2% in November, up from 0.9% in October. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the highest level since October 2014, and more than economists had expected. More to follow... Milan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is giving Unicredit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan a thumbs-up - shares in the bank are now up 7%. The pound is flat this morning, at $1.2685 against the US dollar, but that could change once November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation figures hit the wires at 9.30am. Kathleen Brooks of City Index explains what traders will be looking for: CPI data out later this morning is worth watching for a couple of reasons, it is expected to rise to 1.1%, which would be the fastest pace of price growth for 2 years, this comes at an interesting time for sterling as the market ponders another leg higher in its recovery. Prices are expected to resume their upward trend after a 0.1% decline in October. Fuel price increases and a reduction in food price deflation is likely to drive CPI higher in November. The one-off factors that weighed on October prices, such as the large drop in clothing sales, are unlikely to be repeated in November. A jump in inflation could trigger concerns that consumers will rein in their spending, she adds. Rising prices could also raise questions about the future for UK consumption, a key pillar of GDP growth. Retail sales have held up well in the last few months as consumers brush off Brexit-uncertainty. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial markets are rather subdued ahead of November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation data, in just under 30 minutes. Defensive stocks, such as consumer good firms, are in favour. The FTSE 100 has risen by 14 points, led by fashion chain Burberry (up 2.7%), with Unilever (+1.6%) also making ground. Italian bank shares are rising, as Unicredit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turnaround plan creates a little more confidence that the sector can get over its problems. Shares in Monte dei Paschi have gained 1.4%, as traders watch to see if it can get its own cash call, of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn, out of the door soon. UniCredit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revamp is a key moment in Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bank crisis, says Reuters columnist Neil Unmack: A cost cull, bad debt purge and mega-cash call mean the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest bank should soon be less of a worry. With Rome facing a volatile 2017, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just as well. Investors may need persuading to back such a huge rights issue, at a time of political uncertainty, he adds. They may conclude that the growth forecasts underpinning the plan are too optimistic. But still: [CEO Jean-Pierre] Mustier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan is robust enough, and healthier bigger lenders could mean more options for smaller ones. Assuming Europe can muddle through, UniCredit shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to. After falling 4% at the start of trading, Unicredit shares are now up almost 3% as investors digest its restructuring plan. Unicredit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rescue plan also involves purging itself of almost \u00e2\u201a\u00ac18 of bad debt. It plans to bundle these non-performing loans into new securities that will be sold off to investors. And it is booking an \u00e2\u201a\u00ac8.1bn provision against losses on bad loans, taking its total charge to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac12.2bn (which is why it needs to hold a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn rights issue to raise new funds from shareholders) Banking analyst Benjie Creelan-Sandford of Jefferies says Unicredit has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gone aggressive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with the restructuring plan announced today. Creelan-Sandford explains: Unicredit has announced a a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn rights issue, much of which will be consumed by writedowns and restructuring charges. The upfront bill of a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn is clearly large but as we have highlighted previously we think an aggressive balance sheet clean-up paves the way for a more substantial re-rating. The aggressive cost reduction is to be supported by substantial IT investment while the bank envisages net headcount reduction of 14,000 people by 2019 (equivalent to over 11% Group headcount). Speaking of banks... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government has just sold another tranche of Lloyds Banking Group shares. This takes its stake below 7% - eight years after Lloyds (and Royal Bank of Scotland) were bailed out. The race to fend off a crisis in Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking sector has taken a decisive shift this morning, as the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest lender unveiled a wide-ranging restructuring plan. Unicredit will raise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn by issuing new shares to investors, clean up the bad debts on its balance sheet and attempt to boost long-term productivity. It is also planning to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153transform\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd its operating model and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153streamline\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd its products and services, to cut costs. And that means cutting jobs too -- Unicredit is announcing another 6,500 job cuts today, which means 14,000 staff will have been culled by 2019. CEO Jean Pierre Mustier, calls it a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pragmatic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd plan, that will tackle its exposure to non-performing loans - the bad debts that have build up over many years and never been tackled. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are taking decisive actions to deal with our NPE legacy issues to improve and support recurring future profitability to become one of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most attractive banks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some instant reaction: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Is inflation back? We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find out at 9.30am GMT when new cost of living data is released. Economists predict that the consumer prices index (CPI) rose to 1.1% in November, up from October, partly due to rising petrol and food prices. If so, that would suggest that the weak pound is now feeding through to consumers, by pushing up import costs. A month ago, UK inflation surprisingly dipped, but analysts at RBC Capital Markets believe CPI will bounce back today: Last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unexpected dip back below 1% y/y on the headline CPI measure had a lot to do with the negative contribution from the clothing and footwear sector. The arithmetic suggests the hurdle is low for somewhat of a reversal this month. Furthermore, it looks likely that petrol prices will also add to the headline annual inflation rate. With oil producers now working together to stem supply, petrol prices are probably heading higher too..... Also coming up today Unicredit, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest bank, is announcing plans to restructure itself and raise billions in new capital. The plan is being unveiled as Rome continues pushing for private investors to rescue Monte dei Paschi, its oldest bank. more on that shortly. Things are hotting up in Greece too, after the International Monetary Fund denied it was forcing more austerity on Athens. In a new blogpost last night,top officials warned that the Greece was not implementing the right sort of policies that would actually lead to growth. In a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blame us!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd moment, Poul Thomsen, director of the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European department, and Maurice Obstfeld, the fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, wrote: It is not the IMF that is demanding more austerity, either now or as a means to lower the need for debt relief over the medium-term. Or to be more direct, if Greece agrees with its European partners on ambitious fiscal targets, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t criticize the IMF for being the ones insisting on austerity when we ask to see the measures required to make such targets credible. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll watch out for reaction to that, plus all the other key events through the day...",

It also increases the chances of snap elections in Greece as after overplaying his hand and facing increasing difficulties in concluding the review, Tsipras may be tempted to cut his losses by calling early elections before SYRIZA loses more support for adopting unpopular measures.</p> </blockquote> <p>Syriza would probably lose an early election, given the right-wing New Democracy party has a significant lead in the polls.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-585181ebe4b03593d414eef1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-14T17:32:24.374Z\">5.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with Greece:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GreekAnalyst/status/809084662614212608\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Tsipras on the offense: he wants MPs to vote tomorrow on the benefits to pensioners &amp; islanders, by name! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash\">#Greece</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/0DHMc3nDKs\">https://t.co/0DHMc3nDKs</a></p>&mdash; The Greek Analyst (@GreekAnalyst) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GreekAnalyst/status/809084662614212608\">December 14, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58517d08e4b04a37cde47817\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-14T17:23:32.613Z\">5.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">European shares slip back ahead of Fed decision</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Markets paused for breath as investors awaited the Federal Reserve interest rate decision in less than two hours.

As prime minister Alexis Tsipras prepares to meet his French and German counterparts later this week, speculation is mounting that he will ask the organisation to withdraw from the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current bailout program. Helena Smith reports from the Greek capital:</p> <blockquote> <p>Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relations with the IMF were never easy. The Washington-based institution has long been blamed fore the gruelling austerity visited on Greeks even when it wholeheartedly endorsed the cause of debt relief.

Sources close to the Greek prime minister say in the wake of the fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to go public with its views \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in a blog penned this week by IMF European director Poul Thomsen and chief economist Maruice Obstfeld \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Tsipras will propose that the organisation abstains altogether from the bailout programme currently keeping the country afloat. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Fund has never officially joined this programme and we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really need it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said one. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At most it could be reduced to a technical, consultative role.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd </p> <p>The leftist leader, who on Tuesday blasted the body for being staffed by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153irrational technocrats,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is said to be incensed that it is now asking for more pension and tax cuts once the programme expires in 2018.

                "bodyText":"We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve waited a whole year for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. And when the big day arrived, the shock result of last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US presidential election rather overshadowed it. So what did we learn? 1) Fed chair Janet Yellen insisted that the US economy was in decent shape, as America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank delivered its first hike in borrowing costs since December 2015. She said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our decision to raise rates should certainly be understood as a reflection of the confidence we have in the progress the economy has made and our judgment that that progress will continue. It is a vote of confidence in the economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But this sunny view didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t last long, with Yellen admitting during the press conference that the Fed was operating under a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccloud of uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, until it knows more about what Donald Trump will do. 2) In the nicest way possible, Yellen indicated that the labour market was doing fine, thanks, without Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan for a $1 trillion infrastructure plan. She said: There may be some additional slack in labor markets, but I would judge that the degree of slack has diminished. So I would say at this point that fiscal policy is not obviously needed to provide stimulus to help us get back to full employment. But nevertheless let me be careful that I am not trying to provide advice to the new administration or to Congress as to what is the appropriate stance for policy. There are many considerations that Congress needs to take account of and many bases for justifying changing fiscal policy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 3) Fed press conferences can be quite dry affairs, but Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most stirring moment came as she defended recent regulations brought in since 2008. Asked about Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to roll back these rules, Yellen reminded us that Dodd-Frank was introduced to avoid another \u00e2\u20ac\u0153devastating financial crisis\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I would say it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very important not to roll back. There maybe some changes that could be made and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve suggested a few, like eliminating the burden of compliance with the Volcker rule or incentive compensation regulations for smaller banks or modestly raising the threshold for banks that are subject to enhanced credential supervision. But I would urge that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to keep this in place.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 4) Yellen found herself in Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crosshairs several times during the election campaign, but she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not planning on quitting the Fed earlier. Asked about her own future, the Fed chair indicated she was going nowhere until her first term expires in 2008: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I do intend to serve out my four-year term. I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t made any decision about the future. I recognize I might or might not be reappointed. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a decision I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to make and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have thoughts on at this time. As you said I recognize too thatI could stay on as a board member, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a decision for another day.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 5) Markets react, despite Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s calming words. Janet Yellen took some pains to insist that the Fed hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t radically changed its approach, even though it now expects an extra rate hike next year (three, not two). This is a very modest adjustment in the path of the fed funds rate, and involves changes by only some of the participants. But with shares down, and the dollar rallying, investors may have concluded that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election win changes the monetary policy landscape. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little more reaction: And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all from us after a busy day on both sides of the Atlantic. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow for more Fed reaction, the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final policy meeting of 2016, and possibly more bailout drama in Greece. Goodnight, and thanks for reading and commenting. GW You can take off the Dow 20,000 hats, folks. The US stock market has closed in the red, with the Dow Jones index shedding 0.6% to finish at 19,792, a drop of around 118 points. The wider S&amp;P 500 lost 0.8%, while the Nasdaq handed back 0.5%. That shows that the Fed was more hawkish than Wall Street expected, or wanted. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wall Street correspondent Rupert Neate on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s developments: The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised interest rates for the first time in a year, and only the second time since the 2008 financial crisis. The US central bank also predicted three further rates increase in 2017, up from previous expectations of two rate hikes. Janet Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153growth is a touch stronger, unemployment is a shade lower\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as she announced a 0.25% increase in the benchmark rate to 0.50-0.75%. It is the first time rates have been raised since December 2015 when the benchmark rate was lifted from near-zero for seven years since the crisis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My colleagues and I are recognizing the considerable progress the economy has made towards our dual objectives of maximum employment and price stability,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yellen said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We expect that the economy will continue to perform well, with the job market strengthening further, and inflation rising to 2% over the next couple of years.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Capital Economics are even more bullish than the Fed, and expects FOUR interest rate rises next year. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly due to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans for a fiscal stimulus package (even though Yellen argues that the labour market doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need the extra help). Capital Economics analysts say: As universally expected, the Fed today raised interest rates for the second time in this economic cycle, with that hike coming a full year after the first increase and more than seven years after the current expansion began. With the economy much closer to full employment now and a strong likelihood of a fiscal stimulus next year, however, we expect the Fed to accelerate the pace of tightening next year, with one rate hike in the first half of next year followed by three in the second half. Dean Turner, Economist at UBS Wealth Management, says we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t underestimate the importance of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate hike: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While this was universally expected, we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget that this is still a big milestone. It marks only the second interest rate increase in a decade from the Fed. The Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anticipation of a faster pace of hikes (three next year vs two previously) and the nudge up in the long-run rate forecast to 3% shows that confidence in the growth outlook is increasing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Investors are also dumping US government debt, sending the interest rate (or yield) on Treasury bills higher. Yields rise when prices fall, so traders are concluding that the Fed was more hawkish about monetary policy than expected (because it now expects three rate rises next year, up from 2 in September) I\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdll post a snap summary of Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference next. In the meantime, shares have fallen on Wall Street over the last 90 minutes as investors digest the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate hike and guidance for 2017. All the main indices are in the red, which means anyone hoping to see the Dow Jones smash through 20,000 points today will be disappointed. The dollar continues to rally, though, as traders react to the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecast for three rate hikes in 2017. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up one whole cent against the euro, which has dropped to $1.052. And finally, we get another question about the US election... Q: Many people are angry about the economy, even though the aggregate performance levels seem pretty good. So are you reevaluating how you see the economy? Yellen says she has long been worried about income inequality, wealth inequality, and the fact that many families haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen real wage gains. These are long-standing concerns. These are not new phenomenons, but the recession was very severe and probably exacerbated them. And the Fed chair insists that central bankers can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t solve these problems -- this is one for politicians. Our policies can affect the overall levels of economic activity, the inflation rate, but policymakers must be alert to these issues, she adds. Yellen then singles out the unemployment level among black and African American workers is higher than the average, before ending the press conference and heading to the door. Q: virtually every economist expected a rate rise today - does the Fed need that level of certainty before taking the plunge? Yellen says this is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not a prerequisite\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Q: You have been criticised by Donald Trump several times, so are you still planning to serve your full term, and would you like a second term? Yellen must have known this would come up; and, smiling politely, she says she would still like to serve her full term (it expires in 2018). She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not considered if she would like a second term, and if she would still serve on the Fed board otherwise. I recognise that I may or may not be reappointed as Fed chair, Yellen adds. Q: Did you discuss Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic plans at this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, and the effect that his victory has had on the financial markets? Yellen reveals that the FOMC did indeed talk about this. All the participants agreed there was considerable uncertainty about how economic policies will change, she says, adding: We are operating under a cloud of uncertainty at the moment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The next question is also about Donald Trump, and his pledge to scrap some financial regulation, such as the Volcker Rule (which stops banks making riskier bets with their own money). Yellen launches a strong defence of the measures taken in recent years, saying: We lived through a devastating financial crisis that took a huge impact on our economy. Most policymakers came away from that crisis thinking we must take steps to avoid a repeat, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I feel we have done that\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, she adds. Q: What do you think about Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweeting, and his attacks on individual companies? (such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin)? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not about to offer the president-elect advice, says Yellen. But she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not rolling over either, saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a strong believer in the independence of the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Q: Why is it riskier to run \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 fiscal policy to strengthen the economy and drag more people into the labour market, rather than relying on monetary policy? [Another question about Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s infrastructure spending ideas] Yellen insists that she has never favoured \u00e2\u20ac\u0153running a high-pressure economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Asked again about potential tax and spending changes, Janet Yellen says that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no obvious need to change fiscal policy to get America back to full employment. But she insists that she is not trying to provide advice to the new administration, or to Congress. Some snap reaction to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference. This is from Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ed Conway: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Meg Greene, economist at Manulife: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Neil Irwin of the New York Times: Q: What will today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate hike, and three more rate rises in 2017, mean for US families? Yellen says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate rise reflects the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confidence in the economic recovery. The economy has been remarkable resilient, she says, adding: It is a vote of confidence in the economy. Households and firms will see very modest changes from this decision, she says. Q: Would tax cuts boost the productivity of the US economy? And how would the Fed react to new policies that improve productivity growth, or didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t? Yellen says policies that boost education, improve the quality of capital, or encourage innovative new companies would all boost the productive potential of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. Q: Do would you have to raise rates faster if we saw fiscal policies that do not improve productivity? Yellen won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speculate about potential policy changes. Onto questions: Q: Why is the Fed now expecting three interest rate rises, not two? Is it because of the economy, or because of Donald Trump? Fed chair Yellen says there is only a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very modest change\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the forecasts, with only a couple of policymakers changing their view (by moving their dot on that chart I showed earlier) Looking ahead, Yellen expects that the US economy will only warrant \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gradual rate increases\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. And then she touches on politics, saying that: Changes in fiscal policy, or other policies, could potentially affect the economic outlook. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a coded reference to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans for an infrastructure spending boost once he takes office. Yellen rattles through the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest economic projections, before concluding that they are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very similar\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ones. GDP growth is a touch stronger, unemployment is a shade lower, and inflation is unchanged, she declares. Over the past seven years, since the depths of the US recession, 15 million new jobs have been created, the Fed chair tells reporters. On inflation, Yellen reminds us that consumer prices rose by an annual rate of 1.5% in October, up more than one percentage point over the last year. And core inflation (excluding fuel and food) came in at 1.75%.. Janet Yellen begins by confirming that the Fed raised interest rates by a quarter point today, to 0.5%-0.75%. She says that 2.25 million net new jobs have been created in the last 12 months, the labour market has improved, and inflation has moved closer to the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target. We expect the economy will continue to perform well, she adds. Janet Yellen has just arrived at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference, to explain why the Fed has raised interest rates today. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a live feed (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also added it to the top of this liveblog) Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans for an aggressive fiscal spending plan have forced the Fed to predict faster rate hikes next year. So argues Lee Ferridge of State Street Global Advisors: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As widely expected the FOMC delivered the second rate hike in this cycle, precisely 12 months after its first move. However, in a major surprise it increased its expectations for the likely rate path in 2017 to three hikes rather than the two forecast following its September update. It seems that in light of the forthcoming Trump fiscal stimulus plan and, signs of both rising price pressures and inflation expectations (helped by the recent OPEC decision to cut oil output) the Fed felt that it needs to adopt a more aggressive rate hiking path. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate hike is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vote of confidence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the US economy. But she also cautions that the economic outlook is still \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfinely balanced\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: Though unemployment is at a nine year low, wages and the participation rate have recently come in flat, which should give some reason for caution. The economy is not yet firing on all cylinders. This trend will likely be observed closely in the New Year, particularly if inflation continues to run below its 2% target, and we might expect Yellen to look for more sustainable labour market improvements before further rises. Ian Kernohan, Economist at Royal London Asset Management, expects the Fed to tread cautiously, until Donald Trump has made his tax and spending plans clearer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed rate hike was long anticipated, so there was no surprise when it came. Attention will now turn to the outlook for monetary policy in 2017. We do expect a sizeable fiscal stimulus to be announced next year; however the size and shape of that package may not be visible for some time. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As a consequence, we expect the Fed to remain cautious on the pace of rate hikes, at least in the first half of next year. The post-election rise in the dollar and bond yields also adds weight to arguments for a cautious approach.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some snap reaction to the decision, starting with Michelle Jamrisko of Bloomberg who remembers how the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts were wrong last year: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new dot plot - showing where its policymakers expect interest rates to be over the next few years: As you can see, a majority of policymakers expect three rate rises in 2017 (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the widest collection of dots in the second column). There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more uncertainty about 2018 and 2019 (which is why the dots are more scattered). Note that one policymaker expects only one rate hike next year, and none in 2018 and 2019! (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the lonely dot that lags behind the rest). The dollar has strengthened, after the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdot plots\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 predicted three rate hikes in 2017. It has gained 0.6% against the euro, meaning \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1 is now worth $1.056, down from $1.062. Shares moved wildly on Wall Street as the Fed decision hit the wires, but things quickly calmed down. The Dow Jones Industrial Average nearly hit 20,000 points, but is now up just 0.12% at 19,936. The Federal Reserve says it has raised borrowing costs because the US economy has continued to strengthen. In today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement (online here), it explains: Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in November indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace since mid-year. Job gains have been solid in recent months and the unemployment rate has declined. The Fed is also confident that the recovery will continue, taking inflation back to its target: The Committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further. Inflation is expected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, it adds. IMPORTANT: The Federal Reserve is also predicting that it will raise interest rates three times in 2017. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from the two rate hikes expected back in September. BREAKING: The US Federal Reserve has voted to raise American interest rates for the first time this year, and only the second time in a decade. Borrowing costs are going up by a quarter-point, to 0.5%-0.75%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what Wall Street expected, and shows that the Fed is confident that the labour market is in solid shape. More to follow.... Just 15 minutes to go, until we get the most eagerly anticipated Fed decision of the year. Michael Scanlon, managing director of Manulife Asset Management, agrees that the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guidance on interest rate policy will be crucial today. He says (via Reuters): The most important thing that investors will be looking atis the interpretation of the commentary from the Fed. I think the market is pricing in about two hikes for 2017 but if the Trump administration is able to reduce corporate taxes, I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be surprised to see four hikes next year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Colin Cieszynski of CNC Markets predicts that the Fed will be cautious about future rate hikes: The big question on everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lips is whether Donald Trump can resist the temptation to tweet about the Fed decision. Currency expert Kathleen Brooks, of City Index, says we must watch Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s twitter activity after the Fed meeting: If Janet Yellen threatens to take away the punch bowl at his growth party could he throw his toys out of the pram, and tweet his displeasure? If he does, then this could cause major volatility in financial markets, and it could also be bad news for stocks, as it is likely to lead to questions about the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence from Presidential meddling in the coming years... On the other hand, if Trump can keep himself away from his Twitter account this evening then this would send a positive message to the markets that he will respect the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence going forward, which could be seen as positive for markets. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible that Yellen could upset the president-elect during her press conference, if journalist ask her about bank reglation. Brooks explains: One area where Yellen and Trump could clash is the Volcker Rule. This is one of the most controversial elements of Dodd-Frank regulation, which essentially bans banks from proprietary trading, and Donald Trump hates it. So if Yellen suggests she might oppose Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to loosen bank regulation, there could be fireworks.... Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Carl Riccadonna reckons the Federal Reserve will deliver an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ambivalent hike\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd today. A what?! He means they will raise borrowing costs by a quarter-point, but avoid making any firm comments on what Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election win means for the economy. Tension in building on Wall Street as investors brace for the Fed decision. The Dow Jones industrial average is bobbing around last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record close, at 19,910 points. The Dow has never been over 20,000 points, but today could be the day....if Janet Yellen reassures the markets. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at City firm IG, says the Fed chair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments today will be crucial: With markets seeing a rate rise as a foregone conclusion, there will be a significant focus upon the language and Fed projections which should shed further light on the 2017 plan. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank is preparing to announce its final monetary policy decision of 2016 at 2pm EST (7pm UK time, or 8pm in most of Europe). Investors and economists are united in predicting that the Federal Reserve will raise US interest rates, probably by a quarter-point to 0.5%-0.75%. This would be the first rate rise for a year, and mean that the Fed thinks America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, and labour market, is strong enough to handle higher borrowing costs. The Fed should also release its latest economic and financial forecasts at the same time; showing how its rate-setting committee sees the future. Fed chair Janet Yellen will then explain the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision at 2.30pm EST. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll liveblog that press conference here. Anyone hoping that the US central bank will also offer insights on president-elect Trump will probably be disappointed. Yellen is likely to stick strictly to the numbers, rather than speculate on what Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic plans might mean for monetary policy. As Jim Caron, fixed income portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, put it (via CNBC) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think too much is unknown. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not going to involve themselves in that. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to do what they can do based on the economic evidence at hand.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dial back a year, and Fed policymakers were predicting four rate hikes in 2016. Instead, a series of shocks - including Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote - have encouraged them to sit tight. So US interest rates have been pegged at 0.25-0.5% for 12 months. But it will be an almighty shock if the Fed doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hike today.... The chances of snap elections in Greece next year have risen, says Wolfango Piccoli of Teneo Intelligence. He says the eurogroup\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to suspend Greek debt relief puts prime minister Alexis Tsipras in a very difficult position. If Tsipras goes ahead with the one-off payment to pensioners, this would further antagonize the EZ creditors, putting at risk the promised short-term debt relief. On the other side, giving in to the creditors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pressure would make Tsipras look amateurish at best, and at worst, further undermine his credibility and standing domestically. This would come on the back of a significant drop in popularity of his own SYRIZA. This new spat between Greece and its Eurozone partners means that the conclusion of the second review will be further delayed. It also increases the chances of snap elections in Greece as after overplaying his hand and facing increasing difficulties in concluding the review, Tsipras may be tempted to cut his losses by calling early elections before SYRIZA loses more support for adopting unpopular measures. Syriza would probably lose an early election, given the right-wing New Democracy party has a significant lead in the polls. Back with Greece: Markets paused for breath as investors awaited the Federal Reserve interest rate decision in less than two hours. An increase for the first time in a year is widely expected, but there will be more focus on what the Fed outlines in terms of future rises, not to mention any comments on the economy and the policies of president-elect Donald Trump. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 19.38 points or 0.28% at 6949.19 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.35% to 11,244.84 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.72% at 4769.24 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 1.18% to 18,606.32 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 1.21% to 9218.4 In Greece, the Athens market lost 3.21% to 619.19 as the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lenders put debt relief on hold On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 18 points or 0.09%. Perhaps the news that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lenders are putting debt relief on hold has not reached prime minister Alexis Tsipras. Or perhaps it has. In any case he has now announced his government will extend a pilot programme to give 30,000 school children free meals come January, which may well add to the annoyance shown already by creditors over his plans for Christmas bonuses for pensioners. Helena Smith reports: After announcing a one-off bonus for pensioners and suspension of a special sales tax on far flung Aegean isles, the leftist leader today turned to school children saying his government would ease the plight of those living in poverty-stricken areas of northern Greece. A pilot programme will, as of January, be funded from the government surplus to feed 30,000 school children living in those parts of Thessaloniki hardest hit by unemployment, he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This programme has been factored into the budget of 2017. It is worth around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac11.5m,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said adding that wherever it had been enforced it had ameliorated the problem of malnourishment among young children and improved their performance at school. Asked if the hand-outs would derail the adjustment programme Greece has agreed to enforce, Tsipras appeared in especially defiant mood. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think everyone has to respect the Greek people, who for the last seven years, have made huge sacrifices in the name of Europe. We have carried the weight of the refugee crisis. In the name of Europe we have, in recent years, implemented an extremely harsh policy of austerity. There has to be respect from all. I have, if you will, no doubt whatsoever because everything that we are doing is absolutely within the framework of the Accord which we are keeping and which our partners should keep too.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Oil prices have recovered from the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lows after the latest US inventory figures showed a bigger than expected dip in crude stocks. In contrast with the American Petroleum Institute\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures on Tuesday, the Energy Information Administration said crude stocks fell by 2.6m barrels last week, compared with expectations of a 1.6m fall. But stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub rise by 1.2m barrels. David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spread Co, said: This data was at odds with yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s API update. This showed an increase in crude inventories of 4.7 million barrels for the week ending 9th December. This was way above the consensus expectation which was for a decline of 1.6 million barrels. In addition, gasoline inventories showed their biggest rise since January. Crude has also been under pressure after OPEC released a report predicting that, despite promised production cuts, the oil market wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rebalance until the second half of 2017. Earlier in the week the International Energy Agency (IEA) had forecast that supply and demand would be in balance in the first half of next year. Traders will be keeping a close eye on the WTI contract to see if it can hold above the $52 level. If it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, then technically the stage could be set for a significant pull-back. Brent crude is currently down 0.5% at $55.43 a barrel having fallen as low as $54.76 during the day. West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is down 0.98% at $52.46 a barrel. Back with Greece: Some more positive news from the eurozone. Italian prime minister Paolo Gentiloni won a confidence vote in the upper house of the Senate, allowing his coalition government to take office. Gentiloni replaced Matteo Renzi, who resigned last week after he lost a referendum on constitutional reform. The Greek stock market is down 2.9% following the news that lenders have put short term debt relief for the country on hold. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters on the latest Greek debt developments: Euro zone lenders have put on hold the implementation of a short-term debt relief deal for Greece on Wednesday after the Greek government proposed to make a one-off payout to pensioners in December, the euro zone bailout fund ESM said. Euro zone finance ministers agreed on Dec 5 to grant Greece short-term debt relief that would reduce the amount of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public debt by 20 percentage points of GDP by 2060. But on Dec 8, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said, without consulting euro zone lenders, that his government would spend 617 million euros in one-off benefits for low-income pensioners ahead of Christmas because Greece exceeded its 2016 primary surplus target. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Following recent proposals by the Greek government to spend additional fiscal resources for pensions and VAT our governing bodies have put their decisions temporarily on hold,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a spokesman for the ESM said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Institutions are currently assessing the impact of Greek government decisions vis a vis the ESM programme commitments and targets. (We) will then analyze the institutions\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 assessment and subsequently decide how to proceed,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. And it seems that Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 plan to give struggling pensioners a Christmas bonus has riled the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors, who had not agreed the deal. The spokesman for the Eurogroup has just said there was no agreement now to implement the latest short term debt measures: Over to Greece where tensions between Athens and the International Monetary Fund continue. As prime minister Alexis Tsipras prepares to meet his French and German counterparts later this week, speculation is mounting that he will ask the organisation to withdraw from the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current bailout program. Helena Smith reports from the Greek capital: Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relations with the IMF were never easy. The Washington-based institution has long been blamed fore the gruelling austerity visited on Greeks even when it wholeheartedly endorsed the cause of debt relief. But the latest spat may be a spat too far. Sources close to the Greek prime minister say in the wake of the fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to go public with its views \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in a blog penned this week by IMF European director Poul Thomsen and chief economist Maruice Obstfeld \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Tsipras will propose that the organisation abstains altogether from the bailout programme currently keeping the country afloat. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Fund has never officially joined this programme and we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really need it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said one. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At most it could be reduced to a technical, consultative role.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The leftist leader, who on Tuesday blasted the body for being staffed by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153irrational technocrats,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is said to be incensed that it is now asking for more pension and tax cuts once the programme expires in 2018. Far too often, he said, the IMF had got it wrong with assessments that either over-estimated or under-estimated the impact of recessionary policies on Greece. In the blog, Thomsen and Obstfeld sought to clarify what they described as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153misinformation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd surrounding the Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role in Greece insisting that far from advocating more austerity the organisation wanted less. Instead, they said, it was the agreement of Athens to achieve higher fiscal targets that made more austerity inevitable. Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 new stance has not been met with universal applause. Many see it as counter-productive, arguing that despite popular myth the IMF is by far Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best ally supporting it on the need for debt relief and primary surplus requirements to be reduced. Wolfgang Manchau, the prominent European affairs columnist, tweeted that Tsipras was making a huge strategic mistake aligning himself with the Europeans against the IMF. Stefanos Manos, Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former finance minister, also said he welcomed the IMF officials\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 intervention. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m glad they went public with their views. Their [blog] comments amounted to a very balanced presentation and made quite a lot of sense,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told me. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some of their points \u00e2\u20ac\u201c like the one that more than 50 % of people in Greece are not taxed at all - were hair-raising, absolutely maddening to read but needed to be aired.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ahead of the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate decision, US markets have edged lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average - which has been toying with the 20,000 barrier for the first time - is down 11 points at 19,900 while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are also marginally lower. All three indices hit new peaks on Tuesday. Oil prices have slipped lower after their surge since the weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement between Opec and non-Opec producers to cut output. The fall follows data from the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday showing a 4.7m weekly rise in US crude inventories compared to expectations of a 1.6m decline. Official figures from the US Energy Information Administration are due later. Meanwhile Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest report showed a growing oil surplus next year unless members stick to their output curbs. Opec said with the cuts the 2017 overhang would reach 1.24m barrels a day, up 300,000 on its previous estimate. Brent crude is currently down 1.29% at $55 a barrel. Something for the Federal Reserve to think about as they sign off on their latest interest rate decision, with the first rise for a year widely expected. Retails sales growth cooled off in November after two months of strong gains. They edged up just 0.1% as consumers cut back on car purchases, while October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure was revised down from the initial 0.8% gain to 0.6%. Economists had been expecting a rise of 0.3%. Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, said: Retailers will be more than a little disappointed with November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drop in retail sales, as well as October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revised figure, which overall leaves question marks hanging over the sector going in to the festive shopping season. However, observers will point to the contentious presidential election as a prime reason for shoppers keeping their wallets closed amid the swirling uncertainty. With retailers making the bulk of their profits in December, the sector will be hoping the lure of sales will be too tempting for shoppers to resist. But signs of rising inflation have come from another set of data. US producer prices climbed 0.4% last month, the largest gain since June, after being unchanged in October. This is higher than the 0.1% increase expected by analysts. Economist Rob Carnell at ING Bank said: ..What really grabs the attention is the 1.3% month on month rise in trade services. This is mainly due to wider margins in the wholesale and retail sector. And as such, could well be echoed in the November CPI release on December 15. With the consensus expectation for only a 0.2% month on month increase in November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headline CPI, we now think that the risk of a higher (say 0.4% month on month) figure is looking more likely. If so, then headline inflation will rise from 1.6% in October, to 1.9% in November - in excess of the 1.7% year on year consensus estimate. With markets looking for little further tightening from the Fed after what looks a near-certain rate hike today - the Fed may start to look as if it is either allowing the economy to run a little hot, or alternatively, falling behind the curve, unless today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expected hike is coupled with more hawkish guidance. Labour market expert Paul Bivand has tweeted some useful charts on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK unemployment report, which show how the labour market appears to be cooling: With the UK employment figures out of the way, investors are waiting patiently for the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rates decision in six hours time. European stock markets are basically flat (the FTSE 100 has lost 7 points, or 0.1%), and Wall Street is expected to open quietly in 75 minutes time. Back in the City, shares in British\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second largest pub chain have soared by a third as a takeover battle breaks out. Punch Tavern is being pursued by Heineken, the Dutch brewer which produces Strongbow and Foster\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, and also by Alan McIntosh, one of Punch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cofounders. This two-way battle, broken by Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mark Kleinman this morning, has excited the City. Shares in Punch have rocketed by 35% to 172p, from 128p, a two-year high. The company leases urban and rural pubs across the country to tenant landlords, and has been spending years tackling its huge debt pile build up before the financial crisis. Punch has just issued a statement, confirming that it is in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153advanced discussions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with the Heineken side, Patron Capital Advisers ,about an offer of 174p per share. It is also in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153discussions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with McIntosh\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consortium, Emerald Investment Partners, which are offering 185p per share (subject to due diligence etc). Punch cautions that: There can be no certainty that any firm offer will be made by either Patron or Emerald. A further announcement will be made in due course. Both groups have until 11 January to make a firm bid, or walk away. That might not be the end of it, though -- industry regulators might have concerns about such a large pub estate changing hands, especially as Heineken already owns 1,100 leased pubs. The Resolution Foundation have helpfully fired some charts over., showing how real wage growth is still below its pre-crisis levels (pay rises minus inflation). They also warn that inflation could overtake pay rises in 2017, hitting workers with another pay squeeze: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report shows that there are now 4.75 million self-employed people in the UK, up 129,000 compared to last year. Mike Cherry, National Chairman at the Federation of Small Businesses, is urging the government to provide more help for these workers - who aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t entitled to the full range of benefits which employees receive. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The huge rise in self-employment since the recession must be met with action. There is much to do to improve our social security and financial systems in particular. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Social security and our tax system have not kept up with the changing nature of 21st century work. It is urgent that Government gets to grips with the new reality of more people striking out on their own and working for themselves. In maternity, low pay, pensions and the housing market, the self-employed lose out from systems designed for a different age. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Taylor review is a crucial opportunity to help the wellbeing of the self-employed and the companies they start. Maternity support must be raised to a level closer with the employed and the design of Universal Credit changed so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no longer a threat to business start-ups. The financial system must ensure the self-employed have the same chance to buy their own homes and save for retirement as those in traditional employment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), predicts that the unemployment rate will rise from its 11-year lows next year: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The labour market remains a source of strength for the UK economy. The number of people in work remains close to historically high levels, with unemployment levels continuing to fall. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, there are signs that the UK labour market may be beginning to cool, with a small fall in employment and the continued rise in the claimant count measure. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is likely that UK unemployment will start to drift upwards in the coming months, as uncertainty over Brexit and the increasing input costs faced by businesses weigh on jobs growth. However, while we currently forecast the unemployment rate will peak at 5.5% in early 2018, this is still well below the long-term average. Dr John Philpott, Director of The Jobs Economist, is also concerned that the labour market is cooling down: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK labour market finally appears to be suffering a bout of post-Brexit vote blues which is now hitting recruitment. The number of people employed in the private sector has fallen by 17,000 and vacancies have levelled off, though an offsetting rise of 12,000 in public sector employment (mostly in education and the NHS) has limited the fall in both the overall job total and the employment rate. Despite this headline unemployment is down 16,000 on the quarter but only because the jobs slowdown is disguised by a sharp rise of 76,000 in the number of people out of work who are economically inactive. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market is cooling after a solid run: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data provides the clearest evidence yet that the jobs market has started to cool off since the Brexit vote. Total employment in the three months to October was broadly flat compared to the previous three months, having been rising strongly in the year before the EU referendum. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The official unemployment rate held steady at 4.8%, but this disguised a marked rise in economic inactivity of over 100,000 in the latest three months. The more timely but less comprehensive claimant count measure of unemployment edged up again in November for the fourth month in a row. Hawksworth adds that it will be hard for firms to hand out pay rises and take on more staff: Regular pay growth edged up to 2.6%, and is now close to 3% on average in the private sector. This is good news for workers facing the prospect of rising consumer price inflation over the next year, but could dampen future jobs growth if it continues.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Professor Geraint Johnes, director of research at Lancaster University\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Work Foundation, has dug into today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data and found that more self-employed workers are now only working part time hours. That may be a sign that some firms are suffering a drop in demand. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The number of full-time self-employed workers fell by some 55000 while those of part-time self-employed workers rose by 53000. The nature of many jobs undertaken by self-employed workers is precarious, and it is not at this stage clear to what extent the shift towards part-time work is voluntary. To the extent that it is not, there may be clouds on the horizon.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The rise in wage growth, from 2.4% to 2.6%, will unfortunately be eroded by inflation - which jumped from 0.9% to 1.2% in November. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady urges the government to help workers, particularly in the public sector. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Wages are still struggling to get off the ground with increases in pay offset by rising inflation. After the longest wage squeeze since Victorian times, this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the pay boost working people need to get their living standards back on track. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government needs to act fast to avoid another living standards crisis. That means a clear plan for Brexit that will protect jobs, pay and rights. And we need a quick end to the unfair public sector pay cap, which will see public sector workers face year-on-year cuts to real pay.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market report also suggests that Britain became a little more productive in the last quarter. We worked a combined total of 1.01 billion hours in the August to October quarter, which is five million hours fewer than in May to July. The ONS says: people worked, on average, 31.9 hours per week, down slightly compared with May to July 2016 and with a year earlier people working full-time worked, on average, 37.3 hours per week in their main job, a decrease of 0.2 hours compared with May to July 2016 and down slightly compared with a year earlier people working part-time worked, on average, 16.1 hours per week in their main job, unchanged compared with May to July 2016 but down slightly compared with a year earlier. And as the economy grew by an estimated 0.4% in August-October, that means productivity has gone up (as we took less time to do more work. Economist Rupert Seggins flags up that the claimant count has been rising for several months - a sign that the UK labour market may be weakening. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key points from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market report: For August to October 2016, there were 31.76 million people in work in Britain -- 6,000 fewer than in May to July 2016 but 342,000 more than for a year earlier. The employment rate (the proportion of people aged from 16 to 64 who were in work) had fallen to 74.4%, from the joint record high of 74.5% recorded for May to July 2016, but higher than for a year earlier (73.9%). There are 1.62 million unemployed people, 16,000 fewer than for May to July 2016 and 103,000 fewer than for a year earlier. The unemployment rate remained at 4.8%, down from 5.2% for a year earlier. It has not been lower since July to September 2005. The number of economically inactive people (not in work or seeking work) jumped by 76,000 in the last quarter to 8.91m. Average weekly earnings rose by 2.5% including bonuses and by 2.6% excluding bonuses. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good news for workers: Average weekly earnings excluding bonuses rose by 2.6% year-on-year in the three months to October, up from 2.4% last month. Pay including bonuses rose by 2.5%, up from 2.4%. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s snap take of the unemployment report: U.K. employment fell for the first time in more than a year in the three months through October as the labor market showed some signs of weakness. The number of people in work fell by 6,000 to 31.76 million people, the Office for National Statistics said on Wednesday. While the decline was small, and the jobless rate was unchanged at 4.8 percent, the statistics office said the labor market \u00e2\u20ac\u0153appears to have flattened off in recent months.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Single-month data showed that the unemployment rate rose to 4.9 percent in October from 4.6 percent in September. Unemployment also fell over the three-month period, though that was offset by an increase in the inactivity rate. Breaking: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobless rate remains at an 11-year low of 4.8% for the three months to October. That matches last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures. But the number of people in work has dropped by 6,000 to 31.762m, the first fall since the second quarter of 2015. And the number of people claiming unemployment benefit has gone up again, by 2,400 in November, to 809,000. More to follow! Italian banking shares have hit their highest level since June, having gained 1.3% this morning. Traders haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t given up hope that the sector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker banks can be recapitalised, especially after Unicredit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn cash call received a warm welcome yesterday. Italian bank shares have now jumped by a quarter since the referendum on constitutional reform, and the resignation of Matteo Renzi: Kit Juckes of Societe Generale predicts that the Federal Reserve will play a very straight bat today, when it (probably) raises US interest rates for the first time in 2016. A year ago, markets expected the Fed Funds rate to be in a 0.75-1% range by now. By this evening, they are likely to have crawled to 0.50-0.75%. If for no other reason, that should caution anyone expecting much in the way of a hawkish message from the FOMC - this is a Fed leadership group whose main feature is its dovishness. Given that the single biggest source of economic uncertainty hanging over the US economy right now is the outlook for fiscal policy -what will President Trump do? - the temptation to be very, very bland in the statement that accompanies a thoroughly-discounted rate hike at 7pm GMT, is likely to be irresistible. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no drama in the foreign exchange markets either, where the pound is sticking firmly to $1.267 against the US dollar, up just 0.1% Traders may be reluctant to take big positions ahead of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve meeting, which could spark volatility depending how hawkish or dovish Janet Yellen is. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets have opened cautiously, as investors sit tight ahead of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK unemployment report, and the Fed meeting tonight. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has dipped by 16 points, or 0.25%, and there are similar declines in France and Germany. Dixons Carphone are the biggest faller, down 3% in volatile trading, despite posting a 14% jump in profits and telling the City it had its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbiggest ever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Black Friday. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets agrees that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earnings figures are particularly important, following the rise in inflation from 0.9% to 1.2% yesterday. Inflation certainly appears to be on the way back in the UK in numbers released yesterday, which showed that CPI hit its highest levels in two years driven primarily by clothing and fuel prices, while a rise in import prices to their highest levels since 2011 was an unwelcome portend of what could be around the corner in 2017. Unemployment is expected to remain at 4.8%, while average earnings are expected to remain at 2.3%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main event is the latest UK unemployment report at 9.30am GMT, which will show whether Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market is ending the year with a bang or a whimper. The figures will be poured over for signs that the economy is weakening in the face of continued Brexit uncertainty. Economists predict that the headline jobless rate will stay low, but the number of people signing on for unemployment benefit may rise. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what the City expects: the unemployment rate will remain at an 11-year low of 4.8% in the three months to October The employment total will rise by 50,000 during the quarter. Wage growth will remain at 2.3% (but may accelerate to 2.5% if bonuses are stripped out). The claimant count will jump by 6,500 in November, following last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 9,800 rise. Yesterday we saw inflation jump to 1.2%, so if wages don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rise too people will face a real earnings squeeze in 2017. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets believe the jobless rate could rise a little, to 4.9%, but are cautious about jumping to many Brexit conclusions. Employment growth momentum is fading but it is still early days as far as capturing the referendum effect is concerned. Also coming up today. The US Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise American interest rates today, at its final FOMC meeting of the year (at 7pm GMT or 2pm EST). Fed chair Janet Yellen will then give a press conference, to discuss the state of the US economy - and probably field a few questions about politics too. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll keep an eye on Greece, where relations between Athens, the IMF and the EU are deteriorating in a familiar fashion: On the corporate front, consumer electronics group Dixons Carphone are reporting results this morning. They look decent, at first glance, with first-half profits up 19%, but the firm is also talking about uncertain times ahead. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re holding a press with journalists right now, so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have more shortly...",

                "bodyText":"The vote in the Greek parliament saw some unlikely allies back the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Christmas bonus to pensioners, with the final figure in favour 196. Our correspondent Helena Smith says: The 61 were New Democracy which effectively abstained. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Greek parliament approves pension deal With the Federal Reserve raising interest rates for the first time in a year and talking of three more increases to come next year, the dollar has strengthened and helped push banking shares higher, supporting European markets in general. Simon Gergel, chief investment officer of UK equities at Allianz told Reuters: Rising interest rates are generally quite good for banks, depending on their specific situation, but in general they are sitting on large deposit bases and they can make a bigger spread as interest rates go up. The market gains came despite a fall in commodity stocks after the greenback moved higher. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished 49.82 points or 0.72% higher at 6999.01, tantalising close to the 7000 level Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 1.08% to 11,366.40 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 1.05% at 4819.23 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB jumped 2.09% to 18,994.79 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 1.33% at 9340.8 But in Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.88% to 613.76 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently In Athens the vote on the controversial legislation has just begun as thousands of pensioners take to the streets in Athens. With the support of three political parties and the ruling two-party coalition the ballot is easily expected to secure sought support to be passed into law. That means pensioners will receive a 13th payment before Christmas. Helena Smith reports: Pensioners, representing organizations across the country, have gathered en masse in central Athens, in a protest rally now headed towards the prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office. The demonstration could not be better timed, coinciding with the vote and the spotlight the Greek PM, Alexis Tsipras, has inadvertently placed on pensioners with the announcement of his surprise pre-Christmas bonus. Holding banners decrying the loss of benefits many have suffered since the crisis began, they demanded that the cuts be reinstated. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget what we gave to the social security system, we are not going to give up what is rightly ours, we are not going to sell our dignity,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the organisations said in a statement. Pensioners, some living on as little as \u00e2\u201a\u00ac300 a month, are among those who have been hardest hit by the harsh fiscal policies debt-stricken Greece has been forced to apply in return for international rescue funds. While Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 unexpected gift has been welcomed most do not feel it goes far enough. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They have to give us back our full pensions, which represent all the years that we worked, all the contributions that we made, not make a mockery of us with crumbs and bonuses,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Dimos Koubouris, who heads the federation of pensioners. The Greek parliament is due to start voting shortly on the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to pay one-off Christmas bonuses to pensioners, the move which annoyed the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors so much they put debt relief on hold. Meanwhile Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras is at the European summit in Brussels: As markets move higher, Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Despite a woeful performance from the mining sector and falling oil prices, the FTSE 100 is ending the day firmly in positive territory. Clearly the number of stocks expected to benefit from rising US rates outpaces those who will suffer from lower commodity prices. Investors are spending their first 24 hours in a new world, one dominated by rising US interest rates plus an impending fiscal stimulus that is meant to rescue the US from economic malaise. With the euro in full flight it is not surprising to see eurozone markets racing, and this is probably something we should get used to for the year ahead. Meanwhile, the FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance will depend on whether the rising dollar does too much to torpedo the commodity rally, or whether higher rates will lift bank stocks sufficiently in the year ahead to offset this. 15 December 2016 may well prove to be a microcosm of what 2017 has to offer. Back with the US and the Dow Jones Industrial Average continues to climb following the Fed rate decision. It is now up around 154 points at 19,946 and heading towards 20,000. And Moscovici has also met the head of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opposition party New Democracy: Back with Greece and European commissioner Pierre Moscovici has tweeted: The FTSE 100 has regained the 7000 level for the first time since the end of October. Bank shares are among the leading risers after the US rate hike from the Federal Reserve, and hopes that Italian banks will be recapitalised. Earlier there were some new US economic figures, all fairly positive in the wake of the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate rise and plans for another three increases next year. The consumer price index rose 0.2%, in line with expectations, while the New York Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Empire manufacturing index came in at 9 in December, well above the consensus of 4 and the November figure of 1.5. Jobless claims fell for the second week in a row, down 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 254,000. This is the 93rd straight week that claims have been below 300,000, which is a level associated with a healthy jobs market. Meanwhile the US current account deficit fell from $118.3bn in the second quarter to $113bn in the latest three months. A jump in soybean shipments boosted exports, according to the commerce department. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now up around 120 points or 0.6%. Tsakalotos has defended Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 plans to pay out one-off benefits for low-income pensioners ahead of Christmas. A day after eurozone lenders put short-term debt relief for Greece on hold in response, he told Reuters in Berlin: I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think this is a big issue. We have bigger fish to fry. Tsakalotos also argued that Europe needed to show it could solve its own problems in order to restore confidence among working-class people after populist gains in a series of European elections, the Brexit vote and the Italian referendum. On Wall Street, the Dow has opened higher, after losing more than 100 points yesterday following the Fed rate hike. Dow Jones up 46 points, or 0.2% to 19,837.04 Nasdaq up 2.45 points at 4923.66 S&amp;P 500 up 1.96 points to 2255.24 His comments came as French President Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois Hollande jumped to Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defence of Greece after European creditors pulled a recently announced debt relief package for the country. Hollande said ahead of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s summit of EU leaders that it is out of the question to ask for further additional efforts from Greece or prevent them from taking a number of sovereign measures that respect the commitments\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that Greece previously took. Just days after a eurozone agreement to approve some debt relief, Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras surprised eurozone creditors by announcing a Christmas bonus for some 1.6 million low-income pensioners and committing to restore a lower sales tax rate for Aegean Sea islanders. Tsipras said at the summit there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s room for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a breakthrough, without blackmail.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Greek bond yields are surging, with ten-year yields hitting a one-month high of 7.61%, up 25 basis points. Short-dated yields spiked to a four-month high ahead of a parliamentary vote on a bonus to poor pensioners that threatens to derail the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt relief plans. Two-year bond yields soared more than 150bps to 8.65%, the highest since August, and five-year yields jumped 16 bps to 8.34%. The Greek finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, said the Greek government must be credible with its creditors, but also with the people of Greece. He insisted that the euro group had not taken any decision on debt relief for Greece yet, according to Reuters. Back in the markets, the euro has slipped below $1.04 for the first time in 14 years. Naeem Hamed of Think Markets blames the widening gap between monetary policy on the opposite sides of the Atlantic. The Fed over in the US is tightening their belt and the ECB is still no way close to taper its monetary policy. Traders have gone aggressive today and the divergence in monetary policies is the major focal point for them. Worth noting that the euro is doing less badly against a basket of other currencies: Newsflash: Rupert Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 21st Century Fox has formally lodged its \u00c2\u00a311.7bn bid to take full control of Sky. If the deal goes through, it will create the most powerful media group in the UK. My colleague Mark Sweney explains what happens next: Murdoch will now need to gain regulatory approval for the deal, which values Sky at more than \u00c2\u00a318bn, which will give him control of pay-TV operations in the UK, Germany and Italy; in addition to ownership of the Times, Sunday Times and Sun, and radio group TalkSport. Fox has not raised the initial \u00c2\u00a310.75 per share offer it tabled on Friday. Karen Bradley, the culture secretary, now has 10 working days to decide whether the deal raises public interest concerns, specifically relating to media plurality. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: City experts have rapidly digested today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news from the Bank of England, so here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the best early reaction: Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management, predicts that the Bank of England will leaves rates unchanged for some time: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Bank of England was not expected to change policy at this meeting, and their statement suggests that the balance of arguments favours keeping policy unchanged for the foreseeable future. They note that the forward-looking components of business surveys are weaker than those for current output levels, suggesting a slowdown in 2017. Also, with trade weighted sterling moving higher since their last meeting, this would result in a slightly lower path for inflation than they had envisaged. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The MPC will remain sensitive to any slowdown in economic activity next year, with real income growth squeezed by rising inflation and Brexit uncertainty impacting corporate investment plans. In my view, the balance of probability still favours another small rate reduction next year, and with the Fed hiking rates, this will continue to put downward pressure on sterling against the dollar.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But Nick Dixon, Investment Director at investment group Aegon, believes inflationary pressure will force interest rates up next year: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With inflation moving towards the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target quicker than expected, the only way is up for interest rates in 2017. Base rate hikes will be the tool of choice for the monetary policy committee to keep prices in check. Mortgage holders should consult their advisers now about fixing their rates before they rise\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kallum Pickering of German bank Berenberg says the Bank is keeping a close eye on inflation and wage growth: In August, by cutting the bank rate and expanding its asset purchases the BoE helped avoid a crisis immediately after the Brexit vote. The good news is that the work is over for now. The UK economy requires no further support from monetary policy. The economy has outperformed expectations since the referendum. And while growth is set to slow next year the risk of recession looks low. The BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP growth outlook of 1.4% in 2017 and 1.5% in 2018 is broadly in line with our own call of 1.5% growth in each year. The final minutes of the year indicate that the MPC is in a neutral gear for now. The committee continues to pay close attention to the Brexit-related downside risks to growth, especially the squeeze on real incomes coming from the anticipated rise in inflation from the sharp sterling depreciation. From the Bank of England, my colleague Katie Allen reports: The Bank of England has left interest rates at their record low of 0.25% but repeated a warning that higher inflation and slower wage growth risk squeezing household budgets and spending next year. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nine-strong monetary policy committee voted unanimously to keep rates on hold and maintain the current programme of electronic money printing known as quantitative easing. Policymakers had cut rates and expanded QE back in August to shore up confidence in the wake of June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote to leave the EU. In minutes to its final meeting of the year, the MPC said it would continue to trade off the effects of a weaker pound raising inflation against the prospects of economic growth and employment slowing. For now, policymakers said they saw no need to change policy as little had appeared to change since the MPC published its forecasts for the economy in November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation report. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A slowdown in growth remained likely, but there had been little news since the time of the November inflation report about domestic activity and, although the near-term global outlook had improved, this was counterbalanced by more elevated risks,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the minutes said... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Katie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full story: The pound has fallen sharply against the US dollar, as investors digest today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of England decision. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minutes show that the Bank has revised its inflation forecasts down a little, due to the recent recovery in sterling. So that means there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s less chance that interest rates might be hiked. The MPC says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Since the Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s previous meeting, sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade-weighted exchange rate has appreciated by over 6%, while dollar oil prices have risen by 14%. All else equal, this would result in a slightly lower path for inflation than envisaged in the November inflation report, though it is still likely to overshoot the target later in 2017 and through 2018.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enough to knock almost one cent off the pound today, to $1.2478. The Bank of England believes that the global economy could benefit from Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to boost government spending. The MPC says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Since November, long-term interest rates have risen internationally, including in the United Kingdom. In part, this reflects expectations of looser fiscal policy in the United States which, if it materialises, will help to underpin the slightly greater momentum in the global economy evident in a range of data since the summer.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The minutes of this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of England meeting show that the central bank sees no need to change monetary policy, as little has changed since November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation report. The monetary policy committee says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A slowdown in growth remained likely, but there had been little news since the time of the November inflation report about domestic activity and, although the near-term global outlook had improved, this was counterbalanced by more elevated risks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The minutes also highlighted a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153notable decline in consumer confidence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, repeated a forecast for unemployment to rise next year and for inflation to overtake pay growth \u00e2\u20ac\u0153marginally\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in 2017. The Bank reiterates its previous stance that is was ready to make monetary policy tighter or looser depending on how the economy evolves as the Brexit process gets underway. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Monetary policy could respond, in either direction, to changes to the economic outlook as they unfolded to ensure a sustainable return of inflation to the 2% target.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The BoE has also voted to leave its quantitative easing programme, created to stimulate the UK economy, unchanged at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. That means it will still buy and hold \u00c2\u00a3435bn of UK sovereign debt, and \u00c2\u00a310bn of corporate debt too. And all three decisions were unanimous. Breaking: The Bank of England has voted to leave UK interest rates unchanged at their current record low of 0.25%. More to follow Here we go! The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s critics claim it blundered this summer by slashing interest rates to 0.25% and restarting its quantitative easing plan. They point to the decent economic data since the Brexit vote, as evidence that the BoE over-reacted. But some City experts believe things would be rather worse if the BoE hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t moved swiftly. Ralf Preusser, global head of rates research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, told Bloomberg TV this morning that the Bank had provided valuable leadership immediately after the EU referendum. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153incredibly reactive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd approach, and the unexpectedly rapid leadership race to succeed David Cameron, protected the economy. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why the confidence shock which had been expected \u00e2\u20ac\u0153did not materialise\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Preusser, adding that he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t criticised the Bank for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcjumping the gun\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as some do. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for our regular update from Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 source in the Italian government: Note the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcif necessary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 -- Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government is still hoping to persuade private investors to provide funds to recapitalise lenders such as Monte dei Paschi. Just 25 minutes to go until the Bank of England announces its interest rate decision. With everyone expecting No Change, the real news will probably be in the minutes of this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says there are three things to watch out for: Inflation: price pressure is building, could the larger than forecast increase in prices in November worry the Bank, especially if this pace of increase continues? Any clarification on just how tolerant the Bank will be of an inflation over-shoot. Could the Bank balance any hawkish concern about inflation, with concern about the impact of Brexit and the triggering of Article 50. OUCH! The euro just slumped to a new near 14-year low against the rampant US dollar. Speaking of Greece, European commissioner Pierre Moscovici has hit back at the International Monetary Fund over its warning that Athens hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tackled its tax and pension problems. Writing in the Financial Times, Moscovici said Greece had made \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unprecedented efforts\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd including \u00e2\u20ac\u0153major reforms of the pension, personal income tax and VAT systems\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Is the commission being too lenient on Greece in contrast with an ostensibly more realistic IMF position? Of course not! While it has worked tirelessly to help Greece build a sustainable recovery, it has also pressed the authorities there to respect their commitments. The commission has been an honest broker, representing the interests of the eurozone as a whole. The next step is to conclude the second programme review, which hinges on an agreement to bring the IMF on board. This cannot happen as long as positions are defined by dogma or short-term political tactics with no regard for the social effect of the measures proposed. More here: Greece cannot be condemned to austerity for ever No response from the IMF, yet anyway. But former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis decided to attack Moscovici on Twitter, earning a rebuke from the commissioner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press officer. All terribly edifying. Over in Greece, prime minister Alexis Tsipras seems to have found support from the majority of political parties who will be backing his drive to hand out pre-Christmas fiscal gifts in a roll-call vote later today. MPs are being urged to back Tsipras, even though the giveaways have alarmed Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors - prompting them to freeze short-term debt relief plans yesterday. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports. Passions are flaring ahead of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote with senior cadres in the Syriza party calling it one of the most crucial ballots since the leftists assumed power. Addressing the 300-member House this morning, the Interior Minister Panos Skourletis emphasised the significance of the moment. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is not a chance moment but a moment where parliament should affirm the right of the government of the country to do the self-evident. The agreement [with lenders] foresees it and the numbers prove it. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand why we should wait. Citizens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 needs, pensioners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 needs have a priority over the needs of Brussels.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ahead of the ballot political parties, including the far right Golden Dawn, are signalling they will endorse the embattled prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spending spree. The KKE communist party and social democrat Pasok party also said they would support Alexis Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 decision to, in effect, grant retirees a 13th pension in the form of a pre-Christmas bonus. The main opposition centre right New Democracy party said it would not support the legislation and instead vote \u00e2\u20ac\u0153present.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Speaking in Brussels, its leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis declared that the leftist-led administration was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gambling\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with the debt-stricken country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future. Tsipras, he said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153has once more proved himself to be immoral and dangerous.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Greek journalist Eleni Varvitsiotis has heard that creditors are about to go public with their concerns: Gold has hit its lowest level since February this morning, down 1% to just $1.134 per ounce. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly because the US dollar has rallied (so you need fewer dollars to buy the same amount of gold). But gold is also less attractive in an environment of higher inflation and interest rates, as it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yield anything. Shares in two precious metals producers, Randgold and Fresnillo (the silver producer) are leading the fallers on the stock market: JD Sports has become the latest retailer to face serious criticism over working practices, a year after its rival Sports Direct found itself in very hot water for paying staff less than the legal minimum. An investigation by Channel 4 found evidence of staff at its Rochdale warehouse being badly treated, including a \u00e2\u20ac\u01533 strikes and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re sacked\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 policy, staff being threatened with dismissal for sitting down, and airport-style security checks and random searches. Shares in JD Sports fell 7% yesterday as the news broke. And today, the company told the City it was opening an investigation. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady says politicians need to do more to protect workers: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These are degrading conditions to work in. The practices exposed at JD Sports show just how little value some companies attach to their staff. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153JD Sports\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 initial response \u00e2\u20ac\u201c denying the problems \u00e2\u20ac\u201c doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t instil confidence. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increasingly clear that Sports Direct wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just one bad apple, and that terrible working practices are taking place across the UK. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government needs to look seriously at how this sort of behaviour continues to take place in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Britain. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unions in workplaces can stamp out this sort of abuse. I would encourage anyone working in a warehouse like this to join a union and ensure that management cannot ignore their voice.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd French fund manager Etienne de Marsac has tweeted a handy graph, showing how UK and US government borrowing costs have jumped, thanks to the Fed (as flagged earlier). Newsflash: UK retail sales are still growing , despite the ongoing uncertainty around Brexit. Retail sales volumes grew by 0.2% in November, and were 5.9% higher than a year earlier. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down from 1.8% monthly growth in October. Non-food sales were particularly strong; perhaps due to shoppers snapping up offers on Black Friday. But there are also signs that the recent rises in petrol prices have forced some drivers to cut back. The Office for National Statistics says: In the latest month growth continues to be driven by a broad increase in all 4 categories, with all but petrol making significant contributions in November. Petrol provided its lowest contribution to growth since November 2014, which could reflect rising petrol prices. The highest contribution to growth was non-food stores, contributing 2.1 percentage points to growth. This large increase in non-food volumes could be a result of consumers taking advantage of Black Friday deals on a number of non-food products. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some economist reaction: Boom! Output across the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories has hit a 32-month high in December, according to the latest healthcheck from data firm Markit. But firms also report that the cost of raw materials has jumped -- factory input prices are rising at their faster rate since May 2011. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overall eurozone PMI was unchanged at 53.9, which shows steady growth, as the jump in manufacturing output was balanced by a small slowdown in services. European stock markets are taking the Fed rate hike in their stride this morning - not surprising, really, as it was widely expected. The German DAX and the French CAC have risen by around 0.4%, reflecting the drop in the euro vs the US dollar (good news for exporters). And Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has dipped by 9 points, or 0.15%. Financial shares are rallying, with Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays both up 2.3% Eric Lonergan, macro fund manager at M&amp;G, says the market reaction has been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153logical\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The dollar has rallied, the yield curve has flattened and the equity of the large US money centre banks, which profit most from a rising Fed funds, are out-performing a weak stock market. He argues that banks should benefit from higher interest rates: Banks may well ease lending conditions in response to higher margins, and if corporate optimism feeds through to a tighter labour market and wage increases, final demand may prove as immune to higher interest rates as it did to ever lower global policy rates in recent years Bad news from Wigan -- 100 jobs have been lost as a biscuit maker at the Northern town\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goes into administration. Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mark Kleinman has the story: The maker of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPink Panther\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 wafers sold in British supermarkets will be the latest food producer to blame a Brexit crunch when it announces on Thursday that it has fallen into administration. Sky News understands that the owner of Rivington Biscuits\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which is based in Wigan, Lancashire, will blame the post-EU referendum slump in the value of sterling for drivng up input costs in recent months. Almost 100 of the 125-strong workforce are understood to have been made redundant on Wednesday, less than a fortnight before Christmas. Newsflash from a chilly Bern: The Swiss central bank has left interest rates unchanged at their current record low of minus 0.75%. The SNB says the global economy has continued to recover, but threats remain -- including Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: In the UK, the economic impact of the Brexit decision has so far proved less pronounced than originally feared. The SNB expects the moderate pace of global growth to continue in 2017. The baseline scenario for the world economy is still subject to considerable risks, however. Structural problems in a number of advanced economies could negatively affect the outlook. Added to this are a multitude of political uncertainties which are particularly associated with the future course of economic policy in the US, upcoming elections in several countries in the euro area as well as the complex and arduous exit negotiations between the UK and the EU. Government bonds are being pummelled in early trading - as they suffer from the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisions. With prices sliding, the interest rate on UK 10-year gilts has jumped to 1.52%, up from 1.38% yesterday. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the highest yield since May, before the Brexit vote. Other government bonds are also being hit - the yield on 10-year US Treasuries (America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt) has jumped to 2.61%, from 2.51%. French, Italian and Spanish bonds are also weakening in value (prices fall when yields rise), as traders pull money out of bonds. With the Fed predicting faster rate hikes next year, investors are demanding a higher rate of return for holding government bonds. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services says: As was perhaps to be expected, markets took some umbrage at the dot plot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s implication of one additional rate hike in 2017. Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Jamie McGeever shows how the US dollar has strengthened sharply over the last two years: The dollar rally has hit shares across emerging markets this morning. Traders are bracing for a surge of capital out of developing countries and back into US assets, to benefit from higher interest rates. So that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s driven most Asian markets into the red: The US dollar has surged to a 14-year high against other currencies this morning, after the Federal Reserve raised American interest rates last night. In volatile trading, the dollar index (the broad measure of the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strength) hit its highest level since 2003. It hit a record high against the Turkish lira, an eight year high against the Chinese yuan, and a 20-month high against the euro (which has slid back to $1.0478). The surge came after the Fed predicted it would raise interest rates three times in 2017, up from the two hikes predicted in September. And with Donald Trump promising huge spending on infrastructure once he becomes president, investors are concluding that the Fed may have to tighten monetary policy faster than expected to rein in inflation. Stephen Innes, senior trader at Oanda in Singapore, said in a note that Fed chair Yellen has surprised the markets by not talking a softer tone. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is flat out hawkish, and the US dollar is reacting accordingly,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I thought we would be calling the Yellen bluff this morning, as the market had expected at most a subtle shift in Fed language. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forward guidance is in reaction to Trumpflation as Dr Yellen did little to quell the markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pent up the view that both growth and inflation will accelerate in 2017.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: However..... there are reasons to be cautious. The Fed may be expecting three rate hikes in 2017, but that certainly doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean it will definitely happen. Philip Shaw of Investec points out that policymakers had expected four rate hikes this year - and only delivered one, last night. (each dot shows where one Fed policymaker expects US interest rates to be) Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Get out the tinsel and put on the party hats, because Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final central bank meeting of the year is upon us. At noon UK time, the Bank of England will announce its decision on monetary policy, as it continues its balancing act since the Brexit vote. The City expect the BoE to leave interest rates on hold today, at their current record low of 0.25%. But will it maintain its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcneutral bias\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 - meaning the next move in rates could be up or down? And will any policymakers split from the pack, or will it be a 9-nil vote? The Bank has a lot to think about right now, with inflation jumping to 1.2% in November as the weak pound drives import prices up. Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour force data is also a concern, with employment falling for the first time since the EU referendum. So governor Mark Carney and colleagues need to tread cautiously, especially with Britain facing a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclost decade\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: Also coming up today.... The Swiss and Norwegian central banks are also announcing their decisions on monetary policy this morning. On the economic front, we get new \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflash\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 estimates of the eurozone manufacturing and service sectors from Markit at 9am, plus US inflation and manufacturing reports this afternoon. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also keep tracking Greece, where relations between Athens, European officials and the International Monetary Fund are becoming more strained by the day. As we covered yesterday, Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout fund froze plans for Greek debt relief after prime minister Alexis Tsipras announced new help for poorer pensioners. Tsipras won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be cowed, though. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s asking parliament to vote on giving 1.6 million pensioners a Christmas bonus of between \u00e2\u201a\u00ac300 and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac800, and whether to suspend a planned increase in sales tax for Aegean islands which have been hit by the migrant crisis. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day.....",

Still, a good performance from the Russell 2000 this afternoon bodes well for the week ahead. Santa definitely arrived early this year, but perhaps we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get another rally next week. The FTSE seems happy enough to move above 7000, and it is entirely plausible that the index will touch new all-time highs before everyone sets off for Christmas. It will just require a little sprinkling of festive spirit, and hopefully a good performance from miners, which have been a little under pressure since the Fed announced its plan to raise rates three times next year.</p> <p>The coming week is not exactly busy, as might be expected, but one area of interest will be the Bank of Japan. The yen has taken a hammering since the election, which has done wonders for the Japanese stock market, but we should not rule out a statement that gives the currency a breathing space.

                "bodyText":"American drillers added oil rigs for the seventh week in a row last week. The Baker Hughes rig survey showed 12 oil rigs and one gas were added, as the crude price recovery encouraged further drilling activity. Oil rigs have been added in 26 of the past 29 weeks. So far the rig news has had little impact on the oil price, with Brent crude still up around 1.7% at $54.95 a barrel. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back on Monday. Despite US markets coming off their best levels - perhaps following a report China seized an underwater US drone in the South China Sea - European shares have ended the week on a fairly positive note. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 12.63 points or 0.18% to 7011.64, the first time it has closed above 7000 since 25 October Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.33% to 11,404.01 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac climbed 0.29% to 4833.27 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB edged up 0.11% to 19,014.75 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.77% to 9412.8 In Greece, the Athens market added 4.22% to 639.64 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 27 points at 19879 having earlier reached 19,923. Meanwhile the pound is up 0.46% to $1.2471 but is still trading close to a three week low after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday and thus boosted the US currency. More on S&amp;P maintaining its Triple A rating on Germany. The agency said: We think Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highly diversified and competitive economy will continue to sustain its current growth momentum, backed by strong domestic demand and resilient exports against an increasingly challenging international backdrop. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surpluses on its external and fiscal balance sheet will enable the country to weather external shocks, while ultralow interest rates and strong tax revenue growth continue to benefit its public-sector balance sheet. We are affirming our \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAAA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 long-term and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcA-1+\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 short-term sovereign credit ratings on Germany. The stable outlook reflects our view that over the next two years Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances and strong external balance sheet will continue to withstand potential financial and economic shocks. Markets remain in positive territory, although they are off their best levels. But the recent rally could continue next week, analysts believe. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: The week ends with gains across the board, although the Dow Jones remains tantalisingly short of the 20,000 target. Still, a good performance from the Russell 2000 this afternoon bodes well for the week ahead. Santa definitely arrived early this year, but perhaps we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get another rally next week. The FTSE seems happy enough to move above 7000, and it is entirely plausible that the index will touch new all-time highs before everyone sets off for Christmas. It will just require a little sprinkling of festive spirit, and hopefully a good performance from miners, which have been a little under pressure since the Fed announced its plan to raise rates three times next year. The coming week is not exactly busy, as might be expected, but one area of interest will be the Bank of Japan. The yen has taken a hammering since the election, which has done wonders for the Japanese stock market, but we should not rule out a statement that gives the currency a breathing space. Everyone seems to be long the US dollar, so it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take much of a change to spark some interesting moves in the week ahead. Oil is moving higher on hopes that producers will stick to their deal to cut output. Ahead of the latest Baker Hughes survey of US rigs, Brent crude has climbed 1.7% to $54.94 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate is up 1.57% to $51.70 as Russia said all of its oil companies had agreed to reduce output. Back with Greece, and ahead of the Merkel-Tsipras meeting, the German finance ministry has said an assessment report on Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 surprise relief package is not going to make for rosy reading, reports Helena Smith: Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 lender institutions have assembled a report into whether the Greek prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unilateral measures violate his country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout obligations and while preliminary \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it is quite critical,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a German finance ministry announced today.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, currently up 42 points at 19,894, is close to breaching the 20,000 barrier for the first time. Meanwhile the S&amp;P 500 has opened up 0.2% while the Nasdaq Composite is 0.26% higher. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The big question on most people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lips at the moment is whether the Dow can manage to nibble away at the 20,000 level that it has been flirting with this week. Thus far it has fallen short and the likelihood is that the opportunity to do it this week has passed. Even if we fall short we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve still seen a decent week for US equities, trading as they continue to do at record levels. The big question is how a strong US dollar and a strong US equity market can co-exist at a time when all we have had at the moment is promises of fiscal action, and higher rates. Since the 8th November the Dow has rallied 9%, the S&amp;P 00 over 6% and the Russell 2000 has gained over 14%; how much of market expectations of what President elect Trump can deliver are now priced in? The typical UK household spends more than \u00c2\u00a32,000 a month, but in December - in the run-up to Christmas - it spends an extra \u00c2\u00a3500, according to the Bank of England. And the biggest increase is not, as you might expect, on alcohol but on books, the Bank says. And over the past three years, the value of online shopping has doubled, and now accounts for \u00c2\u00a31 in every \u00c2\u00a38 spent. US housing starts fell by more than expected in November, falling from a nine year high. They dropped 18.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.09m units, below expectations of a figure of 1.23m. October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s number was revised up from 1.32m to 1.34m, the highest since July 2007. More on Greece, and some comments from Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras and German chancellor Angela Merkel ahead of their talks. Tsipras has said he would tell the chancellor about the positive momentum in the Greek economy and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153spectacular overachievement of revenue targets.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Meanwhile, another possible hurdle for Greece to overcome: European markets are at 11-month highs, partly on the back of a weaker euro and expectations for stronger growth in the US next year. Reuters quotes Markus Huber, trader at City of London Markets: Stocks are continuing to get a boost from a weaker euro and the notion that the United States, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy, will experience an uptick in growth once President-elect Donald Trump has started implementing his new policies. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main markets are up across the board: FTSE 100: +0.3% at 7,019 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.6% at 11,437 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +0.6% at 4,850 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: +0.4% at 19,064 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: +0.4% at 9,377 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: +0.3% at 360 Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has appealed for an end to the standoff between the government and the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors. If follows the decision by prime minister Alexis Tsipras to award low income pensioners with a pre-Christmas bonus - a move which angered Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s international lenders. The Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Helena Smith reports from Athens: Hours after the Greek parliament approved Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 package of relief measures, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has stepped in, urging an end to the dispute and appealing for differences to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153worked out at the negotiations table in a genuine spirit of co-operation with the institutions and our partners.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Predicting the economy will expand by 2.5% next year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a jump from just 0.1 % this year - the Bank of Greece called for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pragmatism and flexibility\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in its interim monetary policy report released today. This emerging positive momentum in the economy needs to be supported and consolidated through adherence to the programme targets and an accelerated implementation of the reforms and privatisations agreed on. Specifically, the Bank of Greece expects GDP to grow by a marginal 0.1% in 2016, before picking up to 2.5 % in 2017 and further to 3% in 2018 and 2019, supported by investment, consumption and exports. But an ongoing review of the debt-stricken country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditor-mandated reforms would have to be wrapped up quickly, the bank said, so that Greece could take the next step towards inclusion in the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s QE bond-buying programme. There is not much time left, in the light of upcoming national elections in a number of euro area countries. Progress, it added, would be easier if lenders also agreed to lower expectations of Athens achieving a primary budget surplus of 3.5 % by 2018. Tsipras is expected to raise this issue \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the decision by the euro zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout agency, or ESM, to put short-term debt relief measures for Athens on hold - when he holds talks with German chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin this evening. Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics, says the CBI surveys suggests the weaker official manufacturing data for October will prove to be a blip. [It] suggests that the 1% monthly fall in manufacturing output in October, as revealed by the ONS figures earlier this month, was just a temporary blip. Accordingly, we continue to think that GDP growth will become better balanced over the coming quarters. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Markit, says 2017 could be a tougher year for manufacturers. Despite the decent December CBI industrial trends survey, there are significant potential problems for the manufacturing sector that look likely to build up in 2017. In particular, business confidence is likely to be hampered by mounting uncertainty over the Brexit process, constraining investment plans and limiting demand for capital goods. It also looks inevitable that consumers will become markedly less able (due to diminishing purchasing power) and likely more reluctant to buy big ticket consumer durable items over the coming months. While output and orders were up, the CBI survey also suggested the sharp fall in the drop of the pound since the Brexit vote is starting to push up manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 costs. A weaker pound makes imports from abroad more expensive, and the CBI said factory gate inflation is heading higher as manufacturers pass on to customers some of the price increases they are facing. Expectations for output price inflation - the prices charged by manufacturers for their goods - in the three months to March rose to their highest level since June 2011. Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, says: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good to see our manufacturers ending the year on a high note with growth in production the strongest since summer 2014 and total orders still robust. But the weakness of sterling is pushing up the cost of imports, and our survey shows strong signs of this feeding through to higher factory gate prices. After a challenging 2016, UK manufacturers will want to build on the positive momentum going into the new year, with the Government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent commitments on a modern industrial strategy and innovation investment a welcome tonic.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial trends survey paints a better than expected picture of the UK manufacturing sector in December. The orders balance was 0, as 21% of businesses reported orders were above normal and 21% said they were below. That was better than the -5% predicted by economists, and the highest level in 20 months. Growth in output was the strongest since mid-2014, the business lobby groups said. Production fell in just four out of 18 sectors. Teva Group, parent company of Actavis, has responded to criticism from the competition watchdog over steep price hikes. The Competition and Markets Authority says the UK-based Actavis company increased the price of life-saving hydrocortisone tablets by over 12,000% (full story here). Teva responds: Generic medicines continue to be an affordable alternative to branded therapies. Teva is proud of our track record in bringing cost savings to the NHS as the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest generic medicines manufacturer. Competition from generic medicines saves the NHS in England and Wales \u00c2\u00a313.5bn per year overall, and Teva medicines account for approximately \u00c2\u00a33.2bn of this saving. Although the pricing of the acquired Actavis product (Hydrocortisone) under investigation was never under Teva\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s effective control, Teva believes that intervention by the CMA in prices for generic medicines raises serious policy concerns regarding the roles of both the CMA and the Department of Health. The annual rate of inflation climbed to a 31-month high of 0.6% in November from 0.5% in October, the Eurostat statistics office has confirmed. The biggest drivers of the rise came from restaurants and cafes, rents and tobacco, while the price of gas, heating oil and package holidays fell and held the inflation rate back. Olivier Vigna, economist at HSBC, said the French Insee survey was the latest indication that growth in the fourth quarter will pick-up to 0.4% from 0.2% in the third. Recent surveys on France largely confirm the rebound in the economic activity we expect for Q4 and other forward-looking indicators also point to a higher momentum. Of course, it would be naive to read too much into the positive signals coming from surveys as they are not always reflected in hard data. Nevertheless, the upwards trend witnessed in surveys bodes well for the increase we anticipate for GDP over the last quarter of 2016: we forecast +0.4% q-o-q after two consecutive weak quarters (-0.1% in Q2, then +0.2% in Q3). So although it is too early to have a comprehensive view on the full set of Q4 data, such an encouraging move, if durable and converted into better hard data, would also be positive for the entry into 2017. Over in France, firms were feeling more confident than expected in December according to the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (Insee). The headline index rose to 105 from 102. It was the highest level since the summer of 2011. Confidence grew among manufacturing, services and retail firms, but dipped in construction. Insee: After being almost stable since August 2015, equal or slightly above its long term average (100), the climate has improved markedly in December 2016. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy will be stronger than expected in the fourth quarter according to the Munich-based Ifo Institute. Positive growth momentum in Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy will be carried into 2017, it added. As Ifo issued updated forecasts, the institute\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president Clemens Fuest, commented: All signs point to a fourth quarter that is stronger than had been expected until now. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll take this impetus into the new year. Ifo left its forecast for growth in 2016 unchanged at 1.9%, which would be the strongest in five years. It nudged up forecasts for both 2017 and 2018 by 0.1% percentage points to 1.5% and 1.7% respectively. Fuest: The change of growth pace from 2016 to 2017 is only due to a lower number of workdays. For context, here are the International Monetary Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth predictions for the G7 in 2017 : US: 2.2% Germany: 1.4% France: 1.3% Italy: 0.9% Japan: 0.6% UK: 1.1% Canada: 1.9% The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Actavis is the latest pharmaceutical company to come under criticism from the competition regulator over sharply hiking the price of tablets. Specifically, the Competition and Markets Authority says Actavis increased the price of life-saving hydrocortisone tablets by over 12,000%. It pushed up the annual cost to the NHS from \u00c2\u00a3522,000 before to 2008 to \u00c2\u00a370m by 2015. The tablets are used by people whose adrenal glands do not produce enough steroid hormones, such as those suffering from Addison\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disease. At the this stage, the CMA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s findings are provisional and no fine has been issued. It follows the watchdog\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision last week to impose a record \u00c2\u00a384.2m fine on Pfizer, after the price charged to the NHS for an anti-epilepsy drug was increased by up to 2,600%. Read our full story on Actavis here: The FTSE 100 is up five points in early trading. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a modest gain but takes the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading index of shares back above the 7,000 mark at 7,002. Following the excitement of the Fed rate rise and Bank of England policy meeting earlier in the week, markets across Europe are fairly steady. FTSE 100: +0.1% at 7,004 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.02% at 11,368 French CAC: -0.1% at 4,815 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: +0.2% at 19,033 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.2% at 9,319 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: +0.03% at 359 Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Close attention will be paid to the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s December industrial trends survey at 11am today as it will provide a timely health check on the UK economy as 2016 draws to a close. Business surveys capture a more recent picture of economic activity than official data, but rely on a smaller sample size and tend to be more anecdotal. That said, economists and policymakers look to surveys for clues of where the official data might be heading. The CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing survey is expected to show a balance of -5% of firms reported a rise in orders in December, worse than November when it was -3%. One of the issues in recent weeks however is that the official data has painted a weaker picture of the economy than business surveys. Adam Cole, currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets, says: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CBI manufacturing survey is worth watching in the light of the very weak October manufacturing output data which marked a poor start to the monthly indicators that will add up to Q4 GDP. The CBI survey has been less volatile than the manufacturing PMI recently and the consensus for the orders balance (-5) would be consistent with manufacturing out trending no better than flat. We will bring you the numbers and reaction as it comes in, as well as tracking all the main events through the day.",

Helena Smith reports:</p> <blockquote> <p>Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest standoff with creditors has sparked widespread conjecture that early elections are not far off. Lenders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 demands for additional austerity beyond 2018, when the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current bailout programme ends, has put Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 leftist-led government increasingly on the defensive. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 surprise announcement of fiscal support for vulnerable groups appears only to have toughened the hard line approach with the European Stability Mechanism, the euro zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financing arm abruptly freezing short-term debt relief measures last week.</p> <p>Senior cadres in the ruling Syriza party say they are now being told that unless \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4.5 bn worth of extra measures in the form of pension and tax reforms are legislated, a crucial second review of the economy will be delayed. That could once again raise the spectre of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ejection from the eurozone. Earlier today the credit ratings agency, Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, said it would increase the risk of Greece defaulting on bond payments in July. </p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are being blackmailed,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said one. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have accepted reforms that ideologically have been very difficult to swallow. Asking us to vote through more is democratically unacceptable.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd </p> <p>With the two-party government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wafer thin majority of 153 in the 300-seat house it was far from sure that further belt-tightening could be endorsed.

The Ifo index increased to 110.0 in December, from 110.4 in November. The increase was mainly driven by a better current assessment component (116.6, from 115.6). The expectations component remained almost unchanged. The December increase suggests that German businesses are not (yet) afraid of negative economic implications from the new president in the US.</p> <p>Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ifo was the last important macro indicator for the German economy this year. As always, the upcoming Christmas break is a good occasion for a reflective moment. A look at the German economy through the rear mirror. A look which shows an impressive, though slightly slowing growth performance. The German economy has continued its recovery and defied many external risks and turmoil, like Chinese stock market turbulences and economic slowdown, low oil prices, Brexit and continued weakness in many Eurozone countries. The key for economic success has been domestic demand. Strong domestic demand on the back of a strong labour market, low inflation, low interest rates and higher wages, partly fueled by the ECB and refugees.</p> <p>Unfortunately, as with so many good things, the current positive growth cycle is also coming to an end. Gradually, not abruptly. Looking into 2017, the upside for the German economy is that the main growth drivers of 2016 should still be the main growth drivers of 2017, only weaker. Construction, the best-performing sector currently, should continue to benefit from low interest rates and excess demand for housing in urban areas. Consumption should continue to thrive on the back of the strong labour market, higher real wages and low interest rates. Finally, government consumption should remain high as the influx of refugees requires continued expenditure. However, these three drivers are unlikely to gain momentum as interest rates are unlikely to drop further, inflation is gradually moving upwards and the labour market has reached its natural rate of unemployment.</p> <p>Real risks to the German outlook mainly seem to stem from the outside. The still unknown impact from president-elect Trump on trade and economic policies, the ongoing Brexit uncertainty and renewed political tensions in Europe due to several elections or a new flaring up of the Greek crisis are in our view the biggest risks for 2017. On top of everything, national elections in Germany do not pose a risk in itself but should clearly absorb time that could be used to implement new reforms and investments.</p> <p>All in all, it very much looks as if 2017 could be the slimmed down version of 2016. The growth ingredients should remain the same but it will be a bit less of everything. A good recipe to lose some weight after the holidays but not the best recipe for more economic growth.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5857a9a5e4b0525ea8569da1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-19T09:42:03.404Z\">9.42am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.cesifo-group.de/ifoHome/facts/Survey-Results/Business-Climate/Geschaeftsklima-Archiv/2016/Geschaeftsklima-20161219.html\">The German economy is in a festive mood</a></strong>, according to Clemens Fuest the president of the IFO institute. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The German economy is making a strong finish to the year.</p> <p>In the manufacturing sector, the index rose. Assessments of both the current business situation and expectations improved. Demand picked up significantly and the order back log grew. More companies plan to ramp up production in the months ahead as a result. </p> <p>In wholesaling, the business climate index rose to its highest level in almost three years. This was primarily due to more favourable assessments of the business situation. Wholesalers, however, scaled back their optimistic expectations slightly. In retailing the index remained unchanged at a high level. While retailers assessed their current business situation slightly less favourably, their business expectations improved. Electrical goods retailers reported brisk Christmas business. </p> <p>The construction sector continues to break records. Since Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reunification business has never been better for contractors. Improved business expectations indicate that the boom will continue in the months ahead.</p> </blockquote> <p>But it was not so joyous in the service sector:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the service sector the mood deteriorated in the run-up to Christmas. The indicator fell to 31.7 balance points in December from 35.0 balance points in November. Service providers assessed their current business situation less favourably. They also scaled back their business expectations slightly. Both indices, however, are significantly above their long-term average.

                "bodyText":"Over in Greece the government is once again denying any suggestion that elections are on the horizon despite mounting speculation that a national ballot may soon be inevitable. Helena Smith reports: Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest standoff with creditors has sparked widespread conjecture that early elections are not far off. Lenders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 demands for additional austerity beyond 2018, when the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current bailout programme ends, has put Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 leftist-led government increasingly on the defensive. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 surprise announcement of fiscal support for vulnerable groups appears only to have toughened the hard line approach with the European Stability Mechanism, the euro zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financing arm abruptly freezing short-term debt relief measures last week. Senior cadres in the ruling Syriza party say they are now being told that unless \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4.5 bn worth of extra measures in the form of pension and tax reforms are legislated, a crucial second review of the economy will be delayed. That could once again raise the spectre of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ejection from the eurozone. Earlier today the credit ratings agency, Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, said it would increase the risk of Greece defaulting on bond payments in July. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are being blackmailed,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said one. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have accepted reforms that ideologically have been very difficult to swallow. Asking us to vote through more is democratically unacceptable.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd With the two-party government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wafer thin majority of 153 in the 300-seat house it was far from sure that further belt-tightening could be endorsed. Approval ratings of Syriza and Tsipras have plummeted precipitously on the back of fury over unpopular reforms. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Early elections are not part of our plans,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In 2018 Greece will exit the memoranda and [international] supervision,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said referring to the latest bailout programme. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Even if the review is delayed we will not have elections. The country does not need elections.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. The US economy continues to perform reasonably despite signs of a slowdown between November and December. The initial Markit services purchasing managers index for December came in at 53.4, down from a final figure of 54.6 in November. The composite index came in at 53.5 in December compared to 54.9 the previous month. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our report on the Christine Lagarde guilty verdict. Kim Willsher reports: Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, has been found guilty of negligence in approving a massive payout of taxpayers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 money to controversial French businessman Bernard Tapie, but avoided a jail sentence. A French court convicted the former government minister, who had faced a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15,000 fine and up to a year in jail, but decided she should not be punished and that the conviction would not constitute a criminal record. The verdict came as a surprise as even the public prosecutor had admitted the evidence against Lagarde was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153weak\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd during a five day trial last week. Jean-Claude Marin told the court Lagarde\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions fell into the category of politics and not criminality and called for her to be acquitted. Lagarde, who has always argued she did nothing wrong and acted \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in the public interest\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, was not present for the judgment. Her lawyer Patrick Maisonneuve said she had flown back to Washington DC, where the IMF is based. Lagarde had appeared before the Cour de Justice de la R\u00c3\u00a9publique, a special tribunal set up to judge ministers and public officials for alleged crimes committed while in office. It is made up of three judges and 12 politicians from the French houses of parliament. It was only the fifth time the court had sat and its judgements cannot be appealed against. The full story is here: The prospect of 20,000 on the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged a little closer after it moved higher at the start of trading. The index is currently up 36 points at 19,880, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are both marginally higher. Elsewhere: Reports that the German bank would have to pay that much spooked investors back in September. The IMF board is meeting shortly to discuss the Christine Lagarde situation. Gerry Rice, the fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s director of communications, said: The Executive Board has met on previous occasions to consider developments related to the legal proceedings in France. It is expected that the Board will meet again shortly to consider the most recent developments. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AP on the Lagarde news: A special French court has declared International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde guilty of criminal negligence in a long-running arbitration case. But the court decided not to punish her or give her a criminal record. The Court of Justice of the Republic ruled that her negligence while servicing as finance minister allowed for the misappropriation of funds by other people. The others, in a separate case, haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet been tried. International Monetary Fund managing director Christine Lagarde has been convicted on one count of negligence by a French court, Bloomberg is reporting. Lagarde was accused of failing to prevent a government payout to businessman Bernard Tapie when she was French finance minister eight years ago. Uh oh. There could be a spanner in the works of the Monte dei Paschi fundraising. Reuters reports: Italian bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena is trying to resolve differences with a key investor over its 5 billion euro ($5.2 billion) rescue plan to allow the deal to go ahead and avoid a state bailout. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third-largest bank has until the end of December to raise capital and offload 28 billion euros in gross bad loans as requested by European Central Bank supervisors. Monte dei Paschi has failed to find buyers for its shares so far. On Monday, it shook the market again with a warning that Italian bank industry bailout fund Atlante was rethinking its 1.5 billion euro purchase of bad loans from the lender. Atlante had expressed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deep reservations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in a Dec. 17 letter over the terms of a bridge loan that Monte dei Paschi had secured as part of the sale of bad loans, the bank said. Monte dei Paschi shares extended losses on the news, erasing a week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains to trade down 7.7 percent at 19.3 euros each. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If issues raised by (Atlante\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manager) Quaestio cannot be solved, the operation could not be concluded by Dec. 31, 2016 as requested by the European Central Bank,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the bank said in a statement. However, Carlo Messina, chief executive of Intesa Sanpaolo, one of Atlante\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top contributors, said he believed the investment fund should go ahead with the deal and that it would reach a decision by Tuesday at the latest. Italy is ready to bail out Monte dei Paschi, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest bank,to prevent it being wound down and destabilising the euro zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fourth-largest banking sector. Time for an update on the markets, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an uncertain pattern. Most European markets are still marginally lower, although off their worst levels, while Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB is up 0.3% despite the fall in Monte dei Paschi as the bank starts its \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn refinancing. The FTSE 100 has also edged higher - just - up 0.09%. But France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac is 0.26% lower, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has dipped 0.03% and Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex is down 0.66% Meanwhile with the strength of the dollar continuing in the wake of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate rise from the US Federal Reserve, the pound fell around 1% to its lowest level for a month, although it has recovered a little ground and is now down 0.75% at \u00c2\u00a31.2394. Against the euro, sterling is down 0.5% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.1882. Tomorrow could see more developments in the row between Greek and its lenders over the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to pay pensioners a Christmas bonus, something which was not approved by the lenders. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kathimerini reports: The Euro Working Group (EWG) is to meet Tuesday to discuss the impact on the Greek program of the SYRIZA-led government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to grant a one-off supplement to pensioners. The European Stability Mechanism reacted to the measure by suspending for the time being the implementation of the short-term debt relief measures that were only rubber stamped by eurozone finance ministers on December 5. EWG is expected to discuss a report by representatives of the institutions on the actual cost of the handout. The report was requested by German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble. Clemens Fuest, the president of Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IFO institute, has told Bloomberg that current interest rates may be too low for the eurozone. He presumably then welcomes signs of inflationary pressures in the latest wages data. The International Monetary Fund is positive about the actions taken by Ukraine over its biggest lender, PrivatBank. IMF managing director Christine Lagarde, who also has other things on her mind at the moment, said: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision of Ukrainian authorities to nationalize PrivatBank is an important step in their efforts to safeguard financial stability. This decision was taken to ensure the smooth operations of the bank given its systemic role in Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial system, and in view of insufficient efforts to strengthen its capital adequacy in recent months... It is now important that the process of nationalisation be followed by firm efforts to maximise the repayment of related-party loans, and the appointment of an independent management team to restore the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s viability, minimising the cost to the state and taxpayers in line with existing legislation and international best practice. The IMF will continue to support Ukraine in its efforts to build strong institutions, enhance transparency, and advance structural reforms which are critical to achieve strong and sustainable economic growth. And in Italy: The details of the European Union\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision against Apple in a dispute over the tax it pays to Ireland have been released. Jennifer Rankin reports from Brussels: Apple could reduce its \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn (\u00c2\u00a310.8bn) tax bill to Ireland if it increased payments to its US parent company or paid back taxes to other EU countries, the European commission has said, as it revealed the full text of its landmark ruling against the US tech giant for the first time. Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition commissioner, suggested Ireland may not see the full \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn in back taxes, if Apple chose to pay larger amounts to its US headquarters to fund research and development. Speaking to the Irish Independent, she also said the total paid to Ireland could be reduced because other EU member states may demand more tax from Apple if they concluded that the US tech firm had underpaid them, because it had been routing profits to Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Irish headquarters in Cork. The full text of the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision, published on Monday, sets the stage for a titanic legal battle, which pits the European commission against Apple and Dublin, with implications for hundreds of companies. In August, the commission said a sweetheart deal devised by the Irish government had allowed Apple to pay tax of just 0.005% in 2014 and an average rate of 1% over many years. The UK Competition and Markets Authority will investigate the secondary ticketing market. It said: The CMA has today launched an enforcement investigation into suspected breaches of consumer protection law in the online secondary tickets market. This follows concerns that people are not getting the full range of information required by law when buying tickets put up for resale. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will specifically look at if information is provided on who the seller is and any connections the seller may have with the platform or event organisers; whether there are any restrictions on the use of resold tickets which could result in the person being denied access to the event; and where a seat is located in the venue. Andrea Coscelli, CMA Acting Chief Executive, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A night out at a concert or a trip to a big match is something that millions of people look forward to. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important they know who they are buying from and whether there are any restrictions that could stop them using the ticket. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have heard concerns about a lack of transparency over who is buying up tickets from the primary market. We also think that it is essential that those consumers who buy tickets from the secondary market are made aware if there is a risk that they will be turned away at the door.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Meanwhile eurozone construction activity was also on the rise: Annual growth in hourly eurozone wages rose 1.6% in the third quarter, compared to an increase of just 0.9% in the previous three months and 1.7% in the first quarter. Hourly labour costs - which include wages and non-wage costs - rose by 1.5% in the eurozone and by 1.9% in the wider 28 member European Union in the third quarter of 2016, compared with the same quarter of the previous year. Report compiler Eurostat said: The two main components of labour costs are wages &amp; salaries and non-wage costs. In the euro area, wages &amp; salaries per hour worked grew by 1.6% and the non-wage component by 1.2% in the third quarter of 2016 compared with the same quarter of 2015. In the second quarter of 2016, the annual changes were +0.9% and +1.5% respectively. In the EU28, hourly wages &amp; salaries rose by 2.0% and the non-wage component by 1.5% in the third quarter of 2016. In the second quarter of 2016, annual changes were +1.4% and +1.7% respectively. Howard Archer, chief European and UK economist at IHS Markit, said the data could be encouraging for the European Central Bank: A rise in Eurozone wage costs and total labour costs in the third quarter of 2016 may fuel hope within the ECB that underlying Eurozone inflationary pressures may just be starting to pick up. The ECB has been frustrated and disappointed by the lack of a pick-up in underlying Eurozone in recent months, even though the headline consumer price inflation rate has picked up... However, while the ECB may well take some comfort from the third-quarter Eurozone labour costs and wage data, the Governing Council will still be wary about the current weakness of underlying price pressures \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the ECB will likely note that while annual growth in Eurozone total labour costs and wages both picked up in the third quarter, this followed a sharp relapse in the second quarter and both were still just below the levels seen in the first quarter. Over to Greece, and this: If the festive mood in the German economy is not enough for you, then head over to our Christmas quiz for a bit more seasonal cheer. 44 out of 50 is the score to beat in my case (which is less impressive than it sounds given I wrote four of the questions.....) Economists have mixed views on what the December German IFO index portends for 2017: But economist Carsten Brzeski at ING Bank is less sanguine: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most prominent leading indicator, the Ifo index, closes the year with another improvement. The Ifo index increased to 110.0 in December, from 110.4 in November. The increase was mainly driven by a better current assessment component (116.6, from 115.6). The expectations component remained almost unchanged. The December increase suggests that German businesses are not (yet) afraid of negative economic implications from the new president in the US. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ifo was the last important macro indicator for the German economy this year. As always, the upcoming Christmas break is a good occasion for a reflective moment. A look at the German economy through the rear mirror. A look which shows an impressive, though slightly slowing growth performance. The German economy has continued its recovery and defied many external risks and turmoil, like Chinese stock market turbulences and economic slowdown, low oil prices, Brexit and continued weakness in many Eurozone countries. The key for economic success has been domestic demand. Strong domestic demand on the back of a strong labour market, low inflation, low interest rates and higher wages, partly fueled by the ECB and refugees. Unfortunately, as with so many good things, the current positive growth cycle is also coming to an end. Gradually, not abruptly. Looking into 2017, the upside for the German economy is that the main growth drivers of 2016 should still be the main growth drivers of 2017, only weaker. Construction, the best-performing sector currently, should continue to benefit from low interest rates and excess demand for housing in urban areas. Consumption should continue to thrive on the back of the strong labour market, higher real wages and low interest rates. Finally, government consumption should remain high as the influx of refugees requires continued expenditure. However, these three drivers are unlikely to gain momentum as interest rates are unlikely to drop further, inflation is gradually moving upwards and the labour market has reached its natural rate of unemployment. Real risks to the German outlook mainly seem to stem from the outside. The still unknown impact from president-elect Trump on trade and economic policies, the ongoing Brexit uncertainty and renewed political tensions in Europe due to several elections or a new flaring up of the Greek crisis are in our view the biggest risks for 2017. On top of everything, national elections in Germany do not pose a risk in itself but should clearly absorb time that could be used to implement new reforms and investments. All in all, it very much looks as if 2017 could be the slimmed down version of 2016. The growth ingredients should remain the same but it will be a bit less of everything. A good recipe to lose some weight after the holidays but not the best recipe for more economic growth. The German economy is in a festive mood, according to Clemens Fuest the president of the IFO institute. He said: The German economy is making a strong finish to the year. In the manufacturing sector, the index rose. Assessments of both the current business situation and expectations improved. Demand picked up significantly and the order back log grew. More companies plan to ramp up production in the months ahead as a result. In wholesaling, the business climate index rose to its highest level in almost three years. This was primarily due to more favourable assessments of the business situation. Wholesalers, however, scaled back their optimistic expectations slightly. In retailing the index remained unchanged at a high level. While retailers assessed their current business situation slightly less favourably, their business expectations improved. Electrical goods retailers reported brisk Christmas business. The construction sector continues to break records. Since Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reunification business has never been better for contractors. Improved business expectations indicate that the boom will continue in the months ahead. But it was not so joyous in the service sector: In the service sector the mood deteriorated in the run-up to Christmas. The indicator fell to 31.7 balance points in December from 35.0 balance points in November. Service providers assessed their current business situation less favourably. They also scaled back their business expectations slightly. Both indices, however, are significantly above their long-term average. Service providers remain keen to recruit additional staff. German business confidence improved in December, with the IFO index rising to 111 much as expected: Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest lender has been declared insolvent, with the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank saying that nationalisation was the best way forward. Reuters reports: Ukraine declared the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest lender PrivatBank insolvent on Monday and said bringing it under state ownership was the only way to protect the money of 20 million Ukrainian clients and stave off threats to the financial system. The central bank said in a statement that PrivatBank had not fulfilled its recapitalisation programme and 97 percent of its corporate loans had gone to companies linked to the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shareholders. As of Dec. 1, the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capital shortfall stood at 148 billion hryvnia ($5.65 billion). \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are sure that moving the bank into state ownership is the only possible way to save the money of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clients and to save the financial system,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the central bank said in a statement. The central bank said that Ukraine was ready to support PrivatBank with liquidity if needed, adding that it did not see the nationalisation process as significantly impacting the currency market or inflation levels. PrivatBank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former shareholders had agreed to restructure loans paid to insiders by July 1 next year, the central bank said, while the finance minister said the bank would be sold once it was back on its feet. Under Western-backed banking reforms, Ukraine is meant to shut lenders that cannot meet capitalisation targets, but PrivatBank is considered too big to fail. The nationalisation comes just days before parliament has to vote on next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget, which must stick to a shortfall of 3 percent of economic output, as agreed with Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s international backers. Meanwhile the Ukrainian president said the state assured PrivatBank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clients that their money was safe, and called for people to remain calm. Over in Italy, shares in Monte dei Paschi have opened and are down 8.5%, triggering another suspension. The Santa rally in markets that we have seen since the start of December appears to be running out of steam a little. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: It may be the start of the final week before Christmas, but so far the European markets are looking rather Santa-less this Monday. To be fair, the FTSE has actually had a rather impressive December already, finally climbing back above 7000 last Friday, so it can be forgiven for not drastically building on that level this morning. The index is still flirting with that landmark level, though currently it lacks the kind of momentum that could lead it to a fresh all-time high later in the day. As for the pound, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still struggling below 1.25 against the dollar, while against the dollar it has shed 0.2%. Over in the Eurozone the situation was similar, with the DAX and CAC both dipping after the bell. Like the FTSE the German and French indices have had a very strong December; the DAX, for example, has risen around 800 points since the start of the month, in part thanks to the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (sort of) QE boost in its most recent meeting. Defying expectations, stock markets have started the last trading week before Christmas on the back foot. The FTSE 100 has fallen around12 points or 0.18% while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac have lost 0.2%. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB has opened down 0.3%. Mining and financial stocks are proving a drag in early trading, with Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Monte de Paschi failing to open but called lower on news of its plans to launch a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn cash call in a last ditch effort to avoid a state bailout. The bank said on Sunday its offer to institutional investors, who account for 65% of the total, would be open until 1pm GMT on Thursday. The offer to retail investors would close a day earlier. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Unicredit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecast for the German IFO business confidence index, due in an hour or so: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We expect the Ifo climate index to improve to 111.0 in December after the stabilization at 110.4 in November.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And Mike van Dulken and Henry Croft at Accendo Markets said: On a quiet day for macro data, in focus today will be German December IFO Surveys, all expected to show slight improvement since November with the Business Climate figure attempting to post a fresh 2016 high (albeit by a very slim margin). These figures have obvious importance for the Eurozone given Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position as the powerhouse for the European economy. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the last trading week before Christmas, and many investors are already winding down for the festive season. But with thin trading volumes in the markets, there might be some volatile moves to look out for. Will the FTSE 100 hit a new peak, beating the closing high of 7103 reached in April 2015 or the record intra-day level of 7129 in October this year? Will the Dow pass the key 20,000 barrier. On the agenda come German confidence figures and US services and composite PMI numbers, and ahead of that European markets are expected to open higher: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also be keeping an eye on struggling Italian bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena, which is attempting to refinance its huge debts, and could affect the general direction of the markets. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: As we head into the final full trading week of 2016, having come off a decent December so far for European stocks which have seen a number of significant breakouts, the key question as we head into year-end is whether these gains of the past two weeks are likely to be sustained. Initial impressions look positive, however the elephant in the room remains the Italian banking sector after last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement by Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest bank Unicredit to draw a line under its recent problems by announcing a significant recapitalisation plan. This week all eyes will return to Monte dei Paschi di Siena who are expected to launch their plans to sell \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn of stock in the days leading up to Christmas to institutions and retail investors, in the hope that over \u00e2\u201a\u00ac25bn of bad loans can then be sold on, and the bank rescued without having to bail in retail bondholders. While the political picture at the top of Italian government has become a little clearer there is no reason that this particular attempted restructuring package is likely to be any more successful than the previous three, given the continued weakness of the Italian economy, which is probably why so far there has been so little investor interest. There may also be developments in the Greek crisis, after lenders objected to the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to give Christmas bonuses to pensioners.",

Current guidance is for the group to generate capital before dividends equivalent of around 160 basis points of risk weighted assets in the current financial year. This is equivalent to around 5p per share and compares to our current full year dividend forecast of 4p, which includes a 2.55p ordinary payment and 1.45p special. It is likely that the anticipated special dividend may therefore be missed or reduced in order to finance the deal, albeit we would expect further surplus capital to be generated in subsequent years. </p> <p>Overall, the anticipated financial performance and shareholder value creation that is expected to be generated by this transaction is impressive, in our view, and suggests a better use of capital than simply returning it to shareholders. That said, Lloyds will be broadly doubling up its exposure to credit cards at a particularly benign point in the bad debt cycle and ahead of a potential slow-down in the UK economy once the terms of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU are reached. While there is some latitude in the financial metrics to absorb potentially higher impairments, the risk cannot be ignored.

MBNA has assets of around \u00c2\u00a37bn, and Lloyds said the deal would increase its annual revenues by \u00c2\u00a3650m. Cost cutting is on the cards - Lloyds said It expected savings of \u00c2\u00a3100m within two years.</p> <p>MBNA still faces claims for misselling personal protection insurance (PPI) but Lloyds says the liability is capped at \u00c2\u00a3240m. </p> <p>Lloyds was reportedly the favourite to buy MBNA, having seen off rival bidder Cerberus, the US private equity group.</p> <p>Elsewhere, the Bank of Japan has kept interest rates on hold and upgraded its economic outlook. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said:</p> <blockquote> <p>This shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been a surprise to most people given recent yen weakness which has come as a welcome relief to Japanese policymakers, after several failed attempts this year to weaken the yen. Even so the yen still remains above the levels it was when the Bank of Japan first pushed rates into negative territory in January, and reinforcing the reality that the only way the yen is likely to weaken further is as a result of future US policy moves. </p> </blockquote> <p>Those US moves are likely to involve further interest rate rises, perhaps in short order given the bullish tone on jobs of Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen in a speech to students in Baltimore on Monday.</p> <p>On the agenda today we get the latest CBI retail sales figures.

                "bodyText":"US shares continue to forge ahead, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average making further strides towards the 20,000 barrier. The Dow is currently up 61 points or 0.3% 19,944, as the post election rally continues. The S&amp;P 500 has opened 0.22% higher and the Nasdaq Composite 0.3% better. The moves higher came despite the increased global tensions, following the attacks in Berlin and Turkey. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: US markets are continuing to remain resilient despite the continued rise in yields and the US dollar, with the Dow looking to have another crack at the 20,000 level that it fell just short of last week. As for Europe, the FTSE 100 is up 0.3%, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is 0.19% higher and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.4%. Hewson said: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been another fairly quiet pre-Christmas trading day for European equity markets which, after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brief pause have continued to build on the gains of the last few weeks with the Dax shrugging off the tragic events in Berlin, to put in another new high for the year. The FTSE100 has also hit its highest level since October as both key European benchmarks reap the benefits of a weaker currency with the euro hitting its lowest levels since 2002 and the pound posting a one month low against the US dollar. If investors are in any way fazed by the rise in geopolitical tension over the past 24 hours it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s certainly not being reflected in stock market valuations. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Over in Greece, the euro working group is set to decide whether to reinstate short-term debt relief measures abruptly suspended last week. Helena Smith reports: In Athens officials are privately expressing optimism that lenders will take the view the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement of relief measures for the vulnerable \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in no way conflicts with fiscal targets.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Prime minister Alexis Tsipras, who caught creditors off guard when he declared a budget primary surplus would allow his leftist led coalition to grant a one-off bonus to around 1.6 million low-income pensioners, is hoping today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s teleconference will clear up \u00e2\u20ac\u0153any misunderstanding.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Greece has been on a collision course with bailout partners since the measures were unveiled. Suspension of a planned VAT rise on islands in the Aegean hit by refugee flows - a second measure - was included in a draft bill put before parliament last night. The hope is that the euro working group will unblock the debt relief measures it froze last week so that a second review of the economy assessing the headway Greece has made in implementing reforms can be concluded when euro zone finance ministers convene again on 26 January. The euro continues to fall against the dollar, heading closer towards parity. The decline is mainly a function of the strength of the US currency of course, as further interest rate rises from the Federal Reserve loom large. But the problems of the eurozone, including the troubled Italian banking sector, are also a factor, as is the horrific attack in Berlin. The euro is currently down 0.5% at $1.0353, its lowest since early 2003. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, said: Another day, anther multi-year high for the dollar. This afternoon saw the euro/dollar drop below last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s low to hit its lowest level since 2003. The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heaviest traded pair has been falling sharply in recent times as disparity between Eurozone and US monetary policies grow. Whereas the ECB has turned even more dovish by expanding its QE stimulus programme to at least December 2017, the Fed has [raised] interest rates and has talked up the possibility of three further hikes next year. This is basically the driving force behind the euro/dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downward move and will probably remain so in the early parts of next year. [The] next phase of the move could be severe in terms of magnitude. At a minimum, the euro/dollar, I think, would reach parity, possibly before the year is out. I think there is potential for it to drop even lower over time. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our report on the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales survey. Larry Elliott writes: Retailers have been enjoying their strongest sales growth in more than a year amid signs from Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading employers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 organisation of a pre-Christmas consumer spending spree. The latest health check of high street and online activity from the CBI found that sales so far in December beat expectations, were above average for the time of year, and led to retailers beefing up their orders to suppliers. But the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s distributive trades survey also found that retailers expect the pace of growth to slacken in early 2017 when the fall in the value of the pound pushes up inflation and reduces living standards. The survey of 112 retailers reported 51% as saying sales were higher than a year ago while 16% said they were lower. The resulting balance of +35 points was up on the +26 points recorded in November and the highest since September 2015. As if to confirm the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments about rising prices, the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ian McCafferty has pointed to the prospect of higher inflation, and reiterated the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stance that interest rates were as likely to rise as to fall. In a speech at the Dorset Chamber of Commerce, he said that higher inflation, weaker growth and the fallout from the Brexit vote complicated the outlook for the UK economy: This confluence of trends - rising inflation, initial demand resilience but a slowdown in growth in prospect and a likely hit to supply over the longer term - provides a challenging background for policy setting... On the basis of our current understanding of the economy, the balance of risks around the outlook was two-sided, such that from the current level, any further changes in our policy stance in the near future were as likely to be upward as downward... The uncertainties about the future path of the economy following the referendum are such that we will be following the emerging data even more closely than normal. Quite where policy will go next will depend crucially on how the different cogs and wheels in the economy behave over the coming year or two. Consumers may be splashing out because they anticipate prices are heading higher, says economist Howard Archer at IHS Markit: Retailers will certainly be hoping that consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 willingness to spend holds up over the final part of the vital Christmas shopping period and into the New Year. The CBI survey indicates that retailers are more cautious about sales prospects in January although they still see them at a relatively decent level.... For now, consumers are still benefiting from decent fundamentals, notably relatively decent purchasing power and high employment... The major problem facing the economy - and retailers in particular - is that it looks inevitable that the fundamentals for consumers will weaken markedly over the coming months with purchasing power being increasingly squeezed and the labour market likely weakening... In the near-term, there is the possibility that some consumers will bring forward purchases of big-ticket items in the belief that their prices are likely to rise appreciably over the coming months. Expectations of rising prices may make consumers particularly keen to take advantage of genuine bargains in the clearance sales in late-December and January. Next year looks more challenging for retailers, ING economist James Knightley agrees: Households are clearly willing to spend, but the headwinds for next year are strong. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Confederation of British Industry has reported that retailers have had a really strong Christmas trading period so far. A net 35% of retailers saw higher volumes of sales than 12 months ago, up from 26% in November and well ahead of the 20% consensus. This is the strongest reading since September last year and suggests that consumer spending will again make a big contribution to 4Q GDP growth. It also again highlights the resilience of the UK economy despite the Brexit uncertainty. However, 2017 is already shaping up to be more challenging. Consumer confidence has weakened significantly in the past couple of months, which may be partly due to growing fears over what Brexit might mean for households, but also an anticipation of sharply higher prices. Inflation expectations have jumped in response to warnings from industry groups and individual companies that the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collapse means higher costs that will likely be passed onto consumers. This is going to squeeze household spending power and may be partly responsible for the recent run of strong spending \u00e2\u20ac\u201c people bringing forward purchases to avoid higher prices. The CBI survey actually takes in the last week of November and the first two weeks of this month, so it includes Black Friday as well as the pre-Christmas shopping spree. The CBI calculates its balance figure by taking away the percentage of retailers who saw falling sales from those who reported a rise. So 51% said sales volumes were up, whilst 16% said they were down, giving a balance of +35%. But despite the boom in the numbers, the CBI said it expected sales to slow in 2017 as the weaker pound pushed up prices and squeezed disposable income. It said the growth was broad based, with strong performances from clothing and grocers. Internet sales - of course - continued to move higher, at their best pace since November 2014. CBI economist Ben Jones said: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s encouraging to see retailers reporting another month of healthy sales growth leading up to the festive season, which rounds off a fairly solid quarter. While we still expect to see decent growth in the near term, the pressures on retail activity are likely to increase during 2017, as the impact of sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s depreciation feeds through. With higher inflation beginning to weigh on households\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 purchasing power, consumption patterns are likely to shift, creating winners and losers across the retail landscape. So far in December retail sales have come in stronger than expected, according to the CBI. Its retail sales index showed a balance of +35%, up from +26% in November and better than the expected +20%. This is the highest level since September 2015. The index of retailers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 orders with suppliers was up 12% in December compared to a rise of 6% in November, the best level for more than a year. A quick update on the markets. Despite the horrific events in Berlin and Turkey, leading shares are attempting to move higher. The FTSE 100 is up 0.03%, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is up 0.05% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.3%. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said: Equity indices are trading flat on another sombre post-terror attack day with markets shrugging off renewed geopolitical risk and Travel stocks not suffering their usual knee-jerk weakness. The FTSE100 is treading water with Lloyds (MBNA purchase offers chance for growth) and big Pharma offsetting losses for HSBC, Oil majors and Tobacco despite the weak pound. Major bourses remain close to highs, but may struggle to improve without a Monte dei Paschi recap/rescue in the bag. The FTSE 100 is sideways 6995-7020, waiting to pop one way or the other. The DAX 30 is holding its December uptrend above 14000, still trying to engineer a breakout to fresh 13-month highs. Dow Jones Futures are knocking at 19920 resistance trying to challenge 19965 all-time highs. The Lloyds/MDNA deal owes something to the regulators, says Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: Lloyds is backing itself despite the uncertain economic outlook, and this deal will mean the bank has now cornered a quarter of the UK credit card market. This does mean a special dividend for 2016 has become less likely, but at the same time the additional earnings from the credit card book bolster the dividend-paying prospects of the bank in years to come. The acquisition will allow Lloyds to boost its net interest margin, which is pretty valuable against a backdrop of such low interest rates. The deal owes some thanks to the FCA deadline on PPI claims, which has given some measure of certainty to the level of compensation MBNA will have to pay out, providing both parties with a more solid platform for negotiation. News from Greece of a delay in appointing a new chief executive for the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest bank. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kathimerini reports: The process for the appointment of a new chief executive officer will resume in 2017, Piraeus Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governing board decided on Monday. Earlier, the majority of the board had voted down the lone candidacy of Christos Papadopoulos due to reservations expressed by the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). Sources say that the appointment was postponed after consultation with the SSM, as it appears that once again the insistence of the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund (HFSF) that a CEO must be appointed did not convince the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board. The HFSF is the biggest stakeholder in Piraeus Bank. It holds 26 percent of its shares. The mandate of the board expires next summer and, according to sources, that will set the time frame for the completion of administrative changes in the lender. Back with the Lloyds deal to buy MBNA, and Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, has a couple of concerns: Lloyds says this deal will boost revenues by \u00c2\u00a3650m a year and improve net interest margin about 10 basis points a year. The bank predicts earnings per share to rise by somewhere between 3% and 5% once the deal has been completed. But we have to be sceptical about a couple of elements. First, this big purchase could take a long time to pay off and by eating up so much cash we have to question whether Lloyds can increase dividends as much as hoped. The deal eats up 80 basis points of capital, which is about half of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual net capital generation. The question we have to ask is whether this is good value for money at a time of great uncertainty in the market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c defaults could rise if we start to get higher unemployment. Brexit makes the economic outlook very uncertain and Lloyds has just upped its exposure to UK consumer debt at potentially the worst moment. The run up to the last financial crisis was marked by hubristic mergers and acquisitions. Too big to fail rules make it impossible for big banks to join up these days but Lloyds has found a way to expand nonetheless. Recent figures from Lloyds weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fabulous. Underlying profits fell 3 per cent to \u00c2\u00a31.9bn, while profits before tax were down 15 per cent at \u00c2\u00a3811m as the bank had to set aside another \u00c2\u00a31bn for PPI claims. You may well be fed up of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153festive spirit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd already but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let that stop you taking our Christmas quiz. No prizes but just the chance to show how much attention you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been paying over the past year: Paysafe, the digital payment specialist which saw its shares slump earlier this month after a negative report from a short seller, is continuing its recovery. The company, which dismissed the claims by Spotlight Research as either old or inaccurate, has jumped nearly 6% to 361p after it announced a buyback of up to \u00c2\u00a3100m. Its shares closed down nearly 18% on the day of the report, but are now not far off a complete recovery. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our full story on the Lloyds/MBNA deal: The German and French markets have now edged into positive territory. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The European markets got off to another slow start this Tuesday, investors struggling to find a reason to send the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s indices any higher. The FTSE once again lingered around the 7000 mark, lacking any real impetus to push towards its all-time peak from earlier in the year. The pound, meanwhile, has continued to fall against the dollar; it now sits under $1.24, its worst price in around the month. Against the euro sterling has fared a bit better, remaining just above the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.19 mark... The fact that [European markets] posted any growth this morning is somewhat remarkable given the events in Germany and Turkey on Monday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is perhaps a sign of how depressingly routine such tragedies have become that the market no longer has the same kind of reaction to them. It was to be expected perhaps, after the events in Berlin and Turkey, but stock markets are struggling for direction at the start of trading as investors remain cautious. The FTSE 100 is down 0.04% while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has dipped 0.04% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac is 0.03% lower. But the Spanish and Italian markets have managed to both edge higher. Lloyds Banking Group meanwhile is up 0.5% after its \u00c2\u00a31.9bn deal to purchase MBNA. Speaking of deals, the controversy over the maker of the new five pound note using animal fat in the production process has not put off a Canadian company from buying the business. Reuters reports: Canadian label and packaging maker CCL Industries Inc said it would buy Innovia Group, whose unit is the supplier of Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new plastic five pound note that has fallen foul with vegetarians, for about C$1.13 billion ($842 million). U.K.-based Innovia Group is a maker of specialty bi-axially oriented polypropylene films used for labels, packaging and security applications... CCL is buying Innovia debt free and net of cash from a consortium of U.K.-based private equity investors managed by The Smithfield Group LLP. The Bank of England said last month that [Innovia was] working toward removing the use of animal fat in the production of its new plastic five pound note after objection raised by thousands of vegetarians. Back with the Lloyds deal to buy MBNA, and Shore Capital reckons the move could rule out any special dividend to shareholders. Analyst Gary Greenwood said: Although there is no change to guidance for a progressive ordinary dividend payment, this may colour management\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thinking towards special dividend payments for the current financial year as management may wish to retail additional capital. Current guidance is for the group to generate capital before dividends equivalent of around 160 basis points of risk weighted assets in the current financial year. This is equivalent to around 5p per share and compares to our current full year dividend forecast of 4p, which includes a 2.55p ordinary payment and 1.45p special. It is likely that the anticipated special dividend may therefore be missed or reduced in order to finance the deal, albeit we would expect further surplus capital to be generated in subsequent years. Overall, the anticipated financial performance and shareholder value creation that is expected to be generated by this transaction is impressive, in our view, and suggests a better use of capital than simply returning it to shareholders. That said, Lloyds will be broadly doubling up its exposure to credit cards at a particularly benign point in the bad debt cycle and ahead of a potential slow-down in the UK economy once the terms of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU are reached. While there is some latitude in the financial metrics to absorb potentially higher impairments, the risk cannot be ignored. In addition, we see limited scope for organic growth given the high post transaction market share and attention such growth may attract from the competition authorities. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more on the Bank of Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more positive view of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. Reuters reports: The Bank of Japan kept monetary policy steady and took a more upbeat view of the economy on Tuesday, reinforcing market expectations that its future policy direction could be an increase - not a cut - in interest rates. Reflecting a pick-up in emerging Asian demand and factory output, the central bank upgraded its language to signal its confidence that the economy is headed for a steady recovery. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy continues to recover moderately as a trend,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the BOJ said in a statement announcing the policy decision. It also offered a brighter view on exports and output, saying they were picking up. But the central bank warned that the impact of US monetary policy on global markets was among risks to the outlook, suggesting that the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate hike cycle could disrupt emerging market capital flows. As widely expected, the BOJ kept unchanged its pledge to guide short-term rates at minus 0.1 percent and the 10-year government bond yield around zero percent. Underscoring its optimism on the outlook, the central bank even revised up its view on private consumption - considered a soft spot for the Japanese economy, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third largest. But BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said it was premature to consider raising the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s yield targets with inflation still distant from its 2 percent target. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s absolutely not the case that Japanese government bond yields are allowed to rise in tandem with overseas long-term interest rates, or that (any such rise in Japanese yields) would prompt us to raise our yield targets,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kuroda told a news conference. Kuroda also said he saw no problem with the yen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent declines against the dollar, saying such falls would help push up inflation by boosting import prices and in so doing raise inflation expectations, a crucial element in the BOJ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to beat economic stagnation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Current exchange-rate moves can be described more as dollar strengthening rather than yen weakening,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kuroda said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible the divergence in monetary policy directions could affect currency moves. But for now, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see current yen falls as excessive or posing any problem.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index Direct, said: The market reaction to this move has generally been a stronger USD/JPY. Although the BOJ economic outlook is more upbeat, it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough to compete with the Fed and its rate-hiking cycle for 2017, which will continue to give the US dollar the yield advantage. Japanese stocks like it though, and the Nikkei is up 0.5% already, as a weaker currency, a brighter economic outlook and a low interest rate environment boost the Japanese corporate outlook. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. On a quiet trading week in the run-up to Christmas, Lloyds Banking Group has just provided a bit of merger excitement. It is paying \u00c2\u00a31.9bn for MBNA, the UK credit card business, from Bank of America. MBNA has assets of around \u00c2\u00a37bn, and Lloyds said the deal would increase its annual revenues by \u00c2\u00a3650m. Cost cutting is on the cards - Lloyds said It expected savings of \u00c2\u00a3100m within two years. MBNA still faces claims for misselling personal protection insurance (PPI) but Lloyds says the liability is capped at \u00c2\u00a3240m. Lloyds was reportedly the favourite to buy MBNA, having seen off rival bidder Cerberus, the US private equity group. Elsewhere, the Bank of Japan has kept interest rates on hold and upgraded its economic outlook. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: This shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been a surprise to most people given recent yen weakness which has come as a welcome relief to Japanese policymakers, after several failed attempts this year to weaken the yen. Even so the yen still remains above the levels it was when the Bank of Japan first pushed rates into negative territory in January, and reinforcing the reality that the only way the yen is likely to weaken further is as a result of future US policy moves. Those US moves are likely to involve further interest rate rises, perhaps in short order given the bullish tone on jobs of Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen in a speech to students in Baltimore on Monday. On the agenda today we get the latest CBI retail sales figures. They supposedly cover December but come ahead of the last minute Christmas trading rush. We already have stronger than expected German producer price figures, up 0.3% month on month in November, compared to expectations of a 0.1% rise. But they were lower than the 0.7% figure in October. We will also be following developments in Greece, after Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warned about the consequences of European lenders delaying debt relief. Our full story is here: And Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s troubled Monte dei Paschi continues to try and attract investors to its \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn fundraising. Meanwhile the Italian government is looking at a \u00c2\u00a320bn rescue package for all its struggling banks. European stock markets are expected to open slightly lower, with investors likely to unnerved by the events in Berlin where 12 people have been killed after a truck ploughed into a Christmas market, as well as the shooting of Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ambassador in Turkey. The opening calls are:",

Furthermore, consumer confidence is now at a very decent level compared to long-term norms. Consumers across the Eurozone are currently benefiting from pretty decent fundamentals overall, notably including higher employment and still limited inflation.</p> <p>This reinforces hopes that the Eurozone will have seen some pick-up in GDP growth in the fourth quarter and is set to see a decent start to 2017...</p> <p>While there are no details available, it seems reasonable suspect that the marked rise in Eurozone consumer confidence in December was due to improved perceptions on the economic situation and outlook. It is also likely that job concerns eased further across the Eurozone after a marked dip in November (following increased worries during August-October). Significantly, latest data showed that Eurozone unemployment dropped at an increased rate in October and September after labour markets had shown signs of losing momentum over the summer.</p> <p>Any improvement in Eurozone consumer confidence \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly a decent increase \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is to be welcomed as the consumer clearly is vital to Eurozone growth prospects...</p> <p>However, there is the danger that an increasingly uncertain political and economic environment could cause companies to become more cautious over employment during 2017.</p> <p>Furthermore, consumer confidence in the Eurozone could very well be pressurised by increasing political uncertainty over the coming months, especially given that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote in June and November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election of Donald Trump as US President fuels concern over potential political shocks in the Eurozone.

This is due to: </p> <ul> <li><strong>onshore corporation tax,</strong> where strength in October instalment payments that was factored into our November forecast is not expected to persist over the rest of the year;<br></li> <li><strong>stamp duty land tax</strong>, where we expect much weaker growth over the rest of the year. SDLT receipts in April 2016 were up 48 per cent on a year earlier, reflecting forestalling ahead of the introduction of an additional rate of stamp duty on additional properties (i.e. buy-to-let investments and second homes). We expect the weakness in receipts seen since the EU referendum to persist over the rest of the year; and <br></li> <li><strong>central government spending,</strong> where a number of factors are expected to boost growth later in the year. These include debt interest spending, which is expected to rise due to higher RPI inflation (with a lag of three to eight months) and higher planned investment spending.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd<br></li> </ul> <p>However (as flagged earlier), Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borrowing since April is down by \u00c2\u00a37.7bn, so the annual deficit should still fall.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/OBR_UK/status/811553699772432384\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Data revisions improve public finances - read the latest commentary at <a href=\"https://t.co/k0nGloBMMW\">https://t.co/k0nGloBMMW</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/gM3KrXEaaT\">pic.twitter.com/gM3KrXEaaT</a></p>&mdash; OBR (@OBR_UK) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OBR_UK/status/811553699772432384\">December 21, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-585a6dc5e4b0d460757eb26e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/helenasmith\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-21T12:42:44.080Z\">12.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"950f4124ed872729a0a5b855a48b145e9b41152c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/950f4124ed872729a0a5b855a48b145e9b41152c/0_0_1301_1345/967.jpg\" alt=\"A Greek flag\" width=\"967\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Over in Greece, relations with creditors remain awkward and tense following Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inconclusive euro working group (representing Greek creditors)<br></strong></p> <h2>Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens:</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The tensions stirred by the announcement of relief measures for those hardest hit by the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seemingly relentless economic crisis show no sign of abating.</p> <p>Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s euro group meeting was a test case in humiliation for the embattled Greek government with Athens being forced to accept in writing that the bonus proclaimed by prime minister Alexis Tsipras for pensioners is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one off\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that will never be repeated.</p> <p>Germany, the main contributor to the emergency bailouts keeping the debt-stricken economy afloat, apparently remains unconvinced that the pre-Christmas gifts (including exempting Aegean islands from a planned sales tax) will not throw the economy off-course.

                "bodyText":"In quiet pre-Christmas trading, the banking sector came under pressure on concerns that Italian bank Monte dei Pashi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fundraising was in trouble, helping push European markets into negative territory. The moves were hardly dramatic however, ahead of the holiday period, and the German market managed to just about buck the trend. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has so far failed to test the 20,000 barrier. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 0.04% at 7041.42 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax edged up 0.03% to 11,468.64 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.33% lower at 4833.82 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.16% to 19,215.59 with Monte dei Paschi itself down 12% Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.38% at 9371.7 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.71% to 638.99 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down around 13 points at 19,961. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day, barring any late developments on Wall Street. Thanks for all your comments and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Worries about European banks are undermining stock markets, particularly in Italy and Spain. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Banking concerns have played across European markets once again today, as Monte dei Paschi looks set for a government takeover. The rescue plan has fallen apart, with Rome unable to find an anchor investor; for understandable reasons, no one wants to be first \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcover the top\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 should the crisis worsen. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt will get bigger, but a major government stake should, paradoxically, boost risk appetite among investors, who will be glad to see the Italian government taking the tough decisions. Meanwhile, Spanish banks are under pressure after the ECJ ruled they would have to pay back funds to mortgage borrowers. 2016 saw plenty of concerns about European banks, but while it made sense for everyone to buy Deutsche shares at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10, it will be harder to find investors willing to take stakes in southern European firms. Still, the overall tone on markets is only slightly negative, although the patient watch for Dow 20,000 goes on. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters on the Monte dei Paschi situation: Ailing Italian bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena has been unable to find an anchor investor willing to put money in its privately funded rescue plan, less than 24 hours before the offer ends, two sources close to the matter said on Wednesday. The bank needs to raise 5 billion euros ($5.2 billion) by the end of this month to avert being wound down. The Italian government is expected to step in this week to bail it out. The Tuscan lender, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third biggest bank and the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest, had pinned its hopes on Qatar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereign wealth fund investing 1 billion euros in its cash call, but that option is no longer on the table, the sources said. As a result, the bank entire share sale, which closes at 2 p.m. (1300 GMT) on Thursday, has drawn very little interest from the wider investment community, they added. The bank declined to comment. Ratings agency DBRS is keeping an eye on Italy: Over in Italy, the rescue package for struggling bank Monte dei Paschi is looking in trouble, bringing the prospect of a state bailout closer: Which suggests that Qatar is unwilling to invest in the bank. But Italy could find out whether any bailout breaches EU rules, if taxpayers have to foot the bill but investors are left untouched. In the wake of its recent blog on Greece, the International Monetary Fund has responded to questions about its comments, mainly to do with tax and pensions. A tweet from the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokesperson explains: Oil prices have slipped slightly as the latest US figures show an unexpected rise in crude stocks. West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is 0.15% lower at $53.22 a barrel while Brent crude is down 0.38% to $55.14. US crude stocks have defied expectations with a hefty jump last week. They rose by nearly 2.3m barrels, according to the Energy Information Administration, compared to forecasts of a fall of around 2.5m barrels. The figures go against Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news from the American Petroleum Institute of a much larger than expected 4.1m decline in crude. Analyst welcomed the improvement in European consumer confidence, but there was some caution over the future outlook. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: European consumers appear to have shrugged off concerns including Brexit, the Italian banking crisis and the upcoming inauguration of President Trump to post the year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strongest confidence figures for December, albeit still firmly in negative territory. While today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data will encourage ECB chief Mario Draghi, the Christmas cheer may not last long, especially if markets start to waver as Brexit negotiations begin in earnest next year. Draghi must be congratulated for steering Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy through choppy waters during what has been a particularly testing 12 months. But now the real challenge begins: delivering substantive growth in 2017. Economist Howard Archer at IHS Markit said: An encouraging boost to Eurozone growth prospects as consumer confidence rose for a fourth month running in December to reach a 20-month high. Furthermore, consumer confidence is now at a very decent level compared to long-term norms. Consumers across the Eurozone are currently benefiting from pretty decent fundamentals overall, notably including higher employment and still limited inflation. This reinforces hopes that the Eurozone will have seen some pick-up in GDP growth in the fourth quarter and is set to see a decent start to 2017... While there are no details available, it seems reasonable suspect that the marked rise in Eurozone consumer confidence in December was due to improved perceptions on the economic situation and outlook. It is also likely that job concerns eased further across the Eurozone after a marked dip in November (following increased worries during August-October). Significantly, latest data showed that Eurozone unemployment dropped at an increased rate in October and September after labour markets had shown signs of losing momentum over the summer. Any improvement in Eurozone consumer confidence \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly a decent increase \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is to be welcomed as the consumer clearly is vital to Eurozone growth prospects... However, there is the danger that an increasingly uncertain political and economic environment could cause companies to become more cautious over employment during 2017. Furthermore, consumer confidence in the Eurozone could very well be pressurised by increasing political uncertainty over the coming months, especially given that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote in June and November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election of Donald Trump as US President fuels concern over potential political shocks in the Eurozone. General elections are due 2017 in the Netherlands (in March), France (in April/May) and Germany (around September), and may also well occur in Italy after the December referendum defeat on constitutional reform. Eurozone consumer confidence has improved so far in December. The provisional reading for the month from the European Commission shows a rise of 1.1 points to -5.1, compared to expectations of a figure of -6. The Commission said: In December 2016, the...flash estimate of the consumer confidence indicator increased markedly in both the euro area (by 1.1 points to -5.1) and the EU (by 1.2 points to -4.6) compared to November. On the home sales, Lawrence Yun, the association\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, said the last three months had been outstanding for the housing market. He said: The healthiest job market since the Great Recession and the anticipation of some buyers to close on a home before mortgage rates accurately rose from their historically low level have combined to drive sales higher in recent months. Furthermore, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no coincidence that home shoppers in the Northeast \u00e2\u20ac\u201d where price growth has been tame all year \u00e2\u20ac\u201d had the most success last month. Existing housing supply at the beginning of the year was inadequate and is now even worse heading into 2017. Rental units are also seeing this shortage. As a result, both home prices and rents continue to far outstrip incomes in much of the country. US existing home sales unexpectedly jumped in November, hitting their highest level in nearly ten years. Sales rose 0.7% to an annualised 5.61m units, the best since February 2007, according to the National Association of Realtors. Analysts had been expecting a fall from October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure of 5.57m units - itself revised down from 5.6m - to 5.5m. Well that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t last. The Dow is now down 14 points as investors shy away from pushing it above 20,000. For the moment at least. After an initial dip, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is slightly higher, edging ever nearer to the 20,000 barrier. But the trend is not exactly certain in early trading. The Dow is currently at 19,982, up 8 points. Elsewhere the S&amp;P 500 opened down just 1.55 points while the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.05%. Analysts have been waiting for a few days now for the Dow Jones Industrial Average to break the 20,000 barrier for the first time, and on Tuesday it came tantalisingly close at 19,987 before closing at 19.974. Could today be the day? The futures are indicating a slight rise, so it looks like edging ever closer. Kit Juckes at Societe Generale said: I have no insight into what happens once the Dow breaks 20,000 but some people see this as a major milestone. And until it is broken it acts as Pied Piper, or perhaps Rudolph\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nose, lighting the way for the risk-hungry and those scared of being left behind. The Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly Brexit Watch has just been published. It shows how the impact June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote is now hitting the economy, with inflation up and retail sales growth slowing. Economists Danny Blanchflower and Andrew Sentance both agree that growth is slowing: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, has just warned that public borrowing in the final four months of this financial year will be slightly higher than a year ago. In its official response to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finance data, the OBR warns that tax receipts may weaken in the December-March period, while government spending will pick up. The OBR says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Considerable uncertainty remains over prospects for borrowing in the remaining third of the year, but we expect public sector net borrowing to rise slightly relative to the same period in 2015-16. This is due to: onshore corporation tax, where strength in October instalment payments that was factored into our November forecast is not expected to persist over the rest of the year; stamp duty land tax, where we expect much weaker growth over the rest of the year. SDLT receipts in April 2016 were up 48 per cent on a year earlier, reflecting forestalling ahead of the introduction of an additional rate of stamp duty on additional properties (i.e. buy-to-let investments and second homes). We expect the weakness in receipts seen since the EU referendum to persist over the rest of the year; and central government spending, where a number of factors are expected to boost growth later in the year. These include debt interest spending, which is expected to rise due to higher RPI inflation (with a lag of three to eight months) and higher planned investment spending.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However (as flagged earlier), Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borrowing since April is down by \u00c2\u00a37.7bn, so the annual deficit should still fall. Over in Greece, relations with creditors remain awkward and tense following Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inconclusive euro working group (representing Greek creditors) Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens: The tensions stirred by the announcement of relief measures for those hardest hit by the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seemingly relentless economic crisis show no sign of abating. Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s euro group meeting was a test case in humiliation for the embattled Greek government with Athens being forced to accept in writing that the bonus proclaimed by prime minister Alexis Tsipras for pensioners is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one off\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that will never be repeated. Germany, the main contributor to the emergency bailouts keeping the debt-stricken economy afloat, apparently remains unconvinced that the pre-Christmas gifts (including exempting Aegean islands from a planned sales tax) will not throw the economy off-course. The leftist-led government insists that fiscal targets can be met because the supplementary help will be extracted from the primary surplus Athens, by dint of hard effort, has managed to achieve. The deputy prime minister Yiannis Dragasakis highlighted the tensions on Tuesday evening saying it was the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sovereign right\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to distribute the excess surplus as it felt fit. Finance ministry sources say with the handwringing still ongoing, Athens has yet to send the letter. Without it, euro zone partners have said the retaliatory decision to freeze short-term debt relief measures \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a huge setback for Athens \u00e2\u20ac\u201c cannot be lifted. One of Monte dei Paschi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s riskier bonds has tumbled in value today, in another sign that investors believe its \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn cash call will fail. That capital raising exercise ends tomorrow afternoon; if it hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t attracted enough support, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government might then step in and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbail in\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 some bond holders, making them share the cost of a rescue. Back in Italy, shares in Monte dei Paschi bank have taken an almighty dive - only to bounce right back up again  . They initially slumped by 18% in a panicky selloff, as news broke that the bank might run out of liquidity within four months. BUT then they rallies sharply, after Italian MPs approved plans to borrow an extra \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20bn to fund bank bailouts (potentially starting with Monte dei Paschi) It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear, though, that shareholders would be left with much if the Rome government is forced to intervene -- which is why shares are down 99.8% from their record high.... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tax receipts have risen by 4.4% this financial year, or \u00c2\u00a317.8bn, to \u00c2\u00a3421.8bn. That helped to pull borrowing down since April -- but not by enough to prevent the national debt hitting record highs. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), is concerned that the UK tax take isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t growing faster: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Government borrowing in November, while higher than expected, was still marginally lower in annual terms. Despite the slight improvement, debt levels remain unsustainably high. \u00e2\u20ac\u01532017 is likely to be a challenging period for the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances, with economic growth likely to soften, which will hamper the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to generate tax receipts. The more flexible approach to deficit reduction announced in the Autumn Statement is a sensible step given the broader uncertainty. However, the acid test for the Chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new fiscal rules will be whether they are able to reverse the ongoing shortfall in tax revenue, which has persistently hampered previous attempts to reduce the deficit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chancellor Philip Hammond may find some Christmas cheer in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances. Even though the deficit was higher than expected, Britain seems to be on track to hit the (new) budget targets which were announced in November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s autumn statement. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153welcome news\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for Hammond. Reassuring news for the Chancellor as the public finances saw modest improvement in November compared to a year earlier \u00e2\u20ac\u201c thereby keeping the government on track to meet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or even slightly undershoot - its upwardly revised target for 2016/17 contained in November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Autumn Statement. It would have been somewhat embarrassing if the first set of public finance figures after the November Statement had immediately put question markets over his new fiscal targets. Howard has also crunched through today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data, and reports that: There was a slowdown in growth in tax receipts in November, primarily due to income tax related receipts dipping 1.1% year-on-year. ONS data show that employment growth has slowed recently, although it needs to be borne in mind that the tax data can be erratic from month to month, partly depending on when exactly the receipts come in. It is also notable that national insurance contributions were up 6.3% year-on-year. VAT receipts were up 4.4% year-on-year in November and corporation tax receipts were up 22.9% year-on-year, which points to still resilient economic activity. City experts aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s net borrowing spiked to \u00c2\u00a312.6bn last month, up from just \u00c2\u00a34.2bn in October. Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The outlook for the UK heading into the new year is a rather bearish one and investors are unlikely to be flying in with both feet as uncertainty continues to swirl. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The gap between UK government spending and income has risen sharply in November, raising a number of red flags with investors who will interpret this as a sign that a significant economic slowdown is coming in the new year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Chancellor Philip Hammond has announced the final spring budget for early March where he will attempt to plan for an uncertain future, with the triggering of Article 50 set for later that month. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If borrowing levels continues to rise at this rate, Hammond may not have too much room for manoeuvre when setting out his fiscal policy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This chart, from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances, shows how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national debt hit a new record high in November - up to \u00c2\u00a31.655bn from \u00c2\u00a31.641bn in October. And this chart shows how net borrowing this financial year has fallen by \u00c2\u00a37.7bn, compared to 2015-2016. Newsflash: Britain borrowed more than \u00c2\u00a312.6bn to balance the books in November. The public sector net borrowing requirement (excluding the impact of our state-owned banks) came in at \u00c2\u00a312.647bn. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s around \u00c2\u00a3400m ahead of City expectations but lower than the \u00c2\u00a313.2bn borrowed in November 2015. And it pushes the national debt up to \u00c2\u00a31.655 trillion, a new record high, equivalent to 84.5% of GDP. More to follow... If the public\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation expectations are accurate, then pay packets are going to be eroded by rising prices in the next few years. This chart from the Resolution Foundation shows how real wages could start falling in 2017, as inflation overtakes nominal pay growth: Eek..... Now this is interesting.... three of the six policymakers at Sweden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Riksbank voted against extending its QE programme by six months. One deputy governor wanted a smaller QE boost, while two more opposed any extension. That forced governor Stefan Ingves to use his casting vote to get today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision through. Shares in Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Monte dei Paschi (MPS) have just been temporarily suspended in Milan after plunging over 8%. The selloff was triggered, I think, by a Reuters report showing that MPS is burning through its \u00e2\u201a\u00ac11bn cash reserves faster than expected. It is now on track to run out of funds in four months time, rather than having almost a year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth of liquidity. Reuters said: Monte dei Paschi said it now expected its net liquidity position, currently standing at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10.6bn, to turn negative after four months. On Sunday the bank had forecast that a current net liquidity position, which was of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac11bn, would turn negative after 11 months under a number of assumptions. Remember, MPS must find \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn of fresh capital by the end of this month. Newsflash from Stockholm: Sweden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has voted to leave interest rates at their current record low of minus 0.5%. The Riksbank has also extended its asset-purchase scheme by another six months, to maintain its current expansionary monetary policy. The pound is dipping in early trading, down 0.25% against the US dollar to $1.2334, and 0.4% against the euro to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.185. The US dollar itself is edging away from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 14-year high, but remains strong -- possibly too strong, given the political uncertainty in America. Jeremy Cook of World First says: Once again, we have to think that the market is irrationally exuberant heading into the New Year and while the economic side of the new politics is being fully priced in \u00e2\u20ac\u201c US and Chinese stimulus \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the political side of the economics \u00e2\u20ac\u201c policy mistakes and antagonistic trade stances \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are not. The dollar has made an impressive run but our minds keep circling back to the inauguration of Donald Trump on January 20th as a possible turning point. Markets like to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbuy the rumour and sell the fact\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and the swelling of asset prices, the dollar and inflation expectations could be a monster version of this trading plan. We cannot be sure until Trump is in the White House and that is in a month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. Have City traders clocked off for Christmas already? European stock markets have barely shifted in early trading, and are hovering close to their highest level in 11 months. In London, the FTSE 100 has risen by 4 points, or 0.07%. Some breaking news: Britons are expecting inflation to pick up speed over the next few years, according to a new survey. Reuters has the details: The British public\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term expectation for inflation rose to 3% in December, a more than two year high, according to a closely watched survey by polling company YouGov. The survey for U.S. bank Citi showed that in December, people on average expected inflation in 5-10 years to reach 3%, the highest level since September 2014 and up from a November forecast of 2.8%. In the shorter term, respondents to the survey expect inflation in 12 months\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time to be at 2.43% from an earlier forecast of 2.36%. Last month, inflation picked up to 1.2% - and economists expect it to keep rising in 2017. The survey comes after a series of Brexit-inflation stories, including the row between Unilever and Tesco over the price of marmite, and price hikes by US technology firms such as Apple. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Even though its unseasonably mild, this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic data may send a shiver through the City. At 9.30am, we find out how much Britain had to borrow last month to balance the gap between government income and spending. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely to show that the deficit widened to \u00c2\u00a312.2bn in November, up from just \u00c2\u00a34.8bn in October. A poor reading may reignite concerns over the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances as we head towards 2017, and a likely economic slowdown. The data may put a few investors off their mince pies, with analysts at RBC Capital Markets saying: November is traditionally a seasonally difficult month for the public finances, and we see a deficit of \u00c2\u00a312bn on the public sector net borrowing (ex-banking groups) measure. Also coming up.... Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government will be pushing on with a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20bn rescue package for its banks, with time running short. Monti dei Paschi, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest lender, is making a last-ditch attempt to raise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn by selling shares to retail investors and investors. But this plan hit another roadblock last night, when the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bank rescue fund expressed concerns about a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.5bn loan that would underpin the deal. If the rescue plan fails, then the Italian state will have to step in. European stock markets are expected to dip this morning, after Wall Street hit record highs (again) last night, and the dollar hit a new 14-year high. Traders will be watching New York later, to see if the Dow Jones index can hit 20,000 for the first time (it rose to 19,974 yesterday). And at 3.30pm GMT, we get a new reading on America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil inventories - a good barometer of demand in the energy sector.",

Coupe reckons it is now the discounters on the back foot. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They are under pressure and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more challenging for them,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Coupe says.</p> <p>He says the major chains have all narrowed the price gap with Aldi and Lidl in the past year and, even where the gap hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t closed, the discounters have been forced to compress their already slim profit margins to maintain their price lead. </p> <p>Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has already spent more than \u00c2\u00a3150m on cutting prices in the past two years. </p> <p>The Christmas meal has proved a significant battleground: last year, Tesco stole a march on the discounters with cheap seasonal veg and this year Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claims it has the cheapest turkeys on the market at \u00c2\u00a33.50 a kg.</p> <p>Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is also investing in developing product areas where it believes it can differentiate itself from the discounters such as ready meals, prepared fruit or the fast growing gluten and dairy free foods. </p> <p>It has already revamped 3,000 food products, a move which it also hopes will help it fight back against the expansion of Waitrose and Marks &amp; Spencer, which has impinged on Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comfortable position as the handiest place to buy quality food. This year, 25% of its Christmas products are new and hundreds more items will be revamped next year.</p> <p>Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has already spent \u00c2\u00a360m on improving the quality of its products including \u00c2\u00a39m on its takeaway food ranges.

                "bodyText":"When Mike Coupe took over from his showier former boss Justin King as Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive in 2014, just as the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nine year-long stretch of sales growth was coming to an end, many industry observers believed he had been handed one of the biggest turkeys in the business. The rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl forced all of the big four grocers, including Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, to slash profits to fund price cuts just as they had to close stores which were surplus to requirements thanks to the rise of online shopping. However, two-and-a-half years on, despite a slight drift down in market share, Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has more or less held its own helping it to steal back its position as the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second largest grocer from a shrinking Asda. Coupe reckons it is now the discounters on the back foot. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They are under pressure and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more challenging for them,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Coupe says. He says the major chains have all narrowed the price gap with Aldi and Lidl in the past year and, even where the gap hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t closed, the discounters have been forced to compress their already slim profit margins to maintain their price lead. Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has already spent more than \u00c2\u00a3150m on cutting prices in the past two years. The Christmas meal has proved a significant battleground: last year, Tesco stole a march on the discounters with cheap seasonal veg and this year Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claims it has the cheapest turkeys on the market at \u00c2\u00a33.50 a kg. Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is also investing in developing product areas where it believes it can differentiate itself from the discounters such as ready meals, prepared fruit or the fast growing gluten and dairy free foods. It has already revamped 3,000 food products, a move which it also hopes will help it fight back against the expansion of Waitrose and Marks &amp; Spencer, which has impinged on Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comfortable position as the handiest place to buy quality food. This year, 25% of its Christmas products are new and hundreds more items will be revamped next year. Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has already spent \u00c2\u00a360m on improving the quality of its products including \u00c2\u00a39m on its takeaway food ranges. Introducing options such as porridge and cold pressed juices and improving basics by, for example, using tomatoes that will not make its sandwiches soggy, has helped to boost sales. Coupe says the strategy is working but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still tough. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have seen a significant refocusing of the mainstream supermarkets on the discounters and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s undoubtedly dampened their growth. But they are still growing because they are opening lots of shops and the threat isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to go away,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. Some argue that, given the tough environment, Coupe should be focusing on the food business, but he believes the future is in branching out. Coupe, who after stints at nearly every major grocer was seen as a safe pair of hands after the showmanship of King, has proved to be even more ambitious and bold than his predecessor. Always more interested in online retailing than King, Coupe has invested \u00c2\u00a31.4bn in buying Argos, the catalogue shop which makes half of its sales online and specialises in high speed deliveries. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I believe there is a significant opportunity in clothing and general merchandise. That market is unconsolidated and where we have relatively small market share and an opportunity for financial services,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. Coupe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy hinges on the three divisions of Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u201c its supermarkets, bank and Argos, all cross selling their goods and services to each other\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s client base while reducing central costs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the three businesses together that gives the group more flexibility, more resources and more ability to compete,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. After an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153operationally successful\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Black Friday last month, the biggest sales day of the year for Argos, Coupe says he is more confident than ever about the buyout. About 250 Argos outlets will open in Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supermarkets as part of an aim to build destination stores where, along with coffee shops, clothing areas, groceries and other services, they will tempt shoppers away from their computers. The Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Argos stores will be cheaper to operate than those on the high street where analysts believe at least 100 will close. A planned \u00c2\u00a3160m of synergies from the merger will feed through to the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bottom line as promised to the City but Coupe hints there are likely to be further financial benefits to play with. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we can generate benefits above \u00c2\u00a3160m, Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Argos have options on what we do with that and one of those is price and another is quality or more profitability. All of those are possible and the key thing is to have the options.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Coupe has promised that the combined business will grow its profit margins from 2.5% to as much as 3.5% over the next few years, clawing back the margin lost during the rise of the discounters. But some analysts argue that the Argos acquisition has only exposed Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to more risk and inflationary cost pressures. It sources more goods, such as electrical appliances, priced in dollars from the far east \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which could only increase the pain from potential cost increases caused by the 15% fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote. However, Coupe says the bigger group will be more capable of withstanding competitive pressures. It is not just about saving money. In the 10 Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stores where Argos has already opened outlets, grocery sales have been boosted by 1% to 2% while sales the catalogue outlets are seeing growth of more than 20% a year after they opened. Part of the logic for the buyout of Argos is to access its quick delivery service which Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hopes to capitalise on to sell more of its clothing and homewares and, perhaps one day, groceries. Coupe says the tie-up with Argos makes Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better equipped for the future with the likes of Amazon ploughing into the UK grocery market and online food shopping expected to rise 68% over the next five years, according to the IGD industry body. The smartphone has swiftly become the preferred tool for internet shoppers and Coupe says he expects the pace of change to be even more rapid over the next five years as new technologies and ways of shopping emerge. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The building blocks are in place. Our job is to make stuff happen as we said it would.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 This article was amended on 22 December 2016 to correct the price of Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turkeys.",

The shares \u00e2\u20ac\u201c down 85% this year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c slumped by 7.5%. MPS is under instruction from the European Central Bank to bolster its finances after it was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/29/rescue-package-in-place-as-europes-oldest-bank-fails-stress-tests\">weakest of 51 European banks subjected to stress tests</a>.</p> <p>The inability to convince Qatar to put in up to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1bn is expected to lead the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board to concede it would not be able to secure a solution to its capital gap without the Italian government.

It is also expected to have political consequences for Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s controlling Democratic party and Matteo Renzi, the former prime minister who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/11/italy-paolo-gentiloni-to-succeed-matteo-renzi-as-prime-minister\">stepped down from office earlier this month</a> after he was roundly defeated in the 4 December referendum.

With Qatar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereign wealth fund pulling out from the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn cash call, the bank now needs a state bailout to stay afloat. Under the current scenario of low interest rates, massive fines and negligible earnings, the reluctance of the private investors to take on such weak structures is understandable. The Italian parliament has vowed to inject more than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20bn into the bank, in order to prevent a collapse which would have far reaching consequences. If the bank fails, there are strong fears that its collapse could pull down much of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bad debt ridden banking sector with it.</p> <p>The bank had been named as the weakest lender in Europe because of billions of euros of risky loans, failing the EU stress test in July this year. Given this, the Italian government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts cannot end with simple state support, but rather large-scale banking reforms and stringent policy measures are needed.

                "bodyText":"All has gone quiet in Italy, so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to pause this liveblog - but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll try to pop back if anything dramatic happens. Otherwise, keep an eye on the Guardian Business page for fresh developments. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the situation right now, by my colleagues Jill Treanor and Stephanie Kirchgaessner (out in Rome): The Italian government is braced to bail out the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest bank, Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS), which is expected to reveal it has failed to win support from private investors for a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn (\u00c2\u00a34.2bn) rescue package. The board of Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third largest bank was meeting on Thursday after it failed to secure an anchor investor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c thought to be the Qatar sovereign wealth fund \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to support its fundraising effort. Shares in the bank were volatile, lifting off record lows but then falling back in confusion about the next steps. The shares \u00e2\u20ac\u201c down 85% this year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c slumped by 7.5%. MPS is under instruction from the European Central Bank to bolster its finances after it was the weakest of 51 European banks subjected to stress tests. The inability to convince Qatar to put in up to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1bn is expected to lead the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board to concede it would not be able to secure a solution to its capital gap without the Italian government. This means Italy would have to impose losses on bondholders before it could stump up cash because of new EU rules intended to stop taxpayers having to pick up the bill for bank losses. However, about \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2bn of the bonds are held by private investors and there are expectations that an arrangement would be put in place to limit their losses. The Italian cabinet is expected to convene on Thursday to discuss its options for protecting retail investors and to try to limit its eventual stake in the bank to below 50%. The bailout is not just a financial issue. It is also expected to have political consequences for Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s controlling Democratic party and Matteo Renzi, the former prime minister who stepped down from office earlier this month after he was roundly defeated in the 4 December referendum. Paolo Gentiloni has taken over as prime minister for now, but Renzi is expected to run for election again as early as next year. Wolfango Piccoli, an analyst with Teneo Intelligence, said a government rescue might not be immediately damaging politically, in large part because public attention will be diverted from the issue during the Christmas period. But the issue could become \u00e2\u20ac\u0153politically toxic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd later, once it becomes clear how many of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s junior bondholders are eventually compensated for their losses, and how long it takes for them to be paid.... Piccoli said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In terms of the junior bondholders, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s see what happens. it will eventually be decided by Brussels,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Once MPS is saved, a number of other banks could also require government support, keeping the issue in the news for the foreseeable future. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This will drag on for some time. If we have elections in May or June, it will be used then [against Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Democratic party], and there is no way to deflect that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s their full story: Shares on Monte dei Paschi (MPS) have slumped to a new all-time low tonight, as investors anticipate a state bailout for the bank. After another volatile day, they closed down 7.5% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15.08 - around 99.85% lower than in early 2007. MPS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apparent failure to raise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn in new capital means investors now expect the Italian government to step in; a move which could end up with it owning a large stake in the bank. Paresh Davdra, CEO and Co-Founder of RationalFX, says: The failure of MPS to secure \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn from an anchor investor will have far ranging implications, as the Italian government prepares for a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20bn bailout. With the Italian banking sector in an incredibly fragile state and the ongoing Deutsche Bank situation creating uncertainty in Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking system as a whole, an unsuccessful rescue effort could destabilise the Eurozone. So, what happens next with Monte dei Paschi? We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re basically waiting for the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board to conclude their meeting, and submit their request for state aid (having failed to raise the necessary \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn from private investors to strengthen their balance sheet). Then the ball is in new prime minister Paolo Gentiloni\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s court; will his cabinet meet this evening, or push the decision back to Friday? Reuters reckons it could go either way. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s their latest report: Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government will meet late Thursday or early Friday before European markets open to discuss an emergency decree to bail out troubled bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. The salvage of Monte dei Paschi would be part of a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20bn safety net that Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni plans to set up beneath the banking industry. Gentiloni said on Thursday the cabinet would meet on Friday to discuss measures to help Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s under-developed southern regions. He did not mention the banking decree, leaving open the door on a late-night meeting on Thursday. European stock markets have closed for the night, after a fairly dull day dominated by worries over Monte dei Paschi. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 gained 22 points, or 0.3%, to 7063, led by precious metals producers and defensive stocks including ITV, Whitbread and Tui Travel. Mining stocks, and banks, led the fallers. Across Europe, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB weakened by 0.5% as investors braced for the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest banking bailout in many years, while the German DAX lost 0.2% and the French CAC closed flat. Meanwhile on Wall Street, the Dow Jones has slipped a little deeper into the red, and a little further from the 20,000 point milestone. Robert O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Daly of The Economist Intelligence Unit agrees that Monte dei Paschi is heading for a state rescue, now that its attempt to raise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn from private investors has faltered. He also predicts that populist parties could get an electoral boost, if more banks require government help. O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Daly writes: We expect the state to approve the MPS board\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s request to inject capital. This will require a bail-in of junior bondholders, though the state may move to compensate retail bondholders. The government is putting in place a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20bn fund to shore up MPS and other weak banks. More broadly, we believe that addressing Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking woes would be manageable from an economic standpoint, as market estimates place the costs of cleaning up the banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bad loans at 2.5% of GDP or less. If mishandled, MPS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recapitalisation and future efforts to address other problematic banks could further inflate populist rhetoric at Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next national election campaign, following the boon for anti-establishment parties provided by the resounding \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd vote at the referendum. Over in New York, the US stock market has opened with barely a grunt. The Dow Jones industrial average has dipped by 8 points in muted trading, to 19,933. That takes it away from its record highs, and further way from the much-obsessed about 20,000 mark. Back to Monte dei Paschi.... and the Financial Times also reckons that the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board will meet later today to discuss their next move,. With MPS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capital raising push now over, the FT says: According to people close to the matter, the Italian cabinet will meet to approve the bailout of MPS late on Thursday or early on Friday, after the MPS board has requested help. The MPS board was not expected to make any statement until after the end of trading on Thursday, those people said. The FT also reports that Rome\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government will try to protect small bondholders, if there is a bailout: Due to EU rules designed to limit the hit to taxpayers, the government rescue will impose losses on MPS shareholders and junior bondholders, making them share some of the financial burden. Italian officials said that they would move to compensate some of the 40,000 MPS retail bondholders who might take a hit, though institutional investors would not be spared. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The scheme is ready\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, said one senior Italian official. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The burden-sharing principle will be respected but we will try to limit the damage to savers as much as possible. Breaking news from America: the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy grew even faster than previously thought in the third quarter of 2016. US GDP expanded by an annual rate of 3.5% in the July-to-September period, up from a previous estimate of 3.2%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the equivalent of a quarterly growth rate of around 0.85% -- much faster than Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.5% growth in the same period. This shows that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is growing at the fastest pace in two years, driven by a 3% rise in consumer spending, a 10% jump in exports, and a rise in companies restocking their inventories: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flurry of other economic data flashing across my terminal too, including the news that New orders for US-made capital goods (heavy-duty machinery, electronics) jumped by 0.9% last month (excluding aircraft sales). The number of new claims for unemployment benefit hit a six-month high of 275,000 last week. The clocks in Siena have chimed two o\u00e2\u20ac\u2122clock, which means that Monte dei Paschi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempt to raise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn from private investors has officially ended. Unless something remarkable happened in the last few hours, MPS will have failed to hit its target. As we flagged up this morning, MPS had only managed to raise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2bn, once the Qatar sovereign wealth fund declined to back the plan last night. One insider tells us that the Monte dei Paschi board will now meet to plan their next move. They could decide to ask Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government for assistance tonight, to help the bank reach its \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn target. Any rescue plan could also force losses on investors who hold MPS bonds; under European banking rules, these bondholders must be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbailed in\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, before the state can help. But the Italian government will be keen to avoid penalising the retail investors (individuals, families, small businesses...) who hold debt issued by the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest bank..... So they could look to find a way of compensating them (one theory is that anyone holding less than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac100,000 of bonds is protected, as with retail savings accounts). Monte dei Paschi isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only Italian bank in a fix. Economists estimate that Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking sector needs more than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac50bn in fresh capital, to help it tackle its bad debts. Unicredit, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest bank, got the ball rolling with a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn cash call last week, but many other lenders have not yet acted. This chart from Bloomberg shows how the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20bn set aside by the Italian government this week might not be enough: Mihir Kapadia, CEO and Founder of Sun Global Investments, argues that the sector needs deep-rooted reforms, as well as fresh capital. He writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Shares of Monte dei Paschi di Siena have fallen further as efforts to raise private capital failed at the eleventh hour. With Qatar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereign wealth fund pulling out from the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn cash call, the bank now needs a state bailout to stay afloat. Under the current scenario of low interest rates, massive fines and negligible earnings, the reluctance of the private investors to take on such weak structures is understandable. The Italian parliament has vowed to inject more than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20bn into the bank, in order to prevent a collapse which would have far reaching consequences. If the bank fails, there are strong fears that its collapse could pull down much of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bad debt ridden banking sector with it. The bank had been named as the weakest lender in Europe because of billions of euros of risky loans, failing the EU stress test in July this year. Given this, the Italian government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts cannot end with simple state support, but rather large-scale banking reforms and stringent policy measures are needed. Unless this is achieved a banking crisis looks almost inevitable. This is not just a threat to Italy, but for the larger Eurozone, the euro and the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political future.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Electric carmaker Tesla has become the latest firm to raise the cost of its products in the UK, in response to the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline this year. The company told some UK showrooms that prices will go up at the start of next month. In an email, Tesla said: We have just received some information that we need to share with you \u00e2\u20ac\u201c due to currency fluctuations we will be increasing our UK prices for custom orders by 5% on 1 January 2017.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Prices on showroom and pre-owned cars will remain fixed at current prices.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: The fog has now lifted in London, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little else to report from the City. After three hours of trading, Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial markets still seem becalmed, as people wait for Monte dei Paschi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cash call to formally end after lunchtime (2pm in Italy, or 1pm GMT). Some investors are hopeful that the saga will soon end. As LC Macro Advisors head, Lorenzo Codogno, explains (via Reuters):. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This situation has dragged on for years without a clear solution. Now a solution is in sight. My perception is that the government backstop will be welcomed by financial markets and it will be a plus for the (Italian) economy as well.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pleased that a rescue might take three whole months (see earlier post): Risk appetite remains hampered by thinner holiday trading into Christmas as well as talk of a Monte dei Paschi bailout taking a whopping 3-months to complete, taking us well beyond a supposed 31 Dec deadline for shoring up Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s knackered banks. An official announcement still eludes markets which understandably want clarity on the issue. The Financial Times flag up that some Monte dei Paschi savers have been taking money out of the bank in recent months, as its funding crisis accelerated. More here (\u00c2\u00a3). Toby Nangle, top multi-asset manager at Columbia Threadneedle, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced that the Treasury Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new inquiry into the Bank of England will crack the mysteries of monetary policy. After all, the BoE does devote plenty of time to assessing whether its measures are working. So MPs (or their staffers) may find themselves wading through long, competing theories about how interest rates and quantitative easing works. Toby tweets: But...economist Shaun Richards is encouraged that MPs have launched an inquiry into the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work: Newsflash from London: A group of influential MPs have just launched an inquiry into the effectiveness of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy since the financial crisis struck. The Treasury committee will investigate whether the Bank of England was right to slash interest rates to record lows, and buy up hundreds of billions of government bonds with new money. They will examine whether this policy has actually worked, what impact it has had on savers, house prices and struggling companies, and whether policymakers are now out of ammunition to fight the next crisis. The move follows growing criticism of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions in the crisis, most notably from prime minister Theresa May. The BoE, though, insists that it has acted sensibly to protect the economy and preserve jobs. Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie explains why MPs are now taking action: Interest rates are stuck near zero, the Bank of England has used increasingly unconventional forms of quantitative easing, and inflation has been below the two per cent target for three years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The efficacy of monetary policy or otherwise, its unintended consequences, and its prospects, need careful examination. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Treasury Committee will continue to act as a safeguard on the operational independence of the Bank. The Treasury indemnity, which underpins parts of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy, could all too easily encourage the Treasury, or politicians, to put undue pressure on the Bank. The Committee will examine the risks of that, too.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here are the terms of reference for the inquiry: The effectiveness of monetary policy in meeting the inflation target: The effectiveness of holding Bank rate near zero and whether extremely low rates can encourage more, rather than less, saving The effectiveness of quantitative easing and whether it has met with diminishing returns The scope for further expansion of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153qualitative easing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (e.g. corporate bond purchases) Whether forward guidance effectively binds the Bank to a policy course, and the desirability of doing so The unintended consequences of monetary policy The impact on asset-price inflation, the housing market and financial stability The implications for the long-term sustainability of pensions and savings income The distributional impact The impact on competition, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153zombie companies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and productivity The effects on the structure of relative prices in capital and commodity markets and the consequences for capital allocation, productivity and the trade cycle The implications of a large balance sheet and the Treasury indemnity for Bank accountability and its relationship with the government and other agencies The use of macro-prudential, fiscal and other policy to counterbalance any unintended consequences of monetary policy The prospects for monetary policy The drivers behind and prospects for low real interest rates in the UK and globally What is the significance for monetary policy of rises in bond yields since the US election? The impact and trade-offs of tightening monetary policy in the near-term Whether monetary policy is currently out of ammunition for the next crisis Options for raising the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153natural rate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of interest (e.g. fiscal policy, promoting investment) Scrap what we said about MPS buyers being in short supply -- its shares are now up 3% on the day. At this stage in proceedings, and with prices so low, we probably shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t read too much into it. Monte dei Paschi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are having one of those mornings; they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already been suspended once, after plunging over 6%: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets have dipped into the red in early, subdued trading. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no sign of the traditional \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Santa Rally\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd yet; perhaps it has been lost in the fog gripping London this morning. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx sums up the mood: Once again the main news surrounded Monte dei Paschi. With the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest bank rapidly running out of time to raise the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5 billion in capital it desperately needs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only managed \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2 billion so far, with a key Qatari investors choosing not to invest a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1 billion chunk \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it looks like MPS will be forced into a government bailout. Italy approved a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20 billion increase to its debt ceiling yesterday, freeing up money for its ailing banks, starting with Monte dei Paschi. This news has begun to drag on the rest of the European banking sector, with the likes of Deutsche Bank, Barclays and Lloyds all dipping their toes into the red after the bell. This in turn capped the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s indices, with the DAX and CAC falling 0.1% and 0.2% respectively. Update: Shares in Monte Dei Paschi have finally opened, and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re down 6.75% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15.20. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already shed more than 99% of their value in the last decade, as this graph from blogger Jeroen Blokland shows: Shares in Monte dei Paschi have failed to open at the start of trading in Milan. Buyers may be in short supply today, as they risk being wiped out if the Italian state has to bail the bank out  . Italian newspaper Il Sole 24 is reporting that the rescue of Monte Dei Paschi might take two or three months. The paper says that the details haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been worked out yet, but that MPS would initially be able to tap state guarantees to bolster its liquidity. That would help MPS avoid running out of cash, now that Qatar has declined to back its \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn cash call. A long-term recapitalisation plan would take longer; and involve MPS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s management presenting a new business plan. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Monte dei Paschi di Siena has been through a lot since it was founded back in 1472, twenty years before Columbus discovered America. And the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest bank finds itself in the undignified position of needing a bailout this morning, after efforts to persuade private investors to provide desperately needed fresh capital floundered. Monte dei Paschi di Siena admitted last night that Qatar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereign wealth fund had not been persuaded to become the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153anchor investor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to underpin its \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn cash call. So a saga that has been dragging on for months could finally be resolved today, when the cash call closes at lunchtime today. Without private sector capital, MPS is now likely to miss an end of year deadline imposed by the European Central Bank to raise fresh funds. So the Italian government is now under serious time pressure to step in and put in fresh capital itself. As we wrote last night, MPS is running out of time and options. Shares in the bank, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third largest, gyrated wildly in Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading session, plunging 18% to record lows before closing 12% lower amid rumours that the fund-raising effort would fail. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The idea that Qatar could be an anchor investor has vanished and without an anchor investor there is no demand from anyone else,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd one source told Reuters. In the last few minutes, the bank reported that it had only raised \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2bn in new capital through the debt-for-equity swap, far short of the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn target. Yesterday, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government prepared for a rescue bid by approving a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20bn fund for bank recapitalisation. Ministers have also insisted that there will be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153minimised or non-existent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd impact on savers. But shareholders, and those who hold MPS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s junior, and riskier, bonds could suffer losses. Also coming up today The Dow Jones industrial average will have another tilt at smashing through the 20,000 point mark, after faltering and falling back from record highs yesterday. We get a flurry of US economic data, including new personal consumption and durable goods orders at 1.30pm GMT, plus the latest weekly jobless report -- and a new estimate of American growth in the last quarter. And rumours continue to swirl that Deutsche Bank might be close to a settlement with the Department of Justice, over misconduct before the 2008 financial crisis.",

This is primarily due to a sharp fall in house prices in many countries, as austerity gripped the euro area.</p> <p>Importantly, the median household wealth (what a typical family owns), was just \u00e2\u201a\u00ac104,100, less than half the mean average of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac223k.

                "bodyText":"With the markets closed, City traders are now scarpering to their homes (or the shops!) to begin the Christmas break. So in that spirit, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to wrap up now. I hope you all have an excellent Christmas break. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back next week for the final push towards 2017. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a quick summary: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has continued to defy the doubters, with growth revised up to 0.6% in the three months after the EU referendum. And with growth earlier in the year revised down, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no sign of a Brexit slump. However, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current account deficit has worsened, with exports dropping during the quarter. Economists fear that the economy is still too reliant on domestic demand, as consumer spending could tail off in 2017 when inflation takes a bigger bite out of wages. Over in Italy, the prime minister has confirmed that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakest banks will be strengthened with state capital, starting with Monte dei Paschi \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whose efforts to bolster its own reserves failed this week. Paolo Gentiloni told reporters that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today marks an important day for Monte dei Paschi, a day that sees it turn a corner and able to reassure its depositors.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Two European banks, Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse, are paying more than $12bn to settle charges that they mis-sold mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the 2008 crisis. But Barclays is fighting the US Department of Justice, denying that it is guilty of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcirresponsible and dishonest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 conduct. Merry Christmas! The London stock market has just closed for the Christmas break, after a very dull session. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index gained a mere 4 points to finish at 7,068. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fairly muted reaction to the news that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy performed better that expected in the last quarter, and that the Italian banking crisis is being resolved. The markets seem to have run out of energy, after a wild year. Joshua Mahony of IG says: The lack of volumes associated with the holiday season can often bring the potential for significant volatility, yet in fact we have seen quite the opposite with the post-Trump romp largely brushed aside. With US markets having hit new all-time highs and European markets also enjoying a substantial rally over the past month, there is little complain about this year. However, with the US economy is rude health, the US stock markets reaching new territory, Donald Trump will have a tough time trying to improve on the current state of play. Looking away from the UK economy, the European Central Bank has reported that wealth inequality across the eurozone has risen since the eurozone crisis began. A new ECB survey has found that average net wealth across the euro area shrank by 10% between 2010 and 2014, to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac223,300. This is primarily due to a sharp fall in house prices in many countries, as austerity gripped the euro area. Importantly, the median household wealth (what a typical family owns), was just \u00e2\u201a\u00ac104,100, less than half the mean average of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac223k. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because so much wealth is held by the richest people. Households needed to own almost \u00e2\u201a\u00ac500,000 to squeeze into the top 10%. Wealth slumped particularly sharply in Greece and Cyprus, which both entered bailout programme, while net wealth in Germany rose by 10%. And the ECB flags up that wealth inequality appears to have increased slightly. The Gini coefficient, a frequently used indicator of overall wealth inequality, edged up to 68.5 percent from 68.0, which is within the margin of measurement error. A value of 0 corresponds to complete equality, while 100 percent reflects maximum inequality - one household owning all wealth. This could bolster criticism of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ultra-loose monetary policy, which has pumped up the value of financial assets owned by richer Europeans. But the Bank argues that without its action, unemployment would be higher and growth lower. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, is concerned that UK households will feel a squeeze next year, which could hold back growth. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his comment on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Q3\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Quarterly National Accounts brought some unexpected pre-Christmas cheer with Q3 GDP growth revised up from 0.5% to 0.6%. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Consumer spending remained the key driver of growth in Q3, but the first cut of the income data raised further question marks about how long this can continue. Real household income dropped sharply in Q3, taking the annual growth rate to just 0.3%, the weakest outturn for two years. With high inflation set to weigh further on spending power next year, the consumer is surely set to falter soon. If you dig into the meat of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP report, there are reasons to worry -- even though the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate was revised up to a punchy 0.6%. Household disposable income, for example, dropped by 0.6% during the quarter; the biggest drop in almost three years. And the widening current account deficit (see 10.10am) is another concern. Richard de Meo, managing director of Foenix Partners, says the report shows a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdiverging\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 economy: Very strong performance in the services sector, the sharpest rise in employee compensation in 3 years and outperformance in construction and industrial production are then firmly offset by very weak figures in household disposable income, continuing declines in business investment and a widening of the current account deficit. The diverging performance of multiple sectors of the economy simply mirrors the uncertainty that Brexit prospects are imposing on the UK outlook, with pockets of robust growth continuing to be frustrated by much bigger questions relating to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future. The UK government has warned that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy faces challenges, despite growing faster than thought in the last quarter. A Treasury spokesperson doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually mention the Brexit negotiations, but I think we know what they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re hinting at. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the official response: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The fundamentals of the UK economy are strong, but there remain challenges ahead. The Chancellor set out, in the Autumn Statement, his plan to support a resilient economy that works for everyone by driving productivity and supporting working people, while maintaining fiscal discipline.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report into the UK economy has good news for workers; compensation paid to employees rose by 4.5% in Q3. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the biggest rise since 2013, suggesting robust pay growth over the summer. But..... business investment only rose by 0.4% in the quarter (revised down from 0.9%), which means it was 2.2% LOWER than a year earlier. That indicates that firms did rein in their spending over the summer, after the Brexit vote. Worryingly, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current-account deficit has widened in the last quarter, as the country continues to import much more than it exports. The difference between money flowing into the UK, and out, jumped to \u00c2\u00a325.5bn in July-September. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the equivalent of 5.2% of the entire economic output this year, close to the record deficit recorded in 2013. This deterioration is mainly due to weaker trade -- Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit jumped from \u00c2\u00a311bn in Q2 to \u00c2\u00a316.7bn in Q3, according to the ONS. Total UK exports decreased by 2.6% in the July-September quarter, while imports increased by 1.4%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s despite the slump in the pound, which is meant to help exporters by making goods more competitively priced. The ONS says: Exports of goods decreased by 5.1% in Quarter 3 2016, due mainly to a decrease in exports of aircraft, chemicals and unspecified goods. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all good news, though - the ONS has revised down its estimate of UK growth in January-March to +0.3%, from +0.4%. Growth in the second quarter of 2016 has also been trimmed, from 0.7% to 0.6%. So, the UK economy grew just as fast in the three months after the EU referendum than in the three months after it. But overall, the economy is a little smaller than we thought. NEWSFLASH: The UK economy grew faster than we thought in the three months after the Brexit referendum. The Office for National Statistics has just revised up its estimate for UK GDP in the third quarter of 2016. It now reckons that the British economy expanded by 0.6%, not the 0.5% previously reported. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pretty decent rate of growth, especially given the uncertainty created by the EU referendum. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the ONS has revised up service sector growth (the largest part of the UK economy) in the last three months to 1.0%, from 08%. And the City can take the credit, with output from the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153business services and finance industries\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd growing faster than expected. Darren Morgan, Head of GDP, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Robust consumer demand continued to help the UK economy grow steadily in the third quarter of 2016. Growth was slightly stronger than first thought, though, due to greater output in the financial sector.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The ONS also says that industrial production only contracted by 0.4%, not 0.5%, while construction sector output has been revised from -1.1% to -0.8%. More to follow! Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flurry of banking news has spared us from the usual pre-Christmas slump. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets explains what you need to know: Firstly, overnight news that Monte dei Paschi is set to receive state aid as part of a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20bn package to keep the bank and troubled peers afloat is something of a relief, even if it does involve taxpayer funds and represents a big d\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00a0 vu, having already been rescued in recent years. It allows savers to have a quieter break following an eventful week that saw the bank struggle and ultimately fail to raise funds privately. Now it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a question of what price institutional bondholders have to pay and what sort of compensation retail investors will be offered to ensure the bailout follows new EU rules preventing the bill for state aid being unfairly pinned on taxpayers and that the deal is more politically palatable. It also remains to be seen how long the process will take. Talk yesterday of it taking several months to complete is a worryingly long time, allowing unhappy investors to brood and savers take flight, potentially making the current situation even worse. Veloce! News from the US overnight makes for a mixed bag with continental behemoths Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse settling with the Department of Justice (DoJ) for pre-crisis mis-selling of mortgage backed securities (MBS). The former settled for $7bn (only half payable in cash) which is just half the $14bn challenge that shook markets this summer, something considered to be US retaliation for the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call on Apple to repay Ireland \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn in back taxes. Credit Suisse settling for $5bn for similar allegations makes it two out of three. However a pre-Christmas hat-trick eludes the DoJ with UK giant Barclays refusing to give in, viewing claims against it as disproportionate to misdemeanours committed. Considering itself liable for just $1bn, it was happy to settle for $2bn, however, talks have broken down. The DoJ clearly wants more. Deutsche bank shares +3.7% suggests relief at a good result and the affair being closed. Credit Suisse shares flat implies an acceptable deal. Barclays -0.3% indicates some uncertainty about what it eventually ends up paying. However there is no panic. If anything, the standout performer this morning is the bank that has yet to be mentioned. The DoJ wants to fine Royal Bank of Scotland $12bn for its own MBS mis-selling. Its shares are +1.8% on a combination of optimism that it too could settle for half, like Deutsche, although gains may be capped by the prospect of the DoJ taking a dislike to Barclays pushing its luck and decides to make life difficult for the UK City experts are relieved that Italy has finally taken the plunge and agreed to provide \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20bn in emergency liquidity guarantees and capital injections for its banks. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also some exasperation that Rome didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do this years ago (Britain, for example, pumped money into its financial sector back in 2008). Jacopo Ceccatelli, head of Marzotto SIM SpA, a Milan-based broker-dealer, told Bloomberg \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Overall it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good news; finally we are heading toward a solution,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Italy is doing now what other countries have done many years ago to sustain their banking system.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Francesco Confuorti, chief executive officer of Milan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Advantage Financial, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A nationalization should have been done five years ago. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The bank lost time, money and credibility seeking to keep the patient on life support when he was in an irreversible coma.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Barclays is one of the biggest fallers on the FSTE 100 this morning, shedding 0.8%, after being accused of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcirresponsible and dishonest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 practices by the DoJ last night. Unlike many of its rivals, including Deutsche and Credit Suisse, Barclays is fighting charges of mis-selling mortgage backed securities. It has issued a statement to the City, saying: Barclays rejects the claims made in the Complaint. Barclays considers that the claims made in the Complaint are disconnected from the facts. Barclays will vigorously defend the Complaint and intends to seek its dismissal at the earliest opportunity. Shares in Italy banks have jumped by 1.2%, on relief that the Rome government has pledged to strengthen the sector with state help, starting with Monte dei Paschi. Now this is interesting... shares in Royal Bank of Scotland have jumped by 2% at the start of trading in London. RBS is still locked in negotiations with the DoJ over its role in the mortgage-backed securities scandal (which should be familiar to anyone whose seen or read The Big Short, for example). Investors will be concluding that RBS may not be fined as much as feared, given Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s success in haggling the DoJ down from $14bn to $7bn. Shares in Deutsche Bank have jumped by over 4% at the start of trading in Frankfurt, to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac18.50. That confirms that the $7bn settlement agreed with the DoJ for mis-selling toxic securities is much less than investors had feared. Three months ago, Deutsche\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares plunged below \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10, the lowest in decades, after news broke that the DoJ was demanding $14bn. Analyst Dan Davies reckons that leak may have rebounded on the US authorities, who were criticised for taking too tough a line over the scandal. The bailout of Monte dei Paschi is an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153important day\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the bank, says Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new prime minister. After approving the decree that will pave the way to prop up the banking sector, Paolo Gentiloni told reporters that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today marks an important day for Monte dei Paschi, a day that sees it turn a corner and able to reassure its depositors.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s British CEO, John Cryan, will surely be pleased to have finally settled with the US authorities - and for roughly half the $14bn bill he faced at one stage. Chris Wheeler, analyst at Atlantic securities told the Today programme that: I think the $14bn was always posturing position by the DoJ.... The CEO [John Cryan], a very organised individual, can say that box is now ticked. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flurry of fines, settlements and bailout deals are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good news\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the European banking sector, says Naeem Aslam, analyst at Think Markets. He points out that Deutche\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lengthy negotiations with the DoJ had worried the City. Credit Suisse resolved its issue with Department of Justice over mis-selling of mortgage securities. Similarly, Deutsche Bank has also struck a deal with the Department of Justice in relation to their mortgage-backed securities issue. Deutsche bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement is less than what the bank feared and this is music to investor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ears. The amount of $14 billion which was initially expected by Deutsche could have put the bank under a lot of strain. Its stocks plummeted as the bank waited for a result, as traders were not confident about the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to carve out a deal. Under the agreement with the DOJ, the total cost will be $7.2 billion. This figure consists of $3.1 billion in penalty fees and $4.1 billion which the bank needs to refund to its consumers. Italian market regulators have suspended trading in Monte dei Paschi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares and bonds, following the news that it will be bailed out by the state. The Italian government is likely to end up owning a large stake in MPS, while some bondholders will be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbailed in\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to help fund the rescue deal. Good morning. Christmas has come early for bank watchers, with a packed stocking full of crucial developments on the final day before the festive break. Overnight, the Italian government has given its approval for a state bailout of troubled Monte dei Paschi, after the bank failed to raise funds from private investors. Paolo Gentiloni, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new prime minister, announced in the early hours of Friday that his cabinet had agreed to the rescue and would be dipping into a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20bn fund that had already been approved by the parliament earlier this week in the event that MPS needed to be saved. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: In another dramatic, and long-awaited development, Deutsche Bank has finally agreed a $7.2bn settlement with the US Department of Justice for misselling mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the 2008 crisis. The German lender will pay a $3.1bn civil penalty and also provide $4.1bn in compensation to consumers. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much less than the $14bn which the DoJ had originally proposed, and which had raised fears over Deutsche\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial strength. Swiss bank Credit Suisse has also settled with the DoJ; it will pay a $2.48bn penalty plus handing back $2.8bn to consumers. Late last night it emerged that the DoJ is also taking Barclays to court, after the UK lender denied similar charges of bundling up home loans and selling them on. City editor Jill Treanor explains: The US department of justice has accused Barclays of jeopardising the financial position of millions of American homeowners over a decade-old mortgage bond mis-selling scandal. The DoJ is now taking the bank to court, in what was thought to be the first time an institution had failed to reached a settlement with the US authorities over the sale of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) in the run-up to the banking crisis. Responding to the news on Thursday night, Barclays said it would fight the case. Loretta Lynch, the US attorney general, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Financial institutions like Barclays occupy a position of vital public trust. Ordinary Americans depend on their assurances of transparency and legitimacy, and entrust these banks with their valuable savings.... As alleged in this complaint, Barclays jeopardised billions of dollars of wealth through practices that were plainly irresponsible and dishonest. With this filing, we are sending a clear message that the department of justice will not tolerate the defrauding of investors and the American people.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the development and reaction, as the City heads into its final trading session before Christmas (trading ends at lunchtime, hurrah!). At 9.30am we get a new estimate of UK GDP in the third quarter, which will give more details of how the economy performed in the three months after the Brexit vote. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably confirm that the economy expanded by 0.5% in the quarter.",

Silver producer Fresnillo leapt 5.2%, gold miner Randgold gained 4.8%, while mining giant BHP Billiton rose 4.2% and Anglo American picked up 3.5%. Major international firms benefited from the weak pound, which fell to a two-month low of $1.222 against the US dollar. With just two sessions to go, the FTSE-100 has now gained 13% since the start of 2016, despite a series of market shocks including the Brexit referendum result and the US election. That rise means the worth of the 100 most valuable companies listed in London has jumped by about \u00c2\u00a3230bn this year. Mining shares have been the star performers in 2016, after suffering major losses in 2015 when commodity prices crashed. This year, the prices of oil, iron ore, copper, nickel and coal have all risen, as fears that China would suffer an economic \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hard landing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd have eased. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vow to rebuild America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highways, schools and airports has also driven up commodity prices. Anglo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have almost quadrupled in value this year, highlighting how 2016 has been the best year for mining companies since 2009. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, says mining firms have made a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remarkable comeback\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd over the past 12 months. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Small losses are the order of the day across most stock markets today, but London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s traders have evidently come back from Christmas with a festive bounce in their step. The FTSE 100 is the star performer today, helped on its way higher by an excellent turn from the index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mining contingent,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Beauchamp explains. Energy stocks also gained ground, after the price of oil traded near one-year high. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets said shares were boosted by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gains by oil and optimism regarding what Trump can do for the economy following his inauguration in a few weeks time.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd David Cheetham, market analyst at online trading group XTB, said shares typically rally in the quiet period at the end of a year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Observers of the markets have for many years noticed a strong propensity for stocks to rise in the period between Christmas and the New Year and this phenomenon appears to be playing out once more,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Cheetham said. These increases are known as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Santa rally\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by City workers. The FTSE 100 is now just 23 points shy of its all-time intraday high, set in October. The index has gained 12% since the EU referendum in June, despite fears that a vote for Brexit would derail the economy. However, the FTSE 100 is priced in sterling, which has tumbled by 17% against the US dollar. This has made Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s companies particularly attractive to US investors, helping to push up share prices. The FTSE 250 index, which contains medium-sized UK companies, also rose on Wednesday, gaining 0.5%. But it is only up 3% for 2016, substantially lagging the internationally-focused FTSE 100. Wall Street was unable to follow the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead by setting its own record highs. The Dow Jones industrial average faltered in morning trading, dropping by 0.4% to 19,863, dashing hopes that it might finally crash through the 20,000 point mark for the first time ever. Some investors are also bracing for fresh volatility in 2017, with a Trump presidency and the triggering of formal Brexit negotiations likely to rock markets next year. A survey of top City economists and fund managers found that 40% expect the pound to be languishing below $1.20 in a year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK economy has held up relatively well in the short time since the referendum, although without clarity on the blueprint for exiting the EU, the longer-term consequences are still open to debate,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Chris Saint, currency analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, who conducted the survey. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Exchange rates are determined by the interaction of a diverse range of political and economic factors, including interest rates, inflation and growth, all of which are up for grabs in 2017, which is likely to make for lively currency markets in the coming year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd",

Meanwhile, Bovis Homes is down over 5%, dragging the housebuilder sector with it, as it issues an unexpected warning on completion levels.</p> <p>It is always tough to issue a profit warning, but doubly so in the fallow period between Christmas and the New Year.

                "bodyText":"Right, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my news story about the FTSE 100 hitting a new record high tonight, for anyone just tuning in. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow for more live coverage of events in the markets and the world economy. Thanks, and goodnight (and enjoy the holidays, if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not back at work yet...). GW Wall Street is failing to match the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead. Shares are dropping back, so the Dow Jones is down almost 100 points at 19,847. That suggests that the Dow is not going to hit the 20,000 mark today. At least that gives us something to watch out for tomorrow. This is what I was banging on about earlier -- the FTSE 100 is actually down 6% this year if you measure it in US dollars (rather than up 13% in pounds). The London stock market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally has helped to drive up the wealth of the richest in society, as well as boosting the value of pension funds and other asset managers. Indeed, 2016 has been a vintage year for the ultra-rich - despite the backlash against populism this year (or perhaps helping to trigger it). Bloomberg has calculated that the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s billionaires are ending the year owning $237 billion more than on January 1st. Some of the most famous, including Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, did particularly well \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nice to remember that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re donating much of their wealth to charity. It was a turbulent year, though, with the US election, the Brexit vote, and various other shocks and panics meaning fortunes fluctuated over the last 12 months. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: The World\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Richest Made $237 Billion This Year With excellent timing, Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s JP Spinetto has highlighted how the British pound has been one of the worst-performing currencies this year. Sterling has shed 17%, which puts the 13% jump in the FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value this year into some context. This chart of the FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best-performing shares shows how mining stocks drove the market to tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record close: But property firms fell, after housebuilder Bovis warned on profits early this morning after failing to build as many homes as planned. With just two trading days to go, the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mining sector in on track for its best year the aftermath of the financial crisis. The Telegraph\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tara Cunningham explains: London-listed miners are poised for their biggest annual gain since 2009 as firmer oil and commodity prices pushed the sector higher. So far this year, the FTSE 350 mining index has rallied by 102%. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s her full report. Ruth Lea, economic adviser at Arbuthnot Banking Group, points out that the FTSE 250 index of smaller UK firms has also rallied since June: City traders often talk about a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Santa Rally\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd this time of year, and once again the markets have provided. David Cheetham, market analyst at online trading group XTB, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Observers of the markets have for many years noticed a strong propensity for stocks to rise in the period between Christmas and the New Year and this phenomenon appears to be playing out once more.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (thanks to the Press Association for the quote). Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 record high comes 20 months after the previous historic closing level. That closing high, in April 2015, was followed by a sharp summer selloff triggered by fears over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. This was compounded by concerns of a global slowdown in December 2015 when the US central bank raised interest rates for the first time in a decade. But shares then recovered from February this year, and even the Brexit vote was only a blip in the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s march back over 7100 points. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally means the FTSE 100 is now 12% higher than on the day of the EU referendum in June. That means that the value of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest listed companies jumped by 12% in sterling terms since the vote. But... the pound is down by 10% against the euro since June, and around 17% weaker against the US dollar. NEWSFLASH: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has hit its new all-time closing high, driven by strong gains in the mining sector. The blue-chip FTSE 100 just closed 37 points higher at 7106.08, beating the 7103.98 point mark set in April 2015. Mining companies drove the rally, on hopes of robust US economic growth next year. That sent the prices of copper, oil, etc up today, along with precious metals producers. Silver miner Fresnillo and gold producer Randgold both gained around 5% today, followed by BHP Billiton (+4.2%) and Rio Tinto (+3.3%). Internationally focused companies also benefitted from the weaker pound today, as it makes their exports more competitive. However, housebuilding shares suffered following this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit warning from Bovis Homes (which ended down 5.2%). Chris Beauchamp, Chief Market Analyst at IG, says London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s traders came back from Christmas with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a festive bounce in their step\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The FTSE 100 is the star performer today, helped on its way higher by an excellent turn from the index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mining contingent. The sector was one of the really big winners in 2016, making a remarkable comeback over the past twelve months, and it makes sense to think that investors are looking to juice a few more points out of the rally as the year-end approaches. Meanwhile, Bovis Homes is down over 5%, dragging the housebuilder sector with it, as it issues an unexpected warning on completion levels. It is always tough to issue a profit warning, but doubly so in the fallow period between Christmas and the New Year. The sector has gone from being a star performer in recent years to one of the hardest hit since Brexit; miners were the contrarian play for 2016, so the same could be said of a housing sector still supported by healthy demand and constricted supply. As flagged earlier, though, there is one proviso -- the FTSE 100 is priced in sterling, so today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record high has not been adjusted for the fall in sterling since the Brexit vote. Right, the FTSE 100 has entered its closing auction.....so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find out any moment if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hit a new all-time closing high. Back in the City, the FTSE 100 is hovering around its highest ever closing level in late trading. The index is up 31 points at 7099, having earlier burst over its record closing level (7103.98). So we might get a new record high in around 30 minutes.... The Dow has now dropped into the red, down 23 points at 19,921, as the 20k mark proves a hurdle too far..... We haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen the Dow hitting 20,000 points yet, but we have had the next best thing -- a group of pets helping to ring the opening bell on Wall Street. Best Friends Animal Society had the honour of opening the session, to highlight their work preventing dogs and cats at America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shelters being put down. And the group delighted traders by turning up with several impeccably behaved pooches, as this video shows. The Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early rally is fizzling out, after just 20 minutes of trading. Rather than powering over the 20,000 point mark, the benchmark index has subsided back to its opening levels - like a Christmas diner who over-indulged on the mince pies and rather fancies a quiet day. US stock market watchers are bracing for another day of tension.... The Dow is rising at the start of trading... up 29 points to 19,974, and bringing the 20k landmark even closer. And the tech-heavy Nasdaq index has hit a new all-time high at the open, as the Trump Rally continues to drive shares higher. The opening bell is ringing on Wall Street, and traders are squinting at their screens to see if the Dow Jones will hit the 20,000 mark for the first time ever.... Tensions is building on Wall Street as traders wonder whether the Dow Jones industrial average could smash through the 20,000 point mark today. Last night, the Dow ended the day just 55 points shy of this new record. And the futures market suggests that the index could open higher at 9.30am local time (2.30pm GMT). Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says: Thee Santa rally for the equity market continues and every single day investors hope that the DOW index breaks that 20K mark, but so far their wish has not been granted. The 20K mark for the Dow has become a remarkable resistance and a break of this, could attract fresh capital. The London stock market isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only one rallying today. Overnight, the Australian ASX 100 index jumped by 1% to its highest level in 2016, also thanks to demand for mining company shares. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, analyst at London Capital Group, explains: Australian stocks hit the highest levels of this year and are set for a strong close on the back of higher commodity prices and firm appetite in global stock markets following Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory in the US presidential election. The FTSE 100 is rising partly because the pound is falling. Sterling remains at a two-month low against the US dollar, which pushes up the value of international firms listed in London. The euro is also losing ground against the dollar, down almost one cent at $1.0397: This chart shows how the FTSE 100 is back at April 2015\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record closing level, in sterling terms anyway (ignoring the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall against the US dollar since the Brexit vote) Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue-chip index of the biggest listed companies has just crept above its alltime closing high. In quiet trading, the FTSE 100 has risen by 35 points to above 7104 points, driven up by mining companies. That takes the index a whisker over the previous record closing high, of 7103.98, set in April 2015. This also puts the Footsie close to its highest ever level -- the all-time intraday high of 7128 points recorded in October. We should note that trading volumes are really rather thin, with many traders still off for Christmas (having banked their profits/losses for the year). And these figures don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take account of the slump in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote. But still, it illustrates that investors are anticipating a US fiscal stimulus package next year. Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong American consumer confidence figures, which were the best in 15 years, have also bolstered sentiment, helping to push up the price of copper and oil today. BHP Billiton, which produces iron ore, copper, coal and gold, is leading the risers with a 4.3% gain, with silver miner Fresnillo close behind, followed by fellow mining giants Anglo American (+4%) and Rio Tinto (+3.5%). Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Equities are posting small gains amid thin intra-holiday trading that is maintaining the Santa Rally into year-end. The FTSE is boosted by higher oil prices supporting the commodities space, offsetting weakness among some big defensives, airlines (Airbus problems) and real estate (rates to rise and prices to fall in 2017?) Sterling has fallen to its lowest level since late October, as it ends the year on a weak note. The pound has dropped by 0.4% this morning against the US dollar, to $1.223. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no obvious trigger for the move, which comes as City experts predict further losses next year. A new survey by financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown found that a majority of respondents expect the sterling/US dollar rate to end 2017 at lower than $1.25. Some 40% predicting steeper declines to under $1.20. Many of those polled predicted that the US dollar could rally, if Donald Trump pushes through a new fiscal stimulus plan. One respondent says: Full implementation will likely [lead to] a second material leg higher of the US dollar as the Fed is priced to react to inflationary pressures such a package would bring. However, implementation of President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s protectionist and isolationist rhetoric would narrow the breadth of any dollar rally, with the Japanese yen and the euro the beneficiaries.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Other forecasters, though, think the pound has been oversold, and could bounce back once Brexit negotiations begin. Stockbroking firm Numis is hopeful that Bovis will get back on track next year, despite missing its housebuilding targets for 2016. They say: Bovis has announced that due to production delays and the deferral of 180 completions into 2017, it now anticipates full year results to be c11% below Numis expectations. We are leaving 2017 estimates unchanged reflecting the expected completion of the deferred units and a better position with regard to planning and production. The drop in UK mortgage approvals last month could be a sign that the property sector will struggle next year. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight believes that prices could actually fall, after several years of strong increases. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his reaction to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BBA report: We believe the fundamentals for house buyers will progressively deteriorate during 2017 with consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 purchasing power weakening markedly and the labour market likely softening. Increasing economic uncertainty is also likely to weigh down on consumer confidence and willingness to engage in major transactions such as buying a house. Housing market activity and prices are also likely to be pressurized by stretched house prices to earnings ratios and tight checking of prospective mortgage borrowers by lenders However, the downside for house prices will be limited markedly by a shortage of houses for sale. On balance, we suspect that house prices will be essentially flat over the year. Indeed, we believe that a small drop in house prices in 2017 is just as likely to occur as a small rise. BREAKING: The number of new mortgage approved in the UK fell last month, in another sign that the property sector is slowing. High street banks approved 40,659 new loans for home purchases in November, down from 40,835 in October, and 9% lower than a year ago. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also rather less than City expectations -- some economists expected as many as 41,400 new loans to be approved: The British Bankers Association also reports that gross mortgage borrowing fell by 5% compared to November 2015, to \u00c2\u00a312.2bn. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key slide from the BBA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly report: The report also shows that consumers are continuing to borrow to fund their shopping. The BBA says: Consumer credit annual growth fell back in November to around 6% despite strong retail sales. Growth continues to be supported in the case of personal loans by favourable interest rates. Bovis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure to hit its sales targets this year could be a sign that the UK housing sector is now suffering from the Brexit vote. Analyst Russ Mould of stockbrokers AJ Bell says: A profit warning from FTSE 250 firm Bovis is another crack in the wall when it comes to the house builders sector.... Bovis has today stated that legal completion volumes will rise by just 1% to 2% in 2016 year, rather than the targeted 5% as the sale of 180 homes has slipped from this year to next, owing to slower-than-expected build production in December. This means completion volumes fell by 1% to 2% year on year in the second half, raising questions as to whether the market is slowing down in a post-Brexit world after all. Even if Bovis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 average selling price rose 10% to around \u00c2\u00a3255,000 for the year that again implies a marked second-half deceleration, as prices rose 14% to an average of \u00c2\u00a3254,500 in the first six months of this year. Management guidance for pre-tax profits of between \u00c2\u00a3160 million and \u00c2\u00a3170 million implies a 10% miss relative to the analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 consensus of \u00c2\u00a3184 million at the mid-point and that helps to explain why the shares are down 4% this morning at the opening. Despite Bovis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes, the London stock market has risen slightly in the first trading day of the week. The blue-chip FTSE 100 has gained 15 points to 7084, led by mining companies such as BHP Billiton (+4%) and Anglo American (+3%). Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jump in US consumer confidence to the highest level since 2001 is fuelling hopes for robust economic growth in 2017, which would drive demand for copper, iron ore, nickel and the like. Shares in UK housebuilders are falling in early trading, following Bovis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unscheduled warning on profits. Bovis fell over 5%, followed by rival building firms Crest Nicholson (-1.7%), Berkeley Group (-1.6%) and John Laing (-1.3%). Traders must be worried that Bovis isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only company to experience a slowdown last month. Financial journalist Daniel Coatsworth points out that Bovis weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expected to released results until early January. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more reaction: Newsflash: One of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest housebuilders has warned that it will fail to sell as many homes as planned this year. Bovis Homes has sent an early shiver through the chilly City of London, by reporting that production was slower than expected this month. That means Bovis will sell around 180 homes less than expected, which will make a dent in its profits for the year too. In a statement to the City, Bovis warns: We expect the volume delivery for 2016 will be lower than previously anticipated at between 3,950 and 4,000 homes, the exact number depending on the extent of legal completions in the remaining days of the year. We have experienced slower than expected build production across the Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sites during December, resulting in approximately 180 largely built and sold private homes which were expected to complete in 2016 being deferred into early 2017. Bovis now expects to bank pre-tax profits of around \u00c2\u00a3160m to \u00c2\u00a3170m for 2016 -- compared with \u00c2\u00a3160.1m in 2015. Analysts had expected around \u00c2\u00a3183m, so the City will be disappointed. Reaction to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial workers are making their way back to their desks through the fog this morning, after a four-day Christmas holiday. Hopefully everyone had a lovely break, even though fears over what the future will bring may have dampened the atmosphere over the turkey and trimmings. In particular, the prospect of a new president in the Oval Office, and Britain triggering the process of exiting the European Union, is worrying many UK executives. The Chartered Management Institute is warning this morning that a majority of managers in the UK believe Brexit-related uncertainty will hold back economic growth in 2017, with many also expecting long-term economic damage. My colleague Katie Allen explains: In a survey of 1,118 managers, the CMI found 65% were pessimistic about the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic outlook for the next 12-18 months. Their caution over 2017 followed what appeared to be a tough year for many organisations, when only 39% said they had grown, the lowest proportion since 2012 when the shockwaves from the eurozone debt crisis hit the UK economy. A further 39% said business levels had stayed roughly the same in 2016 and 22% said their business had declined. Asked about the impact of Brexit on economic growth in the next three to five years, 49% thought it would be negative. But a sizeable 37% believed leaving the EU would have a positive impact on the UK economy and 14% said it would have no impact. The findings follow signs that businesses are becoming more nervous about hiring and investing as Brexit negotiations approach. Companies and individuals have also become more concerned about costs because the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp fall since the referendum has made imports such as fuel and food ingredients to the UK more expensive. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: Also coming up today At 9.30am, the British Bankers Association will report how many new mortgage loans were approved in November. Economists expect a small rise, from 40,851 to 41,100, despite that Brexit uncertainty. European stock markets are likely to be fairly subdued, after a thin trading day yesterday. Wall Street was also open on Tuesday, but the Dow Jones index again failed to smash through the 20,000 point mark even though US consumer confidence jumped to a 15-year high. The figures underline how the US economy has strengthened this year. However, a certain someone thinks he should get the credit.... We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

Sell everything ahead of stock market crash, say RBS economists In January economists at RBS issued an apocalyptic warning that stock markets could crash by 20% and oil prices slump to $16 a barrel. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sell everything except high quality bonds,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd they said. China could be the crisis point, they argued. Their numbers were wrong but they were right when they said it would be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cataclysmic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd year. Just as well they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know then about Brexit and Donald Trump. 4. UK credit rating downgraded after Brexit vote In the turbulent aftermath of the EU referendum result, as the pound hit 31-year lows and shares tumbled again, Britain was stripped of its last AAA credit rating. Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downgraded the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditworthiness to AA, with a negative outlook. The agency said Brexit would hit growth and had weakened the predictability, stability and effectiveness of policymaking in the UK. 5. Richest 62 people as wealthy as half of world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s population Oxfam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual analysis of how global wealth is (not) shared always makes grim reading. Its analysis in 2016 was timed to coincide with the gathering of many of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s superrich at Davos, and the figures laid bare the vast gap between rich and poor. The charity called for urgent action to tackle the growing inequality that saw the wealth of the poorest half of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s population drop by 41% between 2010 and 2015, while the wealth of the planet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest 62 people jumped by $500bn to $1.76tn. 6. Pound hits $1.30 as property funds are frozen The fallout from the Brexit vote continued to reverberate through the markets, as City property funds barred investors from withdrawing their cash and the Bank of England said risks to the financial system had begun to crystallise. The then chancellor, George Osborne, held a summit with the heads of the major high street banks, who pledged to avoid a new credit crisis by making loans available. 7. Pound and shares rally after two days of record Brexit losses Shares in London and around the world rebounded in volatile trading after three traumatic days that wiped an unprecedented $3tn off global markets. As he called for a second referendum to be held, the Virgin boss, Sir Richard Branson, said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153thousands and thousands\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of jobs would be lost in Britain as a result of Brexit. 8. Lagarde urges speedy Brexit deal as pound hits new lows The IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s managing director, Christine Lagarde, called for clarity on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit plan \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sooner rather than later\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That was two weeks after the referendum. Six months on, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still waiting. The leading economist Mohamed El-Erian, meanwhile, piled on the pain for the battered pound, saying it could slump to parity with the dollar. 9. Cafes serving drinks with 25 teaspoons of sugar a cup One sugar \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 or 25? A shocking report from the campaign group Action on Sugar found that 98% of the 131 hot flavoured drinks found in the big high street chains would carry a red warning if they were forced to label them. Some hot chocolate and other trendy chai drinks contained staggering amounts of sugar, up to 25 teaspoons, in one serving. 10. NatWest paves way for introduction of negative interest rates Nat West bank raised the spectre of negative interest rates, telling its business customers it might have to charge to accept deposits. The bank, which is part of the Royal Bank of Scotland and so owned by the taxpayer, issued its warning in a letter changing the terms and conditions for its 850,000 business customers, which range from self-employed traders to clubs, charities and large corporations.",

                "bodyText":"The FTSE 100 may have been toasting a new closing peak, but elsewhere in Europe shares were drifting lower, with banking stocks proving a drag on markets. The final scores in Europe showed: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.21% to 11,451.05 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.2% lower at 4838.47 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.18% to 19,203.94 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.19% at 9327.1 But in Greece, the Athens market added 0.15% to 636.67 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is drifting away from the 20,000 level and is currently down 18 points at 19,815. Meanwhile, after initially shrugging off an unexpected rise in US crude inventories, oil prices have edged marginally lower, with Brent now down 0.37% at $56.01 a barrel. As for the FTSE 100, it has hit a record high for the second day running, so here is our story giving the background to Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new peak: On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow for the last trading day of the year. It looked a bit unlikely as the FTSE 100 drifted lower for much of the day, but the leading index managed a last minute dash to a new closing high. The index ended 14.18 points higher at 7120.26, within sight of the all time record reached on 11 October this year. With gold and silver prices moving higher, precious metal miners such as Randgold Resources and Fresnillo helped push the index into record territory. Meanwhile the more UK-focused FTSE 250 added just 2.61 points to 18,015.42 and is some distance away from its own peak of 18,607 achieved in early October. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has dipped lower - down around 7 points - while the FTSE 100 has shied away from a new closing high and is now 4 points lower. On the Dow, Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: After yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisive turn lower for US markets there has been little sign of fresh bullish momentum. Barring a miracle, Dow 20,000 looks off the cards, although the rebound in the index over the past year, as in other US markets, has been astounding. Only time will tell if the Trump euphoria can be sustained, or whether we are due another correction early on in the New Year. Oil prices are little changed following the release of the latest US data, with Brent crude up 0.5% at $56.50 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate more or less flat at $54.03. US crude stocks showed a surprise rise last week, according to official figures. Inventories rose by 614,000 barrels to 486m compared to forecasts of a 2.1m barrel decrease, according to the Energy Information Administration. But gasoline stocks fell by 1.6m barrels rather than the expected 1.3m barrel increase. Despite the Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reluctance to surge towards 20,000, the FTSE 100 has just edged into positive territory. Could we yet have a new closing high? US markets are mainly edging ahead in early trading, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average regaining a little ground after Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s triple digit decline and moved another step closer to the so far elusive 20,000 barrier. The Dow is currently up 36 points at 19869 while the S&amp;P 500 opened marginally higher and the Nasdaq composite marginally lower. Oil is holding steady ahead of the latest US inventory figures from the Department of Energy. On Wednesday the American Petroleum Institute reported a surprise 4.2m barrel increase in weekly US crude stocks compared to an expected fall of 2.1m barrels. But ahead of the official DoE figures, Brent crude is up 0.44% at $56.47 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate is 0.18% lower at $53.96. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters on the US data: A drop in U.S. exports last month pushed the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit in goods higher while the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell last week in a positive sign for the labor market. The two reports released on Thursday suggested that when Donald Trump becomes president next month, the labor market will likely be at roughly full strength and international trade could be weighing on the economy. In an initial estimate that does not include trade in services, the Commerce Department said America exported $1.2 billion less in November than in October. Imports rose by $2.2 billion during the month. The full trade report for November is due on Jan. 6... Separately, initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 265,000 for the week ended Dec. 24, the Labor Department said. It was the 95th straight week that claims were below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market. That is the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller. The department said in a statement there were no special factors affecting claims last week although estimating the data can be more difficult around holiday periods. The department said the actual number of claims was estimated by government staff for 10 states. More on the US trade gap, from Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief US economist: Gracious me, we have TWO little pieces of economic news. Firstly, America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit has swelled by 5.5%. New figures from the Commerce Department show that the US trade gap widened to $65.3bn in November, up from $61.9bn in October. Exports shrank by $1.2bn to $121.7bn, while America imported $187bn of stuff, $2.2bn more than in October. Secondly, the number of Americans filing new unemployment claims has fallen by 10,000, to 265,000. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s broadly in line with forecasts, and shows that the US labour market remains resilient. That will reassure the US Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates earlier this month. As it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quiet, what better time to catch up with the biggest business stories of 2016? We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve crunched the numbers, and found that the Brexit vote, and the US election\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impact on the markets, were the most popular issues this year. Our daily liveblog did well again too - so thanks to all readers for keeping our numbers up :) Fiona Walsh, business editor of Theguardian.com, explains: Six of our 10 most-read articles covered the aftermath of the shock EU referendum result, from the trillions wiped off global markets to the plummeting pound and the prospect of negative interest rates. There was Donald Trump too, of course, and an apocalyptic warning from economists in January to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sell everything\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd before a new crash. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full 10 Ten: I fear America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bring much excitement today either. The futures market is suggesting Wall Street will open little changed, in 90 minutes time, after the S&amp;P 500 fell by almost 0.9% yesterday (its biggest drop since the US election). Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, has now criticised the European Central Bank for demanding that Monte Dei Paschi raise more new capital than previously planned. Gentiloni told reporters that he got the news on Christmas Day - which may have rather spoiled the turkey and sprouts. And Gentiloni wants to see the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s workings out, echoing finance minister Padoan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns. Reuters has the story: The European Central Bank should discuss with Italy the reasons behind its assessment that Banca Monte dei Paschi had a greater need for capital than previously thought, Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said on Thursday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is important that the motives for this assessment are shared in discussions in the coming months,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Gentiloni told a news conference. He added he had been surprised on December 25 to receive news that the regulator wanted Monte Paschi to plug a capital shortfall of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac8.8bn, higher than a previous estimate of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn. Pier Carlo Padoan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism of the ECB comes as Italian banking shares post fresh losses today. UBI Banca, Unicredit and Banca Popolare di Milano are all among the biggest fallers on the Stoxx Europe 600 banks index (which tracks Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stocks). Investors are edgy that the cost of recapitalising the Italian banking sector may be going up, after the ECB demand that Monte Dei Paschi raises more capital than expected. Over in Italy, finance minister Pier Carlo Padoan has lashed out at the European Central Bank over its handling of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest bank, Monte Dei Paschi (MPS). Earlier this week, the ECB told MPS that it needs to raise almost \u00e2\u201a\u00ac9bn in new capital, sharply higher than the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn which it had tried, and failed, to attract from private investors. Rome\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government is now stepping in to rescue MPC, and Padoan sounds rather unimpressed that the bill had gone up. Speaking to financial newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore, Padoan said the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new demands would leave MPS \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hyper-capitalised\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He also criticised the Frankfurt-based central bank for not explaining its thinking more clearly: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It would have been useful to receive additional information from the ECB Supervisory Board on the criteria used for such a valuation, since it has consequences for the other banks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In addition to a letter of five lines and three numbers, some explanation would have been useful; opaque moves without an explanation lead people to think that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something wrong behind it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd MPS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liquidity position has been worsening in recent months, with some savers taking money out of the lender. More here: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointingly quiet out there.... There may still be time for another Santa Rally! After a festively slow start, the FTSE 100 has roused itself after its 8am selloff, and crept back to 7106 points - last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record closing level. Trading is still pretty quiet, with many City workers still enjoying a Christmas break. Many mining stocks are still in the red today, following commodity prices down. And banks across Europe are under pressure, partly due to worries over Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking bailout. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, analyst at London Capital Group, says the markets are being cautious after commodity prices retreated in Asia overnight, meaning: A combination of profit-taking and risk-off is weighing on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 100 largest caps in London. She also suggests the US stock market could fall, if the latest trade and unemployment figures, due at 1.30pm, miss expectations. The US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s November trade balance and the weekly jobless claims are due out today. Any disappointment could cause a further disillusion regarding the US recovery and encourage a deeper correction in the US markets, given that there is room for significant pullback following the relentless, two-month rally in the US stock markets following Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appointment as the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 next president. Is London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s house price boom fizzling out? Prices in the capital only rose by an annual rate of 3.7% in in the last quarter, compared to a UK average of 4.5%, according to new figures from the Nationwide building society. This is the first time since 2008 that London prices have lagged the national average (although obviously houses are still much pricier than elsewhere). Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, expects prices to rise by 2% in 2017, although there is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a greater degree of uncertainty than usual\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The story of UK house price growth in 2016 was one of relative stability. Annual house price growth ended 2016 at 4.5%, the same as the rate recorded in 2015. There were signs that London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s significant period of outperformance may be drawing to a close.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Nationwide also reports that a typical first-time buyer in London would have to be in the top 90th percentile of earners (ie, one of the best paid 10% of the population), while in the North typical buyers are in the top 30th. Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent, says this is a serious concern: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcLondon clearly has suffered more in the price stakes than elsewhere in the country, a reverse of what we were seeing earlier in the year and for most of 2015. But for us it is the steep fall in number of transactions and market accessibility, which remains a challenge particularly for first-time buyers, rather than the ups and downs of prices which is more important. More here: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been another torrid day for Toshiba. Shares in the Japanese manufacturer tumbled by 19% in Asian trading, following losses of 20% on Wednesday and 12% on Thursday. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump was driven by continued fears that the company faces a massive charge relating to the purchase of a nuclear construction business called Stone &amp; Webster a year ago. Toshiba shocked investors earlier this week by admitting that it may have to write off several billion US dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgoodwill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, having bought Stone &amp; Webster for $229m. Analysts are concerned that the full cost is still unknown; last night, Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slashed Toshiba\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating and warned that the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s operating and financial performance could deteriorate. More here: Money is flowing out of shares and into bonds this morning. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign that investors might be taking a safety-first approach ahead of the New Year break. So bond prices are up, pushing yields (interest rates) down to their lowest levels in several weeks: Precious metals producers Randgold and Fresnillo are leading the risers in London, both up over 2%. But other mining firms are dropping back, with Rio Tinto and Glencore both down over 1%. Mining stocks had driven yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally, but are now suffering from falling commodity prices today (steel and copper prices have both dipped). The pound has bounced back from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two-months low, rising 0.25% to $1.225. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s helping to pull the FTSE 100 down (as a weak pound is good for internationally focused firms) Having closed at a record high last night, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is subsiding at the start of trading. The blue-chip index dropped by 35 points, or 0.5%, in early deals to 7074 points. Other European markets have also dipped, as the selloff on Wall Street last night casts a shadow. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets explains: US markets stumbled yesterday as investor optimism cooled and hopes faded of the Dow Jones hitting 20,000 before year-end. However volumes remain light and this doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean the 2016 election fuelled rally is done with. It may just be taking a well needed breather. The biggest fallers in London are BT and Dixons Carphone, which has gone \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcex-dividend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 this morning (you had to own the shares last night to receive the next payment to investors) Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It could be another red letter day in the City. The FTSE 100 closed at a record high last night, and traders are now wondering if the index could smash through its all-time intraday high today. The omens aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t great, though, with spreadbetters predicting small falls this morning as investors book profits before the year end. The FTSE 100 is expected to drop by 27 points at the open, having closed at 7106 last night. The alltime high is 7129 points. Later today, America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dow Jones industrial average could have another tilt at the fabled 20,000 point mark. Yesterday it fell by 111 points - only its second triple-digit decline since last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential election, suggesting the rally may be fading. On the economic front, the City will be digesting new house price figures from Nationwide, which show prices jumped by 0.8% in December (more on that shortly). At 1.30pm, we get the latest US trade figures, and the weekly unemployment numbers. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll keep an eye on Italy, for any developments in its banking bailout. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day.....",

The record came as the index hit a closing high for the third day in a row.</p> <p>The index rose 14.4% over the course of the year, adding \u00c2\u00a3232bn to the value of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top companies and marking its best annual performance since 2013.</p> <p>It came despite the shocks of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/24/ftse-100-and-sterling-plunge-on-brexit-panic\">the Brexit referendum vote</a> and Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election, and a slump to 5,499 in February on concerns about a slowdown in the global economy, particularly in China.</p> <p>The rise was driven by mining companies and overseas earners, which dominate the leading index. The FTSE mining index has jumped 100% over the year, with Anglo American the best performer, up 287%. Signs of recovery in China and the prospect of new infrastructure spending by the incoming US administration sparked the revival, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/10/pound-continues-to-fall-against-dollar-and-euro-amid-hard-brexit-fears\">the 17% slump in the pound since the Brexit vote in June</a> has benefited those companies that earn their money overseas.

Over the course of the past two weeks the emollient Euclid Tskalatos has had to use all his gifts of diplomacy to not only pacify euro zone partners of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good intent, but persuade them that under stewardship of the left the debt-stricken country is far from bent on colliding with the institutions keeping it afloat. </p> <p>This the Oxford-educated economist did in a pre-Christmas letter that sought to dispel any notion that a bonus for low-income pensioners was more than a one-off and suspension of a VAT tax for Aegean isles (those, like Lesbos, on the frontline of the refugee crisis) would apply for longer than 2017. This letter appeased Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors enough for them to resume talks on short term measures that by 2060 would cut Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt burden by around 20 percentage points. </p> <p>But this week Tskalatos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 mollifying has been eclipsed by other mixed signals that Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 leftist-led coalition has also sent out: signals that could dash government hopes of the country returning to capital markets, and being included in the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quantitative easing program, in early 2017.</p> <p>On Wednesday, minister of state Alekos Flambouraris - prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 mentor and one of his closest aides - insisted that the government wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hesitate to hand out bonuses again if it also managed to secure a budget surplus next year.

France will also face an important political test when it holds its presidential election in spring 2017. National Front leader Marine Le Pen will be trying to take advantage of the positive momentum she has built up to sweep her party to its first victory. While this would require a vast \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and unlikely \u00e2\u20ac\u201c swing from voters, recent events remind us that the rise of anti-establishment parties globally is not one to be underestimated.

First of all, high levels of debt (Europe has an average debt-to-GDP ratio of 90% versus the 60% target of the Stability and Growth Pact) are forcing most European countries to rein in spending rather than increase it. Second, not having the ability to print money at an individual country level in the European Union (EU) requires each member to demonstrate even more fiscal discipline for the union to remain viable.</p> <p>For those mainstream European political parties wishing to claw back votes from their more extreme rivals, the challenge is therefore as follows: to improve the living standards of hundreds of millions of Europeans, while preserving the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s balance sheet.

                "bodyText":"The City of London has officially shut down for another year. Traders are heading to their favourite pubs and wine bars to mark the FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record high, and to ponder what perils and delights 2017 bring. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely to be another white-knuckle ride, with Trump in the White House, Marine Le Pen trying to become French president, China battlign to avoid a hard landing, and Britain facing the sticky problem of negotiating an exit from the EU. That will probably add up to more market volatility -- this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gentle trading will soon be just a memory. Until then, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a summary of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s events, by my colleague Nick Fletcher: The FTSE 100 has ended a tumultuous year at an all-time high, boosted by a surge in mining companies and dollar earners and hopes of a spending spree by US president-elect Donald Trump. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue chip index closed a shortened trading day at 7,142.83, up 22.57 points, beating the previous peak of 7,129.82 set in October. The record came as the index hit a closing high for the third day in a row. The index rose 14.4% over the course of the year, adding \u00c2\u00a3232bn to the value of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top companies and marking its best annual performance since 2013. It came despite the shocks of the Brexit referendum vote and Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election, and a slump to 5,499 in February on concerns about a slowdown in the global economy, particularly in China. The rise was driven by mining companies and overseas earners, which dominate the leading index. The FTSE mining index has jumped 100% over the year, with Anglo American the best performer, up 287%. Signs of recovery in China and the prospect of new infrastructure spending by the incoming US administration sparked the revival, while the 17% slump in the pound since the Brexit vote in June has benefited those companies that earn their money overseas. Over the year, sterling has fallen 16.5%, its worst performance since the financial crisis in 2008. But in dollar terms the FTSE 100 was actually down 5% over the year, owing to the decline in the pound. Analysts at KPMG said the performance of FTSE 100 companies with more than 70% of their market outside the UK was up 20% over the year. But those with 70% of their business in the UK were down 6%. KPMG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Yael Selfin said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Put in pounds and pence, this equates to a \u00c2\u00a3226bn rise in the value of the KPMG Non-UK50 and a \u00c2\u00a324bn loss for their domestic equivalent.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Despite Brexit, the FTSE 100 was the best-performing European market, as continuing worries about the eurozone, the banking problems in Italy and the prospect of elections in Germany and France next year limited gains. Happy New Year to all our readers, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see you in 2017. GW Over in Greece, 2016 is closing with the standoff between Athens and its creditors seemingly put to rest...but with no certainty that 2017 will finally resolve the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great economic crisis. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a busy time for the Greek finance minister. Over the course of the past two weeks the emollient Euclid Tskalatos has had to use all his gifts of diplomacy to not only pacify euro zone partners of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good intent, but persuade them that under stewardship of the left the debt-stricken country is far from bent on colliding with the institutions keeping it afloat. This the Oxford-educated economist did in a pre-Christmas letter that sought to dispel any notion that a bonus for low-income pensioners was more than a one-off and suspension of a VAT tax for Aegean isles (those, like Lesbos, on the frontline of the refugee crisis) would apply for longer than 2017. This letter appeased Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors enough for them to resume talks on short term measures that by 2060 would cut Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt burden by around 20 percentage points. But this week Tskalatos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 mollifying has been eclipsed by other mixed signals that Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 leftist-led coalition has also sent out: signals that could dash government hopes of the country returning to capital markets, and being included in the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quantitative easing program, in early 2017. On Wednesday, minister of state Alekos Flambouraris - prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 mentor and one of his closest aides - insisted that the government wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hesitate to hand out bonuses again if it also managed to secure a budget surplus next year. The alternate defence minister soon followed saying Athens would extend the special VAT exemption into 2018 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153if the refugee crisis continues, and in my opinion it unfortunately will.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Adding to the confusion, the government then announced that far from ruling out similar solidarity measures, Tskalalotos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 letter \u00e2\u20ac\u0153opens the ways for similar ones in the future.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The doublespeak has enhanced speculation that Greece could be heading for elections if Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 financial resuscitation plans don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come to pass. This week an MRB poll showed that 63 percent of Greeks believed snap polls were likely in 2017 mostly because of growing differences between Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 administration and creditors. Prognostications are a mugs game. But of one thing we can be sure: the Greek crisis will continue \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and we will be here to report it! European stock markets are ending 2016 with something of a whimper. The Stoxx 600 index, which tracks the 600 biggest listed companies in Europe, has lost around 1% this year. This chart, from Bloomberg, shows how European shares slid sharply in January and February (when worries over China rocked market), and then had a nasty dose of Brexit-itis in the summer. Another way of looking at things.... UK share prices have also benefitted from the largely robust economic data since the Brexit vote on June 23rd. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew by 0.6% in July-September, matching the growth rate in the three month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s before the referendum. This refusal to buckle under the uncertainty created by Brexit has encouraged the City to pile into shares. Yael Selfin, head of macroeconomics at KPMG UK, explains (via Reuters) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The latest GDP figures point to a strong UK economy which has probably accounted for some of the pick-up in equity prices overall since the referendum.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to sound alarmist, but the last time the FTSE 100 hit a record high on the last day of the year was 1999. That was swiftly followed by the dot-com crash, and a major slump in shares - with the FTSE 100 not recovering its losses until 2015. Tony Cross, communications director for the Social Stock Exchange (SSX), remembers it: On the upside, this rally is good for pension pots: Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, predicts that markets will be lively next year - especially as the US has just expelled a bunch of Russian diplomats: With Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foot already out the door, it is clear that he is happy to speak out against the likes of Israel and Russia without fear of dealing with the repercussions. What is not clear is how things will pan out once the pro-Russian Trump comes into power. Should Trump immediately reverse this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s measures, it would not only say that he places little confidence in his own security services, but also shows that Russia can essentially do what they want without the chance of being reprimanded. US futures have edged off overnight highs..... It looks like a quiet end to a very busy year, but 2017 certainly promises to be just as eventful. The pound and the FTSE 100 have largely moved in opposite directions since Britain voted to leave the EU: (thanks to PA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ian Jones) The Press Association also point out that the slump in sterling since the Brexit vote has driven shares up: The pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall, triggered by Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to quit the EU, has proved beneficial for multinational companies listed on the index as many tend to benefit from earnings in currencies - such as the US dollar - which are stronger than sterling. On Friday, sterling slumped further against the euro, falling 0.1% to 1.16 euro. The pound was up 0.5% against the dollar at 1.23. Sterling remains 18% down against the greenback and 11% lower versus the euro since the Brexit vote in June. Or in other words.... Mining companies had a great year. Share prices across the sector doubled in 2016, as the prices of commodities such as iron ore, copper and nickel rallied. The FTSE 250, which includes smaller UK-focused companies, ended 2016 up 3.7% for the year. The FTSE 250 is seen as a better gauge of the UK economy than the international giants that make up the FTSE 100. But it is also flattered by the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tumble against other currencies since June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum. NEWSFLASH: The FTSE 100 has closed for 2016 at a new record high, after sudden last-minute rally. The blue-chip index gained 22 points, or 0.3%, to finish at 7142 points. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a new intraday high, and its third closing high in as many days. This means the FTSE has rallied by 14.4% this year, in spite of the political turbulence at home and abroad. We should keep in mind that the index is priced in sterling; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still down around 4% in US dollar terms. Details and reaction to follow.... BOOM! The FTSE 100 just hit a new all-time high. It touched 7132 points, as City traders make one final push before the close of trading. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just above the previous intraday high of 7129, and means the index has risen around 14% this year. With 10 minutes to go until the closing bell, the FTSE 100 is recovering its early losses! The blue-chip index is now UP 2 points on the day, at 7122. If it ends over 7121, it will be a new closing high - the third in as many days... The Bond Vigilante team at M&amp;G reckon 2017 will be a testing time for Europe, as public anger about austerity bubbles away. They write: Nowhere have the subjects of fiscal austerity and rising inequality been as relevant as in Europe today. Stubbornly high unemployment rates combined with declining living standards have contributed to rising levels of civil and political instability over the past year. Populist and nationalist parties have been able to capitalise on this phenomenon and raise massive amounts of support from exasperated European citizens. In Spain, for example, a caretaker government had to be put in place after two consecutive presidential elections failed to designate a clear winner. France will also face an important political test when it holds its presidential election in spring 2017. National Front leader Marine Le Pen will be trying to take advantage of the positive momentum she has built up to sweep her party to its first victory. While this would require a vast \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and unlikely \u00e2\u20ac\u201c swing from voters, recent events remind us that the rise of anti-establishment parties globally is not one to be underestimated. Equally, traditional polling methods seem to struggle to capture the swing to the hard right that is underway. These mounting pressures could not come at a worse time for Europe, whose 2017 political schedule looks particularly packed... The extra difficulty for Europe is that its capacity to boost growth and employment via increased public and infrastructure spending and tax cuts is more limited than other economies, for two main reasons. First of all, high levels of debt (Europe has an average debt-to-GDP ratio of 90% versus the 60% target of the Stability and Growth Pact) are forcing most European countries to rein in spending rather than increase it. Second, not having the ability to print money at an individual country level in the European Union (EU) requires each member to demonstrate even more fiscal discipline for the union to remain viable. For those mainstream European political parties wishing to claw back votes from their more extreme rivals, the challenge is therefore as follows: to improve the living standards of hundreds of millions of Europeans, while preserving the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s balance sheet. This can only be achieved by implementing the right mix of pro-growth structural reforms, but some tough times could still lie ahead. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a small part of their predictions for 2017, which they say will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a whole new ball game\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Worth a read. Investors will be toasting their successes this weekend, or grumbling bitterly about having backed the wrong horses. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the best place to put your money this year, despite the FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 13% leap. Brazil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market outperformed all rivals this year, according to Bloomberg data. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite staggering, given the country has suffered a historically bad recession, rising unemployment, plus political turmoil and the impeachment of former president Dilma Rousseff. Investors are betting that Brazil can claw its way back to growth, and that Rousseff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s successor, Michel Temer, will push through structural reforms. Richard Stone, chief executive of stockbroking firm The Share Centre, has stuck his neck out with three predictions for 2017. He reckons that the UK economy will outperform expectations, leading to the first interest rate rise since the financial crisis. Stone says: Unemployment remains low and employment is at near record levels. The boost from Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s devaluation will continue to feed through \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly for exporters to the EU who still have unfettered access to the single market but with substantially lower pricing in Euro terms. Inflation will rise, in part as a function of the impact of weaker Sterling, but also as a result of the relatively tight labour market. Without substantial changes in productivity this will likely start to feed through into higher wages. In Europe, he expects populist parties to increase their support - but not win power in Germany, France or the Netherlands. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The level of disaffection in Europe is just as strong as it is elsewhere in the world, but the political and voting systems are very different. This means that those expressions of discontent are less likely to have the same success as they did in the binary choices that were presented by the Brexit and US Presidential Election votes. In particular the coalition nature of politics in the Netherlands and Germany, along with the run-off process for the French Presidential election, mean that although extremist politicians may make advances their ability to gain power is limited \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so I would not expect any great surprises. And he fears that US relations with China will deteriorate under president Trump: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153January will see the inauguration of President Donald Trump and we will then start to see how his policy pronouncements play out. In the US the power of the President is constrained by the checks and balances inherent in the system, particularly in Congress. However, the President still has significant sway on foreign policy and trade. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Relations with China \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if the current mood music is to be believed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c may become more difficult. This in turn could impact trade. Conversely relations with Russia may soften which might alleviate some of the political tensions currently on the global stage. Stone also suspects Beijing may have to devalue the renminbi next year in an attempt to stimulate growth, which might cause market volatility (as it did in August 2015). The FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s merry upward romp has been welcomed by eurosceptics as a sign that the economy is in good shape following June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum. Conservative MP Michael Gove (who campaigned for Vote Leave, and was rewarded with demotion to the back benches), tweeted last night that the Footsie had hit a record high \u00e2\u20ac\u0153despite Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It would be more accurate to say that the rally is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbecause Brexit thumped the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. As this chart shows, the FTSE 100 is still down 5% this year when priced in US dollars (the light blue line): 2016 has been a vintage year for the oil price. Brent crude prices have jumped by 53% this year, while US crude prices are up 46% - the biggest jump since 2009. For once Opec can take the credit. The oil cartel put its bickering behind it this year, by uniting behind an agreement to cut production by over one million barrels per day. That has lifted Brent crude to $57.05 per barrel this morning, which I fear will soon feed through to higher prices at the pumps. The year is ending on a subdued note, with the main European stock markets all in the red. The FTSE 100 is down 20 points from last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record close, at 7100 points, in extremely light trading. And Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Stoxx 600 has dropped 0.15%, meaning it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on track for its first annual loss since 2011. The latest deterioration in relations between Washington and Moscow will surely encourage investors to sit on the sidelines today, and see how Vladimir Putin responds to the expulsion of 35 diplomats. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says: Fresh geopolitical fun and games are taking centre stage with Obama taking a final swipe at Russia before he leaves office. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has just closed for the year, down 12%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actually quite a recovery since the wild plunges in early January, which forced regulators to suspend trading altogether a few times. The other European stock markets have lagged behind the FTSE 100 this year. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB has lost 10% during a year dominated by worries over its banks, and a political crisis. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX gained 6.4% while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC rose by 4%. The Europe-wide Stoxx 600 index dropped by 1.6%. This multicoloured tweet from Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Atul Prakash shows how each index has performed every year since 2000: (That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the FTSE 100 on the top, then the Stoxx 600, the Dax, the CAC, and finally the FTSE MIB) Apologies, I might have forgotten to turn comments on the blog this morning (or they turned themselves off!). Anyway, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on now. We shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget that the FTSE 100 has also benefitted from the slump in sterling this year since the Brexit vote. The Footsie is packed with internationally focused companies; a cheap pound makes UK exports more competitive, and also raises the value of overseas earnings. So while the FTSE 100 is up 13.8% this year, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actually down over 5% when priced in US dollars. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Lorcan Roche Kelly wrote the definitive analysis on this issue recently.... Mining stocks have played a major role in driving the FTSE 100 up this year. The mining section of the FTSE 100 has jumped by 100% this year, helped by a recovery in commodity prices after a torrid 2015. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its best performance since 2009. Anglo American, for example, has almost quadrupled in value since January 1st. Miners are benefitting from optimism about the global economy next year, and the prospect of Donald Trump boosting US infrastructure spending. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index is on track to post its biggest annual gain in three years. Despite the political shocks that rocked markets this year, the blue-chip index has gained 13.8% since January 1st. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its best performance since 2013, when it gained 14.4%, and follows two years of losses. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t plain sailing through. Having begun January at 6,242 points, the Footsie slumped to 5,536 by mid-February, as global markets were spooked by Chinese slowdown fears. It then recovered, before a wobbly June - the index crashed by 6% after the EU referendum. But the FTSE 10 soon bounced back and we saw further gains in the summer and autumn. Finally, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock election win sparked a late rally, as this chart shows: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve nearly made it! After a turbulent 12 months, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just one more trading session to go until we can consign 2016 to history and face the worst that the new year can throw at us. Given that includes President Trump, the Brexit negotiations, and key elections in France and Germany, we might not want to rush into 2017 too enthusiastically, of course. But right now, City investors are hoping that the global economy could shrug off these concerns and strengthen next year. That helped the FTSE 100 to hit closing record highs on Wednesday and Thursday, and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chance we could see a hat-trick today. The opens aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t great, though -- the blue-chip index has dropped by a few points at the start of trading, having closed at 7120 last night. The all-time intraday high, incidentally, is 7129 points, so well within reach if City traders get all excitable. Trading ends at 12.30pm chaps, so get those orders in fast. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day, and looking back at the best and worst of 2016.",

                "bodyText":"The price of Brent crude tumbled below $30 per barrel for the first time in 13 years at the start of 2016 as worries over a supply glut intensified. The lifting of sanctions on Iran in January meant the oil producer could ramp up crude exports into a market already awash with supplies thanks to high production from US shale oil and the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec). But prices recovered as the year progressed on signs of diminishing stocks and on growing expectations Opec would limit output. An agreement to cut supplies was reached at the end of the year between Opec and a number of non-members, sending oil to a 17-month high above $57. The price is up 54% over the year. A tumultuous year in global politics boosted demand for gold \u00e2\u20ac\u201c seen as a safe haven in troubled times \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and sent its price soaring for much of 2016. Appetite for gold was also boosted by low interest rates. Investors could get little or no return on cash and other assets that pay interest and so instead sought out investments such as gold. The precious metal lost some of its shine after markets digested Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory and the prospect of big government spending and interest rate rises in the US. As the US dollar and bond yields eased off in the final days of 2016, gold got a small fillip, ending slightly higher over the year as a whole. The pound has tumbled since the EU referendum, hitting 31-year lows this year. A US interest rate rise in December led the dollar to extend gains against sterling. The pound is down around 17% against the dollar since the Brexit vote. Conversely, the FTSE 100 share index has soared to record highs. Much of the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise has been down to the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness: many of the firms listed report in dollars and so their earnings are flattered by the currency movements. The weak pound also encourages international investors to pick up UK-listed stocks and other assets such as property. The US stock index has soared to new highs in 2016, flirting with the 20,000 level. Worries about a potential wave of protectionism under president-elect Donald Trump have been more than offset by Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hopes that huge infrastructure spending and deregulation will boost the US economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in the short-term at least. Since the election, banks have been among the top risers on US stock markets, helped by rising interest rates and expectations that Trump will relax regulations. The Baltic Dry index is looked to for early warning signs of trouble for the global economy. It measures dry freight costs for commodities such as coal, rice and wheat and, when it drops, economists start worrying about a slowdown in world trade and, by extension, in global economic activity.
