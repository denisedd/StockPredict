                "bodyText":"Right, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. A quick recap. December has got off to a lively start in the financial markets, with big moves in the commodity and foreign exchange arenas. Traders have driven the oil price sharply higher for the second day running. Brent crude has hit its highest level since October 2015, jumping by almost 5% to $54.31 per barrel. Despite questions over compliance, yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Opec deal is being seen as a real game-changer that could push prices higher - meaning fresh inflationary pressures and higher prices at the petrol pumps. The pound has also romped higher today, after Brexit minister David Davis offered the tantalising prospect of the UK paying to access the EU single market. The comments, made in parliament, fuelled hopes that Britain might avoid a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Sterling hit two-month highs, before dipping a little -- and is currently up 0.5% at $1.257. Government bonds have also sold off today, driving up the yield on benchmark US debt. UK borrowing costs also rose, with the yield on 10-year gilts up from 1.5% to 1.51%. And European stock markets have closed in the red: FTSE 100: down 30 points at 6752, -0.45% German DAX: down 106 points at 10534, -1% French CAC: down 17 points at 4560, -0.4% Investors are fretting about Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Italian referendum on constitutional reforms, and Austria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential election (between a far-right candidate and a Green). Get swotting up now! Over on Wall Street, machine and equipment firm Caterpillar briefly suspended its shares today so it could warn that analysts profit expectations are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctoo optimistic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Caterpillar cited various headwinds, such as Brexit uncertainty, Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slow recovery and volatility in the oil price. It also warned that any infrastructure programme from Donald Trump probably wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help its earnings in 2017. This is the key slide from its presentation to analysts: Caterpillar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price has been rising for weeks, on speculation that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to upgrade America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highways, airports and schools will mean more demand for its diggers and trucks. But Wall Street isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too worried by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning; Caterpillar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have resumed trading, up 0.25% on the day. Now this is interesting....oil giant BP has signed off on a $9bn project to expand its Mad Dog oil field in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The decision follows extensive work bringing the cost of the project down (at one stage, it was going to cost $20bn). And it shows that oil firms are prepared to invest in new projects, if they think the oil price makes it worthwhile. BP chief executive Bob Dudley says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This announcement shows that big deepwater projects can still be economic in a low price environment in the US if they are designed in a smart and cost-effective way. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It also demonstrates the resilience of our strategy which is focused on building on incumbent positions in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most prolific hydrocarbon basins while relentlessly focusing on value over volume.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But.... BP can never shake off memories of an earlier project in the Gulf, the Deepwater Horizon disaster at the Macondo oil field in 2010. Eleven workers were killed when the rig caught fire, creating one of the worst environmental disasters ever. Central Bank news! Agustin Carstens, head of the Bank of Mexico, has resigned. Carstens, one of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most experienced central bankers, has been appointed to run the Bank of International Settlements (BIS is basically the central bankers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 central bank). He will leave the Bank of Mexico in July 2017, and start at BIS three months later. Carstens deserves a change of job, having been battling to handle the impact of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pronouncements on the Mexican Peso. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michael McDonough says the news adds extra uncertainty, with Mexico already expected to hike interest rates next month: The top rung of central banking is a little like Formula 1 -- with a small number of candidates moving between a limited number of seats. So Carstens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 appointment may have a knock-on effect on the European Central Bank; board member Beno\u00c3\u00aet C\u00c5\u201cur\u00c3\u00a9 could possible have got the BIS job, but is now free for other challenges... Boom! The Brent crude oil price has just hit its highest level of the year. A barrel of Brent for February delivery just changed hands at $53.79, which is the most expensive since October 2015. Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprise supply cut is forcing traders to rapidly reassess their expectations. Jane Sydenham, investment director at Rathbone Investment Management, calls it a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcknee jerk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reaction to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whilst at present the news is good for the markets, it is much more difficult to say how this will play out in the longer term. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re currently experiencing a knee-jerk reaction, unsurprising since this is the biggest co-ordinated action in eight years. It is likely that this will run on for a little while longer but how the markets price in the unexpected oil inflation is something we are yet to see.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Former cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith, who campaigned for Brexit, has criticised the idea that Britain might make payments to the EU after leaving the bloc. He was responding to David Davis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suggestion that the UK would consider the idea. PA has the story: Prominent Brexit-backer Iain Duncan Smith claimed Mr Davis had given a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153convoluted\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd answer and may have been talking about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bridging arrangements\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to phase out UK contributions to the EU. The former cabinet minister insisted there was no way of reaching a deal to pay the EU for access to the single market. He told BBC Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s The World At One: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My sense is that I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that he was absolutely answering the question that was posed to him. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talking about here is how do you get a deal that allows British and Europeans to access each others\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 markets without the necessity of tariff barriers or artificial barriers against service etc. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s any way in which you can reach a deal whereby you say \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pay some money in and therefore you allow us access\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, because you might as well have tariff barriers at that point.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Other Brexit supporters have also expressed disquiet about this idea in the past; but it all depends on the kind of Brexit deal that Theresa May goes for. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pound rally follows the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best month since 2009. Sterling gained 6% against the euro in November, 1,5% against the US dollar, and almost 15% against the Japanese yen. It may show that the markets are becoming less worried about the UK, following more solid economic data since June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says: Momentum is particularly strong against the yen and its recent performance has been staggering, GBPJPY is up more than 14% since the start of November! Political risks around Brexit are receding, as political risks elsewhere start to bite. The cost to insure UK sovereign debt has fallen sharply since spiking back in June. Good economic news from America: its factory sector is growing at its fastest pace since the Brexit vote. The ISM manufacturing index has jumped to 53.2 in November, from 51.9 in October, which is the fastest rate since June. Firm said they were benefitting from strong domestic demand. A rival survey, from Markit, was also just released. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s even more encouraging, showing activity rising at a 13-month high. No wonder City traders may be looking frazzled: The US crude oil price has hit a five-week high, as traders push it through the$50 per barrel mark. Oil is surging even higher, as commodity traders continue to react to the Opec supply cut deal hammered out yesterday. Brent crude is now up 3% at $53.44 per barrel, a near two-month high, and a really substantial surge from $46/barrel before the Opec meeting. Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to cut output by 1.2m barrels per day looks like a real game-changer. The group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s secretary general, Mohammed Barkindo, is telling Bloomberg TV right now that it was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153historic landmark\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sam Wahab, director of oil and gas research at Cantor Fitzgerald Europe, believes the price could keep rising: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement has truly changed the landscape for oil over the coming years, putting a floor of $50 a barrel under oil prices. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Prior to this agreement, the environment of sub $50 oil was likely to persist, but this move sufficiently addresses the supply/demand dynamics, with some 3.5% of supply being cut from January. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It means 2017 will likely see prices around the $55-$60 a barrel mark, and we may yet see further jumps in prices as soon as next week if the non-OPEC members also agree a production cut at their meeting on Friday 9th December. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally has pushed the pound to nearly a three-month high against the euro. That means it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just 8% below its pre-referendum levels (having been down 15% at one stage). The pound just spiked even higher against the US dollar, after the latest American unemployment figures hit the wires. Sterling hit $1.268, up 1.7 cents, as data showed that the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefit has hit a 5-month high. The initial jobless claims figure rose to 268,000 last week, up from 251,000. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some more reaction to David Davis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments, and the bounce in the pound: Craig Erlam, chief market analyst with retail brokerage Oanda: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The idea that single market is still a priority is a move away from the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 line. Since the two or three major selloffs we saw earlier this year, the Bank of England has changed its stance to holding rates next year, the data has been better and now the rhetoric has softened.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sterling is on the tear this morning on hopes for a soft Brexit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153David Davis said the UK could contribute to the EU budget in return for access to markets and that has fuelled a rally for the pound.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chris Saint, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Currency Service \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rehabilitation is gathering steam, having broken through the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.19 level against the euro today for the first time in almost three months. A surge of nearly 1% versus the US dollar has also lifted the pound back above US$1.26. Gains come amid signs of a more compromising approach to upcoming Brexit negotiations from the UK government, with Brexit minister David Davis saying Britain would consider contributing to the EU budget in return for retaining access to European markets. Our Politics Live blog has full coverage of David Davis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments on Brexit: David Davis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suggestion that the UK could pay for access to European markets after Brexit have also sent the pound rallying against the euro. Sterling has gained nearly one eurocent to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.19, its highest point since September 7th. Caxton FX analyst Alexandra Russell-Oliver says that Davis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments are pushing the pound up. She also points out that the euro is suffering from fears of political instability, with two important votes taking place on Sunday: The pound rally, which has occurred against most major currencies has follows comments from Brexit Secretary Davis, which indicate that the UK may be willing to make trade-offs for access to the single market. The euro is currently under pressure in anticipation of the Italian Constitutional Referendum and Austrian Presidential Election, taking place on Sunday, where shock results could result in further volatility. The pound has surged by 1% this morning after Brexit secretary David Davis suggested that the UK could make payments in return for access to the European markets. The comments have fuelled hopes in the City that Britain might avoid a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial services industry, for example, could retain access to the single market after 2019 (the likely exit date). Our political reporter Jess Elgot explains what happened: David Davis has suggested that the government would consider making contributions to the EU budget in exchange for access to the single market, saying his Department for Exiting the EU would consider all options to get the best deal with the bloc. During questions in the House of Commons, the Labour MP Wayne David asked if the Brexit secretary would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153consider making any contribution in any shape or form for access to the single market\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Davis said the government would look at the options during the article 50 process over the next two years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The major criterion here is that we get the best possible access for goods and services to the European market,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And if that is included in what he is talking about, then of course we would consider it. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s her full story: This chart shows how the pound surged by one and a half cents, or 1.2%, since Davis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments, to $1.2650. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its highest level since the US election three weeks ago. Neil Jones, head of FX hedge fund sales at Mizuho, told Reuters that some traders have been racing to buy the pound -- or unwind bets against sterling. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These headlines suggesting Britain may be able to access the single market are generating substantial sterling demand from traders and investors looking to reduce their short positions and unwind hedges.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Consumers should brace for higher petrol prices soon, warns Michelle McGrade, chief investment officer of TD Direct Investing: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been clear for some time that the low price of oil has been hurting producers. In my view, it was only a matter of time before OPEC decided to cut production. A higher oil price, together with a strong US dollar, makes things tougher for UK consumers because not only will petrol be more expensive, but this could fuel a stronger surge in inflation than originally expected, as inflation is highly correlated to the price of oil. The combination makes for an unwelcome gift just before Christmas. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve checked with the AA about the report that filling up a car will soon cost an extra \u00c2\u00a35. They say that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s based on oil hitting $60 -- so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not there yet. But the 12% jump in the oil price this week is still going to hurt drivers... Back to Opec.... and the oil price is clinging onto today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains, as analysts keep kicking the tires of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal. Brent crude is hovering around $52.50, a 1.2% gain today. That means it has surged by 12% since yesterday morning, just before Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s members sat down and hammered out the supply cuts deal. City traders are pondering: Will Opec members actually deliver the production cuts they signed up to yesterday? Will non-Opec members support the deal by cutting supply (as Opec hopes)? Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says this uncertainty means the oil price could fall back: OPEC has suggested the deal is contingent on getting this 600,000 b/d from non-OPEC \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet know if it could unravel if this doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen. There are lots of pieces in the jigsaw that are yet to fall into place. If OPEC members stick to the script and if non-OPEC comes up with the goods we might be on for further gains in crude. If not this rally could easily lose momentum and fade. And.... the more the oil price goes up, though, the more incentive there is for US shale producers to turn their pumps back on. Bloomberg Gadfly writer Liam Denning reckons this issue will be crucial: Supporting the market in this way hands an opportunity to U.S. exploration and production firms to hedge future production at higher prices and expand their own drilling budgets to fill some of the gap left by Saudi Arabia, Russia and others. Over the next six months, we will see if OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coalition can hold. Assume it does -- a huge assumption at this point -- and in the following six months we will see how much the frackers will do to undermine it. His full take is here: Now this really is a moment..... unemployment across the eurozone has fallen below 10% for the first time in over five years, and is now at a seven-year low. Eurostat reports that the jobless rate fell to 9.8% in October. September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure has been revised down to 9.9% (from 10%). Eurozone unemployment hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been below 10% since April 2011, and October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading is actually the lowest since 2009. Over the last year, unemployment has fallen in 24 of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 28 members. The largest annual decreases were registered in Croatia (from 16.1% to 12.7%), Spain (from 21.2% to 19.2%) and Slovakia (from 11.1% to 9.1%). Italy and France have also reported falls in unemployment, as Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slow-but-steady recovery continues. Economists fear that British factories could hike their prices to help them handle a sharp rise in raw material costs since the summer. George Nikolaidis, senior economist at EEF, says the weaker pound is both a challenge and an opportunity for manufacturing: While the more competitive exchange rate means UK manufacturers are well positioned to capitalise on the recovery in demand in key export markets, higher input costs are coming through the manufacturing supply chain thick and fast to put the squeeze on profit margins. Manufacturers are inevitably looking to pass these costs on to customers adding to the inflationary pressures already building up in the UK economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mike Rigby, head of manufacturing at Barclays also believes consumers will be hit by higher prices next year: Exporters continue to take advantage of a weak sterling but it is increasingly looking like a case of having to take the rough with the smooth as businesses start to pass on higher import costs, which could accelerate inflationary pressures as we enter 2017.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And Jeremy Cook of World First fears that the recent jump in output could be slowing: Breaking: Growth in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector slowed last month, despite the weak pound helping firms export abroad. The UK factory PMI, which measures activity across the sector, has fallen to 53.4, down from 54.4 in October. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker than the City expected, but it does still show that the sector has expanded for four month running -- as the initial Brexit shock quickly ebbed away. Firms reported that output and new orders both expanded at a solid date. Markit, which compiles the figures, also warns that the weak pound is driving up import costs -- as well as making UK goods more attractive to overseas buyers. The effects of the weak sterling exchange rate continued to be felt by manufacturers during November. On the plus side, the boost to export competitiveness led to a further increase in new business from abroad. Companies reported improved demand from the USA, mainland Europe and the Middle East. The negative impact of the exchange rate was felt on the cost side. Average purchase prices rose at a pace close to October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s near six-year record and again at one of the fastest rates in the survey history. The Financial Times has a good piece about how some Opec members are paying a higher price than others to get the deal through: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: Saudi Arabia and its Gulf Arab allies, including Kuwait, United Arab Emirates and Qatar, have agreed to shoulder the bulk of the cuts. They are banking on a quick recovery in price to ensure they do not lose revenues or surrender market share to other suppliers. Iran and Iraq, which sit outside the Gulf bloc in the Middle East, have sacrificed less. Most oil analysts see the limited concessions they made to let the deal succeed as largely face-saving technical measures to placate the Saudis. Other members from Venezuela to Angola, which have agreed to cut part of their output in support of a 1.2m barrel-a-day reduction, have a patchy record of compliance with past deals. Despite Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s price surge, they may need an ongoing recovery to be convinced to do their share. Newsflash: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factor sector has posted its strongest growth in close to three years. Data firm Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly manufacturing PMI has risen to 53.7, up from 53.5 in October. Any reading over 50 shows an expansion, and this is the best reading since January 2014. The sector was driven by the Netherlands, Austria and Spain - while poor old Greece suffered its biggest contraction in a year. Factories also reported that cost pressures are rising sharply, meaning they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re paying more for raw materials. Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s production cut may make that worse.... Dominic Rossi, global CIO equities at Fidelity International, urges caution: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I would not get too excited by the Opec cut. Compliance will be a problem, and the Russians will pump more gas instead. In the meantime, the long-run marginal cost of US shale continues to fall. I would not chase this oil price rally too hard.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd City experts are a little sceptical that Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal will actually push oil prices much higher. Spanish banking group BBVA suggest warn that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153implementing and monitoring\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the deal could be constrained by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153geopolitical factors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (for example, Saudi Arabia and Iran are already backing rival sides in the Yemen conflict) Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ANZ bank point out that US shale producers could boost their own output, keeping a lid on prices. City analyst Louise Cooper questions suggests Iraq can stick to the deal: (Some of Iraq\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil fields are based in Iraqi Kurdistan, to the north of the country, where the peshmerga military forces are based) The Wall Street Journal has created an excellent graphic, showing how Opec has created the current oil glut by pumping harder, while US shale producers have cut back: The WSJ also explains how Saudi and Iran managed to settle on a deal: The member countries were faced with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very deep\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd abyss of low oil prices, and that won out over politics, said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of IHS Markit and a longtime oil-market watcher. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153OPEC is back in business,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mr. Yergin said in an interview. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This will rank as one of their historic decisions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Saudi Arabia and Iran, whose differences blocked a deal that aimed to freeze production earlier this year, made the deal possible by coming to a tortured compromise on production figures. Iran was allowed to increase its production by 90,000 barrels a day, a significant victory for the Islamic Republic as it tries to rebuild its economy after the end of Western sanctions. But the deal allows both Iran and Saudi Arabia to claim a win, by pointing to different sets of numbers. Iran, using production figures generated by OPEC, can say it is raising output, while Saudi Arabia can point to the Islamic Republic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s output figures and say that Iran is agreeing to a cut. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good day for the oil market, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good day for the oil industry,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said after the deal was reached. Shares in energy companies are jumping today too. In London, Royal Dutch Shell and BP are leading the risers on the FTSE 100; a higher oil price should mean higher profits. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says trader are ignoring concerns that the deal may not stick (especially if non-Opec members don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree their own cuts). Long-term apprehension surrounding the deal (and the potential for a pick-up in US shale production) will be thrown to the back of investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 minds as Brent regains a $52 handle and US Crude fast approaches $50 per barrel. How long can the post-deal rally last? Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal is bad news for motorists, as higher crude prices will swiftly lead to more expensive petrol. The front page of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Times declares that it could mean a litre of fuel costs 10p more, which swiftly adds up: Motorists face paying \u00c2\u00a35 more to fill up an average family car after a Saudi-led cartel struck a rare deal to boost the price of oil. Oil prices jumped by 8.9 per cent to $50.45 a barrel yesterday after the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec), which pumps a third of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil, agreed to limit output for the first time in eight years. Motoring groups warned that the agreement was likely to create an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unwelcome Christmas present\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for families by sharply pushing up prices on the forecourt. Petrol fell to 101p a litre in February after oil plunged to $27 a barrel as Iran increased production when sanctions were lifted. Some analysts now predict that oil could rise to $60 a barrel. According to estimates, this could push petrol to a two-year high of 123p a litre, from 114p today. The oil price has extended its gains this morning as the financial markets continue to digest Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s output cut deal. US crude oil smashed through $50 per barrel for the first time in a month this morning. Brent crude - oil sourced from the North Sea - jumped by another 1% to $52.73. Yesterday, oil surged by over 8% as it became clear that Opec had, for once, come up with a plan to tackle the oil glut. Traders are genuinely surprised that Opec members put their differences behind them in Vienna this week, and agreed to cut 1.2m barrels off their daily output, to 32.5m. Russia also caught the experts out; it is backing Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal by promising to trim its own output by 300,000 barrels per day. That means that non-Opec members may, as Opec hopes, chip in with a 600,000bpd reduction. Chris Weston of IG explains that this could give the deal extra teeth: The consensus was that we would get some sort of loose agreement from the collective that kept oil supported, but left the market asking many more questions. What we have seen however has been real meat on the bone, not just from gaining an understanding around production cut allocations from the more tricky OPEC members, including Iran and Iraq, but it seems Russia was so enthused by what they heard that they have increased their own production cut levels from 200,000 to 250,000 to 300,000 a day through the first half in 2017. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Opec members are still in celebratory mood after agreeing their first output cut in almost a decade. The oil cartel defied the sceptics yesterday, by announcing it would slash production by 1.2m barrels per day, in an attempt to tackle the glut of crude oil in the market. As we covered yesterday, this sent the oil price soaring - and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing further gains this morning. Analysts are now wondering if the deal will hold, and what it means for other producers, consumers, and the global economy. Also coming up today... Data firm Markit is publishing its latest manufacturing PMI reports, showing how factories around the globe fared last month. The big news overnight is that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector beat forecasts, expanding at its fastest rate in over four years. This may signal that China is, once again, relying on traditional smokestack \u00e2\u20ac\u0153industries\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd industries for growth, rather than transforming into a consumer-driven economy. We find out how Britain, and Europe, performed in the next couple of hours: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what to watch out for: 9am GMT: eurozone manufacturing PMI 9.30am GMT: UK manufacturing PMI 2.45pm GMT: US manufacturing PMI And there are also signs today that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing market is slowing. The Nationwide building society has reported that prices only rose by 0.1% in November, meaning prices were just 4.4% higher than a year ago.",

Hopes had been high that passage of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcprior actions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c contingent for the conclusion of a second review of the bailed out Greek economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c would have been concluded in time for Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, the last gathering of euro zone finance ministers this year. For prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 government, December 5<sup>th</sup> has been marked as the date debt relief talks could finally start.</p> <p>Instead, the leftist-led coalition has been faced with the daunting task of endorsing yet more austerity, the price of participation of the International Monetary Fund in Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third, 86 bn euro rescue programme. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s protestors, rallying outside the prime ministers offices, are among the thousands who will be hit by cuts expected to apply as of the New Year.</p> <p>But in a move interpreted as an olive branch, the German finance ministry announced today that the euro group would also discuss possible short-term debt measures for Greece at Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. The IMF has long said that euro zone countries must give Greece \u00e2\u20ac\u0153upfront, unconditional\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd debt relief to make it debt burden sustainable and allow the Washington-based organisation to take part in its bailout programme.

Stephen Brown, European economist at the consultancy, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The stagnation of Swiss GDP in Q3 demonstrates the negative impact that deflation and the strong franc have had on the economy. With a plethora of political risks in the euro-zone set to keep the franc strong, exporters are unlikely to get a respite soon... It was the weakest quarter for growth since Q2 2015 and a sharp slowdown from the 0.6% rise recorded in Q2.</p> <p>After stagnating in Q2, consumer spending growth eked out an expansion of 0.1% in Q3. Nevertheless, consumer spending growth has clearly been weak in recent quarters, possibly as a result of consumers responding to Switzerland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deflationary environment by delaying purchases. More encouragingly, investment rebounded by 0.5%. Meanwhile, government consumption edged down slightly, by 0.1%.</p> <p>In addition to the current strong level of the franc, next year exporters will also have to contend with a slowdown in growth and a plethora of political risks in the euro-zone, Switzerland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main trading partner. If just one of those risks were to materialise, it could act as a double-whammy for Switzerland by both exacerbating the euro-zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic slowdown and by prompting a renewed appreciation of the franc due to the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s safe-haven status. In all, then, we expect Swiss GDP growth to slow from about 1.5% this year to 1% in both 2017 and 2018.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d2a716706e3cb0dbe6262507dc6df1fd73069dd7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2a716706e3cb0dbe6262507dc6df1fd73069dd7/0_242_5256_3154/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Switzerland mountain railway, Glacier Express route between Andermatt and Oberalp Pass.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Switzerland mountain railway, Glacier Express route between Andermatt and Oberalp Pass.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: rusm/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58414398e4b015a427f76a69\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-02T09:49:58.127Z\">9.49am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Italian 10-year bond yields are heading for their biggest weekly fall since July, amid referendum jitters.</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-584141cce4b015a427f76a62\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-02T09:48:33.231Z\">9.48am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Construction was better than expected.

Essentially, Renzi wants to reduce the power of the Senate - the upper chamber of parliament, allowing for smoother implementation of legislation and potentially a more stable political system. However, the referendum has turned into a vote on Renzi himself, whose popularity has taken a sharp dip since his election in September 2014.</p> <p>We expect the political fallout to be contained. Even if Renzi resigns, recent history suggests that there is more probability of a technocrat government being installed. If a general election were to happen, the likelihood is that it would result in a fragmented coalition government that would find it difficult to pass legislation, owing to the very parliamentary system that Renzi is trying to reform.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote> <p>But there would be a negative impact on the already struggling economy.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 vote will reduce hopes of advancing the structural reform agenda, resulting in weaker growth for an already struggling economy.

And over in Greece, scores of disabled protestors have been taking to the streets as the governing coalition rushes to complete reforms ahead of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crucial meeting of euro zone finance ministers. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens: Once again the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakest link is in a race-against-the clock to complete reforms demanded by creditors keeping the debt-stricken country afloat. Hopes had been high that passage of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcprior actions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c contingent for the conclusion of a second review of the bailed out Greek economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c would have been concluded in time for Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, the last gathering of euro zone finance ministers this year. For prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 government, December 5th has been marked as the date debt relief talks could finally start. Instead, the leftist-led coalition has been faced with the daunting task of endorsing yet more austerity, the price of participation of the International Monetary Fund in Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third, 86 bn euro rescue programme. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s protestors, rallying outside the prime ministers offices, are among the thousands who will be hit by cuts expected to apply as of the New Year. But in a move interpreted as an olive branch, the German finance ministry announced today that the euro group would also discuss possible short-term debt measures for Greece at Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. The IMF has long said that euro zone countries must give Greece \u00e2\u20ac\u0153upfront, unconditional\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd debt relief to make it debt burden sustainable and allow the Washington-based organisation to take part in its bailout programme. At over 300 bn euro or 180 percent of GDP, Athens has by far the highest debt load in the EU. The IMF would consider 120 percent to be manageable. And Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management, said: With a December hike in the Fed Funds rate fully priced into markets, the latest set of payrolls would have to have been extremely weak to impact expectations. We expect the Fed to hike rates on December 14th and the market will move on to speculating on the timing and direction of the next move. With rising treasury yields impacting mortgage rates, other central banks still easing policy, and uncertainty over the scale and timing of any Trumpflation stimulus, we expect the Fed to remain cautious with the pace of rate hikes next year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, said: The decline in the unemployment rate to a new cyclical low of 4.6% last month, from 4.9% was due to a combination of a 160,000 increase in the household survey measure of employment together with a 226,000 decline in the labour force. The number of involuntary part-time workers fell by 220,000. As a result, the U6 unemployment dropped to an eight-year low of 9.3%, from 9.5%. The upshot is that the labour market appears to be approaching full employment. That said, the 0.1% m/m decline in average hourly earnings, which pushed the annual growth rate back down to 2.5%, from 2.8%, suggests that there is still a little slack left for the Fed to play with. A December rate hike is coming and, assuming that we see a major fiscal stimulus passed in the first half of next year, we expect an additional 100 basis points of tightening from the Fed next year, taking the fed funds target range to between 1.50% and 1.75% by end-2017.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Returning to the US economy, Alex Lydall, head of dealing at Foenix Partners, has a slightly different take on the labour market data. A rate hike in December is unlikely to be derailed from the afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report, but a poor wages number does give Janet Yellen food for thought. The headline figure of 178k was solid - along with a significant decrease in the Unemployment rate to 4.6% - but the premise of extra fiscal stimulus in a Trump era and letting wages naturally increase as the Fed have reiterated, could leave Yellen pondering future hikes if wages stutter. We are still likely to see a 0.25 hike this month, but the speed of next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery could be impacted if wages and participation rates continue to cause a headache. With risk appetite bullish from the OPEC agreement this week, the greenback could likely see some short-term weakness against the majors, with the notable exception of the risk associated this weekend with the Italian Referendum.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Meanwhile, my colleague Katie Allen writes: The Bank of England should be wary of rushing into interest rate rises to curb inflation, according to its chief economist, in a warning that the UK economy is vulnerable to a sharper slowdown next year than current forecasts would suggest. Andy Haldane said he was comfortable with the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current wait-and-see stance on borrowing costs as it weighs up the conflicting forces of a lower pound stoking inflation and the Brexit vote denting business confidence. Here is an interesting point Here is some instant reaction to the US jobs data. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, said: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s positive US job figures, coming on the back of good economic numbers across the board, will further increase the odds of a rate rise at the next Fed meeting in mid-December. The healthy labour market mirrors the momentum we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen in the economy since the summer, which has enjoyed strong PMI figures in both services and manufacturing. However, crucially, the participation rate has not risen, which may take some of the shine off these figures for the Fed. With the US presidential election suspense now behind us, it is Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rhetoric which will be of most interest to investors as they look ahead at what to expect in the new Trump era next year. If as expected, we see a swing towards fiscal stimulus, this may give the Fed greater scope to hike rates further in 2017. Fed decision making will no longer be solely data dependent, but policy dependent also.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Looking at a breakdown by sector, manufacturing jobs fell by 4,000 last month, the fourth monthly decline. Construction rose by 19,000 jobs following a 14,000 gain in October, and retail jobs fell for the second month in a row, by 8,300. As the US economy approaches full employment, monthly job gains have slowed from an average of 229,000 in 2015 to an average of 180,000 this year. The 178,000 increase in new jobs was slightly better than expected. Economists had pencilled in 175,000 jobs and an unchanged jobless rate of 4.9%. However, wage growth has slowed. Average hourly earnings fell 3 cents, or 0.1%, after rising 0.4% in October. This lowered the year-on-year growth rate to 2.5% in November from 2.8% in October, which was the biggest increase in nearly 7 1/2 years. The jobless rate hit 4.6%, the lowest in more than nine years, making it a near certainty that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its meeting on 14 December. The jobs report comes after a run of strong economic data. Breaking news: nonfarm payrolls show 178,000 new jobs were created in the US economy last month, compared with 142,000 in October (revised lower from 161,000). My colleague Sean Farrell has found out more. The owners have sold the property in Whitechapel to an undisclosed buyer, will leave in May 2017 and are in talks about what will happen to the business. It looks like it could be sold \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so it is likely to continue as a business. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest bell foundry which made Big Ben and the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia, is closing. Whitechapel Bell Foundry, which traces itself back to Elizabethan times and says it is the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest manufacturing company, said the decision was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in response to the changing realities of running a business of this kind\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The firm was set up in 1570 during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I and is one of two remaining bell foundries in the UK. It has changed ownership several times and moved sites. The foundry says it is listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest manufacturing company in continuous operation. Owners Alan and Kathryn Hughes said, according to the Daily Telegraph: We have made this decision with a heavy heart, but in response to the changing realities of running a business of this kind. The Bell Foundry in Whitechapel has changed hands many times, but it has always been a family business. My own family has owned the foundry since 1904, but other families have run the firm through its history, which stretches back to 1570.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A statement posted on the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website suggests that perhaps the company will reopen somewhere else. Whitechapel Bell Foundry Ltd announces, with regret, that by May 2017 it will cease its activities at the Whitechapel Road site that it has occupied since its move there in 1738. The company intends to complete work on all projects presently in hand during the coming months. It will not be entering into new contracts for the time being whilst discussions with the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staff and other interested parties regarding the future direction, ownership, and location of the company are ongoing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The dollar, measured against a basket of currencies, has dipped before the US jobs data. The dollar index has slipped 0.1% to 100.92 and is down 0.6% this week \u00e2\u20ac\u201c its first weekly fall in a month. The US currency is also on course for its first weekly decline in four weeks against the euro. The head of watchdog Ofcom has said that British regulators should be given wider powers to block mergers following the Brexit vote \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in particular if a company is strategically important. In a speech to the Institute for Government, Sharon White said Britain should use the opportunity provided by the referendum to beef up the capacities of its regulators. We have the opportunity to introduce a wider set of considerations in merger decisions, including policy or public-interest concerns where a company is deemed to have particular strategic significance for the UK.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But she added this should not lead to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153regulatory creep\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new powers for the sake of it\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She also called for the introduction of new protections for consumers. The US non-farm payrolls report is expected to show steady job growth, with a small pick-up to 175,000 new jobs forecast for November, from 161,000 in October. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, has looked at the markets: More losses for stock markets indicate the nervousness that is taking hold ahead of the Italian referendum. The slow pullback in US markets is also an indication that we are in the traditionally weak period of early December. Berkeley Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s numbers this morning gained the approval of shareholders, with the shares moving higher in early trading. Housebuilders remain one of the more interesting dynamics, with valuations still remarkably low, even if concerns remain about potential drop offs in demand. Non-farm payrolls are not expected to disrupt the steady procession towards a Fed rate hike in December, although wage growth is still not as strong as the Fed would like. We also have the Baker Hughes rig count at the end of the day, at a time when most London traders will either be well on their way home or in the pub. Still, it will be a number worth watching as questions remain over how US producers will act in the wake of the OPEC cut.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Time for a morning round-up. Key US jobs data are out at 1.30pm. Non-farm payrolls are expected to show 175,000 new jobs were created in November, up from 161,000 in October. European stocks are falling ahead of this weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Italian constitutional referendum and Austrian presidential election. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index fell as much as 1.2% and is now 1.1% lower at 337. Wall Street has fared better, where US stocks have hit record highs buoyed by expectations of fiscal stimulus by president-elect Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration. City of London Markets trader Markus Huber said: Many are of the opinion that traders will continue to favour US over European stocks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brent crude oil has been slipping all morning, and is now down 1% at $53.36 a barrel. It has eased from the one-year high hit yesterday following the Opec oil cartel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement to cut production on Wednesday, the first such deal in eight years. The UK construction sector has strengthened, but firms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 costs have also picked up on the back of the weaker pound, hitting a 5 1/2 year high. Here is our full take on the pick-up in UK construction activity. In other news today, train fares in the UK will go up by an average of 2.3% next year, the rail industry has announced. This was quickly condemned as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153another kick in the teeth for British passengers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by the Rail, Maritime and Transport union. The union said travellers already pay some of the highest fares in Europe to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153travel on rammed out and unreliable trains\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. You can read the full story here. Returning to the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction figures, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some reaction. Mike Chappell, global corporates managing director for construction at Lloyds Bank commercial banking, said: As this survey shows, many construction firms, and particularly those at the top end of the supply chain, retain a cautiously optimistic outlook. Their mood has been helped by what was widely seen as a construction-friendly Autumn Statement, which included a new commitment from the chancellor to spend an increased proportion of GDP on infrastructure. This appears to amount to a Keynesian-style recognition that investment in infrastructure can itself help to stimulate the economy. On the flip side there remains some concern about the London market, which is seen as particularly exposed to a post-EU referendum slowdown. Our own research* shows that business confidence across the UK dropped slightly in November after a relatively high reading in October.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Paul Trigg, construction specialist and assistant head of risk underwriting at credit insurance firm Euler Hermes, said: Performance across the construction sector is clearly polarising as housebuilders report healthy profits and a number of high-profile contractors bring in the administrators. We expect the number of insolvencies in the sector to climb through next year. Low margin contracts continue to put serious pressure on company cash flows, with businesses unable to pass on further rises in input costs resulting from inflation. Pressure on cashflow will inevitably impact firms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ability to pay on time throughout the supply chain and construction companies will need to be extra careful when managing their credit books. The Autumn Statement provided some welcome news on both housing and infrastructure, but the industry needs clarity quickly on whether all of this is new money or just a repackaging of previous announcements.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Producer prices in the eurozone have jumped to their highest in more than four years in October as energy prices increased. The European Union\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statistics office said prices at the factory gate in the 19-member currency bloc climbed 0.8% in October, much more than expected. Compared with a year earlier, prices fell 0.4%. The figures will be welcomed by the European Central Bank in its battle against ultra-low inflation. Consumer price inflation has picked up recently and hit a 31-month high of 0.6% in November. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still far below the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target. Capital Economics have sent us their thoughts on the Swiss GDP numbers. Stephen Brown, European economist at the consultancy, said: The stagnation of Swiss GDP in Q3 demonstrates the negative impact that deflation and the strong franc have had on the economy. With a plethora of political risks in the euro-zone set to keep the franc strong, exporters are unlikely to get a respite soon... It was the weakest quarter for growth since Q2 2015 and a sharp slowdown from the 0.6% rise recorded in Q2. After stagnating in Q2, consumer spending growth eked out an expansion of 0.1% in Q3. Nevertheless, consumer spending growth has clearly been weak in recent quarters, possibly as a result of consumers responding to Switzerland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deflationary environment by delaying purchases. More encouragingly, investment rebounded by 0.5%. Meanwhile, government consumption edged down slightly, by 0.1%. In addition to the current strong level of the franc, next year exporters will also have to contend with a slowdown in growth and a plethora of political risks in the euro-zone, Switzerland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main trading partner. If just one of those risks were to materialise, it could act as a double-whammy for Switzerland by both exacerbating the euro-zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic slowdown and by prompting a renewed appreciation of the franc due to the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s safe-haven status. In all, then, we expect Swiss GDP growth to slow from about 1.5% this year to 1% in both 2017 and 2018.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Italian 10-year bond yields are heading for their biggest weekly fall since July, amid referendum jitters. Construction was better than expected. Housebuilding remained the best performer, even though its expansion slipped to a three-month low. Commercial activity bounced back after five months of decline, while civil engineering remained the weakest area. Overall, incoming new construction work was the strongest since March, after declining through the summer in the wake of the EU referendum. Some construction firms noted that their workloads had been boosted by a resumption of projects that were delayed after the Brexit vote. However, there were also reports that the stronger inflation backdrop had led to intense competitive pressures and squeezed margins. The bounceback in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction industry has continued in November, with the sector expanding at the fastest rate since March, according to a survey. Commercial work picked up for the first time in six months. However, cost inflation also picked up and is now the strongest for 5 1/2 years. The purchasing managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 index from Markit/CIPS rose to 52.8 in November from 52.6 in October. Also on Sunday, Austria holds a presidential election that could see Norbert Hofer of the Freedom Party become the first far-right head of state elected in western Europe since World War II. In Italy, prime minister Matteo Renzi has said he will stand down if voters reject a constitutional reform. But this does not necessarily mean fresh elections. Italian president Sergio Mattarella could ask Renzi to stay, ask another centre-leftist politician to form a new government or try to persuade Silvio Berlusconi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s centre-right party to join or support a caretaker government, as Reuters reports. Jaisal Pstakia, investment manager at Heartwood Investment Management, says: In all probability the Italian electorate is likely to reject Prime Minister Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposals for constitutional reform. Essentially, Renzi wants to reduce the power of the Senate - the upper chamber of parliament, allowing for smoother implementation of legislation and potentially a more stable political system. However, the referendum has turned into a vote on Renzi himself, whose popularity has taken a sharp dip since his election in September 2014. We expect the political fallout to be contained. Even if Renzi resigns, recent history suggests that there is more probability of a technocrat government being installed. If a general election were to happen, the likelihood is that it would result in a fragmented coalition government that would find it difficult to pass legislation, owing to the very parliamentary system that Renzi is trying to reform.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But there would be a negative impact on the already struggling economy. A \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 vote will reduce hopes of advancing the structural reform agenda, resulting in weaker growth for an already struggling economy. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate in 2016 has been one of the weakest among its euro peers, weighed down by high unemployment rates and a stalling credit cycle. Loan growth has fallen back into negative territory and demand is expected to be further constrained by tighter credit standards for both mortgages and corporates.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd European stocks are falling as investors nervously await this weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Italian constitutional referendum. Commodity stocks are among the biggest fallers, with oil prices sliding today, and financial shares are also down. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pan-European Stoxx 600 index is down 1.2%, the lowest in more than three weeks. Simon Smith, chief economist at FX Pro, said: We have the Italian constitutional referendum over the weekend. This has the potential to induce some volatility in the early part of next week. There are still a lot of undecided voters, so although the no side is ahead, the result is not a given. And even if this does come to fruition, a rejection of the reforms would lead to political instability in Italy and quite possibly to early elections.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We are going to spend less on Christmas this year, PricewaterhouseCoopers reckons. Its survey shows the average UK adult expects to spend around \u00c2\u00a3280 on gifts. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the first time the consultancy firm has done this survey, but it says other reports suggest spending was around \u00c2\u00a3300-\u00c2\u00a3400 last year, so this would indicate a dip in Christmas spending. Around 4% of people said they wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t buy any presents. A quarter expect the effects of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote to leave the European Union to have an impact on how much they spend this Christmas. However, the majority (67%) expect no impact at all. More than half (53) said they would make their purchases online this Christmas, compared to 43% in store. In the UK, Berkeley Group, which builds luxury homes in London and the south east, has taken a hit from Brexit uncertainty and rising stamp duty. But the company still made a pretax profit of \u00c2\u00a3392.7m in the six months to October, up 34% from a year earlier. It sold fewer homes but at a higher price \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the average selling price rose to \u00c2\u00a3655,000 from \u00c2\u00a3506,000 last year. However, chief executive Rob Perrins said reservations had fallen 20% in the housebuilder\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first half, similar to guidance given in June. This fall in volume is due to higher stamp duty, the extraordinary attack on buy-to-let landlords \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such an important part of sustaining the London market and increasing the supply of new homes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the uncertainty caused by Brexit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd You can read the full story here. Meanwhile, the Finnish economy expanded 0.4% in the third quarter. The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statistics office revised down an earlier estimate of 0.5%. GDP rose 1.6% from a year earlier. Finland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is slowly recovering following years of stagnation caused by the decline of Nokia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former phone business and the impact of the recession in neighbouring Russia. The Swiss economy has stalled: Swiss GDP figures came out earlier this morning, and showed the economy was flat in the third quarter compared to the second. It grew by 1.3% year-on-year. The figures were worse than expected and the weakest in more than a year, as Switzerland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s export-led economy struggled with the strong franc. Economists had pencilled in 0.3% growth. The Swiss National Bank ditched a cap on the franc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value against the euro almost two years ago. European stocks have opened lower, as expected. FTSE 100 index in London down more than 50 points at 6701.22, 0.77% fall Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax down 0.9% France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC down 0.7% Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex down 0.6% Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE Mib down 0.6% Portugal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PSI20 down 0.4% It emerged earlier this week that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new plastic \u00c2\u00a35 note contains animal fat, which caused a storm on Twitter and the launch of a petition on behalf of vegans, vegetarians and some religious groups. It has been signed by more than 121,000 people. A day later, the Bank of England bowed to the pressure and issued a statement saying that it had asked its polymer supplier, Innovia, to find an alternative. The central bank said that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an extremely small amount of tallow is used in an early stage of the production process of polymer pellets, which are then used to create the base substrate for the five pound note\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The Australian pioneer of the polymer bank note has now waded into the row, saying it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stupid\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that vegetarian and vegans are protesting in the UK about the five pound polymer note containing tallow. Professor David Solomon told the Australian radio station 2GB: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stupid. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s absolutely stupid. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trivial amounts of it in there.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Solomon said polymer notes were extremely hard to forge and had a lot more benefits for the consumer than previous paper notes. It picks up less drugs than paper notes and you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t chop down trees. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more hygienic than a paper note by a long way.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US non-farm payrolls day, always a big event for the US dollar. Analysts are forecasting that 175,000 jobs were created in November, up from 161,000 in October. The Federal Reserve is already widely expected to raise interest rates in December as recent economic data have mostly been strong. Yesterday surveys showed manufacturing grew faster than expected in November. Here in the UK, we will get a monthly industry survey on construction at 9:30am GMT. Oil is drifting lower this morning, after hitting a one-year high following the Saudi-led Opec cartel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement to cut output on Wednesday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the first such agreement in eight years. Russia, the biggest non-Opec oil producer, also agreed to reduce its output gradually. Brent crude is trading at $53.37, down 1%. European stocks are expected to open lower.",

It is the first time in five years the economy has recorded three months of negative growth.

The Bureau of Statistics data showed economic activity contracted in a range of areas in the last quarter, highlighting the ongoing fragility of the economy. Falls in public expenditure, net exports, private investment in new buildings, new engineering, and new and used dwellings all detracted significantly from growth. Mining investment fell for the 12th consecutive quarter (down 10.6%), while non-mining investment rose by 4.8%. Westpac economist Andrew Hanlan said one of the wettest winters on record caused disruptions, contributing to the unexpected decline in home building activity \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including a 9% fall in new home building activity in Victoria. He said lending conditions were tightened in the second half of 2015, with housing finance contracting over the half year to March 2016, and that had negative spill-over effects. He said global growth and trade had also been lacklustre this year, while the labour market had been weaker than last year. Michael Blythe, the chief economist of the Commonwealth Bank, said growth was also affected by the election campaign in June and July, when measures of economic and political uncertainty spiked to near-record highs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This uncertainty had a real economic impact on consumer and business activity,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he wrote in a note to clients. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is not surprising that some economic drivers weakened at the time.

Time for a market update. The dollar is still down around 0.5% at US74.30c as investors weigh up the increased possibility that the RBA will cut interest rates next year. Perhaps even twice, some think. The share market meanwhile, is much more positive and the ASX/S&amp;P200 has put on 0.8% today to sit at 5476.3 points. Stock markets across the region were mostly positive thanks to the Dow Jones average closing at another record high on Tuesday night. The Nikkei was up 0.6%, the Hang Seng 0.35% but the Kospi in Korea is down slightly. Steven Knight of the brokerage Blackwell Global has a broader analysis of the outlook for Australia, which he decribes as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vulnerable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd because of the 12th successive quarterly drop in private investment. He thinks the pick up in oil, coal and iron ore prices in the past six months will cushion any continued lack of investment but the question is what happens when, if seems likely, demand for the big commodities levels off again: This highlights the lack of GDP diversity in the Australian economy and the fact that transition of capital to the services and retail industry has been sluggish at best. Australian growth needs to come from spending, investment and increased employment and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s difficult to see where that is likely to come from with expectations at the currently low level. Subsequently, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP release is likely to be seen as a wake-up call to both the markets and the Reserve Bank of Australia. Although the RBA recently elected to keep the cash rate on hold at 1.50% the reality is that the latest round of data all but assures near term rate cuts. My view is that we are likely to see 50bps shaved from interest rates over the next six months in an attempt to provide some much-needed stimulus. The Guardian columnist Stephen Koukoulas agrees with the folk at Capital. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just filed his thoughts on the GDP figures and points the finger at policy failures by the Coalition and the Reserve Bank \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the former for cutting spending into a downturn in the economy and the latter for failing to spot the threat from deflation quickly enough and leaving rates too high. He writes: Quite obviously, the RBA should have cut interest rates earlier and harder, not least to free up cash flow for the business sector and indebted households but also to take some air out of the Australian dollar, which has been strong against most global currencies. It should and probably will cut interest rates again but will likely wait until its next meeting in February to do so. Better late than never. Staying with rates, and the number crunchers at Capital Economics reckon that the RBA will be forced to cut the cash rate to 1% next year and the dollar will drop below US70c. Although they think the economy will get back to growth in the fourth quarter \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in line with most expectations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they see borrowing costs coming down again. This is only the fourth fall in GDP in 25 years, which highlights that the economic backdrop is not consistent with a big rise in underlying inflation. This supports our view that interest rates may fall from 1.5% to 1% next year, which could drag the Australian dollar below US$0.70. The question of where interest rates will go from here is likely to be much debated from now until the next Reserve Bank meeting in February. Craig James of CommSec said earlier that the GDP print meant that the recent talk of a possible rates hike was off the table. This what he said in his note: The Reserve Bank warned [on Tuesday] that annual economic growth would slow before it picked up in 2017. That is our expectation also. The economy should grow near its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpotential\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rate of 3% in 2017. We continue to believe that interest rates will remain on hold in coming months. But no one will be thinking of rate hikes any time soon. The Coalition will be desperate to avoid Australia entering a slump with another negative print for the fourth quarter. The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prized triple-AAA credit rating is already under threat and Scott Morrison will do his bext with his midyear fiscal and economic outlook on 19 December to persuade the rating agencies and the markets that he has the situation under control. Most analysts, including Shane Oliver from AMP and Craig James from CommSec, agree that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s number is likely to a one-off and that Australia will bounce back into positive territory next time. Ben Jarman at JP Morgan in Sydney is a little more circumspect. While he agrees that the weather-hit building industry should bounce back in the fourth quarter, household spending is weak and could drag on the overall figure. Consumer spending growth is 2% annualised over the last six months. This is occurring at a time where the business surveys have already soured somewhat and retail spending momentum has been fading. The breadth of the contraction in construction activity does indeed seem consistent with weather effects. At the least this makes a quarterly GDP growth outcome of 1% for 4Q17 achievable. And there is precedent for output consistently surging back after weather-related disruptions over several quarters: after a slight 0.2% contraction during the 2011 Queensland floods, which badly disrupted coal export output, GDP growth averaged 1.1% for four straight quarters. However, the level of weather disruption did not appear to be anywhere near that scale on this occasion, and the underlying trend in domestic demand back then was much stronger, as mining capex was in full flight. So much as the RBA governor yesterday positioned for a temporary lull in growth, with inflation very weak the rebound needs to be fast, and convincing. On the early tracking, the bounce-back in 4Q GDP is unlikely to be sufficient to avoid downward revisions in the RBA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s February statement of monetary policy. Great chart courtesy of our friends at Business Insider showing the quarterly dips of the past 25 years. The trade minister, Steve Ciobo, has been speaking about the figures from Jakarta where he is on government business. He admits the numbers are disappointing but the government is focusing on policies to boost economic growth. This is what he told Bloomberg: Trade export deals are a key part of that and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why as a Coalition we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve focused on locking into place very high-quality trade deals between Australia, South Korea, China and Japan. So the number is down and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not what we would expect as ideal but our annualised growth rate still sits above the OECD average. Looking on the bright side, there are good reasons to think that the decline in GDP won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be repeated in the December quarter and that Australia will avoid slipping into recession. The main reason is that the terms of trade improved by 4.5% in the third quarter thanks to rising commodity prices. That trend has continued in recent weeks and should benefit the bottom line when the next round of GDP figures come out in the new year. Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital, said: I see this as a one-off because some of the factors which dragged down growth were reversed in the current quarter. Housing and public investment will bounce back, retail spending has recently picked up pace and the boom in resource exports will resume. Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP has shrunk by 0.5% in the September quarter thanks to a slump in construction output and weak public spending It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only the fourth such decline in the past 25 years The Aussie dollar has sunk 0.5%, buying US74.26c, while the ASX200 shrugs off the news on the hope of more stimulus Treasurer Scott Morrison says the figures \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdemand support for his policies of jobs and growth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Commsec chief economist Craig James says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153perfect storm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The ASX/S&amp;P 200 has taken the poor GDP reading in its stride with miners and banks driving the benchmark index higher today. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently up 32.9 points at 5,461.60, a rise of 0.61%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a result of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bad news is good news\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd paradox that has gripped the financial markets since the end of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central banks started their various money-printing schemes in 2008 ie, the worse the news is from the real world, the more stocks bounce in the hope that the bad news will force central banks to kickstart the economy. Reuters quotes Tony Farnham, an economist with Patersons Securities: The poor GDP data has people expecting more accommodating policy. The accommodation can be either through friendlier monetary policy or alternatively it could be increased fiscal policy, by that I mean increased government expenditure ideally in the capex side and infrastructure side. For more on the bad news/good news conundrum, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some analysis from our economics editor Larry Elliott from earlier in the year. The GDP contraction has taken a chunk out of the Aussie dollar. It has fallen 0.46% against the US dollar to US74.26c. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also fallen against other currencies, including a drop of 0.31% against the pound. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s buying 58.65p at the moment. My colleague Gareth Hutchens has written our main news story on the GDP figures which you can read here. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got lots of reaction, including this from James Pearson, the chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who has called for corporate tax cuts. Australia must not be like the frog in the pot of water that is slowly brought to boil. To regain our competitiveness, and therefore create and sustain jobs, we must encourage our businesses, which employ most Australian workers, to invest and grow. That includes by cutting the burden of company tax to stimulate investment. The 0.5% contraction has surprised a lot of people because the consensus forecast among economists was 0.2%, according to those surveyed by Australian Associated press. TD Securities chief Asia-Pacific macro strategist Annette Beacher told AAP that the Reserve Bank would now be trying to work out whether Australia was halfway to a recession, which is defined by two quarters of economic contraction. I think they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be spending the afternoon figuring out to what extent are these one-offs, and can we get rebound in [the fourth quarter]. Will private consumption rebound, will the dwelling sector rebound, will the public sector rebound? They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be spending more time looking at that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, Beacher said she thought the dips across the different sectors such as construction and federal capital spending, were more likely an unfortunate coincidence that makes a Christmas recession unlikely. Commsec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist Craig James says the figures will turn out to be a blip, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153but a very important blip\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Australians of all stripes have become complacent, he says, and have stopped spending and investing. Infrastructure spending will have to take its place to provide \u00e2\u20ac\u0153momentum\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the economy in the coming months. But overall he blamed the uncertainty generated by Brexit and Trump for the decline in GDP. In the September quarter the economy was hit by a perfect storm. Not only was there the reaction to the UK \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBrexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 vote, there was also the federal election and then there was the uncertainty about the US elections. And clearly, when there is a lot of uncertainty around, consumers and businesses tend to delay decisions to spend, invest and employ. A big fall in public investment also accounted for the bulk of the contraction of activity in the quarter. While spending measures of the economy were weak in the September quarter, income measures were actually quite strong. And the farm sector was also strong in the quarter and should also be a key contributor to growth in coming quarters. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe there are grounds for another quarter of contraction. The shadow treasurer is speaking in Canberra now and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talking about the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deeply disappointing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd figures that Scott Morrison \u00e2\u20ac\u0153could hardly bring himself to mention\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. After a fair bit of qualification he calls it the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153second worst economic performance for 25 years\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and calls on Morrison to take responsibility for the problem. The fact of the matter is that this is just the fourth negative quarter in 100 quarters in Australia. Just the fourth negative quarter since 1991. And in fact, the only other occasions that this has occurred over the last 25 years, there have been very good and clear reasons for it. For example, in 2011 Australia was dealing with Cyclone Yasi. In 2009, the greatest economic downturn since the great depression internationally. And of course the aftermath of the Sydney Olympics. Now, in other words, this is the second worst economic growth result in the last 25 years. Morrison says the figures aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just a wake up call, but rather serve as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153demand\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for everyone else to support his policies for jobs and growth. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more from his opening remarks to the press conference which has just ended: The Turnbull government will never take economic growth for granted, ever. In the 12 months to the end of September our economy grew by 1.8%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down from 3.1% achieved at the end of June. Our growth is still higher than six out of seven G7 economies, second only to the United Kingdom, higher than the US, Canada, Japan, Germany and higher than the OECD average. The contraction recorded in real GDP in the September quarter is not just a reminder, not just a wake up call or a warning about being complacent when it comes to economic growth. It is a demand to support economic policies that drive the investment needed for job security, the hours and wages that hard-working Australians need to cope with the rising cost of living, especially on electricity costs, and that businesses need to survive in a tough and competieve environment. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nationals accounts data demmands the support in the national interest for the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic plan for jobs and growth that we outlined this year. It demands it in the national interest. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, has fronted the media in Canberra to try to explain the dire figures which show the annual growth rate down to 1.8 per cent. The figures are not just a reminder or a wake-up call about being complacent, but rather a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153demand to support economic policies that drive the investment needed to support job security\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Morrison said. The ABS is fairly clear about the reasons for the shrinking of the economy. In its press release on the figures, it says the 3.6% decline in output of the construction industry \u00e2\u20ac\u0153was the largest contributor to the fall in GDP growth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on an industry basis. It said other industries such as financial and insurance services, professional scientific and technical services, rental hiring and real estate services and administrative support services also contributed to the overall decline. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full statement: The volume of activity in the Australian economy decreased 0.5% in the September quarter 2016, the first quarter of negative growth since the Queensland flood affected March quarter 2011. Through the year growth remains positive at 1.8%, reflecting the three previous quarters of growth. Economic activity contracted in a number of areas this quarter. Private investment in new buildings detracted 0.3 percentage points from GDP growth, while new engineering and new and used dwellings detracted 0.2 and 0.1 percentage points respectively. Public capital expenditure detracted 0.5 percentage points from growth as it declined from elevated levels in the June quarter. Net exports detracted an additional 0.2 percentage points from growth. Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s terms of trade rose 4.5% through the September quarter. The reduced building activity is reflected in the output of the construction industry which fell 3.6% for the quarter and was the largest contributor to the fall in GDP growth on an industry basis. A number of other industries also recorded below trend growth, or declined, this quarter, including financial and insurance services, professional scientific and technical services, rental hiring and real estate services and administrative support services. The largest offset to these falls was agriculture which grew 7.5 per cent. Mining production contributed no growth, but maintained its historically high levels of production. Subdued activity in the building industry contributed to a decline in the income of small businesses, with gross mixed income down 5.8%. Private non-financial corporation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gross operating surplus increased 1.2%, supported by stronger mining commodity prices. Compensation of employees increased 1.3%, and real gross national income increased 0.9% for the quarter to be 3.2% higher through the year. The ABS bad news for the Aussie dollar which fell sharply on the news and is currently trading at US74.24c. Stock market investors were more sanguine, however, with the ASX/S&amp;P 200 index up 0.5% on the morning. Good morning and welcome to the live blog on reaction to the surprisingly poor GDP figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics today. They showed that the economy shrank by 0.5% in the three months to the end of September, the first negative quarter for five years and only the fourth for more than two decades. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be bringing you reaction from Canberra and the rest of the country, plus everything from the markets. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our first news story from Gareth Hutchens in Canberra.",

Helena Smith reports:</p> <blockquote> <p>Most EU member states would relish overhauling a relic of old times like the ban on Sunday shopping.

Instead the Washington-based body, which is still negotiating its participation in Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest bailout, has stepped up demands for trade to be liberalised saying shops should remain open on Sundays. Moreover, it argues, the reform will give people work in a nation hobbled by record levels of unemployment. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee0ef26b8d2e15ff056b047891469ac5449d2090\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee0ef26b8d2e15ff056b047891469ac5449d2090/0_117_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"IMF wants Greek shops to open on Sunday\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">IMF wants Greek shops to open on Sunday</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Hartmann/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>In its splash today, the daily Ethnos newspaper, citing a leaked email from the IMF, reports that closure of an ongoing review of the economy by creditors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the second since Athens received its third bailout last summer \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is now contingent on shops opening up for commerce on Sundays.

It said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Fitch Ratings has revised the 2017 sector outlook for Irish banks to stable from positive, as the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote to leave the EU increases uncertainty for the operating environment. Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic recovery should remain strong in the short term, underpinning the stable sector outlook. The rating outlook on Irish banks is positive, reflecting our expectation that improving bank credit fundamentals should outweigh these challenges.</p> <p> Brexit is negative for Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term economic and political prospects, putting pressure on GDP growth and creating uncertainty around relations with Northern Ireland. The extent of any weakening of the bank operating environment, triggered by a slowdown of GDP growth in the UK, sterling depreciation, or potential trade barriers, will become clear only as EU-UK negotiations develop. A deterioration in the operating environment could slow any improvements in the asset quality and capitalisation of Irish banks...</p> <p>Capitalisation, although improving, remains vulnerable. We expect capital ratios to strengthen in 2017, despite pressure from volatility in pension fund deficits and foreign-exchange markets. Fully-loaded regulatory capital ratios remain weaker than international peers, primarily due to large amounts of deferred tax assets; these assets are reducing slowly because of Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s low corporate tax rate and relatively low levels of profitability compared to the size of the balance sheet. Large, albeit reducing, stocks of unreserved problem assets also leave Irish banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 capitalisation more exposed if the operating environment deteriorates.</p> <p> Further improvements in asset quality and capitalisation would improve the banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 risk profiles and may result in ratings upgrades; this is why the ratings outlook for Irish banks is positive. Although uncertainty as regards the operating environment has increased, we believe credit fundamentals will improve in 2017, as the sector continues to work through its backlog of impaired loans. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58480e3fe4b08659393b9c28\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-07T14:24:10.255Z\">2.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>But...

                "bodyText":"Hopes that Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks can be bailed out one way or another - private investors, state aid or the European bailout fund - continue to support stock markets. And the expectation that the European Central Bank may extend its bond buying programme for a few more months is also providing some support. On Wall Street the global surge in banking stocks helped push both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500 to new intra-day peaks, although pharmaceutical shares were under pressure after president-elect Donald Trump said he would look at cutting drug prices. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 1.81% or 122.39 points at 6902.23 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax jumped 1.96% to 10,986.69 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 1.36% at 4694.72 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB rose 2.1% to 18,130.66 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.75% at 8960.4 In Greece, the Athens market added 2.82% to 640.07 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 92 points or 0.48% at 19344, close to the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highs. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. In Greece tensions over reforms are once again mounting with creditors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this time over an IMF demand that shops remain open for business on Sundays. Helena Smith reports: Most EU member states would relish overhauling a relic of old times like the ban on Sunday shopping. In Greece, though, it is the sort of measure that makes for front-page splashes, conspiracy theory and cries of protest. But the International Monetary Fund, in the spirit of further opening up one of the continent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most sclerotic economies, is not letting go. Instead the Washington-based body, which is still negotiating its participation in Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest bailout, has stepped up demands for trade to be liberalised saying shops should remain open on Sundays. Moreover, it argues, the reform will give people work in a nation hobbled by record levels of unemployment. In its splash today, the daily Ethnos newspaper, citing a leaked email from the IMF, reports that closure of an ongoing review of the economy by creditors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the second since Athens received its third bailout last summer \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is now contingent on shops opening up for commerce on Sundays. The organisation wants the measure to be signed and sealed this month. So far the response has been negative. Ministry of finance officials told the paper that, instead, they will push through an amendment that will allow shops in specially defined tourist areas to stay open. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unlikely to pass muster with lenders who have signalled they are going to rachet up the pressure on Greece to enforce the sort of reforms that will make it more competitive. Ideologically, the governing leftwing Syriza party is said to be against the move on the grounds that it will not only benefit bigger stores but is an infringement of basic workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rights. The Greek Orthodox Church has already likened the step to a sin and shop employees, who have already taken to the streets, are girding for further battle. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our full story on Matteo Renzi planning to resign later as Italian prime minister: One of the factors supporting the market rally is the expectation that the European Central Bank could announce an extension of its bond buying programme following its latest meeting on Thursday: [APP is the asset purchase programme] That hope, and optimism that Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s struggling banks can somehow be recapitalised, have combined to send European markets higher, with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax up 1.8%, France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac 1.1%, the FTSE 100 1.6% and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB 1.5%. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average has hit a new intra-day record of 19,276, despite concerns about healthcare companies after Donald Trump said he would look at drug pricing. Back in the UK and some good news for steel workers at Port Talbot: Markets continue to be buoyed by hopes of a resolution to Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking problems. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: With the Italian government passing its 2017 budget, and Mario Renzi confirming he will resign this evening, the European markets maintained their banking-boosted growth this Wednesday. The continued lack of fuss following the Italian referendum result, combined with the prospect of a Monte dei Paschi bailout (potentially as soon as this week), has led the European indices to a bevy of highs this afternoon. The CAC is still at an 11 month peak, while the DAX, following a near 200 point rise, is at its best price in exactly a year. The highs hit by the FTSE were a bit less impressive, though its 110 point increase does leave the UK index just 10 points away from 6900, a level it hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen since November 10th. While most of the pan-European growth has been inspired by the rallying banking sector, the FTSE has also benefited from a commodity stock rebound and the latest pound-plunge, with sterling shedding 0.8% against the dollar and 1.1% against the euro. But Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, warned markets could be getting ahead of themselves: Talk that the Italian banking system could be on the verge of a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15bn bailout from the European Stability Mechanism has pushed equity markets in Europe to their highest levels in several months... While the reports of a bailout request have been denied the usual rule of thumb when these sorts of reports do the rounds is that there is usually an element of truth to them, even if we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know the exact mechanics, and markets are responding to that. As with most things the devil is likely to be in the detail, and the likely strings that are likely to be attached to any aid request, if and when it comes. It is here that markets could be getting ahead of themselves. Well it seems Matteo Renzi will not be staying on as Italian prime minister after all and plans to resign this evening now the budget has been passed. He tweeted: AP reports: Italian Premier Matteo Renzi says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll resign now that Parliament has completed approval of the 2017 national budget. Renzi had offered his resignation two days earlier to President Sergio Mattarella following his humiliating defeat in a government-backed voter referendum on reforms. But Mattarella told him to stay in office until passage of the budget law, which was done Wednesday afternoon. Renzi tweeted that he plans to go to the president to resign at 7 p.m. (1800 GMT). Following the poor UK manufacturing figures earlier, comes news that the economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth has flattened in the last few weeks, according to a leading think tank. The National Institute of Economic and Social Reseach has estimated that UK output grew by 0.4% in the three months to the end of November, the same as in the three months to October. But it warned a slowdown was ahead. The think tank said the economy was being supported by the service sector, which was borne out by the earlier weak manufacturing figures. Rebecca Piggott, research fellow at NIESR, said: Recent economic growth has been driven almost entirely by the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s broad service sector, supported by robust consumer spending. In stark contrast, the official figures suggest that the production and construction sectors of the economy have declined over recent months. Looking ahead, we do not expect such buoyant consumer spending growth to persist. Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pronounced depreciation this year is expected to pass through to the consumer prices throughout the course of 2017 and 2018, eroding the purchasing power of households substantially. NIESR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest quarterly forecast published just over a month ago forecast GDP growth of 2% per annum in 2016 and 1.4% in 2017. CPI inflation was expected to reach 3.8% at the end of 2017. Another area likely to be hit by the uncertainty of the UK leaving the EU is the Irish banking sector, according to ratings agency Fitch. It said: Fitch Ratings has revised the 2017 sector outlook for Irish banks to stable from positive, as the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote to leave the EU increases uncertainty for the operating environment. Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic recovery should remain strong in the short term, underpinning the stable sector outlook. The rating outlook on Irish banks is positive, reflecting our expectation that improving bank credit fundamentals should outweigh these challenges. Brexit is negative for Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term economic and political prospects, putting pressure on GDP growth and creating uncertainty around relations with Northern Ireland. The extent of any weakening of the bank operating environment, triggered by a slowdown of GDP growth in the UK, sterling depreciation, or potential trade barriers, will become clear only as EU-UK negotiations develop. A deterioration in the operating environment could slow any improvements in the asset quality and capitalisation of Irish banks... Capitalisation, although improving, remains vulnerable. We expect capital ratios to strengthen in 2017, despite pressure from volatility in pension fund deficits and foreign-exchange markets. Fully-loaded regulatory capital ratios remain weaker than international peers, primarily due to large amounts of deferred tax assets; these assets are reducing slowly because of Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s low corporate tax rate and relatively low levels of profitability compared to the size of the balance sheet. Large, albeit reducing, stocks of unreserved problem assets also leave Irish banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 capitalisation more exposed if the operating environment deteriorates. Further improvements in asset quality and capitalisation would improve the banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 risk profiles and may result in ratings upgrades; this is why the ratings outlook for Irish banks is positive. Although uncertainty as regards the operating environment has increased, we believe credit fundamentals will improve in 2017, as the sector continues to work through its backlog of impaired loans. But... Bloomberg is reporting that Renzi might be having second thoughts about stepping down. They say: Matteo Renzi is wavering on whether to stay on as Italian prime minister despite his resignation offer after Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum defeat, according to a senior state official. President Sergio Mattarella wants Renzi to reconsider his decision in order to provide political and economic stability, said the official, who asked not to be named because the issue is confidential. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story. Newsflash! After a debate today. the Italian Senate just approved the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2017 budget. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the last order of business before Matteo Renzi can formally step down as prime minister. Renzi now also expected to meet with senior members of his Democratic Party this afternoon, to discuss the next steps - including whether he remains as party leader. Back in the markets, European stocks are hitting multi-month highs on continued optimism that Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking sector will receive much-needed fresh capital soon. Every index is sharply higher today, with some traders speculating that the fabled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Santa Rally\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd might be kicking off (stock markets often rally in the run-up to Christmas). Over in Milan, Monte dei Paschi is still having a good day, up 8%, following the reports that the Italian government could take a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2bn stake in the bank. And the suggestions that Rome could turn to the ESM for a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15bn bank bailout continues to calm fears of an imminent financial crisis. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says: Even the prospect of a nationalisation [of Monte dei Paschi], potentially as early as this weekend, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spooking the markets as it may avoid retail bondholders having to take any losses. The FTSE 100 index is now up by 100 points, or 1.5% at 6880 -- a chunky rise. However, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly because the pound fell at 9.30am when October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak UK manufacturing data were released. The German Dax is still at a one-year high, the French CAC is at its highest level since January, and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB it at its highest level since June. EC antitrust commissioner Margrethe Vestager declined to comment directly on the Monte dei Paschi rescue talks. But she did point out that the commission is keen to support citizens who have been missold financial products. That could be significant, as the small retail investors who own Italian bank bonds may argue that they were deceived about the risk of being possibly \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbailed into\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 a rescue. And some analysts reckon the Italian government could circumvent those new bail-in rules by compensating these small investors. Vestager told reporters in Brussels that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One of the things that we are working with is tools to enable governments to compensate for mis-selling of different kinds. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is something we have set up before. We will work with governments again if they want to set up schemes that can allow citizens to be compensated if mis-selling has been taking place.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The European Commission have got a fight on their hands over today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Euribor fines. JP Morgan and HSBC have both announced that reject the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conclusions that they breached antitrust laws, and will fight on to try to prove it. A spokeswoman for JP Morgan (fined \u00e2\u201a\u00ac337m today) says the bank could launch an appeal: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have cooperated fully with the European Commission throughout its five year investigation. We did not engage in any wrongdoing with respect to the EURIBOR benchmark. We will continue to vigorously defend our position against these allegations, including through possible appeals to the European courts.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd HSBC (fined \u00e2\u201a\u00ac33m) is also adamant that it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take part in a cartel: The European Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision relates to allegations of Euribor manipulation and related purported conduct during the course of one month in early 2007. We believe we did not participate in an anti-competitive cartel. We are reviewing the European Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision and considering our legal options. French bank Credit Agricole is refusing to accept that it breached antitrust rules! In a short, sharp statement, it says: Cr\u00c3\u00a9dit Agricole takes note of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision of the European Commission in the Euribor case. Cr\u00c3\u00a9dit Agricole firmly believes that it did not infringe competition law. Accordingly, it will appeal the Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision before the European courts. Payment of the fine will not affect the 2016 financial statements given the provisions set aside previously. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fines mark the end of the euribor scandal, hopefully, Vestager continues. But.... The Commission will not hesitate to investigate and sanction any other cartel it may uncover in the future in the financial industry. Commissioner Vestager is outlining the euribor ruling now. You can watch it live here. She says JP Morgan, HSBC and Credit Agricole all breached antitrust rules by conspiring to rig the euribor rate. The euribor market is means to provide protection from market volatility in euro-denominated securities, Vestager says. If this market is rigged, it will benefit only a few. Traders used IM services and corporate chatrooms to exchange confidential information to distort the euribor rate to serve their own interests, she adds. Euribor was calculated from submissions from individual banks, which created the ability to rig it. Vestager cites one example, from 19th March 2007, in which the cartel members decided they would benefit from a lower euribor rate. So, weeks earlier, they conspired to submit low numbers to the committee which calculated the daily figure. (this will sound depressingly familiar to anyone who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s read about the Libor scandal). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the details of the euribor-rigging fines just announced by the EC. JPMorgan: \u00e2\u201a\u00ac337.2m HSBC: \u00e2\u201a\u00ac33.6m Credit Agricole: \u00e2\u201a\u00ac114.7m Margrethe Vestager, the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s antitrust commissioner, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Banks have to respect EU competition rules just like any other company operating in the single market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd These fines come three years after four other banks were fined over Euribor rigging, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, RBS and Societe Generale. Newsflash! The European commission has fined Cr\u00c2\u00b4dit Agricole, HSBC and JP Morgan a combined total of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac485m for their role in the Euribor fixing scandal. This is the case in which traders were accused of conspiring to rig the official rates at which banks would lend to each other in various currencies (euros, in this case) More to follow.... City experts are pretty unimpressed by the slide in UK manufacturing in October: That disappointing UK manufacturing report has hit the pound, sending it down 0.5% against the US dollar: The Office for National Statistics reports that most areas of manufacturing struggled in October, led by pharmaceuticals, where output shrank by 3.6%. This chart shows how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector weakened in October, after two months of gains: Breaking: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial sector has suffered its biggest fall in output sine 2012. UK industrial production shrank by 1.3% in October, dashing hopes of a 0.2% rise. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly due to the temporary shutdown of the Buzzard oil field in the North Sea. But... manufacturing certainly had a poor month too. Output across manufacturing firms fell by 0.9% in October. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the weakest performance since February, and will raise fears that the economy is weakening. Economist Mark Astley says the figures are much weaker than expected. Investec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Philip Shaw hopes that the underlying picture is better. Every single Italian bank share has risen this morning, led by Monte dei Paschi which is currently 7.7% higher. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout fund has just said that it hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t received a request for help from Italy, and hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t had any discussions about a possible programme. Asked about reports that Rome is planning a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15bn bailout request for its banks, a spokesman for the European Stability Mechanism says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is no request and there are no discussions with theItalian authorities on an ESM loan.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However...this denial doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that Italy isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t preparing a request for help from the ESM, of course.... Looking away from Italy, the big news this morning is that drugs giant Pfizer has been hit with a record fine after the price charged to the NHS for an anti-epilepsy drug was hiked by up to 2,600%. Boom! Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX stock market has hit its highest level in a year, while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC is at an 11-month high. Optimism is rife in the City that a recapitalisation solution for troubled Italian bank Monte dei Paschi is in the pipeline, says Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets However, this could be via Italy applying for a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15bn loan from Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ESM to help recapitalise several troubled banks and not just MPS which would avoid the issue of illegal state aid/bailout. Mizuho strategist Antoine Bouvet says investors are hopeful that Rome will get a grip on the crisis: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite the fact that the probability of early elections has risen, the market is focusing on the banking sector and the fact the government seems to be showing more urgency in dealing with that problem.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However.... financial analyst Dan Davies (who actually owns some MPS shares, bold lad) isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced that a bailout will benefit shareholders. European stock markets are all rallying this morning, with banking stocks boosted by Italian bailout hopes. The main indices are up around 1%, pushing the FTSE 100 up by almost 60 points to 6837. La Stampa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report that Italy may seek European help for its banks is cheering the City: In London, mining stocks are also gaining ground, with Rio Tinto and Antofagasta both up 4%. Shares in Monte Dei Paschi have jumped by 9% at the start of trading in Milan, on hopes that Italy can pull off a rescue package. Other Italian banks are rallying too, driving the whole sector up 3%. Traders are reacting to La Stampa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that Italy could seek a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15bn bailout (even though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just been denied) They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also comforted by Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 overnight report that Italy could take a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2bn stake in Monte dei Paschi, in a bid to: a) encourage private investors to back the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn cash call b) avoid inflicting losses on small retail investors who hold MPS bonds. One source told Reuters that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a de-facto nationalisation with a strong presence by the state that can attract other investors and allow the transaction to be completed. Italian government debt is rallying this morning, pushing the yield (interest rate) on its 10-year debt down to 1.91%, from 1.97%. That has narrowed the gap between Italian and German borrowing costs - a key measure of stress in the eurozone. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s La Stampa newspaper is reporting that Rome is considering seeking a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15bn loan from European authorities, to recapitalise its banking sector. According to the report, Italy would use the funds to shore up several banks, not just Monte dei Paschi. In return, Rome would have to commit to tightening its 2017 budget (which might be tricky, given the political void at present). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an intriguing idea, with one problem....it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just been denied by Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Treasury department. But how could it happen? These funds would come from the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), which is Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout fund. Spain took a similar loan a few years ago, which helped it avoid falling into a financial crisis. The attraction for Italy would that such a loan would come with fewer strings attached than a full-scale bailout. But there would still be some conditions, and monitoring of its banks by Brussels. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Three days on from Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s constitutional referendum, the future of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker banks still hangs in the balance. Monte de Paschi di Siena (MPS), the oldest and most troubled of the Italian banks, is making a final push to persuade investors to back its \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn cash call. But prime minister Matteo Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation may force Monte dei Paschi into seeking some form of help from the state, as investors have been spooked by the uncertainty gripping the Italian political system. Reuters reported last night that the Italian government could take a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2bn controlling stake in MPS, which would lift the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stake up to 40%. That could also provide compensation for the small retail investors who hold some of its bonds. And there is still talk that a public rescue plan could be cobbled together by the weekend, possibly even with some fund from Europe? All may become clearer today... #NoPromises Also coming up today: The European Commission could hit HSBC, JPMorgan and Cr\u00c3\u00a9dit Agricole with multimillion-euro fines later today for rigging the Euribor interest rate benchmark. Australia has sent a shiver through the global economy by reporting that its economy shrank by 0.5% in the last quarter; only the fourth such decline in 25 years. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how the story unfolded: On the economic front, we get: German industrial production for October (just released, more on that shortly) UK industrial production for October. at 9.30am GMT The NIESR think tank estimates UK GDP for September-November, at 3pm GMT",

                "body":"<p>The European Central Bank has vowed to continue with its programme of electronic money printing to shore up the eurozone recovery but surprised financial markets by reducing the amount of stimulus it expects to provide each month.</p> <p>The single currency bloc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank <a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2016/html/pr161208.en.html\">left interest rates unchanged</a> and said it would continue its programme of quantitative easing (QE) to next December or beyond \u00e2\u20ac\u0153if necessary\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, marking an extension to its previous guidance that the scheme would run until the end of March.</p> <p>However, the value of the bonds bought by the ECB per month under the QE programme will drop to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn (\u00c2\u00a351bn) from April next year, from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac80bn currently. The ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s QE scheme involves creating electronic cash to buy sovereign and corporate debt to counter anaemic economic growth and low inflation. </p> <p>ECB president Mario Draghi insisted the central bank would remain ready to beef up its support for the eurozone economy as needed and rebuffed suggestions the plans for more modest bond-buying from next spring represented \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tapering\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, a process by which QE is wound down.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is no question about tapering. Tapering has not been discussed today,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told a news conference after the latest ECB policy meeting.<br></p> <p>Draghi has previously talked about doing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/26/euro-irreversible-mario-draghi-ecb\">whatever it takes</a>\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to support the currency bloc and on Thursday sought to send a similarly reassuring message. </p> <p>He said the policy of low rates \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main interest rate is at zero \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and QE was supporting demand in the eurozone and the economy was expected to continue growing at a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153moderate but firming\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd pace. But if things took a turn for the worse, and inflation failed to pick up enough, the ECB could increase its bond-buying again and/or extend the scheme, he added.<br></p> <p>The ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own inflation outlook suggested such moves to increase bond-buying could well be warranted. It is forecasting inflation of just 1.3% next year, 1.5% in 2018 and 1.7% in 2019. When asked if that counted as meeting the ECB target of inflation below but close to 2%, Draghi said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Not really, so we have to persist.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd<br></p> <p>The central bank is expecting only modest economic growth for the eurozone over coming years. It believes GDP growth this year will come in at 1.7%, will match that pace again in 2017 and then ease to 1.6% in 2018 and 2019.</p> <p>Jennifer McKeown, at the consultancy Capital Economics, noted how the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s language reflected a climate of heightened political uncertainty.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Presumably, the Bank has been encouraged by signs that the economy is performing well in the face of political uncertainty at home and abroad. However, it clearly remains in cautious mode,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153In all, we see a significant chance that the ECB will have to increase the pace of its asset purchases again next year. And even if it does not, policy will be far more supportive than in the US, leading the euro to depreciate further.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Draghi flagged up that uncertain climate in his press conference, referring to upcoming elections in France, the Netherlands and Germany.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Just look at the election calendar for the year to come.

                "bodyText":"The European Central Bank has vowed to continue with its programme of electronic money printing to shore up the eurozone recovery but surprised financial markets by reducing the amount of stimulus it expects to provide each month. The single currency bloc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank left interest rates unchanged and said it would continue its programme of quantitative easing (QE) to next December or beyond \u00e2\u20ac\u0153if necessary\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, marking an extension to its previous guidance that the scheme would run until the end of March. However, the value of the bonds bought by the ECB per month under the QE programme will drop to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn (\u00c2\u00a351bn) from April next year, from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac80bn currently. The ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s QE scheme involves creating electronic cash to buy sovereign and corporate debt to counter anaemic economic growth and low inflation. ECB president Mario Draghi insisted the central bank would remain ready to beef up its support for the eurozone economy as needed and rebuffed suggestions the plans for more modest bond-buying from next spring represented \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tapering\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, a process by which QE is wound down. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is no question about tapering. Tapering has not been discussed today,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told a news conference after the latest ECB policy meeting. Draghi has previously talked about doing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153whatever it takes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to support the currency bloc and on Thursday sought to send a similarly reassuring message. He said the policy of low rates \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main interest rate is at zero \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and QE was supporting demand in the eurozone and the economy was expected to continue growing at a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153moderate but firming\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd pace. But if things took a turn for the worse, and inflation failed to pick up enough, the ECB could increase its bond-buying again and/or extend the scheme, he added. The ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own inflation outlook suggested such moves to increase bond-buying could well be warranted. It is forecasting inflation of just 1.3% next year, 1.5% in 2018 and 1.7% in 2019. When asked if that counted as meeting the ECB target of inflation below but close to 2%, Draghi said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Not really, so we have to persist.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The central bank is expecting only modest economic growth for the eurozone over coming years. It believes GDP growth this year will come in at 1.7%, will match that pace again in 2017 and then ease to 1.6% in 2018 and 2019. Jennifer McKeown, at the consultancy Capital Economics, noted how the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s language reflected a climate of heightened political uncertainty. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Presumably, the Bank has been encouraged by signs that the economy is performing well in the face of political uncertainty at home and abroad. However, it clearly remains in cautious mode,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In all, we see a significant chance that the ECB will have to increase the pace of its asset purchases again next year. And even if it does not, policy will be far more supportive than in the US, leading the euro to depreciate further.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Draghi flagged up that uncertain climate in his press conference, referring to upcoming elections in France, the Netherlands and Germany. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Just look at the election calendar for the year to come. That is by itself a source of uncertainty. Look at the rest of the world. Look at what is happening with the emerging market economies,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told reporters. He also echoed other central bankers, including Mark Carney at the Bank of England, as he repeated calls for governments to play a bigger role in driving economic recovery with moves such as improvements to infrastructure and productivity. Many investors had been hoping for an extension of QE at the same pace, rather than the reduction announced by the ECB and there were sharp moves on financial markets as traders struggled to make sense of the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stance. The euro initially jumped and then fell back. Yields on government bonds, which move inversely to prices, climbed as traders reacted to the prospect of lower ECB demand from April. Stock markets rallied as bank shares in particular benefited from hopes that a period of ultra-low interest rates might be finally nearing an end. The ECB also used its latest meeting to relax the rules over which bonds it can purchase under QE, reflecting worries that after years of QE it could run out of assets to buy. The changes to the QE programme follow criticism from Germany that loose monetary policy in the eurozone was hurting savers and fuelling rightwing nationalism. In the past, Draghi has rebuffed those attacks and stressed low rates and QE were needed to get inflation back to target. On Thursday, he reiterated that the ECB was not biased towards the currency bloc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s less prosperous southern states. While Draghi was at pains to reject suggestions the ECB was tapering, many market commentators said the central bank was in fact doing just that. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is effectively tapering,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Marilyn Watson, bond market strategist at asset manager BlackRock. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement, in our view, continues a trend among major central banks of moving away from ever-looser monetary policy stances.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Others highlighted the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apparent attempts to keep all camps happy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The announcement had something for just about everyone.

Talk of jobs and growth from mining investment or the cost of jobs and growth from pricing carbon always quickly skips past the reason why anyone would actually wish to price carbon or be against a coal mine. Climate change is left to the side of the economic debate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and especially so under this government. The topic was all but ignored in the 2015 intergenerational report, and any concerns about the impact of the Carmichael mine on the local environment due to water use, or the on the Great Barrier Reef, let alone on the climate, are quickly trammelled by those championing economic growth. The issue is treated similar to how politicians in the past used to flick away suggestions about inequality by arguing that there had to be a trade-off between growth and equality. Now economists realise that equality actually promotes economic growth, and so too are economists realising that climate change must be considered within economic growth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not as a trade-off, but because the impacts of climate change are so great they must be an essential component of policies geared towards economic growth. Last month a group of economists including Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz, signed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the Stockholm Statement\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which seeks to guide policymaking. The statement notes as one of its core principles that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Environmental Sustainability is a Requirement, Not an Option\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Earlier this month, former chief economist of the World Bank, and also a signatory of the statement, Professor Kaushik Basu, told me that governments when crafting economic policy makers \u00e2\u20ac\u0153should build in right from the start the need to protect the environment to make sure they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not damaging the climate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

                "bodyText":"European stock markets are now closed, so let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wrap up: Financial markets are expecting higher inflation after a group of oil producers sealed their first joint production cut deal since 2001. Brent crude is trading at a 17-month high, up 3.6% or $2 per barrel at $56.27, after 11 non-Opec members including Russia agreed to cut their production by around 550,00 barrels per day. That commitment means Opec will now deliver the 1.2m bpd cut agreed at the end of November, potentially putting a floor under oil prices. However the move has also sparked a selloff in European government bonds, driving borrowing costs higher as investors anticipate a spike in consumer price inflation, and higher interest rates. UK 10-year bond yields hit 1.5% for the first time since March. Mihir Kapadia, CEO and Founder of Sun Global Investments, sum up the situation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The historic OPEC deal over the weekend has led to confidence in the market pushing up to a 5 % surge in Oil prices. Euro Zone government bond yields have risen significantly reflecting among other things an expectation of higher inflation. As Saudi Arabia made greater than expected cuts and non-OPEC countries agreed cuts of 558,000 barrels a day, oil prices peaked at a 17 month high with WTI trading at $54.2 and U.S. Brent rising 4.4% at $56.73 per barrel, steadily clawing out from the slump \u00e2\u20ac\u201c boosting oil stocks and Middle Eastern bonds among other assets. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been drama on Wall Street, where $4bn was wiped off Lockheed Martin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value in early trading after Donald Trump tweeted that its F-35 jets were too expensive. Investors rushed to sell Lockheed shares, as the defence firm rushed out a statement defending the cost of the project and offering to discuss it with the president-elect. Another sign that the president-elect can move the markets with a tweet. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been little progress in the frenzied push to recapitalise Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking sector. That could be a good sign -- Rome\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t given up persuading private investors from injecting fresh cash into Monte dei Paschi (MPS) Italian bank stocks have gained ground today, with MPS closing 3.7% higher tonight. Paolo Gentiloni is being sworn in as Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next prime minister today, so he should soon be able to crack on with tackling the situation. Sources in the Italian Treasury have said that they are prepared to bail out MPS if needed, but hope that the bank can raise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn from investors. A senior ECB policymaker has said the bank has never discussed resorting to helicopter money, in an attempt to stimulate the eurozone economy. Over in Paris, Christine Lagarde has faced judges over claims of negligence during her time as finance minister. And European stock markets have just closed after a fairly unimpressive day. In London the FTSE 100 shed 63 points, or almost 1%, to 6890. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly because the pound had a good day against the US dollar, up almost one cent (bad news for exporters). That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for tonight. Thanks for reading and commenting! GW True to her word, Christine Lagarde has not stayed silent - instead, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s told judges in Paris that she will fight the allegations that she was negligent by allowing the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac400m payment to Bernard Tapie in 2008. Lagarde told the court that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I would like to show you that I am in no way guilty of negligence, but rather that I acted in good faith with only the public interest in mind.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Was I negligent? No. And I will strive to convince you allegation by allegation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (thanks to Reuters for the quotes) Rupert Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempt to take over broadcaster Sky has taken an interesting twist, as my colleague Mark Sweney explains: Advisers on the transaction between Sky and Fox, which is expected to lodge an official bid later this week, are pursuing a so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153scheme of arrangement\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This tactic, which requires Sky to gain approval from investors representing 75% of the voting rights, will ensure that all shareholders against the deal are forced to sell once the threshold is reached. This would protect Murdoch from the unfortunate scenario where he finally claims his prize, but is left with a mutinous rump of investors who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sell their Sky shares. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full statement from Lockheed Martin, defending the cost of its F-35 fighters following Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism. [Lockheed Martin delivered Israel its first two F-35 jets today] My colleague Kim Willsher reports that Christine Lagarde isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t planning to keep silent during her trial: The president of the court asked Lagarde how she intended to defend herself and if she wished to exercise her right to remain silent. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have no intention of keeping silent, madame la presidente,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lagarde replied. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kim\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report: Christine Lagarde\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lawyer has urged the judges at the Plais de Justice to pause her trial for negligence during her time as French finance minister. Associated Press has the latest details from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s court hearing. International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde went on trial Monday in a Paris court, accused of negligence for allowing a huge handout to a well-connected businessman when she was in the French government. Poised and serious, Lagarde took notes as the judge summed up the years-long legal saga that led to charges against her charges she contests. A well-respected pioneer for women in leadership, Lagarde faces up to a year in prison if convicted. A lawyer for Lagarde, Patrick Maisonneuve, pleaded for a delay in the proceedings, arguing that it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make sense for her to face trial while a separate investigation in the broader case is still underway. It is unclear whether the judges will decide Monday on the appeal or adjourn for deliberations. The case revolves around a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac403m ($425 million) payout to tycoon Bernard Tapie in an arbitration deal in 2008 over the botched sale of sportswear maker Adidas in the 1990s, when Lagarde was finance minister. The amount of the award prompted indignation in France. Investigators suspect that the whole process was rigged in favor of Tapie, a business magnate with close connections with political circles, including then-President Nicolas Sarkozy. Civil courts have since quashed the unusually generous award, declared the arbitration process and deal fraudulent and ordered Tapie to pay the money back. Lagarde is accused of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153serious negligence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that allegedly allowed other people in the case to commit a suspected major misappropriation of public funds. Investigating judges say Lagarde committed a series of serious errors when she made the arbitration choice and also, later on, when she refused to challenge the deal, suggesting she may have been influenced by the political connections between Tapie and Sarkozy, according to court documents. Despite Lockheed Martin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problem, the S&amp;P 500 index has hit a fresh record high in early trading on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average has also hit a new high, and at 19,776 is getting close to the 20,000 mark. Energy companies are rallying on the back of the oil production cut deal agreed over the weekend. A Lockheed Martin executive has responded to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attack, insisting that the company has taken steps to cut the costs of its F-35 programme. Reuters has the details: Since the beginning, we have invested hundreds of millions of dollars to reduce the price of the airplane by about 70% since its original costing, and we project it to be about 85 million dollars in the 2019 or 2020 time frame\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, said Jeff Babione, Lockheed Martin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s F-35 programme leader. That hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stopped the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares falling by almos 5% in early trading, knocking almost $4bn off its value. The European Central Bank has never discussed flooding the eurozone with helicopter money. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to ECB board member Beno\u00c3\u00aet C\u00c5\u201cur\u00c3\u00a9, who has just completed an online Q&amp;A about monetary policy. Asked if the ECB could embrace helicopter funding (which means either a) handing the public money, or b) creating money to explicitly fund government spending), C\u00c5\u201cur\u00c3\u00a9 indicated that it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agenda. C\u00c5\u201cur\u00c3\u00a9 also defended the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to trim its QE programme to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn per month of new bond purchases, from April, even though it sees inflation below target in 2019. C\u00c5\u201cur\u00c3\u00a9 also argued that banks shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t grumble too much about record low interest rates -- ultraloose monetary policy does benefit them too: And he gets a bonus mark for playing this delivery too: The president-elect has done it again..... Shares in US defence firm Lockheed Martin are losing altitude in pre-market trading after Donald Trump tweeted that the F-35 fighter jet programme was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153out of control\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd/ Trump is promising to make big cuts once in office, which will wipe 2% off the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price when trading begins on Wall Street in 45 minutes. The F-35 Lightning II joint strike fighter is a stealth jet, designed and manufactured by Lockheed Martin in partnership with other defence firms. Last month the Pentagon awarded Lockheed Martin a $6.1bn contract to produce 57 F-35 stealth fighters -- the ninth batch, and 58% cheaper than the first order. Clearly not enough of a saving for Mr Trump.... The Russian rouble has leapt by 2%, after oil producers hammered out that deal to cut global output by 1.8m barrels per day. One US dollar now buys just 61.2 ruble, the lowest since October 2015 - before fears over Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy hammered the currency: Newsflash: Christine Lagarde has now arrived at the Paris courthouse where she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tried of allegations of negligence (as explained earlier). Security is tight outside the courthouse: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Patrick Maisonneuve, Lagarde lawyer: Officials representing Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors will head back to Athens tomorrow, in another attempt to complete the latest review of its bailout. European Commission officials say they hope to complete the work soon: But...the two sides still seem someway apart, with Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lenders demanding economic reforms to hit its bailout targets. And finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has warned creditors not to be too hardline, urging them to consider compromises. As Tsakalotos put it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Greek expression is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcput water into wine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not an expression I like, because I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like my wine watered down, but you know what I mean, to reach an honest compromise.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Caroline Connan has tweeted from inside France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cour de Justice, where the head of the IMF will face a special tribunal over the Tapie Affair today. Bloomberg also have a snappy summary of the case against Christine Lagarde: Basically, that Lagarde didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do enough to stop a payout to [businessman Bernard] Tapie. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accused of gross negligence in the use of public funds, a rarely used charge brought in cases where the evidence suggests the defendant didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t knowingly participate in activities to defraud the state. According to the indictment, Lagarde got at least two things wrong. First, she gave her go-ahead in October 2007 to the arbitration procedure even though the French investment agency, Agence des Participations de l\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Etat, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153repeatedly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd advised her against it. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also accused of waiving the right to appeal the arbitration decision even though she was told that a possible legal challenge was available.

You can post them on Twitter using the #AskECB hashtag. Italian bank shares are rallying this morning, on hopes that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new government can resolve the problem in its financial sector. UBI Banca, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fifth largest lender, has jumped by over 4% while Unicredit and Banco Populare di Milano have both gained over 2.5% And this is helping Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market to outperform the rest of Europe; Milan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB is the only index up today. The City is hoping that the appointment of Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, will create an opportunity to resolve the crisis. Lena Komileva of G+ Economics explains: Gentiloni\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appointment is expected to mean the current Finance Minister, Padoan, stays in his post to focus on resolving the banking sector. While Monte dei Paschi is teetering on the brink of a collapse, an interim technocratic government is more likely to take on the difficult political capital cost involved in plugging in the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capital gap, by bailing in retail shareholders, with the promise of some fiscal compensation after the next election. The fact that private investors are shunning Italian political risk after the Referendum means that onus lies with the interim government to ensure successful political containment and prevent Eurozone systemic risk. Thus, while investors will continue to dislike uncertainty, the political risk-rewards of a likely compromise with Monte dei Paschi shareholders in the next few weeks, together with the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own backstop mechanisms, means that the situation will likely be contained. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borrowing costs have hit their highest level in around 18 months, as the yield on US Treasury bills rises. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly due to the inflationary impact of the oil deal, and partly due to predictions that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates on Wednesday. Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 source at the Italian Treasury has given more details about how a state bailout of Monte dei Paschi might be handled: European government bonds are taking a bath this morning, amid fears that the deal to curb oil production will drive inflation higher. Prices are falling across the board, which pushes up the yield (or interest rate) on sovereign debt. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-year gilt yield hit 1.5% for the first time since May, up from 1.43% on Friday night. Most eurozone debt is also out of favour. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-year bond yield has hit 0.396%, up from 0.347% on Friday, while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-year yield has hit an 11-month high of 0.919%. And the gap between Italy and Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borrowing costs has widened to its widest level since February 2012 -- the heights of the eurozone debt crisis. Rising bond yields usually signify that the City is expecting higher inflation -- and thus demanding a higher rate of return when buying bonds. Reuters is reporting that Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government is prepared to recapitalise Monte dei Paschi if necessary - but still hopeful that private investors will stump up for the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn cash call. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the story: Italy is ready to pump capital into Monte dei Paschi di Siena if the ailing bank fails to get the money it needs to remain in business from investors, a Treasury source said on Monday. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third-biggest bank is pressing ahead with a plan to raise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn ($5.3 billion) on the market this year,despite political uncertainty in the country after a constitutional referendum triggered a government crisis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is confidence at the economy ministry that Monte dei Paschi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cash call can succeed. If the operation failed, the state would carry out a precautionary recapitalisation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the Treasury source said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s existence and its clients\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 savings will be preserved under any circumstances,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the source added. Last night, MPS reopened its debt-to-equity swap -- which would allow retail investors to convert their bonds into shares. That could help to hit its target of raising \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn in new capital. Over in Italy, shares in Monte dei Paschi (MPS) have jumped by 7.5% at the start of trading. The move came as EU economics commissioner Pierre Moscovici declared that Italy can tackle its banking problems without creating a new crisis. Moscovici was in best \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t panic!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd mode on France Info radio, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is not and there will not be a banking crisis in Italy, there will not be a European financial crisis coming from Italy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have the capacity to deal with the situation and it will be dealt with from both in Italy and at the European level.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still no word on whether private investors will provide MPS with a lifeline, or whether its cash call will fail. Shares in oil companies are jumping this morning as investors anticipate higher profits once the output cuts kick in. Royal Dutch Shell have jumped by 3%, while BP are up 2%. Smaller oil exploration and production are also benefiting, with Tullow Oil up 8% and Cairn Energy gaining 6%. City experts agree that the deal agreed by Opec and non-Opec members are significant. But some suspect that prices may not rise much higher, because America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shale industry has not made promised to make any cuts. Morgan Stanley say this the deal should \u00e2\u20ac\u0153add to bullish sentiment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the market, especially if producers actually comply with the cuts: FXTM Chief Market Strategist Hussein Sayed believes the oil price could push higher -- at which point US shale producers could easily return to the market. With 1.758 million barrels expected to be slashed out of the market, or about 2% of the global oil supply starting January 1, oil prices have more room to rally with Brent potentially crossing above $60 in the next couple of weeks. The market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focus will then switch to compliance with the agreement, and U.S. shale producers who are not a part of the agreement. U.S. rig counts rose by 21 last week to 498, the biggest increase since mid-2015, and the questions now becomes how fast will US shale ramp up production and at what level is it possible to cap the current rally? These production cuts show that Opec and non-Opec members are serious about putting a floor under the oil price, says Naeem Aslam of Think Markets. Saudi Arabia has shown a willingness to bring its oil production below the 10 million barrels a day mark. This is surely a sign that the country is serious about lowering the supply glut on the market. Moreover, this also shows that they are willing to do more than the non-OPEC countries to push the price of oil higher. Traders are also cheering the news that Russia is also going to cut its oil production by 300K barrels a day by May 2017. But Barclays believe prices will fall back during 2017. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are too many moving parts for OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new policy to be sustainable in the long term. The strategy is bound to overshoot, in our view, leading to lower prices in the second half of next year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The oil price is surging this morning, after energy producers hammered out a historic deal to cut output over the weekend. A group of 11 countries who are not part of the Opec cartel collectively agreed to cut output by 558,000 barrels per day, from January 1. That bolsters the production cuts agreed by Opec late last month; they are cutting 1.2m barrels per day in an attempt to cut the worldwide glut in oil and drive prices higher. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the first such deal between Opec and non-Opec members in 15 years. And in further drama, Saudi Arabia also signalled that it might be prepared to make deeper cuts, on top of what it initially pledged. Saudi Oil Minister Khalid al-Falih said after Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I can tell you with absolute certainty that effective January 1, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to cut and cut substantially to be below the level that we have committed to on November 30.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This is having a serious effect on oil this morning, driving Brent Crude and US Crude price to their highest level since last July. Brent, the benchmark for global oil price, is up 4.4% at $56.73 per barrel. Great news for Opec. But if prices stay at the levels, motorists can expect to pay more at the pump, and heating our homes might get pricier too.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Coming up today.... The battle to rescue Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks will continue this week, now that foreign minister Paolo Gentiloni has been chosen to replace Matteo Renzi as prime minister. Executives at Monte dei Paschi, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest bank, are making a final attempt to persuade private investors to back its \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn cash call. If they fail, the bank could soon find itself swept into a bail-in. From Rome, my colleague Stephanie Kirchgaessner reports: Executives at Monte dei Paschi of Siena (MPS) were fighting on Sunday night to salvage a multibillion-euro rescue by private investors in a frantic attempt to prop up the bank. In a statement released after a board meeting on Sunday, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest bank said it would forge ahead with a debt-for-equity swap offer for tens of thousands of retail investors. The offer still requires regulatory approval. If MPS manages to convince investors to go along with the plan, it would help it avoid a government bailout by Italy, which would have far-reaching economic and political consequences. A deal to prop up MPS was thrown into doubt last week after the European Central Bank (ECB) reportedly said it could not have more time to secure the private investment. MPS had sought an extension until 20 January. Also on the agenda: Investors are watching the oil price closely, after producers agreed an output deal over the weekend (more on that shortly). IMF chief Christine Lagarde is appearing before judges in Paris this afternoon, over charges relating to the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac400m payment made to businessman Bernard Tapie when she was French finance minister. Lagarde denies charges of negligence, but could potentially face up to a year in jail and a fine of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15,000 if convicted. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already pleaded her case on France 2 television, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Negligence is a non-intentional offence. I think we are all a bit negligent sometimes in our life. I have done my job as well as I could, within the limits of what I knew.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And traders are also counting down the hours until Wednesday afternoon, when America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank, the Federal Reserve, is widely expected to raise US interest rates. Fed chief Janet Yellen will also face a lot of questions about president-elect Donald Trump, we assume. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

It also increases the chances of snap elections in Greece as after overplaying his hand and facing increasing difficulties in concluding the review, Tsipras may be tempted to cut his losses by calling early elections before SYRIZA loses more support for adopting unpopular measures.</p> </blockquote> <p>Syriza would probably lose an early election, given the right-wing New Democracy party has a significant lead in the polls.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-585181ebe4b03593d414eef1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-14T17:32:24.374Z\">5.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with Greece:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GreekAnalyst/status/809084662614212608\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Tsipras on the offense: he wants MPs to vote tomorrow on the benefits to pensioners &amp; islanders, by name! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash\">#Greece</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/0DHMc3nDKs\">https://t.co/0DHMc3nDKs</a></p>&mdash; The Greek Analyst (@GreekAnalyst) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GreekAnalyst/status/809084662614212608\">December 14, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58517d08e4b04a37cde47817\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-14T17:23:32.613Z\">5.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">European shares slip back ahead of Fed decision</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Markets paused for breath as investors awaited the Federal Reserve interest rate decision in less than two hours.

As prime minister Alexis Tsipras prepares to meet his French and German counterparts later this week, speculation is mounting that he will ask the organisation to withdraw from the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current bailout program. Helena Smith reports from the Greek capital:</p> <blockquote> <p>Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relations with the IMF were never easy. The Washington-based institution has long been blamed fore the gruelling austerity visited on Greeks even when it wholeheartedly endorsed the cause of debt relief.

Sources close to the Greek prime minister say in the wake of the fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to go public with its views \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in a blog penned this week by IMF European director Poul Thomsen and chief economist Maruice Obstfeld \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Tsipras will propose that the organisation abstains altogether from the bailout programme currently keeping the country afloat. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Fund has never officially joined this programme and we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really need it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said one. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At most it could be reduced to a technical, consultative role.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd </p> <p>The leftist leader, who on Tuesday blasted the body for being staffed by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153irrational technocrats,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is said to be incensed that it is now asking for more pension and tax cuts once the programme expires in 2018.

                "bodyText":"We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve waited a whole year for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. And when the big day arrived, the shock result of last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US presidential election rather overshadowed it. So what did we learn? 1) Fed chair Janet Yellen insisted that the US economy was in decent shape, as America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank delivered its first hike in borrowing costs since December 2015. She said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our decision to raise rates should certainly be understood as a reflection of the confidence we have in the progress the economy has made and our judgment that that progress will continue. It is a vote of confidence in the economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But this sunny view didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t last long, with Yellen admitting during the press conference that the Fed was operating under a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccloud of uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, until it knows more about what Donald Trump will do. 2) In the nicest way possible, Yellen indicated that the labour market was doing fine, thanks, without Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan for a $1 trillion infrastructure plan. She said: There may be some additional slack in labor markets, but I would judge that the degree of slack has diminished. So I would say at this point that fiscal policy is not obviously needed to provide stimulus to help us get back to full employment. But nevertheless let me be careful that I am not trying to provide advice to the new administration or to Congress as to what is the appropriate stance for policy. There are many considerations that Congress needs to take account of and many bases for justifying changing fiscal policy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 3) Fed press conferences can be quite dry affairs, but Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most stirring moment came as she defended recent regulations brought in since 2008. Asked about Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to roll back these rules, Yellen reminded us that Dodd-Frank was introduced to avoid another \u00e2\u20ac\u0153devastating financial crisis\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I would say it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very important not to roll back. There maybe some changes that could be made and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve suggested a few, like eliminating the burden of compliance with the Volcker rule or incentive compensation regulations for smaller banks or modestly raising the threshold for banks that are subject to enhanced credential supervision. But I would urge that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to keep this in place.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 4) Yellen found herself in Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crosshairs several times during the election campaign, but she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not planning on quitting the Fed earlier. Asked about her own future, the Fed chair indicated she was going nowhere until her first term expires in 2008: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I do intend to serve out my four-year term. I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t made any decision about the future. I recognize I might or might not be reappointed. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a decision I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to make and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have thoughts on at this time. As you said I recognize too thatI could stay on as a board member, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a decision for another day.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 5) Markets react, despite Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s calming words. Janet Yellen took some pains to insist that the Fed hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t radically changed its approach, even though it now expects an extra rate hike next year (three, not two). This is a very modest adjustment in the path of the fed funds rate, and involves changes by only some of the participants. But with shares down, and the dollar rallying, investors may have concluded that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election win changes the monetary policy landscape. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little more reaction: And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all from us after a busy day on both sides of the Atlantic. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow for more Fed reaction, the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final policy meeting of 2016, and possibly more bailout drama in Greece. Goodnight, and thanks for reading and commenting. GW You can take off the Dow 20,000 hats, folks. The US stock market has closed in the red, with the Dow Jones index shedding 0.6% to finish at 19,792, a drop of around 118 points. The wider S&amp;P 500 lost 0.8%, while the Nasdaq handed back 0.5%. That shows that the Fed was more hawkish than Wall Street expected, or wanted. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wall Street correspondent Rupert Neate on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s developments: The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised interest rates for the first time in a year, and only the second time since the 2008 financial crisis. The US central bank also predicted three further rates increase in 2017, up from previous expectations of two rate hikes. Janet Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153growth is a touch stronger, unemployment is a shade lower\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as she announced a 0.25% increase in the benchmark rate to 0.50-0.75%. It is the first time rates have been raised since December 2015 when the benchmark rate was lifted from near-zero for seven years since the crisis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My colleagues and I are recognizing the considerable progress the economy has made towards our dual objectives of maximum employment and price stability,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yellen said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We expect that the economy will continue to perform well, with the job market strengthening further, and inflation rising to 2% over the next couple of years.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Capital Economics are even more bullish than the Fed, and expects FOUR interest rate rises next year. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly due to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans for a fiscal stimulus package (even though Yellen argues that the labour market doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need the extra help). Capital Economics analysts say: As universally expected, the Fed today raised interest rates for the second time in this economic cycle, with that hike coming a full year after the first increase and more than seven years after the current expansion began. With the economy much closer to full employment now and a strong likelihood of a fiscal stimulus next year, however, we expect the Fed to accelerate the pace of tightening next year, with one rate hike in the first half of next year followed by three in the second half. Dean Turner, Economist at UBS Wealth Management, says we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t underestimate the importance of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate hike: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While this was universally expected, we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget that this is still a big milestone. It marks only the second interest rate increase in a decade from the Fed. The Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anticipation of a faster pace of hikes (three next year vs two previously) and the nudge up in the long-run rate forecast to 3% shows that confidence in the growth outlook is increasing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Investors are also dumping US government debt, sending the interest rate (or yield) on Treasury bills higher. Yields rise when prices fall, so traders are concluding that the Fed was more hawkish about monetary policy than expected (because it now expects three rate rises next year, up from 2 in September) I\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdll post a snap summary of Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference next. In the meantime, shares have fallen on Wall Street over the last 90 minutes as investors digest the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate hike and guidance for 2017. All the main indices are in the red, which means anyone hoping to see the Dow Jones smash through 20,000 points today will be disappointed. The dollar continues to rally, though, as traders react to the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecast for three rate hikes in 2017. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up one whole cent against the euro, which has dropped to $1.052. And finally, we get another question about the US election... Q: Many people are angry about the economy, even though the aggregate performance levels seem pretty good. So are you reevaluating how you see the economy? Yellen says she has long been worried about income inequality, wealth inequality, and the fact that many families haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen real wage gains. These are long-standing concerns. These are not new phenomenons, but the recession was very severe and probably exacerbated them. And the Fed chair insists that central bankers can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t solve these problems -- this is one for politicians. Our policies can affect the overall levels of economic activity, the inflation rate, but policymakers must be alert to these issues, she adds. Yellen then singles out the unemployment level among black and African American workers is higher than the average, before ending the press conference and heading to the door. Q: virtually every economist expected a rate rise today - does the Fed need that level of certainty before taking the plunge? Yellen says this is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not a prerequisite\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Q: You have been criticised by Donald Trump several times, so are you still planning to serve your full term, and would you like a second term? Yellen must have known this would come up; and, smiling politely, she says she would still like to serve her full term (it expires in 2018). She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not considered if she would like a second term, and if she would still serve on the Fed board otherwise. I recognise that I may or may not be reappointed as Fed chair, Yellen adds. Q: Did you discuss Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic plans at this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, and the effect that his victory has had on the financial markets? Yellen reveals that the FOMC did indeed talk about this. All the participants agreed there was considerable uncertainty about how economic policies will change, she says, adding: We are operating under a cloud of uncertainty at the moment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The next question is also about Donald Trump, and his pledge to scrap some financial regulation, such as the Volcker Rule (which stops banks making riskier bets with their own money). Yellen launches a strong defence of the measures taken in recent years, saying: We lived through a devastating financial crisis that took a huge impact on our economy. Most policymakers came away from that crisis thinking we must take steps to avoid a repeat, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I feel we have done that\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, she adds. Q: What do you think about Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweeting, and his attacks on individual companies? (such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin)? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not about to offer the president-elect advice, says Yellen. But she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not rolling over either, saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a strong believer in the independence of the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Q: Why is it riskier to run \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 fiscal policy to strengthen the economy and drag more people into the labour market, rather than relying on monetary policy? [Another question about Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s infrastructure spending ideas] Yellen insists that she has never favoured \u00e2\u20ac\u0153running a high-pressure economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Asked again about potential tax and spending changes, Janet Yellen says that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no obvious need to change fiscal policy to get America back to full employment. But she insists that she is not trying to provide advice to the new administration, or to Congress. Some snap reaction to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference. This is from Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ed Conway: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Meg Greene, economist at Manulife: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Neil Irwin of the New York Times: Q: What will today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate hike, and three more rate rises in 2017, mean for US families? Yellen says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate rise reflects the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confidence in the economic recovery. The economy has been remarkable resilient, she says, adding: It is a vote of confidence in the economy. Households and firms will see very modest changes from this decision, she says. Q: Would tax cuts boost the productivity of the US economy? And how would the Fed react to new policies that improve productivity growth, or didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t? Yellen says policies that boost education, improve the quality of capital, or encourage innovative new companies would all boost the productive potential of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. Q: Do would you have to raise rates faster if we saw fiscal policies that do not improve productivity? Yellen won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speculate about potential policy changes. Onto questions: Q: Why is the Fed now expecting three interest rate rises, not two? Is it because of the economy, or because of Donald Trump? Fed chair Yellen says there is only a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very modest change\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the forecasts, with only a couple of policymakers changing their view (by moving their dot on that chart I showed earlier) Looking ahead, Yellen expects that the US economy will only warrant \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gradual rate increases\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. And then she touches on politics, saying that: Changes in fiscal policy, or other policies, could potentially affect the economic outlook. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a coded reference to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans for an infrastructure spending boost once he takes office. Yellen rattles through the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest economic projections, before concluding that they are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very similar\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ones. GDP growth is a touch stronger, unemployment is a shade lower, and inflation is unchanged, she declares. Over the past seven years, since the depths of the US recession, 15 million new jobs have been created, the Fed chair tells reporters. On inflation, Yellen reminds us that consumer prices rose by an annual rate of 1.5% in October, up more than one percentage point over the last year. And core inflation (excluding fuel and food) came in at 1.75%.. Janet Yellen begins by confirming that the Fed raised interest rates by a quarter point today, to 0.5%-0.75%. She says that 2.25 million net new jobs have been created in the last 12 months, the labour market has improved, and inflation has moved closer to the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target. We expect the economy will continue to perform well, she adds. Janet Yellen has just arrived at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference, to explain why the Fed has raised interest rates today. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a live feed (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also added it to the top of this liveblog) Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans for an aggressive fiscal spending plan have forced the Fed to predict faster rate hikes next year. So argues Lee Ferridge of State Street Global Advisors: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As widely expected the FOMC delivered the second rate hike in this cycle, precisely 12 months after its first move. However, in a major surprise it increased its expectations for the likely rate path in 2017 to three hikes rather than the two forecast following its September update. It seems that in light of the forthcoming Trump fiscal stimulus plan and, signs of both rising price pressures and inflation expectations (helped by the recent OPEC decision to cut oil output) the Fed felt that it needs to adopt a more aggressive rate hiking path. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate hike is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vote of confidence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the US economy. But she also cautions that the economic outlook is still \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfinely balanced\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: Though unemployment is at a nine year low, wages and the participation rate have recently come in flat, which should give some reason for caution. The economy is not yet firing on all cylinders. This trend will likely be observed closely in the New Year, particularly if inflation continues to run below its 2% target, and we might expect Yellen to look for more sustainable labour market improvements before further rises. Ian Kernohan, Economist at Royal London Asset Management, expects the Fed to tread cautiously, until Donald Trump has made his tax and spending plans clearer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed rate hike was long anticipated, so there was no surprise when it came. Attention will now turn to the outlook for monetary policy in 2017. We do expect a sizeable fiscal stimulus to be announced next year; however the size and shape of that package may not be visible for some time. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As a consequence, we expect the Fed to remain cautious on the pace of rate hikes, at least in the first half of next year. The post-election rise in the dollar and bond yields also adds weight to arguments for a cautious approach.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some snap reaction to the decision, starting with Michelle Jamrisko of Bloomberg who remembers how the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts were wrong last year: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new dot plot - showing where its policymakers expect interest rates to be over the next few years: As you can see, a majority of policymakers expect three rate rises in 2017 (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the widest collection of dots in the second column). There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more uncertainty about 2018 and 2019 (which is why the dots are more scattered). Note that one policymaker expects only one rate hike next year, and none in 2018 and 2019! (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the lonely dot that lags behind the rest). The dollar has strengthened, after the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdot plots\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 predicted three rate hikes in 2017. It has gained 0.6% against the euro, meaning \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1 is now worth $1.056, down from $1.062. Shares moved wildly on Wall Street as the Fed decision hit the wires, but things quickly calmed down. The Dow Jones Industrial Average nearly hit 20,000 points, but is now up just 0.12% at 19,936. The Federal Reserve says it has raised borrowing costs because the US economy has continued to strengthen. In today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement (online here), it explains: Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in November indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace since mid-year. Job gains have been solid in recent months and the unemployment rate has declined. The Fed is also confident that the recovery will continue, taking inflation back to its target: The Committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further. Inflation is expected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, it adds. IMPORTANT: The Federal Reserve is also predicting that it will raise interest rates three times in 2017. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from the two rate hikes expected back in September. BREAKING: The US Federal Reserve has voted to raise American interest rates for the first time this year, and only the second time in a decade. Borrowing costs are going up by a quarter-point, to 0.5%-0.75%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what Wall Street expected, and shows that the Fed is confident that the labour market is in solid shape. More to follow.... Just 15 minutes to go, until we get the most eagerly anticipated Fed decision of the year. Michael Scanlon, managing director of Manulife Asset Management, agrees that the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guidance on interest rate policy will be crucial today. He says (via Reuters): The most important thing that investors will be looking atis the interpretation of the commentary from the Fed. I think the market is pricing in about two hikes for 2017 but if the Trump administration is able to reduce corporate taxes, I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be surprised to see four hikes next year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Colin Cieszynski of CNC Markets predicts that the Fed will be cautious about future rate hikes: The big question on everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lips is whether Donald Trump can resist the temptation to tweet about the Fed decision. Currency expert Kathleen Brooks, of City Index, says we must watch Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s twitter activity after the Fed meeting: If Janet Yellen threatens to take away the punch bowl at his growth party could he throw his toys out of the pram, and tweet his displeasure? If he does, then this could cause major volatility in financial markets, and it could also be bad news for stocks, as it is likely to lead to questions about the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence from Presidential meddling in the coming years... On the other hand, if Trump can keep himself away from his Twitter account this evening then this would send a positive message to the markets that he will respect the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence going forward, which could be seen as positive for markets. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible that Yellen could upset the president-elect during her press conference, if journalist ask her about bank reglation. Brooks explains: One area where Yellen and Trump could clash is the Volcker Rule. This is one of the most controversial elements of Dodd-Frank regulation, which essentially bans banks from proprietary trading, and Donald Trump hates it. So if Yellen suggests she might oppose Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to loosen bank regulation, there could be fireworks.... Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Carl Riccadonna reckons the Federal Reserve will deliver an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ambivalent hike\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd today. A what?! He means they will raise borrowing costs by a quarter-point, but avoid making any firm comments on what Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election win means for the economy. Tension in building on Wall Street as investors brace for the Fed decision. The Dow Jones industrial average is bobbing around last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record close, at 19,910 points. The Dow has never been over 20,000 points, but today could be the day....if Janet Yellen reassures the markets. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at City firm IG, says the Fed chair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments today will be crucial: With markets seeing a rate rise as a foregone conclusion, there will be a significant focus upon the language and Fed projections which should shed further light on the 2017 plan. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank is preparing to announce its final monetary policy decision of 2016 at 2pm EST (7pm UK time, or 8pm in most of Europe). Investors and economists are united in predicting that the Federal Reserve will raise US interest rates, probably by a quarter-point to 0.5%-0.75%. This would be the first rate rise for a year, and mean that the Fed thinks America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, and labour market, is strong enough to handle higher borrowing costs. The Fed should also release its latest economic and financial forecasts at the same time; showing how its rate-setting committee sees the future. Fed chair Janet Yellen will then explain the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision at 2.30pm EST. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll liveblog that press conference here. Anyone hoping that the US central bank will also offer insights on president-elect Trump will probably be disappointed. Yellen is likely to stick strictly to the numbers, rather than speculate on what Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic plans might mean for monetary policy. As Jim Caron, fixed income portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, put it (via CNBC) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think too much is unknown. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not going to involve themselves in that. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to do what they can do based on the economic evidence at hand.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dial back a year, and Fed policymakers were predicting four rate hikes in 2016. Instead, a series of shocks - including Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote - have encouraged them to sit tight. So US interest rates have been pegged at 0.25-0.5% for 12 months. But it will be an almighty shock if the Fed doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hike today.... The chances of snap elections in Greece next year have risen, says Wolfango Piccoli of Teneo Intelligence. He says the eurogroup\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to suspend Greek debt relief puts prime minister Alexis Tsipras in a very difficult position. If Tsipras goes ahead with the one-off payment to pensioners, this would further antagonize the EZ creditors, putting at risk the promised short-term debt relief. On the other side, giving in to the creditors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pressure would make Tsipras look amateurish at best, and at worst, further undermine his credibility and standing domestically. This would come on the back of a significant drop in popularity of his own SYRIZA. This new spat between Greece and its Eurozone partners means that the conclusion of the second review will be further delayed. It also increases the chances of snap elections in Greece as after overplaying his hand and facing increasing difficulties in concluding the review, Tsipras may be tempted to cut his losses by calling early elections before SYRIZA loses more support for adopting unpopular measures. Syriza would probably lose an early election, given the right-wing New Democracy party has a significant lead in the polls. Back with Greece: Markets paused for breath as investors awaited the Federal Reserve interest rate decision in less than two hours. An increase for the first time in a year is widely expected, but there will be more focus on what the Fed outlines in terms of future rises, not to mention any comments on the economy and the policies of president-elect Donald Trump. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 19.38 points or 0.28% at 6949.19 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.35% to 11,244.84 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.72% at 4769.24 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 1.18% to 18,606.32 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 1.21% to 9218.4 In Greece, the Athens market lost 3.21% to 619.19 as the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lenders put debt relief on hold On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 18 points or 0.09%. Perhaps the news that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lenders are putting debt relief on hold has not reached prime minister Alexis Tsipras. Or perhaps it has. In any case he has now announced his government will extend a pilot programme to give 30,000 school children free meals come January, which may well add to the annoyance shown already by creditors over his plans for Christmas bonuses for pensioners. Helena Smith reports: After announcing a one-off bonus for pensioners and suspension of a special sales tax on far flung Aegean isles, the leftist leader today turned to school children saying his government would ease the plight of those living in poverty-stricken areas of northern Greece. A pilot programme will, as of January, be funded from the government surplus to feed 30,000 school children living in those parts of Thessaloniki hardest hit by unemployment, he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This programme has been factored into the budget of 2017. It is worth around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac11.5m,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said adding that wherever it had been enforced it had ameliorated the problem of malnourishment among young children and improved their performance at school. Asked if the hand-outs would derail the adjustment programme Greece has agreed to enforce, Tsipras appeared in especially defiant mood. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think everyone has to respect the Greek people, who for the last seven years, have made huge sacrifices in the name of Europe. We have carried the weight of the refugee crisis. In the name of Europe we have, in recent years, implemented an extremely harsh policy of austerity. There has to be respect from all. I have, if you will, no doubt whatsoever because everything that we are doing is absolutely within the framework of the Accord which we are keeping and which our partners should keep too.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Oil prices have recovered from the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lows after the latest US inventory figures showed a bigger than expected dip in crude stocks. In contrast with the American Petroleum Institute\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures on Tuesday, the Energy Information Administration said crude stocks fell by 2.6m barrels last week, compared with expectations of a 1.6m fall. But stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub rise by 1.2m barrels. David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spread Co, said: This data was at odds with yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s API update. This showed an increase in crude inventories of 4.7 million barrels for the week ending 9th December. This was way above the consensus expectation which was for a decline of 1.6 million barrels. In addition, gasoline inventories showed their biggest rise since January. Crude has also been under pressure after OPEC released a report predicting that, despite promised production cuts, the oil market wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rebalance until the second half of 2017. Earlier in the week the International Energy Agency (IEA) had forecast that supply and demand would be in balance in the first half of next year. Traders will be keeping a close eye on the WTI contract to see if it can hold above the $52 level. If it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, then technically the stage could be set for a significant pull-back. Brent crude is currently down 0.5% at $55.43 a barrel having fallen as low as $54.76 during the day. West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is down 0.98% at $52.46 a barrel. Back with Greece: Some more positive news from the eurozone. Italian prime minister Paolo Gentiloni won a confidence vote in the upper house of the Senate, allowing his coalition government to take office. Gentiloni replaced Matteo Renzi, who resigned last week after he lost a referendum on constitutional reform. The Greek stock market is down 2.9% following the news that lenders have put short term debt relief for the country on hold. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters on the latest Greek debt developments: Euro zone lenders have put on hold the implementation of a short-term debt relief deal for Greece on Wednesday after the Greek government proposed to make a one-off payout to pensioners in December, the euro zone bailout fund ESM said. Euro zone finance ministers agreed on Dec 5 to grant Greece short-term debt relief that would reduce the amount of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public debt by 20 percentage points of GDP by 2060. But on Dec 8, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said, without consulting euro zone lenders, that his government would spend 617 million euros in one-off benefits for low-income pensioners ahead of Christmas because Greece exceeded its 2016 primary surplus target. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Following recent proposals by the Greek government to spend additional fiscal resources for pensions and VAT our governing bodies have put their decisions temporarily on hold,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a spokesman for the ESM said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Institutions are currently assessing the impact of Greek government decisions vis a vis the ESM programme commitments and targets. (We) will then analyze the institutions\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 assessment and subsequently decide how to proceed,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. And it seems that Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 plan to give struggling pensioners a Christmas bonus has riled the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors, who had not agreed the deal. The spokesman for the Eurogroup has just said there was no agreement now to implement the latest short term debt measures: Over to Greece where tensions between Athens and the International Monetary Fund continue. As prime minister Alexis Tsipras prepares to meet his French and German counterparts later this week, speculation is mounting that he will ask the organisation to withdraw from the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current bailout program. Helena Smith reports from the Greek capital: Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relations with the IMF were never easy. The Washington-based institution has long been blamed fore the gruelling austerity visited on Greeks even when it wholeheartedly endorsed the cause of debt relief. But the latest spat may be a spat too far. Sources close to the Greek prime minister say in the wake of the fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to go public with its views \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in a blog penned this week by IMF European director Poul Thomsen and chief economist Maruice Obstfeld \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Tsipras will propose that the organisation abstains altogether from the bailout programme currently keeping the country afloat. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Fund has never officially joined this programme and we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really need it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said one. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At most it could be reduced to a technical, consultative role.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The leftist leader, who on Tuesday blasted the body for being staffed by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153irrational technocrats,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is said to be incensed that it is now asking for more pension and tax cuts once the programme expires in 2018. Far too often, he said, the IMF had got it wrong with assessments that either over-estimated or under-estimated the impact of recessionary policies on Greece. In the blog, Thomsen and Obstfeld sought to clarify what they described as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153misinformation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd surrounding the Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role in Greece insisting that far from advocating more austerity the organisation wanted less. Instead, they said, it was the agreement of Athens to achieve higher fiscal targets that made more austerity inevitable. Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 new stance has not been met with universal applause. Many see it as counter-productive, arguing that despite popular myth the IMF is by far Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best ally supporting it on the need for debt relief and primary surplus requirements to be reduced. Wolfgang Manchau, the prominent European affairs columnist, tweeted that Tsipras was making a huge strategic mistake aligning himself with the Europeans against the IMF. Stefanos Manos, Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former finance minister, also said he welcomed the IMF officials\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 intervention. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m glad they went public with their views. Their [blog] comments amounted to a very balanced presentation and made quite a lot of sense,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told me. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some of their points \u00e2\u20ac\u201c like the one that more than 50 % of people in Greece are not taxed at all - were hair-raising, absolutely maddening to read but needed to be aired.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ahead of the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate decision, US markets have edged lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average - which has been toying with the 20,000 barrier for the first time - is down 11 points at 19,900 while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are also marginally lower. All three indices hit new peaks on Tuesday. Oil prices have slipped lower after their surge since the weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement between Opec and non-Opec producers to cut output. The fall follows data from the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday showing a 4.7m weekly rise in US crude inventories compared to expectations of a 1.6m decline. Official figures from the US Energy Information Administration are due later. Meanwhile Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest report showed a growing oil surplus next year unless members stick to their output curbs. Opec said with the cuts the 2017 overhang would reach 1.24m barrels a day, up 300,000 on its previous estimate. Brent crude is currently down 1.29% at $55 a barrel. Something for the Federal Reserve to think about as they sign off on their latest interest rate decision, with the first rise for a year widely expected. Retails sales growth cooled off in November after two months of strong gains. They edged up just 0.1% as consumers cut back on car purchases, while October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure was revised down from the initial 0.8% gain to 0.6%. Economists had been expecting a rise of 0.3%. Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, said: Retailers will be more than a little disappointed with November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drop in retail sales, as well as October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revised figure, which overall leaves question marks hanging over the sector going in to the festive shopping season. However, observers will point to the contentious presidential election as a prime reason for shoppers keeping their wallets closed amid the swirling uncertainty. With retailers making the bulk of their profits in December, the sector will be hoping the lure of sales will be too tempting for shoppers to resist. But signs of rising inflation have come from another set of data. US producer prices climbed 0.4% last month, the largest gain since June, after being unchanged in October. This is higher than the 0.1% increase expected by analysts. Economist Rob Carnell at ING Bank said: ..What really grabs the attention is the 1.3% month on month rise in trade services. This is mainly due to wider margins in the wholesale and retail sector. And as such, could well be echoed in the November CPI release on December 15. With the consensus expectation for only a 0.2% month on month increase in November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headline CPI, we now think that the risk of a higher (say 0.4% month on month) figure is looking more likely. If so, then headline inflation will rise from 1.6% in October, to 1.9% in November - in excess of the 1.7% year on year consensus estimate. With markets looking for little further tightening from the Fed after what looks a near-certain rate hike today - the Fed may start to look as if it is either allowing the economy to run a little hot, or alternatively, falling behind the curve, unless today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expected hike is coupled with more hawkish guidance. Labour market expert Paul Bivand has tweeted some useful charts on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK unemployment report, which show how the labour market appears to be cooling: With the UK employment figures out of the way, investors are waiting patiently for the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rates decision in six hours time. European stock markets are basically flat (the FTSE 100 has lost 7 points, or 0.1%), and Wall Street is expected to open quietly in 75 minutes time. Back in the City, shares in British\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second largest pub chain have soared by a third as a takeover battle breaks out. Punch Tavern is being pursued by Heineken, the Dutch brewer which produces Strongbow and Foster\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, and also by Alan McIntosh, one of Punch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cofounders. This two-way battle, broken by Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mark Kleinman this morning, has excited the City. Shares in Punch have rocketed by 35% to 172p, from 128p, a two-year high. The company leases urban and rural pubs across the country to tenant landlords, and has been spending years tackling its huge debt pile build up before the financial crisis. Punch has just issued a statement, confirming that it is in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153advanced discussions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with the Heineken side, Patron Capital Advisers ,about an offer of 174p per share. It is also in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153discussions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with McIntosh\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consortium, Emerald Investment Partners, which are offering 185p per share (subject to due diligence etc). Punch cautions that: There can be no certainty that any firm offer will be made by either Patron or Emerald. A further announcement will be made in due course. Both groups have until 11 January to make a firm bid, or walk away. That might not be the end of it, though -- industry regulators might have concerns about such a large pub estate changing hands, especially as Heineken already owns 1,100 leased pubs. The Resolution Foundation have helpfully fired some charts over., showing how real wage growth is still below its pre-crisis levels (pay rises minus inflation). They also warn that inflation could overtake pay rises in 2017, hitting workers with another pay squeeze: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report shows that there are now 4.75 million self-employed people in the UK, up 129,000 compared to last year. Mike Cherry, National Chairman at the Federation of Small Businesses, is urging the government to provide more help for these workers - who aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t entitled to the full range of benefits which employees receive. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The huge rise in self-employment since the recession must be met with action. There is much to do to improve our social security and financial systems in particular. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Social security and our tax system have not kept up with the changing nature of 21st century work. It is urgent that Government gets to grips with the new reality of more people striking out on their own and working for themselves. In maternity, low pay, pensions and the housing market, the self-employed lose out from systems designed for a different age. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Taylor review is a crucial opportunity to help the wellbeing of the self-employed and the companies they start. Maternity support must be raised to a level closer with the employed and the design of Universal Credit changed so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no longer a threat to business start-ups. The financial system must ensure the self-employed have the same chance to buy their own homes and save for retirement as those in traditional employment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), predicts that the unemployment rate will rise from its 11-year lows next year: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The labour market remains a source of strength for the UK economy. The number of people in work remains close to historically high levels, with unemployment levels continuing to fall. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, there are signs that the UK labour market may be beginning to cool, with a small fall in employment and the continued rise in the claimant count measure. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is likely that UK unemployment will start to drift upwards in the coming months, as uncertainty over Brexit and the increasing input costs faced by businesses weigh on jobs growth. However, while we currently forecast the unemployment rate will peak at 5.5% in early 2018, this is still well below the long-term average. Dr John Philpott, Director of The Jobs Economist, is also concerned that the labour market is cooling down: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK labour market finally appears to be suffering a bout of post-Brexit vote blues which is now hitting recruitment. The number of people employed in the private sector has fallen by 17,000 and vacancies have levelled off, though an offsetting rise of 12,000 in public sector employment (mostly in education and the NHS) has limited the fall in both the overall job total and the employment rate. Despite this headline unemployment is down 16,000 on the quarter but only because the jobs slowdown is disguised by a sharp rise of 76,000 in the number of people out of work who are economically inactive. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market is cooling after a solid run: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data provides the clearest evidence yet that the jobs market has started to cool off since the Brexit vote. Total employment in the three months to October was broadly flat compared to the previous three months, having been rising strongly in the year before the EU referendum. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The official unemployment rate held steady at 4.8%, but this disguised a marked rise in economic inactivity of over 100,000 in the latest three months. The more timely but less comprehensive claimant count measure of unemployment edged up again in November for the fourth month in a row. Hawksworth adds that it will be hard for firms to hand out pay rises and take on more staff: Regular pay growth edged up to 2.6%, and is now close to 3% on average in the private sector. This is good news for workers facing the prospect of rising consumer price inflation over the next year, but could dampen future jobs growth if it continues.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Professor Geraint Johnes, director of research at Lancaster University\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Work Foundation, has dug into today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data and found that more self-employed workers are now only working part time hours. That may be a sign that some firms are suffering a drop in demand. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The number of full-time self-employed workers fell by some 55000 while those of part-time self-employed workers rose by 53000. The nature of many jobs undertaken by self-employed workers is precarious, and it is not at this stage clear to what extent the shift towards part-time work is voluntary. To the extent that it is not, there may be clouds on the horizon.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The rise in wage growth, from 2.4% to 2.6%, will unfortunately be eroded by inflation - which jumped from 0.9% to 1.2% in November. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady urges the government to help workers, particularly in the public sector. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Wages are still struggling to get off the ground with increases in pay offset by rising inflation. After the longest wage squeeze since Victorian times, this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the pay boost working people need to get their living standards back on track. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government needs to act fast to avoid another living standards crisis. That means a clear plan for Brexit that will protect jobs, pay and rights. And we need a quick end to the unfair public sector pay cap, which will see public sector workers face year-on-year cuts to real pay.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market report also suggests that Britain became a little more productive in the last quarter. We worked a combined total of 1.01 billion hours in the August to October quarter, which is five million hours fewer than in May to July. The ONS says: people worked, on average, 31.9 hours per week, down slightly compared with May to July 2016 and with a year earlier people working full-time worked, on average, 37.3 hours per week in their main job, a decrease of 0.2 hours compared with May to July 2016 and down slightly compared with a year earlier people working part-time worked, on average, 16.1 hours per week in their main job, unchanged compared with May to July 2016 but down slightly compared with a year earlier. And as the economy grew by an estimated 0.4% in August-October, that means productivity has gone up (as we took less time to do more work. Economist Rupert Seggins flags up that the claimant count has been rising for several months - a sign that the UK labour market may be weakening. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key points from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market report: For August to October 2016, there were 31.76 million people in work in Britain -- 6,000 fewer than in May to July 2016 but 342,000 more than for a year earlier. The employment rate (the proportion of people aged from 16 to 64 who were in work) had fallen to 74.4%, from the joint record high of 74.5% recorded for May to July 2016, but higher than for a year earlier (73.9%). There are 1.62 million unemployed people, 16,000 fewer than for May to July 2016 and 103,000 fewer than for a year earlier. The unemployment rate remained at 4.8%, down from 5.2% for a year earlier. It has not been lower since July to September 2005. The number of economically inactive people (not in work or seeking work) jumped by 76,000 in the last quarter to 8.91m. Average weekly earnings rose by 2.5% including bonuses and by 2.6% excluding bonuses. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good news for workers: Average weekly earnings excluding bonuses rose by 2.6% year-on-year in the three months to October, up from 2.4% last month. Pay including bonuses rose by 2.5%, up from 2.4%. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s snap take of the unemployment report: U.K. employment fell for the first time in more than a year in the three months through October as the labor market showed some signs of weakness. The number of people in work fell by 6,000 to 31.76 million people, the Office for National Statistics said on Wednesday. While the decline was small, and the jobless rate was unchanged at 4.8 percent, the statistics office said the labor market \u00e2\u20ac\u0153appears to have flattened off in recent months.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Single-month data showed that the unemployment rate rose to 4.9 percent in October from 4.6 percent in September. Unemployment also fell over the three-month period, though that was offset by an increase in the inactivity rate. Breaking: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobless rate remains at an 11-year low of 4.8% for the three months to October. That matches last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures. But the number of people in work has dropped by 6,000 to 31.762m, the first fall since the second quarter of 2015. And the number of people claiming unemployment benefit has gone up again, by 2,400 in November, to 809,000. More to follow! Italian banking shares have hit their highest level since June, having gained 1.3% this morning. Traders haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t given up hope that the sector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker banks can be recapitalised, especially after Unicredit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn cash call received a warm welcome yesterday. Italian bank shares have now jumped by a quarter since the referendum on constitutional reform, and the resignation of Matteo Renzi: Kit Juckes of Societe Generale predicts that the Federal Reserve will play a very straight bat today, when it (probably) raises US interest rates for the first time in 2016. A year ago, markets expected the Fed Funds rate to be in a 0.75-1% range by now. By this evening, they are likely to have crawled to 0.50-0.75%. If for no other reason, that should caution anyone expecting much in the way of a hawkish message from the FOMC - this is a Fed leadership group whose main feature is its dovishness. Given that the single biggest source of economic uncertainty hanging over the US economy right now is the outlook for fiscal policy -what will President Trump do? - the temptation to be very, very bland in the statement that accompanies a thoroughly-discounted rate hike at 7pm GMT, is likely to be irresistible. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no drama in the foreign exchange markets either, where the pound is sticking firmly to $1.267 against the US dollar, up just 0.1% Traders may be reluctant to take big positions ahead of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve meeting, which could spark volatility depending how hawkish or dovish Janet Yellen is. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets have opened cautiously, as investors sit tight ahead of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK unemployment report, and the Fed meeting tonight. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has dipped by 16 points, or 0.25%, and there are similar declines in France and Germany. Dixons Carphone are the biggest faller, down 3% in volatile trading, despite posting a 14% jump in profits and telling the City it had its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbiggest ever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Black Friday. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets agrees that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earnings figures are particularly important, following the rise in inflation from 0.9% to 1.2% yesterday. Inflation certainly appears to be on the way back in the UK in numbers released yesterday, which showed that CPI hit its highest levels in two years driven primarily by clothing and fuel prices, while a rise in import prices to their highest levels since 2011 was an unwelcome portend of what could be around the corner in 2017. Unemployment is expected to remain at 4.8%, while average earnings are expected to remain at 2.3%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main event is the latest UK unemployment report at 9.30am GMT, which will show whether Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market is ending the year with a bang or a whimper. The figures will be poured over for signs that the economy is weakening in the face of continued Brexit uncertainty. Economists predict that the headline jobless rate will stay low, but the number of people signing on for unemployment benefit may rise. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what the City expects: the unemployment rate will remain at an 11-year low of 4.8% in the three months to October The employment total will rise by 50,000 during the quarter. Wage growth will remain at 2.3% (but may accelerate to 2.5% if bonuses are stripped out). The claimant count will jump by 6,500 in November, following last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 9,800 rise. Yesterday we saw inflation jump to 1.2%, so if wages don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rise too people will face a real earnings squeeze in 2017. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets believe the jobless rate could rise a little, to 4.9%, but are cautious about jumping to many Brexit conclusions. Employment growth momentum is fading but it is still early days as far as capturing the referendum effect is concerned. Also coming up today. The US Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise American interest rates today, at its final FOMC meeting of the year (at 7pm GMT or 2pm EST). Fed chair Janet Yellen will then give a press conference, to discuss the state of the US economy - and probably field a few questions about politics too. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll keep an eye on Greece, where relations between Athens, the IMF and the EU are deteriorating in a familiar fashion: On the corporate front, consumer electronics group Dixons Carphone are reporting results this morning. They look decent, at first glance, with first-half profits up 19%, but the firm is also talking about uncertain times ahead. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re holding a press with journalists right now, so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have more shortly...",

                "bodyText":"American drillers added oil rigs for the seventh week in a row last week. The Baker Hughes rig survey showed 12 oil rigs and one gas were added, as the crude price recovery encouraged further drilling activity. Oil rigs have been added in 26 of the past 29 weeks. So far the rig news has had little impact on the oil price, with Brent crude still up around 1.7% at $54.95 a barrel. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back on Monday. Despite US markets coming off their best levels - perhaps following a report China seized an underwater US drone in the South China Sea - European shares have ended the week on a fairly positive note. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 12.63 points or 0.18% to 7011.64, the first time it has closed above 7000 since 25 October Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.33% to 11,404.01 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac climbed 0.29% to 4833.27 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB edged up 0.11% to 19,014.75 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.77% to 9412.8 In Greece, the Athens market added 4.22% to 639.64 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 27 points at 19879 having earlier reached 19,923. Meanwhile the pound is up 0.46% to $1.2471 but is still trading close to a three week low after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday and thus boosted the US currency. More on S&amp;P maintaining its Triple A rating on Germany. The agency said: We think Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highly diversified and competitive economy will continue to sustain its current growth momentum, backed by strong domestic demand and resilient exports against an increasingly challenging international backdrop. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surpluses on its external and fiscal balance sheet will enable the country to weather external shocks, while ultralow interest rates and strong tax revenue growth continue to benefit its public-sector balance sheet. We are affirming our \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAAA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 long-term and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcA-1+\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 short-term sovereign credit ratings on Germany. The stable outlook reflects our view that over the next two years Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances and strong external balance sheet will continue to withstand potential financial and economic shocks. Markets remain in positive territory, although they are off their best levels. But the recent rally could continue next week, analysts believe. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: The week ends with gains across the board, although the Dow Jones remains tantalisingly short of the 20,000 target. Still, a good performance from the Russell 2000 this afternoon bodes well for the week ahead. Santa definitely arrived early this year, but perhaps we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get another rally next week. The FTSE seems happy enough to move above 7000, and it is entirely plausible that the index will touch new all-time highs before everyone sets off for Christmas. It will just require a little sprinkling of festive spirit, and hopefully a good performance from miners, which have been a little under pressure since the Fed announced its plan to raise rates three times next year. The coming week is not exactly busy, as might be expected, but one area of interest will be the Bank of Japan. The yen has taken a hammering since the election, which has done wonders for the Japanese stock market, but we should not rule out a statement that gives the currency a breathing space. Everyone seems to be long the US dollar, so it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take much of a change to spark some interesting moves in the week ahead. Oil is moving higher on hopes that producers will stick to their deal to cut output. Ahead of the latest Baker Hughes survey of US rigs, Brent crude has climbed 1.7% to $54.94 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate is up 1.57% to $51.70 as Russia said all of its oil companies had agreed to reduce output. Back with Greece, and ahead of the Merkel-Tsipras meeting, the German finance ministry has said an assessment report on Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 surprise relief package is not going to make for rosy reading, reports Helena Smith: Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 lender institutions have assembled a report into whether the Greek prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unilateral measures violate his country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout obligations and while preliminary \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it is quite critical,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a German finance ministry announced today. The report, requested by Berlin, will be evaluated in full next week. Particular focus will be paid to Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 surprise bonanza for low-income pensioners in the form of a pre-Christmas bonus, in effect a 13th payment. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hardline stance \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at least from it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s uncompromising finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble - has triggered mounting speculation that the politician is now bent on ousting the leftist leader and replacing him with the head of the main opposition centre right New Democracy party, Kyriakos Mitsotakis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is obvious that [he] wants to overturn the government and replace it with one that has New Democracy at its core,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Stelios Kouloglou, a Euro MP representing Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governing Syriza party. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153After [French president] Hollande \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and [Italian PM] Renzi he wants to be done with whatever trace of the left has remained in Europe.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd US markets are heading higher as the expectation of stimulus measures from the new President continues to provide support. The three main indices are on track for weekly rises and are all near record highs, even as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates and hinted at three more to come in 2017. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, currently up 42 points at 19,894, is close to breaching the 20,000 barrier for the first time. Meanwhile the S&amp;P 500 has opened up 0.2% while the Nasdaq Composite is 0.26% higher. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The big question on most people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lips at the moment is whether the Dow can manage to nibble away at the 20,000 level that it has been flirting with this week. Thus far it has fallen short and the likelihood is that the opportunity to do it this week has passed. Even if we fall short we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve still seen a decent week for US equities, trading as they continue to do at record levels. The big question is how a strong US dollar and a strong US equity market can co-exist at a time when all we have had at the moment is promises of fiscal action, and higher rates. Since the 8th November the Dow has rallied 9%, the S&amp;P 00 over 6% and the Russell 2000 has gained over 14%; how much of market expectations of what President elect Trump can deliver are now priced in? The typical UK household spends more than \u00c2\u00a32,000 a month, but in December - in the run-up to Christmas - it spends an extra \u00c2\u00a3500, according to the Bank of England. And the biggest increase is not, as you might expect, on alcohol but on books, the Bank says. And over the past three years, the value of online shopping has doubled, and now accounts for \u00c2\u00a31 in every \u00c2\u00a38 spent. US housing starts fell by more than expected in November, falling from a nine year high. They dropped 18.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.09m units, below expectations of a figure of 1.23m. October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s number was revised up from 1.32m to 1.34m, the highest since July 2007. More on Greece, and some comments from Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras and German chancellor Angela Merkel ahead of their talks. Tsipras has said he would tell the chancellor about the positive momentum in the Greek economy and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153spectacular overachievement of revenue targets.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Meanwhile, another possible hurdle for Greece to overcome: European markets are at 11-month highs, partly on the back of a weaker euro and expectations for stronger growth in the US next year. Reuters quotes Markus Huber, trader at City of London Markets: Stocks are continuing to get a boost from a weaker euro and the notion that the United States, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy, will experience an uptick in growth once President-elect Donald Trump has started implementing his new policies. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main markets are up across the board: FTSE 100: +0.3% at 7,019 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.6% at 11,437 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +0.6% at 4,850 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: +0.4% at 19,064 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: +0.4% at 9,377 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: +0.3% at 360 Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has appealed for an end to the standoff between the government and the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors. If follows the decision by prime minister Alexis Tsipras to award low income pensioners with a pre-Christmas bonus - a move which angered Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s international lenders. The Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Helena Smith reports from Athens: Hours after the Greek parliament approved Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 package of relief measures, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has stepped in, urging an end to the dispute and appealing for differences to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153worked out at the negotiations table in a genuine spirit of co-operation with the institutions and our partners.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Predicting the economy will expand by 2.5% next year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a jump from just 0.1 % this year - the Bank of Greece called for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pragmatism and flexibility\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in its interim monetary policy report released today. This emerging positive momentum in the economy needs to be supported and consolidated through adherence to the programme targets and an accelerated implementation of the reforms and privatisations agreed on. Specifically, the Bank of Greece expects GDP to grow by a marginal 0.1% in 2016, before picking up to 2.5 % in 2017 and further to 3% in 2018 and 2019, supported by investment, consumption and exports. But an ongoing review of the debt-stricken country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditor-mandated reforms would have to be wrapped up quickly, the bank said, so that Greece could take the next step towards inclusion in the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s QE bond-buying programme. There is not much time left, in the light of upcoming national elections in a number of euro area countries. Progress, it added, would be easier if lenders also agreed to lower expectations of Athens achieving a primary budget surplus of 3.5 % by 2018. Tsipras is expected to raise this issue \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the decision by the euro zone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout agency, or ESM, to put short-term debt relief measures for Athens on hold - when he holds talks with German chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin this evening. Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics, says the CBI surveys suggests the weaker official manufacturing data for October will prove to be a blip. [It] suggests that the 1% monthly fall in manufacturing output in October, as revealed by the ONS figures earlier this month, was just a temporary blip. Accordingly, we continue to think that GDP growth will become better balanced over the coming quarters. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Markit, says 2017 could be a tougher year for manufacturers. Despite the decent December CBI industrial trends survey, there are significant potential problems for the manufacturing sector that look likely to build up in 2017. In particular, business confidence is likely to be hampered by mounting uncertainty over the Brexit process, constraining investment plans and limiting demand for capital goods. It also looks inevitable that consumers will become markedly less able (due to diminishing purchasing power) and likely more reluctant to buy big ticket consumer durable items over the coming months. While output and orders were up, the CBI survey also suggested the sharp fall in the drop of the pound since the Brexit vote is starting to push up manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 costs. A weaker pound makes imports from abroad more expensive, and the CBI said factory gate inflation is heading higher as manufacturers pass on to customers some of the price increases they are facing. Expectations for output price inflation - the prices charged by manufacturers for their goods - in the three months to March rose to their highest level since June 2011. Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, says: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good to see our manufacturers ending the year on a high note with growth in production the strongest since summer 2014 and total orders still robust. But the weakness of sterling is pushing up the cost of imports, and our survey shows strong signs of this feeding through to higher factory gate prices. After a challenging 2016, UK manufacturers will want to build on the positive momentum going into the new year, with the Government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent commitments on a modern industrial strategy and innovation investment a welcome tonic.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial trends survey paints a better than expected picture of the UK manufacturing sector in December. The orders balance was 0, as 21% of businesses reported orders were above normal and 21% said they were below. That was better than the -5% predicted by economists, and the highest level in 20 months. Growth in output was the strongest since mid-2014, the business lobby groups said. Production fell in just four out of 18 sectors. Teva Group, parent company of Actavis, has responded to criticism from the competition watchdog over steep price hikes. The Competition and Markets Authority says the UK-based Actavis company increased the price of life-saving hydrocortisone tablets by over 12,000% (full story here). Teva responds: Generic medicines continue to be an affordable alternative to branded therapies. Teva is proud of our track record in bringing cost savings to the NHS as the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest generic medicines manufacturer. Competition from generic medicines saves the NHS in England and Wales \u00c2\u00a313.5bn per year overall, and Teva medicines account for approximately \u00c2\u00a33.2bn of this saving. Although the pricing of the acquired Actavis product (Hydrocortisone) under investigation was never under Teva\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s effective control, Teva believes that intervention by the CMA in prices for generic medicines raises serious policy concerns regarding the roles of both the CMA and the Department of Health. The annual rate of inflation climbed to a 31-month high of 0.6% in November from 0.5% in October, the Eurostat statistics office has confirmed. The biggest drivers of the rise came from restaurants and cafes, rents and tobacco, while the price of gas, heating oil and package holidays fell and held the inflation rate back. Olivier Vigna, economist at HSBC, said the French Insee survey was the latest indication that growth in the fourth quarter will pick-up to 0.4% from 0.2% in the third. Recent surveys on France largely confirm the rebound in the economic activity we expect for Q4 and other forward-looking indicators also point to a higher momentum. Of course, it would be naive to read too much into the positive signals coming from surveys as they are not always reflected in hard data. Nevertheless, the upwards trend witnessed in surveys bodes well for the increase we anticipate for GDP over the last quarter of 2016: we forecast +0.4% q-o-q after two consecutive weak quarters (-0.1% in Q2, then +0.2% in Q3). So although it is too early to have a comprehensive view on the full set of Q4 data, such an encouraging move, if durable and converted into better hard data, would also be positive for the entry into 2017. Over in France, firms were feeling more confident than expected in December according to the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (Insee). The headline index rose to 105 from 102. It was the highest level since the summer of 2011. Confidence grew among manufacturing, services and retail firms, but dipped in construction. Insee: After being almost stable since August 2015, equal or slightly above its long term average (100), the climate has improved markedly in December 2016. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy will be stronger than expected in the fourth quarter according to the Munich-based Ifo Institute. Positive growth momentum in Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy will be carried into 2017, it added. As Ifo issued updated forecasts, the institute\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president Clemens Fuest, commented: All signs point to a fourth quarter that is stronger than had been expected until now. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll take this impetus into the new year. Ifo left its forecast for growth in 2016 unchanged at 1.9%, which would be the strongest in five years. It nudged up forecasts for both 2017 and 2018 by 0.1% percentage points to 1.5% and 1.7% respectively. Fuest: The change of growth pace from 2016 to 2017 is only due to a lower number of workdays. For context, here are the International Monetary Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth predictions for the G7 in 2017 : US: 2.2% Germany: 1.4% France: 1.3% Italy: 0.9% Japan: 0.6% UK: 1.1% Canada: 1.9% The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Actavis is the latest pharmaceutical company to come under criticism from the competition regulator over sharply hiking the price of tablets. Specifically, the Competition and Markets Authority says Actavis increased the price of life-saving hydrocortisone tablets by over 12,000%. It pushed up the annual cost to the NHS from \u00c2\u00a3522,000 before to 2008 to \u00c2\u00a370m by 2015. The tablets are used by people whose adrenal glands do not produce enough steroid hormones, such as those suffering from Addison\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disease. At the this stage, the CMA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s findings are provisional and no fine has been issued. It follows the watchdog\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision last week to impose a record \u00c2\u00a384.2m fine on Pfizer, after the price charged to the NHS for an anti-epilepsy drug was increased by up to 2,600%. Read our full story on Actavis here: The FTSE 100 is up five points in early trading. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a modest gain but takes the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading index of shares back above the 7,000 mark at 7,002. Following the excitement of the Fed rate rise and Bank of England policy meeting earlier in the week, markets across Europe are fairly steady. FTSE 100: +0.1% at 7,004 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.02% at 11,368 French CAC: -0.1% at 4,815 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: +0.2% at 19,033 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.2% at 9,319 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: +0.03% at 359 Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Close attention will be paid to the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s December industrial trends survey at 11am today as it will provide a timely health check on the UK economy as 2016 draws to a close. Business surveys capture a more recent picture of economic activity than official data, but rely on a smaller sample size and tend to be more anecdotal. That said, economists and policymakers look to surveys for clues of where the official data might be heading. The CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing survey is expected to show a balance of -5% of firms reported a rise in orders in December, worse than November when it was -3%. One of the issues in recent weeks however is that the official data has painted a weaker picture of the economy than business surveys. Adam Cole, currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets, says: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CBI manufacturing survey is worth watching in the light of the very weak October manufacturing output data which marked a poor start to the monthly indicators that will add up to Q4 GDP. The CBI survey has been less volatile than the manufacturing PMI recently and the consensus for the orders balance (-5) would be consistent with manufacturing out trending no better than flat. We will bring you the numbers and reaction as it comes in, as well as tracking all the main events through the day.",

                "bodyText":"Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial spokesperson has called for the algorithms used by technology firms to be made transparent and subject to regulation, as the party prepares the new year launch of its industrial strategy consultation. Shadow minister Chi Onwurah wants to see greater scrutiny of the mathematical formulas that now control everything from the tailored news served to Facebook members to the speed at which workers are required to move around an Amazon warehouse. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Algorithms aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t above the law,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Onwurah warned this weekend. In a telephone interview on Sunday, she said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The outcomes of algorithms are regulated \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the companies which use them have to meet employment law and competition law. The question is, how do we make that regulation effective when we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see the algorithm?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial paper, due to be published after the Christmas break, will call for suggestions on how tech firms could be more closely supervised by government. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We expect algorithms and data rights to be considered as part of that consultation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Onwurah, who was shadow digital economy minister before taking on the industrial brief. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Algorithms are part of our world, so they are subject to regulation, but because they are not transparent, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s difficult to regulate them effectively.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The business models of technology firms are increasingly being challenged by lawmakers. Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shopping and advertising services are under investigation by the European commission, while Uber drivers won a landmark case at a London tribunal this autumn to be considered as employees of the ride-hailing app, and therefore entitled to a minimum wage and holiday pay. The equations behind the operations of digital businesses are a closely guarded trade secret. Any suggestion that they might have to hand them over to government agencies is likely to trigger a major pushback from silicon valley, where many of the biggest names are headquartered. Some commentators have compared forcing Google to share its search algorithm to ordering Coca-Cola disclose the secret recipe behind its best selling fizzy drink. But pressure for reform is mounting. Social media platforms are being blamed for allowing the spread of misinformation and online abuse, conditions which some argue are fueling the resurgence of extreme politics in America and western Europe. There are also signs that Google pages are being distorted by the spread of unchecked hate speech.

Its British subsidiary DeepMind, which specialises in machine learning, has signed an agreement with the Royal Free Hospital in north London to develop an app that will warn doctors when patients are at risk of acute kidney injury. Junior health minister Nicola Blackwood revealed, in response to parliamentary questions, that the government had not been shown the details of the agreement or discussed it with the hospital. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Labour is having to raise the debate because the government is years behind on this and refuses to face up to the challenges of the digital era,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Onwurah said.

Current guidance is for the group to generate capital before dividends equivalent of around 160 basis points of risk weighted assets in the current financial year. This is equivalent to around 5p per share and compares to our current full year dividend forecast of 4p, which includes a 2.55p ordinary payment and 1.45p special. It is likely that the anticipated special dividend may therefore be missed or reduced in order to finance the deal, albeit we would expect further surplus capital to be generated in subsequent years. </p> <p>Overall, the anticipated financial performance and shareholder value creation that is expected to be generated by this transaction is impressive, in our view, and suggests a better use of capital than simply returning it to shareholders. That said, Lloyds will be broadly doubling up its exposure to credit cards at a particularly benign point in the bad debt cycle and ahead of a potential slow-down in the UK economy once the terms of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU are reached.

                "bodyText":"US shares continue to forge ahead, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average making further strides towards the 20,000 barrier. The Dow is currently up 61 points or 0.3% 19,944, as the post election rally continues. The S&amp;P 500 has opened 0.22% higher and the Nasdaq Composite 0.3% better. The moves higher came despite the increased global tensions, following the attacks in Berlin and Turkey. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: US markets are continuing to remain resilient despite the continued rise in yields and the US dollar, with the Dow looking to have another crack at the 20,000 level that it fell just short of last week. As for Europe, the FTSE 100 is up 0.3%, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is 0.19% higher and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.4%. Hewson said: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been another fairly quiet pre-Christmas trading day for European equity markets which, after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brief pause have continued to build on the gains of the last few weeks with the Dax shrugging off the tragic events in Berlin, to put in another new high for the year. The FTSE100 has also hit its highest level since October as both key European benchmarks reap the benefits of a weaker currency with the euro hitting its lowest levels since 2002 and the pound posting a one month low against the US dollar. If investors are in any way fazed by the rise in geopolitical tension over the past 24 hours it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s certainly not being reflected in stock market valuations. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Over in Greece, the euro working group is set to decide whether to reinstate short-term debt relief measures abruptly suspended last week. Helena Smith reports: In Athens officials are privately expressing optimism that lenders will take the view the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement of relief measures for the vulnerable \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in no way conflicts with fiscal targets.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Prime minister Alexis Tsipras, who caught creditors off guard when he declared a budget primary surplus would allow his leftist led coalition to grant a one-off bonus to around 1.6 million low-income pensioners, is hoping today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s teleconference will clear up \u00e2\u20ac\u0153any misunderstanding.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Greece has been on a collision course with bailout partners since the measures were unveiled. Suspension of a planned VAT rise on islands in the Aegean hit by refugee flows - a second measure - was included in a draft bill put before parliament last night. The hope is that the euro working group will unblock the debt relief measures it froze last week so that a second review of the economy assessing the headway Greece has made in implementing reforms can be concluded when euro zone finance ministers convene again on 26 January. The euro continues to fall against the dollar, heading closer towards parity. The decline is mainly a function of the strength of the US currency of course, as further interest rate rises from the Federal Reserve loom large. But the problems of the eurozone, including the troubled Italian banking sector, are also a factor, as is the horrific attack in Berlin. The euro is currently down 0.5% at $1.0353, its lowest since early 2003. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, said: Another day, anther multi-year high for the dollar. This afternoon saw the euro/dollar drop below last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s low to hit its lowest level since 2003. The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heaviest traded pair has been falling sharply in recent times as disparity between Eurozone and US monetary policies grow. Whereas the ECB has turned even more dovish by expanding its QE stimulus programme to at least December 2017, the Fed has [raised] interest rates and has talked up the possibility of three further hikes next year. This is basically the driving force behind the euro/dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downward move and will probably remain so in the early parts of next year. [The] next phase of the move could be severe in terms of magnitude. At a minimum, the euro/dollar, I think, would reach parity, possibly before the year is out. I think there is potential for it to drop even lower over time. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our report on the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retail sales survey. Larry Elliott writes: Retailers have been enjoying their strongest sales growth in more than a year amid signs from Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading employers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 organisation of a pre-Christmas consumer spending spree. The latest health check of high street and online activity from the CBI found that sales so far in December beat expectations, were above average for the time of year, and led to retailers beefing up their orders to suppliers. But the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s distributive trades survey also found that retailers expect the pace of growth to slacken in early 2017 when the fall in the value of the pound pushes up inflation and reduces living standards. The survey of 112 retailers reported 51% as saying sales were higher than a year ago while 16% said they were lower. The resulting balance of +35 points was up on the +26 points recorded in November and the highest since September 2015. As if to confirm the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments about rising prices, the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ian McCafferty has pointed to the prospect of higher inflation, and reiterated the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stance that interest rates were as likely to rise as to fall. In a speech at the Dorset Chamber of Commerce, he said that higher inflation, weaker growth and the fallout from the Brexit vote complicated the outlook for the UK economy: This confluence of trends - rising inflation, initial demand resilience but a slowdown in growth in prospect and a likely hit to supply over the longer term - provides a challenging background for policy setting... On the basis of our current understanding of the economy, the balance of risks around the outlook was two-sided, such that from the current level, any further changes in our policy stance in the near future were as likely to be upward as downward... The uncertainties about the future path of the economy following the referendum are such that we will be following the emerging data even more closely than normal. Quite where policy will go next will depend crucially on how the different cogs and wheels in the economy behave over the coming year or two. Consumers may be splashing out because they anticipate prices are heading higher, says economist Howard Archer at IHS Markit: Retailers will certainly be hoping that consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 willingness to spend holds up over the final part of the vital Christmas shopping period and into the New Year. The CBI survey indicates that retailers are more cautious about sales prospects in January although they still see them at a relatively decent level.... For now, consumers are still benefiting from decent fundamentals, notably relatively decent purchasing power and high employment... The major problem facing the economy - and retailers in particular - is that it looks inevitable that the fundamentals for consumers will weaken markedly over the coming months with purchasing power being increasingly squeezed and the labour market likely weakening... In the near-term, there is the possibility that some consumers will bring forward purchases of big-ticket items in the belief that their prices are likely to rise appreciably over the coming months. Expectations of rising prices may make consumers particularly keen to take advantage of genuine bargains in the clearance sales in late-December and January. Next year looks more challenging for retailers, ING economist James Knightley agrees: Households are clearly willing to spend, but the headwinds for next year are strong. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Confederation of British Industry has reported that retailers have had a really strong Christmas trading period so far. A net 35% of retailers saw higher volumes of sales than 12 months ago, up from 26% in November and well ahead of the 20% consensus. This is the strongest reading since September last year and suggests that consumer spending will again make a big contribution to 4Q GDP growth. It also again highlights the resilience of the UK economy despite the Brexit uncertainty. However, 2017 is already shaping up to be more challenging. Consumer confidence has weakened significantly in the past couple of months, which may be partly due to growing fears over what Brexit might mean for households, but also an anticipation of sharply higher prices. Inflation expectations have jumped in response to warnings from industry groups and individual companies that the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collapse means higher costs that will likely be passed onto consumers. This is going to squeeze household spending power and may be partly responsible for the recent run of strong spending \u00e2\u20ac\u201c people bringing forward purchases to avoid higher prices. The CBI survey actually takes in the last week of November and the first two weeks of this month, so it includes Black Friday as well as the pre-Christmas shopping spree. The CBI calculates its balance figure by taking away the percentage of retailers who saw falling sales from those who reported a rise. So 51% said sales volumes were up, whilst 16% said they were down, giving a balance of +35%. But despite the boom in the numbers, the CBI said it expected sales to slow in 2017 as the weaker pound pushed up prices and squeezed disposable income. It said the growth was broad based, with strong performances from clothing and grocers. Internet sales - of course - continued to move higher, at their best pace since November 2014. CBI economist Ben Jones said: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s encouraging to see retailers reporting another month of healthy sales growth leading up to the festive season, which rounds off a fairly solid quarter. While we still expect to see decent growth in the near term, the pressures on retail activity are likely to increase during 2017, as the impact of sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s depreciation feeds through. With higher inflation beginning to weigh on households\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 purchasing power, consumption patterns are likely to shift, creating winners and losers across the retail landscape. So far in December retail sales have come in stronger than expected, according to the CBI. Its retail sales index showed a balance of +35%, up from +26% in November and better than the expected +20%. This is the highest level since September 2015. The index of retailers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 orders with suppliers was up 12% in December compared to a rise of 6% in November, the best level for more than a year. A quick update on the markets. Despite the horrific events in Berlin and Turkey, leading shares are attempting to move higher. The FTSE 100 is up 0.03%, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is up 0.05% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has climbed 0.3%. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said: Equity indices are trading flat on another sombre post-terror attack day with markets shrugging off renewed geopolitical risk and Travel stocks not suffering their usual knee-jerk weakness. The FTSE100 is treading water with Lloyds (MBNA purchase offers chance for growth) and big Pharma offsetting losses for HSBC, Oil majors and Tobacco despite the weak pound. Major bourses remain close to highs, but may struggle to improve without a Monte dei Paschi recap/rescue in the bag. The FTSE 100 is sideways 6995-7020, waiting to pop one way or the other. The DAX 30 is holding its December uptrend above 14000, still trying to engineer a breakout to fresh 13-month highs. Dow Jones Futures are knocking at 19920 resistance trying to challenge 19965 all-time highs. The Lloyds/MDNA deal owes something to the regulators, says Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: Lloyds is backing itself despite the uncertain economic outlook, and this deal will mean the bank has now cornered a quarter of the UK credit card market. This does mean a special dividend for 2016 has become less likely, but at the same time the additional earnings from the credit card book bolster the dividend-paying prospects of the bank in years to come. The acquisition will allow Lloyds to boost its net interest margin, which is pretty valuable against a backdrop of such low interest rates. The deal owes some thanks to the FCA deadline on PPI claims, which has given some measure of certainty to the level of compensation MBNA will have to pay out, providing both parties with a more solid platform for negotiation. News from Greece of a delay in appointing a new chief executive for the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest bank. Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kathimerini reports: The process for the appointment of a new chief executive officer will resume in 2017, Piraeus Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governing board decided on Monday. Earlier, the majority of the board had voted down the lone candidacy of Christos Papadopoulos due to reservations expressed by the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). Sources say that the appointment was postponed after consultation with the SSM, as it appears that once again the insistence of the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund (HFSF) that a CEO must be appointed did not convince the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board. The HFSF is the biggest stakeholder in Piraeus Bank. It holds 26 percent of its shares. The mandate of the board expires next summer and, according to sources, that will set the time frame for the completion of administrative changes in the lender. Back with the Lloyds deal to buy MBNA, and Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, has a couple of concerns: Lloyds says this deal will boost revenues by \u00c2\u00a3650m a year and improve net interest margin about 10 basis points a year. The bank predicts earnings per share to rise by somewhere between 3% and 5% once the deal has been completed. But we have to be sceptical about a couple of elements. First, this big purchase could take a long time to pay off and by eating up so much cash we have to question whether Lloyds can increase dividends as much as hoped. The deal eats up 80 basis points of capital, which is about half of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual net capital generation. The question we have to ask is whether this is good value for money at a time of great uncertainty in the market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c defaults could rise if we start to get higher unemployment. Brexit makes the economic outlook very uncertain and Lloyds has just upped its exposure to UK consumer debt at potentially the worst moment. The run up to the last financial crisis was marked by hubristic mergers and acquisitions. Too big to fail rules make it impossible for big banks to join up these days but Lloyds has found a way to expand nonetheless. Recent figures from Lloyds weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fabulous. Underlying profits fell 3 per cent to \u00c2\u00a31.9bn, while profits before tax were down 15 per cent at \u00c2\u00a3811m as the bank had to set aside another \u00c2\u00a31bn for PPI claims. You may well be fed up of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153festive spirit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd already but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let that stop you taking our Christmas quiz. No prizes but just the chance to show how much attention you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been paying over the past year: Paysafe, the digital payment specialist which saw its shares slump earlier this month after a negative report from a short seller, is continuing its recovery. The company, which dismissed the claims by Spotlight Research as either old or inaccurate, has jumped nearly 6% to 361p after it announced a buyback of up to \u00c2\u00a3100m. Its shares closed down nearly 18% on the day of the report, but are now not far off a complete recovery. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our full story on the Lloyds/MBNA deal: The German and French markets have now edged into positive territory. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The European markets got off to another slow start this Tuesday, investors struggling to find a reason to send the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s indices any higher. The FTSE once again lingered around the 7000 mark, lacking any real impetus to push towards its all-time peak from earlier in the year. The pound, meanwhile, has continued to fall against the dollar; it now sits under $1.24, its worst price in around the month. Against the euro sterling has fared a bit better, remaining just above the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.19 mark... The fact that [European markets] posted any growth this morning is somewhat remarkable given the events in Germany and Turkey on Monday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is perhaps a sign of how depressingly routine such tragedies have become that the market no longer has the same kind of reaction to them. It was to be expected perhaps, after the events in Berlin and Turkey, but stock markets are struggling for direction at the start of trading as investors remain cautious. The FTSE 100 is down 0.04% while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax has dipped 0.04% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac is 0.03% lower. But the Spanish and Italian markets have managed to both edge higher. Lloyds Banking Group meanwhile is up 0.5% after its \u00c2\u00a31.9bn deal to purchase MBNA. Speaking of deals, the controversy over the maker of the new five pound note using animal fat in the production process has not put off a Canadian company from buying the business. Reuters reports: Canadian label and packaging maker CCL Industries Inc said it would buy Innovia Group, whose unit is the supplier of Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new plastic five pound note that has fallen foul with vegetarians, for about C$1.13 billion ($842 million). U.K.-based Innovia Group is a maker of specialty bi-axially oriented polypropylene films used for labels, packaging and security applications... CCL is buying Innovia debt free and net of cash from a consortium of U.K.-based private equity investors managed by The Smithfield Group LLP. The Bank of England said last month that [Innovia was] working toward removing the use of animal fat in the production of its new plastic five pound note after objection raised by thousands of vegetarians. Back with the Lloyds deal to buy MBNA, and Shore Capital reckons the move could rule out any special dividend to shareholders. Analyst Gary Greenwood said: Although there is no change to guidance for a progressive ordinary dividend payment, this may colour management\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thinking towards special dividend payments for the current financial year as management may wish to retail additional capital. Current guidance is for the group to generate capital before dividends equivalent of around 160 basis points of risk weighted assets in the current financial year. This is equivalent to around 5p per share and compares to our current full year dividend forecast of 4p, which includes a 2.55p ordinary payment and 1.45p special. It is likely that the anticipated special dividend may therefore be missed or reduced in order to finance the deal, albeit we would expect further surplus capital to be generated in subsequent years. Overall, the anticipated financial performance and shareholder value creation that is expected to be generated by this transaction is impressive, in our view, and suggests a better use of capital than simply returning it to shareholders. That said, Lloyds will be broadly doubling up its exposure to credit cards at a particularly benign point in the bad debt cycle and ahead of a potential slow-down in the UK economy once the terms of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU are reached. While there is some latitude in the financial metrics to absorb potentially higher impairments, the risk cannot be ignored. In addition, we see limited scope for organic growth given the high post transaction market share and attention such growth may attract from the competition authorities. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more on the Bank of Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more positive view of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. Reuters reports: The Bank of Japan kept monetary policy steady and took a more upbeat view of the economy on Tuesday, reinforcing market expectations that its future policy direction could be an increase - not a cut - in interest rates. Reflecting a pick-up in emerging Asian demand and factory output, the central bank upgraded its language to signal its confidence that the economy is headed for a steady recovery. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy continues to recover moderately as a trend,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the BOJ said in a statement announcing the policy decision. It also offered a brighter view on exports and output, saying they were picking up. But the central bank warned that the impact of US monetary policy on global markets was among risks to the outlook, suggesting that the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate hike cycle could disrupt emerging market capital flows. As widely expected, the BOJ kept unchanged its pledge to guide short-term rates at minus 0.1 percent and the 10-year government bond yield around zero percent. Underscoring its optimism on the outlook, the central bank even revised up its view on private consumption - considered a soft spot for the Japanese economy, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third largest. But BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said it was premature to consider raising the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s yield targets with inflation still distant from its 2 percent target. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s absolutely not the case that Japanese government bond yields are allowed to rise in tandem with overseas long-term interest rates, or that (any such rise in Japanese yields) would prompt us to raise our yield targets,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kuroda told a news conference. Kuroda also said he saw no problem with the yen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent declines against the dollar, saying such falls would help push up inflation by boosting import prices and in so doing raise inflation expectations, a crucial element in the BOJ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to beat economic stagnation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Current exchange-rate moves can be described more as dollar strengthening rather than yen weakening,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kuroda said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible the divergence in monetary policy directions could affect currency moves. But for now, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see current yen falls as excessive or posing any problem.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index Direct, said: The market reaction to this move has generally been a stronger USD/JPY. Although the BOJ economic outlook is more upbeat, it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough to compete with the Fed and its rate-hiking cycle for 2017, which will continue to give the US dollar the yield advantage. Japanese stocks like it though, and the Nikkei is up 0.5% already, as a weaker currency, a brighter economic outlook and a low interest rate environment boost the Japanese corporate outlook. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. On a quiet trading week in the run-up to Christmas, Lloyds Banking Group has just provided a bit of merger excitement. It is paying \u00c2\u00a31.9bn for MBNA, the UK credit card business, from Bank of America. MBNA has assets of around \u00c2\u00a37bn, and Lloyds said the deal would increase its annual revenues by \u00c2\u00a3650m. Cost cutting is on the cards - Lloyds said It expected savings of \u00c2\u00a3100m within two years. MBNA still faces claims for misselling personal protection insurance (PPI) but Lloyds says the liability is capped at \u00c2\u00a3240m. Lloyds was reportedly the favourite to buy MBNA, having seen off rival bidder Cerberus, the US private equity group. Elsewhere, the Bank of Japan has kept interest rates on hold and upgraded its economic outlook. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: This shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been a surprise to most people given recent yen weakness which has come as a welcome relief to Japanese policymakers, after several failed attempts this year to weaken the yen. Even so the yen still remains above the levels it was when the Bank of Japan first pushed rates into negative territory in January, and reinforcing the reality that the only way the yen is likely to weaken further is as a result of future US policy moves. Those US moves are likely to involve further interest rate rises, perhaps in short order given the bullish tone on jobs of Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen in a speech to students in Baltimore on Monday. On the agenda today we get the latest CBI retail sales figures. They supposedly cover December but come ahead of the last minute Christmas trading rush. We already have stronger than expected German producer price figures, up 0.3% month on month in November, compared to expectations of a 0.1% rise. But they were lower than the 0.7% figure in October. We will also be following developments in Greece, after Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warned about the consequences of European lenders delaying debt relief. Our full story is here: And Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s troubled Monte dei Paschi continues to try and attract investors to its \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn fundraising. Meanwhile the Italian government is looking at a \u00c2\u00a320bn rescue package for all its struggling banks. European stock markets are expected to open slightly lower, with investors likely to unnerved by the events in Berlin where 12 people have been killed after a truck ploughed into a Christmas market, as well as the shooting of Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ambassador in Turkey. The opening calls are:",

But now the real challenge begins: delivering substantive growth in 2017.</p> </blockquote> <p>Economist Howard Archer at IHS Markit said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>An encouraging boost to Eurozone growth prospects as consumer confidence rose for a fourth month running in December to reach a 20-month high. Furthermore, consumer confidence is now at a very decent level compared to long-term norms. Consumers across the Eurozone are currently benefiting from pretty decent fundamentals overall, notably including higher employment and still limited inflation.</p> <p>This reinforces hopes that the Eurozone will have seen some pick-up in GDP growth in the fourth quarter and is set to see a decent start to 2017...</p> <p>While there are no details available, it seems reasonable suspect that the marked rise in Eurozone consumer confidence in December was due to improved perceptions on the economic situation and outlook. It is also likely that job concerns eased further across the Eurozone after a marked dip in November (following increased worries during August-October). Significantly, latest data showed that Eurozone unemployment dropped at an increased rate in October and September after labour markets had shown signs of losing momentum over the summer.</p> <p>Any improvement in Eurozone consumer confidence \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly a decent increase \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is to be welcomed as the consumer clearly is vital to Eurozone growth prospects...</p> <p>However, there is the danger that an increasingly uncertain political and economic environment could cause companies to become more cautious over employment during 2017.</p> <p>Furthermore, consumer confidence in the Eurozone could very well be pressurised by increasing political uncertainty over the coming months, especially given that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote in June and November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election of Donald Trump as US President fuels concern over potential political shocks in the Eurozone.

This is due to: </p> <ul> <li><strong>onshore corporation tax,</strong> where strength in October instalment payments that was factored into our November forecast is not expected to persist over the rest of the year;<br></li> <li><strong>stamp duty land tax</strong>, where we expect much weaker growth over the rest of the year. SDLT receipts in April 2016 were up 48 per cent on a year earlier, reflecting forestalling ahead of the introduction of an additional rate of stamp duty on additional properties (i.e. buy-to-let investments and second homes). We expect the weakness in receipts seen since the EU referendum to persist over the rest of the year; and <br></li> <li><strong>central government spending,</strong> where a number of factors are expected to boost growth later in the year. These include debt interest spending, which is expected to rise due to higher RPI inflation (with a lag of three to eight months) and higher planned investment spending.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd<br></li> </ul> <p>However (as flagged earlier), Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borrowing since April is down by \u00c2\u00a37.7bn, so the annual deficit should still fall.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/OBR_UK/status/811553699772432384\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Data revisions improve public finances - read the latest commentary at <a href=\"https://t.co/k0nGloBMMW\">https://t.co/k0nGloBMMW</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/gM3KrXEaaT\">pic.twitter.com/gM3KrXEaaT</a></p>&mdash; OBR (@OBR_UK) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OBR_UK/status/811553699772432384\">December 21, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-585a6dc5e4b0d460757eb26e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/helenasmith\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-21T12:42:44.080Z\">12.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"950f4124ed872729a0a5b855a48b145e9b41152c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/950f4124ed872729a0a5b855a48b145e9b41152c/0_0_1301_1345/967.jpg\" alt=\"A Greek flag\" width=\"967\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Over in Greece, relations with creditors remain awkward and tense following Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inconclusive euro working group (representing Greek creditors)<br></strong></p> <h2>Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens:</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The tensions stirred by the announcement of relief measures for those hardest hit by the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seemingly relentless economic crisis show no sign of abating.</p> <p>Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s euro group meeting was a test case in humiliation for the embattled Greek government with Athens being forced to accept in writing that the bonus proclaimed by prime minister Alexis Tsipras for pensioners is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one off\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that will never be repeated.</p> <p>Germany, the main contributor to the emergency bailouts keeping the debt-stricken economy afloat, apparently remains unconvinced that the pre-Christmas gifts (including exempting Aegean islands from a planned sales tax) will not throw the economy off-course.

                "bodyText":"In quiet pre-Christmas trading, the banking sector came under pressure on concerns that Italian bank Monte dei Pashi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fundraising was in trouble, helping push European markets into negative territory. The moves were hardly dramatic however, ahead of the holiday period, and the German market managed to just about buck the trend. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has so far failed to test the 20,000 barrier. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 0.04% at 7041.42 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax edged up 0.03% to 11,468.64 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.33% lower at 4833.82 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.16% to 19,215.59 with Monte dei Paschi itself down 12% Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.38% at 9371.7 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.71% to 638.99 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down around 13 points at 19,961. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day, barring any late developments on Wall Street. Thanks for all your comments and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Worries about European banks are undermining stock markets, particularly in Italy and Spain. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Banking concerns have played across European markets once again today, as Monte dei Paschi looks set for a government takeover. The rescue plan has fallen apart, with Rome unable to find an anchor investor; for understandable reasons, no one wants to be first \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcover the top\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 should the crisis worsen. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt will get bigger, but a major government stake should, paradoxically, boost risk appetite among investors, who will be glad to see the Italian government taking the tough decisions. Meanwhile, Spanish banks are under pressure after the ECJ ruled they would have to pay back funds to mortgage borrowers. 2016 saw plenty of concerns about European banks, but while it made sense for everyone to buy Deutsche shares at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10, it will be harder to find investors willing to take stakes in southern European firms. Still, the overall tone on markets is only slightly negative, although the patient watch for Dow 20,000 goes on. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters on the Monte dei Paschi situation: Ailing Italian bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena has been unable to find an anchor investor willing to put money in its privately funded rescue plan, less than 24 hours before the offer ends, two sources close to the matter said on Wednesday. The bank needs to raise 5 billion euros ($5.2 billion) by the end of this month to avert being wound down. The Italian government is expected to step in this week to bail it out. The Tuscan lender, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third biggest bank and the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest, had pinned its hopes on Qatar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereign wealth fund investing 1 billion euros in its cash call, but that option is no longer on the table, the sources said. As a result, the bank entire share sale, which closes at 2 p.m. (1300 GMT) on Thursday, has drawn very little interest from the wider investment community, they added. The bank declined to comment. Ratings agency DBRS is keeping an eye on Italy: Over in Italy, the rescue package for struggling bank Monte dei Paschi is looking in trouble, bringing the prospect of a state bailout closer: Which suggests that Qatar is unwilling to invest in the bank. But Italy could find out whether any bailout breaches EU rules, if taxpayers have to foot the bill but investors are left untouched. In the wake of its recent blog on Greece, the International Monetary Fund has responded to questions about its comments, mainly to do with tax and pensions. A tweet from the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokesperson explains: Oil prices have slipped slightly as the latest US figures show an unexpected rise in crude stocks. West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is 0.15% lower at $53.22 a barrel while Brent crude is down 0.38% to $55.14. US crude stocks have defied expectations with a hefty jump last week. They rose by nearly 2.3m barrels, according to the Energy Information Administration, compared to forecasts of a fall of around 2.5m barrels. The figures go against Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news from the American Petroleum Institute of a much larger than expected 4.1m decline in crude. Analyst welcomed the improvement in European consumer confidence, but there was some caution over the future outlook. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: European consumers appear to have shrugged off concerns including Brexit, the Italian banking crisis and the upcoming inauguration of President Trump to post the year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strongest confidence figures for December, albeit still firmly in negative territory. While today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data will encourage ECB chief Mario Draghi, the Christmas cheer may not last long, especially if markets start to waver as Brexit negotiations begin in earnest next year. Draghi must be congratulated for steering Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy through choppy waters during what has been a particularly testing 12 months. But now the real challenge begins: delivering substantive growth in 2017. Economist Howard Archer at IHS Markit said: An encouraging boost to Eurozone growth prospects as consumer confidence rose for a fourth month running in December to reach a 20-month high. Furthermore, consumer confidence is now at a very decent level compared to long-term norms. Consumers across the Eurozone are currently benefiting from pretty decent fundamentals overall, notably including higher employment and still limited inflation. This reinforces hopes that the Eurozone will have seen some pick-up in GDP growth in the fourth quarter and is set to see a decent start to 2017... While there are no details available, it seems reasonable suspect that the marked rise in Eurozone consumer confidence in December was due to improved perceptions on the economic situation and outlook. It is also likely that job concerns eased further across the Eurozone after a marked dip in November (following increased worries during August-October). Significantly, latest data showed that Eurozone unemployment dropped at an increased rate in October and September after labour markets had shown signs of losing momentum over the summer. Any improvement in Eurozone consumer confidence \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly a decent increase \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is to be welcomed as the consumer clearly is vital to Eurozone growth prospects... However, there is the danger that an increasingly uncertain political and economic environment could cause companies to become more cautious over employment during 2017. Furthermore, consumer confidence in the Eurozone could very well be pressurised by increasing political uncertainty over the coming months, especially given that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote in June and November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election of Donald Trump as US President fuels concern over potential political shocks in the Eurozone. General elections are due 2017 in the Netherlands (in March), France (in April/May) and Germany (around September), and may also well occur in Italy after the December referendum defeat on constitutional reform. Eurozone consumer confidence has improved so far in December. The provisional reading for the month from the European Commission shows a rise of 1.1 points to -5.1, compared to expectations of a figure of -6. The Commission said: In December 2016, the...flash estimate of the consumer confidence indicator increased markedly in both the euro area (by 1.1 points to -5.1) and the EU (by 1.2 points to -4.6) compared to November. On the home sales, Lawrence Yun, the association\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, said the last three months had been outstanding for the housing market. He said: The healthiest job market since the Great Recession and the anticipation of some buyers to close on a home before mortgage rates accurately rose from their historically low level have combined to drive sales higher in recent months. Furthermore, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no coincidence that home shoppers in the Northeast \u00e2\u20ac\u201d where price growth has been tame all year \u00e2\u20ac\u201d had the most success last month. Existing housing supply at the beginning of the year was inadequate and is now even worse heading into 2017. Rental units are also seeing this shortage. As a result, both home prices and rents continue to far outstrip incomes in much of the country. US existing home sales unexpectedly jumped in November, hitting their highest level in nearly ten years. Sales rose 0.7% to an annualised 5.61m units, the best since February 2007, according to the National Association of Realtors. Analysts had been expecting a fall from October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure of 5.57m units - itself revised down from 5.6m - to 5.5m. Well that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t last. The Dow is now down 14 points as investors shy away from pushing it above 20,000. For the moment at least. After an initial dip, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is slightly higher, edging ever nearer to the 20,000 barrier. But the trend is not exactly certain in early trading. The Dow is currently at 19,982, up 8 points. Elsewhere the S&amp;P 500 opened down just 1.55 points while the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.05%. Analysts have been waiting for a few days now for the Dow Jones Industrial Average to break the 20,000 barrier for the first time, and on Tuesday it came tantalisingly close at 19,987 before closing at 19.974. Could today be the day? The futures are indicating a slight rise, so it looks like edging ever closer. Kit Juckes at Societe Generale said: I have no insight into what happens once the Dow breaks 20,000 but some people see this as a major milestone. And until it is broken it acts as Pied Piper, or perhaps Rudolph\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nose, lighting the way for the risk-hungry and those scared of being left behind. The Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly Brexit Watch has just been published. It shows how the impact June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote is now hitting the economy, with inflation up and retail sales growth slowing. Economists Danny Blanchflower and Andrew Sentance both agree that growth is slowing: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, has just warned that public borrowing in the final four months of this financial year will be slightly higher than a year ago. In its official response to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finance data, the OBR warns that tax receipts may weaken in the December-March period, while government spending will pick up. The OBR says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Considerable uncertainty remains over prospects for borrowing in the remaining third of the year, but we expect public sector net borrowing to rise slightly relative to the same period in 2015-16. This is due to: onshore corporation tax, where strength in October instalment payments that was factored into our November forecast is not expected to persist over the rest of the year; stamp duty land tax, where we expect much weaker growth over the rest of the year. SDLT receipts in April 2016 were up 48 per cent on a year earlier, reflecting forestalling ahead of the introduction of an additional rate of stamp duty on additional properties (i.e. buy-to-let investments and second homes). We expect the weakness in receipts seen since the EU referendum to persist over the rest of the year; and central government spending, where a number of factors are expected to boost growth later in the year. These include debt interest spending, which is expected to rise due to higher RPI inflation (with a lag of three to eight months) and higher planned investment spending.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However (as flagged earlier), Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borrowing since April is down by \u00c2\u00a37.7bn, so the annual deficit should still fall. Over in Greece, relations with creditors remain awkward and tense following Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inconclusive euro working group (representing Greek creditors) Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens: The tensions stirred by the announcement of relief measures for those hardest hit by the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seemingly relentless economic crisis show no sign of abating. Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s euro group meeting was a test case in humiliation for the embattled Greek government with Athens being forced to accept in writing that the bonus proclaimed by prime minister Alexis Tsipras for pensioners is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one off\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that will never be repeated. Germany, the main contributor to the emergency bailouts keeping the debt-stricken economy afloat, apparently remains unconvinced that the pre-Christmas gifts (including exempting Aegean islands from a planned sales tax) will not throw the economy off-course. The leftist-led government insists that fiscal targets can be met because the supplementary help will be extracted from the primary surplus Athens, by dint of hard effort, has managed to achieve. The deputy prime minister Yiannis Dragasakis highlighted the tensions on Tuesday evening saying it was the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sovereign right\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to distribute the excess surplus as it felt fit. Finance ministry sources say with the handwringing still ongoing, Athens has yet to send the letter. Without it, euro zone partners have said the retaliatory decision to freeze short-term debt relief measures \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a huge setback for Athens \u00e2\u20ac\u201c cannot be lifted. One of Monte dei Paschi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s riskier bonds has tumbled in value today, in another sign that investors believe its \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn cash call will fail. That capital raising exercise ends tomorrow afternoon; if it hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t attracted enough support, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government might then step in and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbail in\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 some bond holders, making them share the cost of a rescue. Back in Italy, shares in Monte dei Paschi bank have taken an almighty dive - only to bounce right back up again  . They initially slumped by 18% in a panicky selloff, as news broke that the bank might run out of liquidity within four months. BUT then they rallies sharply, after Italian MPs approved plans to borrow an extra \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20bn to fund bank bailouts (potentially starting with Monte dei Paschi) It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear, though, that shareholders would be left with much if the Rome government is forced to intervene -- which is why shares are down 99.8% from their record high.... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tax receipts have risen by 4.4% this financial year, or \u00c2\u00a317.8bn, to \u00c2\u00a3421.8bn. That helped to pull borrowing down since April -- but not by enough to prevent the national debt hitting record highs. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), is concerned that the UK tax take isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t growing faster: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Government borrowing in November, while higher than expected, was still marginally lower in annual terms. Despite the slight improvement, debt levels remain unsustainably high. \u00e2\u20ac\u01532017 is likely to be a challenging period for the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances, with economic growth likely to soften, which will hamper the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to generate tax receipts. The more flexible approach to deficit reduction announced in the Autumn Statement is a sensible step given the broader uncertainty. However, the acid test for the Chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new fiscal rules will be whether they are able to reverse the ongoing shortfall in tax revenue, which has persistently hampered previous attempts to reduce the deficit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chancellor Philip Hammond may find some Christmas cheer in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances. Even though the deficit was higher than expected, Britain seems to be on track to hit the (new) budget targets which were announced in November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s autumn statement. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153welcome news\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for Hammond. Reassuring news for the Chancellor as the public finances saw modest improvement in November compared to a year earlier \u00e2\u20ac\u201c thereby keeping the government on track to meet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or even slightly undershoot - its upwardly revised target for 2016/17 contained in November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Autumn Statement. It would have been somewhat embarrassing if the first set of public finance figures after the November Statement had immediately put question markets over his new fiscal targets. Howard has also crunched through today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data, and reports that: There was a slowdown in growth in tax receipts in November, primarily due to income tax related receipts dipping 1.1% year-on-year. ONS data show that employment growth has slowed recently, although it needs to be borne in mind that the tax data can be erratic from month to month, partly depending on when exactly the receipts come in. It is also notable that national insurance contributions were up 6.3% year-on-year. VAT receipts were up 4.4% year-on-year in November and corporation tax receipts were up 22.9% year-on-year, which points to still resilient economic activity. City experts aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s net borrowing spiked to \u00c2\u00a312.6bn last month, up from just \u00c2\u00a34.2bn in October. Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The outlook for the UK heading into the new year is a rather bearish one and investors are unlikely to be flying in with both feet as uncertainty continues to swirl. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The gap between UK government spending and income has risen sharply in November, raising a number of red flags with investors who will interpret this as a sign that a significant economic slowdown is coming in the new year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Chancellor Philip Hammond has announced the final spring budget for early March where he will attempt to plan for an uncertain future, with the triggering of Article 50 set for later that month. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If borrowing levels continues to rise at this rate, Hammond may not have too much room for manoeuvre when setting out his fiscal policy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This chart, from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances, shows how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national debt hit a new record high in November - up to \u00c2\u00a31.655bn from \u00c2\u00a31.641bn in October. And this chart shows how net borrowing this financial year has fallen by \u00c2\u00a37.7bn, compared to 2015-2016. Newsflash: Britain borrowed more than \u00c2\u00a312.6bn to balance the books in November. The public sector net borrowing requirement (excluding the impact of our state-owned banks) came in at \u00c2\u00a312.647bn. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s around \u00c2\u00a3400m ahead of City expectations but lower than the \u00c2\u00a313.2bn borrowed in November 2015. And it pushes the national debt up to \u00c2\u00a31.655 trillion, a new record high, equivalent to 84.5% of GDP. More to follow... If the public\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation expectations are accurate, then pay packets are going to be eroded by rising prices in the next few years. This chart from the Resolution Foundation shows how real wages could start falling in 2017, as inflation overtakes nominal pay growth: Eek..... Now this is interesting.... three of the six policymakers at Sweden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Riksbank voted against extending its QE programme by six months. One deputy governor wanted a smaller QE boost, while two more opposed any extension. That forced governor Stefan Ingves to use his casting vote to get today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision through. Shares in Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Monte dei Paschi (MPS) have just been temporarily suspended in Milan after plunging over 8%. The selloff was triggered, I think, by a Reuters report showing that MPS is burning through its \u00e2\u201a\u00ac11bn cash reserves faster than expected. It is now on track to run out of funds in four months time, rather than having almost a year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth of liquidity. Reuters said: Monte dei Paschi said it now expected its net liquidity position, currently standing at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10.6bn, to turn negative after four months. On Sunday the bank had forecast that a current net liquidity position, which was of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac11bn, would turn negative after 11 months under a number of assumptions. Remember, MPS must find \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn of fresh capital by the end of this month. Newsflash from Stockholm: Sweden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has voted to leave interest rates at their current record low of minus 0.5%. The Riksbank has also extended its asset-purchase scheme by another six months, to maintain its current expansionary monetary policy. The pound is dipping in early trading, down 0.25% against the US dollar to $1.2334, and 0.4% against the euro to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.185. The US dollar itself is edging away from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 14-year high, but remains strong -- possibly too strong, given the political uncertainty in America. Jeremy Cook of World First says: Once again, we have to think that the market is irrationally exuberant heading into the New Year and while the economic side of the new politics is being fully priced in \u00e2\u20ac\u201c US and Chinese stimulus \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the political side of the economics \u00e2\u20ac\u201c policy mistakes and antagonistic trade stances \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are not. The dollar has made an impressive run but our minds keep circling back to the inauguration of Donald Trump on January 20th as a possible turning point. Markets like to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbuy the rumour and sell the fact\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and the swelling of asset prices, the dollar and inflation expectations could be a monster version of this trading plan. We cannot be sure until Trump is in the White House and that is in a month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. Have City traders clocked off for Christmas already? European stock markets have barely shifted in early trading, and are hovering close to their highest level in 11 months. In London, the FTSE 100 has risen by 4 points, or 0.07%. Some breaking news: Britons are expecting inflation to pick up speed over the next few years, according to a new survey. Reuters has the details: The British public\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term expectation for inflation rose to 3% in December, a more than two year high, according to a closely watched survey by polling company YouGov. The survey for U.S. bank Citi showed that in December, people on average expected inflation in 5-10 years to reach 3%, the highest level since September 2014 and up from a November forecast of 2.8%. In the shorter term, respondents to the survey expect inflation in 12 months\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time to be at 2.43% from an earlier forecast of 2.36%. Last month, inflation picked up to 1.2% - and economists expect it to keep rising in 2017. The survey comes after a series of Brexit-inflation stories, including the row between Unilever and Tesco over the price of marmite, and price hikes by US technology firms such as Apple. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Even though its unseasonably mild, this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic data may send a shiver through the City. At 9.30am, we find out how much Britain had to borrow last month to balance the gap between government income and spending. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely to show that the deficit widened to \u00c2\u00a312.2bn in November, up from just \u00c2\u00a34.8bn in October. A poor reading may reignite concerns over the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances as we head towards 2017, and a likely economic slowdown. The data may put a few investors off their mince pies, with analysts at RBC Capital Markets saying: November is traditionally a seasonally difficult month for the public finances, and we see a deficit of \u00c2\u00a312bn on the public sector net borrowing (ex-banking groups) measure. Also coming up.... Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government will be pushing on with a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20bn rescue package for its banks, with time running short. Monti dei Paschi, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest lender, is making a last-ditch attempt to raise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn by selling shares to retail investors and investors. But this plan hit another roadblock last night, when the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bank rescue fund expressed concerns about a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.5bn loan that would underpin the deal. If the rescue plan fails, then the Italian state will have to step in. European stock markets are expected to dip this morning, after Wall Street hit record highs (again) last night, and the dollar hit a new 14-year high. Traders will be watching New York later, to see if the Dow Jones index can hit 20,000 for the first time (it rose to 19,974 yesterday). And at 3.30pm GMT, we get a new reading on America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil inventories - a good barometer of demand in the energy sector.",

                "bodyText":"The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy of near zero interest rates since the 2008 financial crash is to come under scrutiny by MPs in a far-reaching probe that could lead to calls for changes to the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remit, it was announced on Thursday. The influential Treasury select committee said it would also examine the damage to the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation from attacks on governor Mark Carney by senior politicians. The review comes after Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments at the Tory conference that low interest rates and the \u00c2\u00a3435bn programme of purchasing government bonds, known as quantitative easing, had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bad side-effects\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, sparking concerns that ministers wanted to bring the central bank back under Treasury control. May said she was concerned that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just managing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd families were suffering from policies devised in Threadneedle Street that increased inequality. Newspaper articles and comments that followed by former ministers and pro-Brexit campaigners Michael Gove and Nigel Lawson, and the Eurosceptic former Conservative party leader William Hague, appeared to be part of a co-ordinated assault on Carney and prompted the bank governor to say last month that politicians had embarked on a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153massive blame-deflection exercise\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Most economic forecasts predict that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowing economy will force the Bank to stick with its current policies of rock-bottom rates for another year, angering powerful lobby groups of pensioners that have complained about receiving meagre returns on their savings. Andrew Tyrie, the Tory MP who chairs the committee, said he also wanted to investigate the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unintended consequences\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of maintaining the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s base rate at 0.25% and how much it had increased the incentive for households to put extra money aside. Seven years of government bond purchases by the bank, which amount to \u00c2\u00a3435bn, will also be questioned by MPs. Tyrie said the committee wanted to consider the stimulating effect on the economy of extending the bond buying programme to corporate bonds. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Interest rates are stuck near zero, the Bank of England has used increasingly unconventional forms of quantitative easing, and inflation has been below the 2% target for three years,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The efficacy of monetary policy or otherwise, its unintended consequences, and its prospects, need careful examination.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tyrie said he was concerned about the series of attacks on the Bank and wanted to consider further safeguards to protect its independence He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Treasury committee will continue to act as a safeguard on the operational independence of the Bank. The Treasury indemnity, which underpins parts of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy, could all too easily encourage the Treasury, or politicians, to put undue pressure on the Bank.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The review is likely to dismay Carney, who has assured Tyrie and MPs on the committee on several occasions that the monetary policy committee, which he chairs, has considered all the consequences of its actions and followed the only path open to it. Some thinktanks urged Carney to raise interest rates in 2014 once the UK economy began to recover strongly from the banking crash. But a succession of shocks, including the recent Brexit vote result, have persuaded Carney and the nine-strong MPC to reject these calls and inject further funds to stimulate the economy. In August, following a panicky reaction to the Brexit vote by businesses and consumers, the Bank cut the base rate from 0.5% and added another \u00c2\u00a360bn to its quantitative easing programme. Threadneedle Street has come under fire from pensioner groups and savers who argue that it has favoured borrowers over savers by keeping interest rates low. The committee said it wants to test how much savers have found themselves pumping even greater funds into their pensions and savings plans to make up for the lost interest, possibly depressing consumer spending and business investment as a result. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent said the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s analysis showed that while savers had experienced lower interest rates since 2008, the value of their assets had been protected by the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies.

The shares \u00e2\u20ac\u201c down 85% this year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c slumped by 7.5%. MPS is under instruction from the European Central Bank to bolster its finances after it was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/29/rescue-package-in-place-as-europes-oldest-bank-fails-stress-tests\">weakest of 51 European banks subjected to stress tests</a>.</p> <p>The inability to convince Qatar to put in up to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1bn is expected to lead the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board to concede it would not be able to secure a solution to its capital gap without the Italian government. This means <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy\">Italy</a> would have to impose losses on bondholders before it could stump up cash because of new EU rules intended to stop taxpayers having to pick up the bill for bank losses.</p> <p>However, about \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2bn of the bonds are held by private investors and there are expectations that an arrangement would be put in place to limit their losses.</p> <p>The Italian cabinet is expected to convene on Thursday to discuss its options for protecting retail investors and to try to limit its eventual stake in the bank to below 50%.</p> <p>The bailout is not just a financial issue. It is also expected to have political consequences for Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s controlling Democratic party and Matteo Renzi, the former prime minister who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/11/italy-paolo-gentiloni-to-succeed-matteo-renzi-as-prime-minister\">stepped down from office earlier this month</a> after he was roundly defeated in the 4 December referendum. Paolo Gentiloni has taken over as prime minister for now, but Renzi is expected to run for election again as early as next year.</p> <p>Wolfango Piccoli, an analyst with Teneo Intelligence, said a government rescue might not be immediately damaging politically, in large part because public attention will be diverted from the issue during the Christmas period. But the issue could become \u00e2\u20ac\u0153politically toxic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd later, once it becomes clear how many of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s junior bondholders are eventually compensated for their losses, and how long it takes for them to be paid....<br></p> <p> Piccoli said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153In terms of the junior bondholders, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s see what happens. it will eventually be decided by Brussels,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote> <p>Once MPS is saved, a number of other banks could also require government support, keeping the issue in the news for the foreseeable future.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153This will drag on for some time.

With Qatar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereign wealth fund pulling out from the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn cash call, the bank now needs a state bailout to stay afloat. Under the current scenario of low interest rates, massive fines and negligible earnings, the reluctance of the private investors to take on such weak structures is understandable. The Italian parliament has vowed to inject more than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20bn into the bank, in order to prevent a collapse which would have far reaching consequences. If the bank fails, there are strong fears that its collapse could pull down much of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bad debt ridden banking sector with it.</p> <p>The bank had been named as the weakest lender in Europe because of billions of euros of risky loans, failing the EU stress test in July this year. Given this, the Italian government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts cannot end with simple state support, but rather large-scale banking reforms and stringent policy measures are needed. Unless this is achieved a banking crisis looks almost inevitable.

                "bodyText":"All has gone quiet in Italy, so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to pause this liveblog - but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll try to pop back if anything dramatic happens. Otherwise, keep an eye on the Guardian Business page for fresh developments. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the situation right now, by my colleagues Jill Treanor and Stephanie Kirchgaessner (out in Rome): The Italian government is braced to bail out the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest bank, Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS), which is expected to reveal it has failed to win support from private investors for a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn (\u00c2\u00a34.2bn) rescue package. The board of Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third largest bank was meeting on Thursday after it failed to secure an anchor investor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c thought to be the Qatar sovereign wealth fund \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to support its fundraising effort. Shares in the bank were volatile, lifting off record lows but then falling back in confusion about the next steps. The shares \u00e2\u20ac\u201c down 85% this year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c slumped by 7.5%. MPS is under instruction from the European Central Bank to bolster its finances after it was the weakest of 51 European banks subjected to stress tests. The inability to convince Qatar to put in up to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1bn is expected to lead the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board to concede it would not be able to secure a solution to its capital gap without the Italian government. This means Italy would have to impose losses on bondholders before it could stump up cash because of new EU rules intended to stop taxpayers having to pick up the bill for bank losses. However, about \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2bn of the bonds are held by private investors and there are expectations that an arrangement would be put in place to limit their losses. The Italian cabinet is expected to convene on Thursday to discuss its options for protecting retail investors and to try to limit its eventual stake in the bank to below 50%. The bailout is not just a financial issue. It is also expected to have political consequences for Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s controlling Democratic party and Matteo Renzi, the former prime minister who stepped down from office earlier this month after he was roundly defeated in the 4 December referendum. Paolo Gentiloni has taken over as prime minister for now, but Renzi is expected to run for election again as early as next year. Wolfango Piccoli, an analyst with Teneo Intelligence, said a government rescue might not be immediately damaging politically, in large part because public attention will be diverted from the issue during the Christmas period. But the issue could become \u00e2\u20ac\u0153politically toxic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd later, once it becomes clear how many of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s junior bondholders are eventually compensated for their losses, and how long it takes for them to be paid.... Piccoli said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In terms of the junior bondholders, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s see what happens. it will eventually be decided by Brussels,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Once MPS is saved, a number of other banks could also require government support, keeping the issue in the news for the foreseeable future. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This will drag on for some time. If we have elections in May or June, it will be used then [against Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Democratic party], and there is no way to deflect that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s their full story: Shares on Monte dei Paschi (MPS) have slumped to a new all-time low tonight, as investors anticipate a state bailout for the bank. After another volatile day, they closed down 7.5% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15.08 - around 99.85% lower than in early 2007. MPS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apparent failure to raise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn in new capital means investors now expect the Italian government to step in; a move which could end up with it owning a large stake in the bank. Paresh Davdra, CEO and Co-Founder of RationalFX, says: The failure of MPS to secure \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn from an anchor investor will have far ranging implications, as the Italian government prepares for a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20bn bailout. With the Italian banking sector in an incredibly fragile state and the ongoing Deutsche Bank situation creating uncertainty in Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking system as a whole, an unsuccessful rescue effort could destabilise the Eurozone. So, what happens next with Monte dei Paschi? We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re basically waiting for the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board to conclude their meeting, and submit their request for state aid (having failed to raise the necessary \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn from private investors to strengthen their balance sheet). Then the ball is in new prime minister Paolo Gentiloni\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s court; will his cabinet meet this evening, or push the decision back to Friday? Reuters reckons it could go either way. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s their latest report: Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government will meet late Thursday or early Friday before European markets open to discuss an emergency decree to bail out troubled bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. The salvage of Monte dei Paschi would be part of a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20bn safety net that Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni plans to set up beneath the banking industry. Gentiloni said on Thursday the cabinet would meet on Friday to discuss measures to help Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s under-developed southern regions. He did not mention the banking decree, leaving open the door on a late-night meeting on Thursday. European stock markets have closed for the night, after a fairly dull day dominated by worries over Monte dei Paschi. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 gained 22 points, or 0.3%, to 7063, led by precious metals producers and defensive stocks including ITV, Whitbread and Tui Travel. Mining stocks, and banks, led the fallers. Across Europe, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB weakened by 0.5% as investors braced for the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest banking bailout in many years, while the German DAX lost 0.2% and the French CAC closed flat. Meanwhile on Wall Street, the Dow Jones has slipped a little deeper into the red, and a little further from the 20,000 point milestone. Robert O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Daly of The Economist Intelligence Unit agrees that Monte dei Paschi is heading for a state rescue, now that its attempt to raise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn from private investors has faltered. He also predicts that populist parties could get an electoral boost, if more banks require government help. O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Daly writes: We expect the state to approve the MPS board\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s request to inject capital. This will require a bail-in of junior bondholders, though the state may move to compensate retail bondholders. The government is putting in place a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20bn fund to shore up MPS and other weak banks. More broadly, we believe that addressing Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking woes would be manageable from an economic standpoint, as market estimates place the costs of cleaning up the banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bad loans at 2.5% of GDP or less. If mishandled, MPS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recapitalisation and future efforts to address other problematic banks could further inflate populist rhetoric at Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next national election campaign, following the boon for anti-establishment parties provided by the resounding \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd vote at the referendum. Over in New York, the US stock market has opened with barely a grunt. The Dow Jones industrial average has dipped by 8 points in muted trading, to 19,933. That takes it away from its record highs, and further way from the much-obsessed about 20,000 mark. Back to Monte dei Paschi.... and the Financial Times also reckons that the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board will meet later today to discuss their next move,. With MPS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capital raising push now over, the FT says: According to people close to the matter, the Italian cabinet will meet to approve the bailout of MPS late on Thursday or early on Friday, after the MPS board has requested help. The MPS board was not expected to make any statement until after the end of trading on Thursday, those people said. The FT also reports that Rome\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government will try to protect small bondholders, if there is a bailout: Due to EU rules designed to limit the hit to taxpayers, the government rescue will impose losses on MPS shareholders and junior bondholders, making them share some of the financial burden. Italian officials said that they would move to compensate some of the 40,000 MPS retail bondholders who might take a hit, though institutional investors would not be spared. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The scheme is ready\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, said one senior Italian official. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The burden-sharing principle will be respected but we will try to limit the damage to savers as much as possible. Breaking news from America: the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy grew even faster than previously thought in the third quarter of 2016. US GDP expanded by an annual rate of 3.5% in the July-to-September period, up from a previous estimate of 3.2%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the equivalent of a quarterly growth rate of around 0.85% -- much faster than Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.5% growth in the same period. This shows that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is growing at the fastest pace in two years, driven by a 3% rise in consumer spending, a 10% jump in exports, and a rise in companies restocking their inventories: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flurry of other economic data flashing across my terminal too, including the news that New orders for US-made capital goods (heavy-duty machinery, electronics) jumped by 0.9% last month (excluding aircraft sales). The number of new claims for unemployment benefit hit a six-month high of 275,000 last week. The clocks in Siena have chimed two o\u00e2\u20ac\u2122clock, which means that Monte dei Paschi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempt to raise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn from private investors has officially ended. Unless something remarkable happened in the last few hours, MPS will have failed to hit its target. As we flagged up this morning, MPS had only managed to raise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2bn, once the Qatar sovereign wealth fund declined to back the plan last night. One insider tells us that the Monte dei Paschi board will now meet to plan their next move. They could decide to ask Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government for assistance tonight, to help the bank reach its \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn target. Any rescue plan could also force losses on investors who hold MPS bonds; under European banking rules, these bondholders must be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbailed in\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, before the state can help. But the Italian government will be keen to avoid penalising the retail investors (individuals, families, small businesses...) who hold debt issued by the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest bank..... So they could look to find a way of compensating them (one theory is that anyone holding less than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac100,000 of bonds is protected, as with retail savings accounts). Monte dei Paschi isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only Italian bank in a fix. Economists estimate that Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking sector needs more than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac50bn in fresh capital, to help it tackle its bad debts. Unicredit, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest bank, got the ball rolling with a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn cash call last week, but many other lenders have not yet acted. This chart from Bloomberg shows how the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20bn set aside by the Italian government this week might not be enough: Mihir Kapadia, CEO and Founder of Sun Global Investments, argues that the sector needs deep-rooted reforms, as well as fresh capital. He writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Shares of Monte dei Paschi di Siena have fallen further as efforts to raise private capital failed at the eleventh hour. With Qatar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereign wealth fund pulling out from the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn cash call, the bank now needs a state bailout to stay afloat. Under the current scenario of low interest rates, massive fines and negligible earnings, the reluctance of the private investors to take on such weak structures is understandable. The Italian parliament has vowed to inject more than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20bn into the bank, in order to prevent a collapse which would have far reaching consequences. If the bank fails, there are strong fears that its collapse could pull down much of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bad debt ridden banking sector with it. The bank had been named as the weakest lender in Europe because of billions of euros of risky loans, failing the EU stress test in July this year. Given this, the Italian government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts cannot end with simple state support, but rather large-scale banking reforms and stringent policy measures are needed. Unless this is achieved a banking crisis looks almost inevitable. This is not just a threat to Italy, but for the larger Eurozone, the euro and the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political future.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Electric carmaker Tesla has become the latest firm to raise the cost of its products in the UK, in response to the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline this year. The company told some UK showrooms that prices will go up at the start of next month. In an email, Tesla said: We have just received some information that we need to share with you \u00e2\u20ac\u201c due to currency fluctuations we will be increasing our UK prices for custom orders by 5% on 1 January 2017.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Prices on showroom and pre-owned cars will remain fixed at current prices.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: The fog has now lifted in London, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little else to report from the City. After three hours of trading, Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial markets still seem becalmed, as people wait for Monte dei Paschi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cash call to formally end after lunchtime (2pm in Italy, or 1pm GMT). Some investors are hopeful that the saga will soon end. As LC Macro Advisors head, Lorenzo Codogno, explains (via Reuters):. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This situation has dragged on for years without a clear solution. Now a solution is in sight. My perception is that the government backstop will be welcomed by financial markets and it will be a plus for the (Italian) economy as well.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pleased that a rescue might take three whole months (see earlier post): Risk appetite remains hampered by thinner holiday trading into Christmas as well as talk of a Monte dei Paschi bailout taking a whopping 3-months to complete, taking us well beyond a supposed 31 Dec deadline for shoring up Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s knackered banks. An official announcement still eludes markets which understandably want clarity on the issue. The Financial Times flag up that some Monte dei Paschi savers have been taking money out of the bank in recent months, as its funding crisis accelerated. More here (\u00c2\u00a3). Toby Nangle, top multi-asset manager at Columbia Threadneedle, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced that the Treasury Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new inquiry into the Bank of England will crack the mysteries of monetary policy. After all, the BoE does devote plenty of time to assessing whether its measures are working. So MPs (or their staffers) may find themselves wading through long, competing theories about how interest rates and quantitative easing works. Toby tweets: But...economist Shaun Richards is encouraged that MPs have launched an inquiry into the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work: Newsflash from London: A group of influential MPs have just launched an inquiry into the effectiveness of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy since the financial crisis struck. The Treasury committee will investigate whether the Bank of England was right to slash interest rates to record lows, and buy up hundreds of billions of government bonds with new money. They will examine whether this policy has actually worked, what impact it has had on savers, house prices and struggling companies, and whether policymakers are now out of ammunition to fight the next crisis. The move follows growing criticism of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions in the crisis, most notably from prime minister Theresa May. The BoE, though, insists that it has acted sensibly to protect the economy and preserve jobs. Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie explains why MPs are now taking action: Interest rates are stuck near zero, the Bank of England has used increasingly unconventional forms of quantitative easing, and inflation has been below the two per cent target for three years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The efficacy of monetary policy or otherwise, its unintended consequences, and its prospects, need careful examination. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Treasury Committee will continue to act as a safeguard on the operational independence of the Bank. The Treasury indemnity, which underpins parts of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy, could all too easily encourage the Treasury, or politicians, to put undue pressure on the Bank. The Committee will examine the risks of that, too.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here are the terms of reference for the inquiry: The effectiveness of monetary policy in meeting the inflation target: The effectiveness of holding Bank rate near zero and whether extremely low rates can encourage more, rather than less, saving The effectiveness of quantitative easing and whether it has met with diminishing returns The scope for further expansion of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153qualitative easing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (e.g. corporate bond purchases) Whether forward guidance effectively binds the Bank to a policy course, and the desirability of doing so The unintended consequences of monetary policy The impact on asset-price inflation, the housing market and financial stability The implications for the long-term sustainability of pensions and savings income The distributional impact The impact on competition, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153zombie companies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and productivity The effects on the structure of relative prices in capital and commodity markets and the consequences for capital allocation, productivity and the trade cycle The implications of a large balance sheet and the Treasury indemnity for Bank accountability and its relationship with the government and other agencies The use of macro-prudential, fiscal and other policy to counterbalance any unintended consequences of monetary policy The prospects for monetary policy The drivers behind and prospects for low real interest rates in the UK and globally What is the significance for monetary policy of rises in bond yields since the US election? The impact and trade-offs of tightening monetary policy in the near-term Whether monetary policy is currently out of ammunition for the next crisis Options for raising the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153natural rate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of interest (e.g. fiscal policy, promoting investment) Scrap what we said about MPS buyers being in short supply -- its shares are now up 3% on the day. At this stage in proceedings, and with prices so low, we probably shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t read too much into it. Monte dei Paschi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are having one of those mornings; they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already been suspended once, after plunging over 6%: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets have dipped into the red in early, subdued trading. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no sign of the traditional \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Santa Rally\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd yet; perhaps it has been lost in the fog gripping London this morning. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx sums up the mood: Once again the main news surrounded Monte dei Paschi. With the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest bank rapidly running out of time to raise the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5 billion in capital it desperately needs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only managed \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2 billion so far, with a key Qatari investors choosing not to invest a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1 billion chunk \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it looks like MPS will be forced into a government bailout. Italy approved a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20 billion increase to its debt ceiling yesterday, freeing up money for its ailing banks, starting with Monte dei Paschi. This news has begun to drag on the rest of the European banking sector, with the likes of Deutsche Bank, Barclays and Lloyds all dipping their toes into the red after the bell. This in turn capped the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s indices, with the DAX and CAC falling 0.1% and 0.2% respectively. Update: Shares in Monte Dei Paschi have finally opened, and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re down 6.75% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15.20. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already shed more than 99% of their value in the last decade, as this graph from blogger Jeroen Blokland shows: Shares in Monte dei Paschi have failed to open at the start of trading in Milan. Buyers may be in short supply today, as they risk being wiped out if the Italian state has to bail the bank out  . Italian newspaper Il Sole 24 is reporting that the rescue of Monte Dei Paschi might take two or three months. The paper says that the details haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been worked out yet, but that MPS would initially be able to tap state guarantees to bolster its liquidity. That would help MPS avoid running out of cash, now that Qatar has declined to back its \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn cash call. A long-term recapitalisation plan would take longer; and involve MPS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s management presenting a new business plan. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Monte dei Paschi di Siena has been through a lot since it was founded back in 1472, twenty years before Columbus discovered America. And the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest bank finds itself in the undignified position of needing a bailout this morning, after efforts to persuade private investors to provide desperately needed fresh capital floundered. Monte dei Paschi di Siena admitted last night that Qatar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereign wealth fund had not been persuaded to become the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153anchor investor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to underpin its \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn cash call. So a saga that has been dragging on for months could finally be resolved today, when the cash call closes at lunchtime today. Without private sector capital, MPS is now likely to miss an end of year deadline imposed by the European Central Bank to raise fresh funds. So the Italian government is now under serious time pressure to step in and put in fresh capital itself. As we wrote last night, MPS is running out of time and options. Shares in the bank, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third largest, gyrated wildly in Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading session, plunging 18% to record lows before closing 12% lower amid rumours that the fund-raising effort would fail. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The idea that Qatar could be an anchor investor has vanished and without an anchor investor there is no demand from anyone else,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd one source told Reuters. In the last few minutes, the bank reported that it had only raised \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2bn in new capital through the debt-for-equity swap, far short of the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn target. Yesterday, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government prepared for a rescue bid by approving a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20bn fund for bank recapitalisation. Ministers have also insisted that there will be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153minimised or non-existent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd impact on savers. But shareholders, and those who hold MPS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s junior, and riskier, bonds could suffer losses. Also coming up today The Dow Jones industrial average will have another tilt at smashing through the 20,000 point mark, after faltering and falling back from record highs yesterday. We get a flurry of US economic data, including new personal consumption and durable goods orders at 1.30pm GMT, plus the latest weekly jobless report -- and a new estimate of American growth in the last quarter. And rumours continue to swirl that Deutsche Bank might be close to a settlement with the Department of Justice, over misconduct before the 2008 financial crisis.",

This is primarily due to a sharp fall in house prices in many countries, as austerity gripped the euro area.</p> <p>Importantly, the median household wealth (what a typical family owns), was just \u00e2\u201a\u00ac104,100, less than half the mean average of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac223k. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because so much wealth is held by the richest people.</p> <p>Households needed to own almost \u00e2\u201a\u00ac500,000 to squeeze into the top 10%.</p> <p>Wealth slumped particularly sharply in Greece and Cyprus, which both entered bailout programme, while net wealth in Germany rose by 10%. </p> <p>And the ECB flags up that wealth inequality appears to have increased slightly.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Gini coefficient, a frequently used indicator of overall wealth inequality, edged up to 68.5 percent from 68.0, which is within the margin of measurement error. A value of 0 corresponds to complete equality, while 100 percent reflects maximum inequality - one household owning all wealth.<br></p> </blockquote> <p>This could bolster criticism of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ultra-loose monetary policy, which has pumped up the value of financial assets owned by richer Europeans.

Under the agreement with the DOJ, the total cost will be $7.2 billion. This figure consists of $3.1 billion in penalty fees and $4.1 billion which the bank needs to refund to its consumers. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-585cd702e4b0d460757ebc9e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-23T07:52:49.259Z\">7.52am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Italian market regulators have suspended trading in Monte dei Paschi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares and bonds, following the news that it will be bailed out by the state.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Livesquawk/status/812192893012213760\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Monte Dei Paschi Bonds &amp; Shares Suspended From Trading Today</p>&mdash; Livesquawk (@Livesquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Livesquawk/status/812192893012213760\">December 23, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The Italian government is likely to end up owning a large stake in MPS, while some bondholders will be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbailed in\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to help fund the rescue deal.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-585cd166e4b06265ff0d5fe6\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-23T07:43:42.544Z\">7.43am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">The agenda: Bank news bonanza</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Good morning.</strong></p> <p>Christmas has come early for bank watchers, with a packed stocking full of crucial developments on the final day before the festive break.</p> <p>Overnight, the Italian government has given its approval for a state bailout of troubled Monte dei Paschi, after the bank failed to raise funds from private investors.</p> <p>Paolo Gentiloni, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new prime minister, announced in the early hours of Friday that his cabinet had agreed to the rescue and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/21/italys-20bn-bailout-fund-to-rescue-monte-dei-paschi-di-siena\">would be dipping into a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20bn fund</a> that had already been approved by the parliament earlier this week in the event that MPS needed to be saved.</p> <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/22/italy-bail-out-monte-dei-paschi-di-siena-rescue-matteo-renzi\">Italian cabinet gives green light to Monte dei Paschi di Siena bailout</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In another dramatic, and long-awaited development, <strong>Deutsche Bank </strong>has finally agreed a $7.2bn settlement with the US Department of Justice for misselling mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the 2008 crisis.</p> <p>The German lender will pay a $3.1bn civil penalty and also provide $4.1bn in compensation to consumers.</p> <p>It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much less than the $14bn which the DoJ had originally proposed, and which had raised fears over Deutsche\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial strength.</p> <p>Swiss bank <strong>Credit Suisse</strong> has also settled with the DoJ; it will pay a $2.48bn penalty plus handing back $2.8bn to consumers.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Schuldensuehner/status/812193236165001216\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Some pre-Christmas cheer for banks: Credit Suisse agrees to Pay $2.48bn in civil penalties following Deutsche Bank reaches $7.2bn settlement <a href=\"https://t.co/qehRmZFWMW\">pic.twitter.com/qehRmZFWMW</a></p>&mdash; Holger Zschaepitz (@Schuldensuehner) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Schuldensuehner/status/812193236165001216\">December 23, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><strong>Late last night it emerged that the DoJ is also taking Barclays to court,</strong> after the UK lender denied similar charges of bundling up home loans and selling them on.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ReutersJamie/status/812201731786424320\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">European banks pay US authorities $12.5 billion to settle mortgage claims - Deutsche $7.2B, Credit Suisse $5.3B.

                "bodyText":"With the markets closed, City traders are now scarpering to their homes (or the shops!) to begin the Christmas break. So in that spirit, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to wrap up now. I hope you all have an excellent Christmas break. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back next week for the final push towards 2017. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a quick summary: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has continued to defy the doubters, with growth revised up to 0.6% in the three months after the EU referendum. And with growth earlier in the year revised down, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no sign of a Brexit slump. However, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current account deficit has worsened, with exports dropping during the quarter. Economists fear that the economy is still too reliant on domestic demand, as consumer spending could tail off in 2017 when inflation takes a bigger bite out of wages. Over in Italy, the prime minister has confirmed that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakest banks will be strengthened with state capital, starting with Monte dei Paschi \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whose efforts to bolster its own reserves failed this week. Paolo Gentiloni told reporters that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today marks an important day for Monte dei Paschi, a day that sees it turn a corner and able to reassure its depositors.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Two European banks, Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse, are paying more than $12bn to settle charges that they mis-sold mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the 2008 crisis. But Barclays is fighting the US Department of Justice, denying that it is guilty of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcirresponsible and dishonest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 conduct. Merry Christmas! The London stock market has just closed for the Christmas break, after a very dull session. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index gained a mere 4 points to finish at 7,068. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fairly muted reaction to the news that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy performed better that expected in the last quarter, and that the Italian banking crisis is being resolved. The markets seem to have run out of energy, after a wild year. Joshua Mahony of IG says: The lack of volumes associated with the holiday season can often bring the potential for significant volatility, yet in fact we have seen quite the opposite with the post-Trump romp largely brushed aside. With US markets having hit new all-time highs and European markets also enjoying a substantial rally over the past month, there is little complain about this year. However, with the US economy is rude health, the US stock markets reaching new territory, Donald Trump will have a tough time trying to improve on the current state of play. Looking away from the UK economy, the European Central Bank has reported that wealth inequality across the eurozone has risen since the eurozone crisis began. A new ECB survey has found that average net wealth across the euro area shrank by 10% between 2010 and 2014, to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac223,300. This is primarily due to a sharp fall in house prices in many countries, as austerity gripped the euro area. Importantly, the median household wealth (what a typical family owns), was just \u00e2\u201a\u00ac104,100, less than half the mean average of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac223k. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because so much wealth is held by the richest people. Households needed to own almost \u00e2\u201a\u00ac500,000 to squeeze into the top 10%. Wealth slumped particularly sharply in Greece and Cyprus, which both entered bailout programme, while net wealth in Germany rose by 10%. And the ECB flags up that wealth inequality appears to have increased slightly. The Gini coefficient, a frequently used indicator of overall wealth inequality, edged up to 68.5 percent from 68.0, which is within the margin of measurement error. A value of 0 corresponds to complete equality, while 100 percent reflects maximum inequality - one household owning all wealth. This could bolster criticism of the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ultra-loose monetary policy, which has pumped up the value of financial assets owned by richer Europeans. But the Bank argues that without its action, unemployment would be higher and growth lower. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, is concerned that UK households will feel a squeeze next year, which could hold back growth. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his comment on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Q3\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Quarterly National Accounts brought some unexpected pre-Christmas cheer with Q3 GDP growth revised up from 0.5% to 0.6%. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Consumer spending remained the key driver of growth in Q3, but the first cut of the income data raised further question marks about how long this can continue. Real household income dropped sharply in Q3, taking the annual growth rate to just 0.3%, the weakest outturn for two years. With high inflation set to weigh further on spending power next year, the consumer is surely set to falter soon. If you dig into the meat of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP report, there are reasons to worry -- even though the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth rate was revised up to a punchy 0.6%. Household disposable income, for example, dropped by 0.6% during the quarter; the biggest drop in almost three years. And the widening current account deficit (see 10.10am) is another concern. Richard de Meo, managing director of Foenix Partners, says the report shows a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdiverging\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 economy: Very strong performance in the services sector, the sharpest rise in employee compensation in 3 years and outperformance in construction and industrial production are then firmly offset by very weak figures in household disposable income, continuing declines in business investment and a widening of the current account deficit. The diverging performance of multiple sectors of the economy simply mirrors the uncertainty that Brexit prospects are imposing on the UK outlook, with pockets of robust growth continuing to be frustrated by much bigger questions relating to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future. The UK government has warned that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy faces challenges, despite growing faster than thought in the last quarter. A Treasury spokesperson doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually mention the Brexit negotiations, but I think we know what they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re hinting at. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the official response: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The fundamentals of the UK economy are strong, but there remain challenges ahead. The Chancellor set out, in the Autumn Statement, his plan to support a resilient economy that works for everyone by driving productivity and supporting working people, while maintaining fiscal discipline.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report into the UK economy has good news for workers; compensation paid to employees rose by 4.5% in Q3. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the biggest rise since 2013, suggesting robust pay growth over the summer. But..... business investment only rose by 0.4% in the quarter (revised down from 0.9%), which means it was 2.2% LOWER than a year earlier. That indicates that firms did rein in their spending over the summer, after the Brexit vote. Worryingly, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current-account deficit has widened in the last quarter, as the country continues to import much more than it exports. The difference between money flowing into the UK, and out, jumped to \u00c2\u00a325.5bn in July-September. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the equivalent of 5.2% of the entire economic output this year, close to the record deficit recorded in 2013. This deterioration is mainly due to weaker trade -- Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit jumped from \u00c2\u00a311bn in Q2 to \u00c2\u00a316.7bn in Q3, according to the ONS. Total UK exports decreased by 2.6% in the July-September quarter, while imports increased by 1.4%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s despite the slump in the pound, which is meant to help exporters by making goods more competitively priced. The ONS says: Exports of goods decreased by 5.1% in Quarter 3 2016, due mainly to a decrease in exports of aircraft, chemicals and unspecified goods. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all good news, though - the ONS has revised down its estimate of UK growth in January-March to +0.3%, from +0.4%. Growth in the second quarter of 2016 has also been trimmed, from 0.7% to 0.6%. So, the UK economy grew just as fast in the three months after the EU referendum than in the three months after it. But overall, the economy is a little smaller than we thought. NEWSFLASH: The UK economy grew faster than we thought in the three months after the Brexit referendum. The Office for National Statistics has just revised up its estimate for UK GDP in the third quarter of 2016. It now reckons that the British economy expanded by 0.6%, not the 0.5% previously reported. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pretty decent rate of growth, especially given the uncertainty created by the EU referendum. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the ONS has revised up service sector growth (the largest part of the UK economy) in the last three months to 1.0%, from 08%. And the City can take the credit, with output from the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153business services and finance industries\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd growing faster than expected. Darren Morgan, Head of GDP, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Robust consumer demand continued to help the UK economy grow steadily in the third quarter of 2016. Growth was slightly stronger than first thought, though, due to greater output in the financial sector.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The ONS also says that industrial production only contracted by 0.4%, not 0.5%, while construction sector output has been revised from -1.1% to -0.8%. More to follow! Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flurry of banking news has spared us from the usual pre-Christmas slump. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets explains what you need to know: Firstly, overnight news that Monte dei Paschi is set to receive state aid as part of a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20bn package to keep the bank and troubled peers afloat is something of a relief, even if it does involve taxpayer funds and represents a big d\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00a0 vu, having already been rescued in recent years. It allows savers to have a quieter break following an eventful week that saw the bank struggle and ultimately fail to raise funds privately. Now it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a question of what price institutional bondholders have to pay and what sort of compensation retail investors will be offered to ensure the bailout follows new EU rules preventing the bill for state aid being unfairly pinned on taxpayers and that the deal is more politically palatable. It also remains to be seen how long the process will take. Talk yesterday of it taking several months to complete is a worryingly long time, allowing unhappy investors to brood and savers take flight, potentially making the current situation even worse. Veloce! News from the US overnight makes for a mixed bag with continental behemoths Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse settling with the Department of Justice (DoJ) for pre-crisis mis-selling of mortgage backed securities (MBS). The former settled for $7bn (only half payable in cash) which is just half the $14bn challenge that shook markets this summer, something considered to be US retaliation for the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call on Apple to repay Ireland \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn in back taxes. Credit Suisse settling for $5bn for similar allegations makes it two out of three. However a pre-Christmas hat-trick eludes the DoJ with UK giant Barclays refusing to give in, viewing claims against it as disproportionate to misdemeanours committed. Considering itself liable for just $1bn, it was happy to settle for $2bn, however, talks have broken down. The DoJ clearly wants more. Deutsche bank shares +3.7% suggests relief at a good result and the affair being closed. Credit Suisse shares flat implies an acceptable deal. Barclays -0.3% indicates some uncertainty about what it eventually ends up paying. However there is no panic. If anything, the standout performer this morning is the bank that has yet to be mentioned. The DoJ wants to fine Royal Bank of Scotland $12bn for its own MBS mis-selling. Its shares are +1.8% on a combination of optimism that it too could settle for half, like Deutsche, although gains may be capped by the prospect of the DoJ taking a dislike to Barclays pushing its luck and decides to make life difficult for the UK City experts are relieved that Italy has finally taken the plunge and agreed to provide \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20bn in emergency liquidity guarantees and capital injections for its banks. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also some exasperation that Rome didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do this years ago (Britain, for example, pumped money into its financial sector back in 2008). Jacopo Ceccatelli, head of Marzotto SIM SpA, a Milan-based broker-dealer, told Bloomberg \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Overall it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good news; finally we are heading toward a solution,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Italy is doing now what other countries have done many years ago to sustain their banking system.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Francesco Confuorti, chief executive officer of Milan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Advantage Financial, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A nationalization should have been done five years ago. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The bank lost time, money and credibility seeking to keep the patient on life support when he was in an irreversible coma.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Barclays is one of the biggest fallers on the FSTE 100 this morning, shedding 0.8%, after being accused of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcirresponsible and dishonest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 practices by the DoJ last night. Unlike many of its rivals, including Deutsche and Credit Suisse, Barclays is fighting charges of mis-selling mortgage backed securities. It has issued a statement to the City, saying: Barclays rejects the claims made in the Complaint. Barclays considers that the claims made in the Complaint are disconnected from the facts. Barclays will vigorously defend the Complaint and intends to seek its dismissal at the earliest opportunity. Shares in Italy banks have jumped by 1.2%, on relief that the Rome government has pledged to strengthen the sector with state help, starting with Monte dei Paschi. Now this is interesting... shares in Royal Bank of Scotland have jumped by 2% at the start of trading in London. RBS is still locked in negotiations with the DoJ over its role in the mortgage-backed securities scandal (which should be familiar to anyone whose seen or read The Big Short, for example). Investors will be concluding that RBS may not be fined as much as feared, given Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s success in haggling the DoJ down from $14bn to $7bn. Shares in Deutsche Bank have jumped by over 4% at the start of trading in Frankfurt, to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac18.50. That confirms that the $7bn settlement agreed with the DoJ for mis-selling toxic securities is much less than investors had feared. Three months ago, Deutsche\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares plunged below \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10, the lowest in decades, after news broke that the DoJ was demanding $14bn. Analyst Dan Davies reckons that leak may have rebounded on the US authorities, who were criticised for taking too tough a line over the scandal. The bailout of Monte dei Paschi is an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153important day\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the bank, says Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new prime minister. After approving the decree that will pave the way to prop up the banking sector, Paolo Gentiloni told reporters that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today marks an important day for Monte dei Paschi, a day that sees it turn a corner and able to reassure its depositors.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s British CEO, John Cryan, will surely be pleased to have finally settled with the US authorities - and for roughly half the $14bn bill he faced at one stage. Chris Wheeler, analyst at Atlantic securities told the Today programme that: I think the $14bn was always posturing position by the DoJ.... The CEO [John Cryan], a very organised individual, can say that box is now ticked. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flurry of fines, settlements and bailout deals are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good news\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the European banking sector, says Naeem Aslam, analyst at Think Markets. He points out that Deutche\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lengthy negotiations with the DoJ had worried the City. Credit Suisse resolved its issue with Department of Justice over mis-selling of mortgage securities. Similarly, Deutsche Bank has also struck a deal with the Department of Justice in relation to their mortgage-backed securities issue. Deutsche bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement is less than what the bank feared and this is music to investor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ears. The amount of $14 billion which was initially expected by Deutsche could have put the bank under a lot of strain. Its stocks plummeted as the bank waited for a result, as traders were not confident about the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to carve out a deal. Under the agreement with the DOJ, the total cost will be $7.2 billion. This figure consists of $3.1 billion in penalty fees and $4.1 billion which the bank needs to refund to its consumers. Italian market regulators have suspended trading in Monte dei Paschi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares and bonds, following the news that it will be bailed out by the state. The Italian government is likely to end up owning a large stake in MPS, while some bondholders will be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbailed in\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to help fund the rescue deal. Good morning. Christmas has come early for bank watchers, with a packed stocking full of crucial developments on the final day before the festive break. Overnight, the Italian government has given its approval for a state bailout of troubled Monte dei Paschi, after the bank failed to raise funds from private investors. Paolo Gentiloni, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new prime minister, announced in the early hours of Friday that his cabinet had agreed to the rescue and would be dipping into a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20bn fund that had already been approved by the parliament earlier this week in the event that MPS needed to be saved. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: In another dramatic, and long-awaited development, Deutsche Bank has finally agreed a $7.2bn settlement with the US Department of Justice for misselling mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the 2008 crisis. The German lender will pay a $3.1bn civil penalty and also provide $4.1bn in compensation to consumers. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much less than the $14bn which the DoJ had originally proposed, and which had raised fears over Deutsche\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial strength. Swiss bank Credit Suisse has also settled with the DoJ; it will pay a $2.48bn penalty plus handing back $2.8bn to consumers. Late last night it emerged that the DoJ is also taking Barclays to court, after the UK lender denied similar charges of bundling up home loans and selling them on. City editor Jill Treanor explains: The US department of justice has accused Barclays of jeopardising the financial position of millions of American homeowners over a decade-old mortgage bond mis-selling scandal. The DoJ is now taking the bank to court, in what was thought to be the first time an institution had failed to reached a settlement with the US authorities over the sale of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) in the run-up to the banking crisis. Responding to the news on Thursday night, Barclays said it would fight the case. Loretta Lynch, the US attorney general, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Financial institutions like Barclays occupy a position of vital public trust. Ordinary Americans depend on their assurances of transparency and legitimacy, and entrust these banks with their valuable savings.... As alleged in this complaint, Barclays jeopardised billions of dollars of wealth through practices that were plainly irresponsible and dishonest. With this filing, we are sending a clear message that the department of justice will not tolerate the defrauding of investors and the American people.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the development and reaction, as the City heads into its final trading session before Christmas (trading ends at lunchtime, hurrah!). At 9.30am we get a new estimate of UK GDP in the third quarter, which will give more details of how the economy performed in the three months after the Brexit vote. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably confirm that the economy expanded by 0.5% in the quarter.",

                "body":"<p>A majority of managers in the UK believe Brexit-related uncertainty will hold back economic growth next year and almost half think leaving the UK will be a drag in the long term, according to a survey.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.managers.org.uk/futureforecast\">2017 outlook from the Chartered Management Institute</a> (CMI) paints a relatively downbeat picture of the UK economy, but managers appear optimistic about their own organisations\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ability to thrive despite worries surrounding Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the European Union and the global climate as Donald Trump takes over the US presidency.</p> <p>In a survey of 1,118 managers, the CMI found 65% were pessimistic about the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic outlook for the next 12-18 months. Their caution over 2017 followed what appeared to be a tough year for many organisations, when only 39% said they had grown, the lowest proportion since 2012 when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jan/25/britain-triple-dip-recession-manufacturing\">shockwaves from the eurozone debt crisis hit the UK economy</a>. A further 39% said business levels had stayed roughly the same in 2016 and 22% said their business had declined.</p> <p>Asked about the impact of Brexit on economic growth in the next three to five years, 49% thought it would be negative. But a sizeable 37% believed leaving the EU would have a positive impact on the UK economy and 14% said it would have no impact.<br></p> <p>The findings follow signs that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/10/brexit-fears-large-uk-companies-planning-lower-investment-deloitte-survey\">businesses are becoming more nervous about hiring and investing</a> as Brexit negotiations approach. Companies and individuals have also become <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/27/uk-households-cash-brexit-vote-import-costs\">more concerned about costs</a> because the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp fall since the referendum has made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/26/uk-factories-wary-of-sterlings-fall-and-rising-costs-in-new-year\">imports such as fuel and food ingredients to the UK more expensive</a>.</p> <p>But the CMI poll, conducted in November and published on Wednesday, also showed a majority of managers, 57%, were confident about their organisations\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 own prospects in the year ahead. Just 25% said they felt pessimistic. Managers in the private sector were more optimistic than those in the public and charity sectors.</p> <p>The CMI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, Ann Francke, said the results showed that despite uncertain times ahead there were still opportunities for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153forward-thinking\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd UK businesses.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Although it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear that there are significant challenges posed by the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to Brexit, as a country we need to move forward and harness pragmatic positivity,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said.</p> <p>Francke also called for employers to address the growing sense of frustration with the status quo and widespread inequality expressed by voters in the UK and elsewhere this year.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153In this climate of heightened political uncertainty and economic turbulence, the time is now to position Britain as a global leader in responsible capitalism, targeting essential issues like workplace ethics, inclusivity and executive pay to restore trust and transparency and improve productivity,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said.</p> <p>Managers said tackling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/25/what-is-productivity-why-uk-poor\">the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor productivity performance</a> was a priority in 2017 and that they wanted to improve economic efficiency by investing in technology, improving management skills and cutting bureaucracy.</p> <p>Those surveyed also emphasised that the UK needed to invest in skills to boost its post-referendum prospects.

                "bodyText":"A majority of managers in the UK believe Brexit-related uncertainty will hold back economic growth next year and almost half think leaving the UK will be a drag in the long term, according to a survey. The 2017 outlook from the Chartered Management Institute (CMI) paints a relatively downbeat picture of the UK economy, but managers appear optimistic about their own organisations\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ability to thrive despite worries surrounding Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the European Union and the global climate as Donald Trump takes over the US presidency. In a survey of 1,118 managers, the CMI found 65% were pessimistic about the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic outlook for the next 12-18 months. Their caution over 2017 followed what appeared to be a tough year for many organisations, when only 39% said they had grown, the lowest proportion since 2012 when the shockwaves from the eurozone debt crisis hit the UK economy. A further 39% said business levels had stayed roughly the same in 2016 and 22% said their business had declined. Asked about the impact of Brexit on economic growth in the next three to five years, 49% thought it would be negative. But a sizeable 37% believed leaving the EU would have a positive impact on the UK economy and 14% said it would have no impact. The findings follow signs that businesses are becoming more nervous about hiring and investing as Brexit negotiations approach. Companies and individuals have also become more concerned about costs because the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp fall since the referendum has made imports such as fuel and food ingredients to the UK more expensive. But the CMI poll, conducted in November and published on Wednesday, also showed a majority of managers, 57%, were confident about their organisations\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 own prospects in the year ahead. Just 25% said they felt pessimistic. Managers in the private sector were more optimistic than those in the public and charity sectors. The CMI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, Ann Francke, said the results showed that despite uncertain times ahead there were still opportunities for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153forward-thinking\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd UK businesses. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Although it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear that there are significant challenges posed by the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to Brexit, as a country we need to move forward and harness pragmatic positivity,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. Francke also called for employers to address the growing sense of frustration with the status quo and widespread inequality expressed by voters in the UK and elsewhere this year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In this climate of heightened political uncertainty and economic turbulence, the time is now to position Britain as a global leader in responsible capitalism, targeting essential issues like workplace ethics, inclusivity and executive pay to restore trust and transparency and improve productivity,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. Managers said tackling the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor productivity performance was a priority in 2017 and that they wanted to improve economic efficiency by investing in technology, improving management skills and cutting bureaucracy. Those surveyed also emphasised that the UK needed to invest in skills to boost its post-referendum prospects. Almost half, or 47%, said they fully supported the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apprenticeship levy, which comes into effect in April to help fund work-based training schemes. Asked about Trump, who swept to power in the US on an anti-globalisation platform, 40% thought his election win would have an overtly negative impact on the UK. But 31% thought it would be positive for the UK. A separate poll of employers published on Wednesday highlighted concerns about a fresh bout of economic turmoil when article 50 is triggered in 2017 to begin the process of leaving the EU. The survey of 201 employers by the Recruitment &amp; Employment Confederation (REC) found that four out of 10 respondents felt that formally notifying the EU of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intention to withdraw would make delays in business investment and hiring decisions more likely. But 12% believed delays would become less likely and 38% predicted no impact on investment and hiring. There were also worries that triggering article 50 could intensify skills shortages, with 40% of employers saying EU nationals would become more likely to leave the UK, compared with 39% who saw no impact and 9% who believed they would be less likely to leave. The REC chief executive, Kevin Green, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The prospect of EU workers leaving the UK at a time when employers are already facing severe skills shortages is particularly concerning because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a risk we cannot afford. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need EU workers in many sectors across the economy, from construction to hospitality to public services.

                "body":"<p>When Canadian Mark Carney accepted the job of Bank of England governor in 2012, he said he was honoured to accept the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153important and demanding role\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It is doubtful he could have foreseen, however, quite how demanding it would turn out to be. </p> <p>As the man charged with maintaining calm in the financial markets and the economy, Carney had the most testing of years in 2016. The year started with wild swings in global markets. As the EU referendum campaign got under way, Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit recession warning drew calls for his resignation from pro-leave supporters.</p> <p>The shock result sent the pound tumbling and sparked a political crisis. The Bank stepped in with an interest rate cut and more electronic money printing. There was a fresh onslaught from politicians in autumn as senior Tories lambasted the Bank <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/21/criticising-mark-carney-tory-hobby-bank-england-governor\">over the effects of low interest rates</a>, but after weeks of speculation over his future Carney agreed to stay on as governor for an extra year until the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> deadline is expected to expire in 2019.</p> <p>After Donald Trump won the US presidential race on an anti-globalisation ticket, Carney ended the year with a plea for politicians to do more to share out the gains from global trade. </p> <p>Here is Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s year in quotes: <br></p> <h2>A new year warning</h2> <p>Carney started the year on a gloomy note by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/19/bank-of-england-mark-carney-rules-out-uk-interest-rate-rise\">pouring cold water on market talk of a rate rise</a>, saying UK growth was still too weak. <br></p> <p>Amid turmoil in global markets in January, Carney said the UK faced \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a powerful set of forces\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. </p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The world is weaker and UK growth has slowed,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he added. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The year has turned and in my view the decision proved straightforward. Now is not yet the time to raise interest rates.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>His new stance marked something of a climbdown on his guidance in the summer of 2015 that a decision about raising rates would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/16/uk-interest-rate-rise-new-year\">\u00e2\u20ac\u0153come into sharper relief\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</a> at the end of the year.

In the future, we will not hesitate to take any additional measures required to meet our responsibilities as the United Kingdom moves forward.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <h2>Economic post-traumatic stress disorder</h2> <p>A week after the referendum, Carney said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153some monetary policy easing will likely be required over the summer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/30/interest-rate-cut-likely-brexit-bank-of-england-mark-carney\">signalling that a rate cut was coming</a>. In a wide-ranging speech he also highlighted a cocktail of economic, political and geopolitical uncertainty.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153All this uncertainty has contributed to a form of economic post-traumatic stress disorder amongst households and businesses, as well as in financial markets,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today, uncertainty has meant an inchoate sense of economic insecurity for many people, despite generalised economic prosperity. Across the advanced economies, employment appears less secure, wages more subdued, and inequality more pronounced.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd </p> <h2>We were right to warn on Brexit<br></h2> <p>In July, Carney <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/12/mark-carney-hand-notes-private-talks-chancellor-mps-brexit\">faced questions from parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Treasury committee</a> over whether the Bank had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153peddled phoney forecasts\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about the risks of a Brexit vote. </p> <p>The governor said accusations from critics that the Bank had been dishonest were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extraordinary\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have an obligation to give these assessments. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we view something as the biggest risk to financial stability, we have an obligation to parliament and to the people of the UK to make that clear.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <h2>Time for an interest rate cut</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">Cutting official interest rates to a record low of 0.25%</a> and expanding the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s electronic money-printing programme to shore up the post-referendum economy, Carney said it was time for action. <br></p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is a clear case for stimulus, and stimulus now, in order to have an effect when the economy really needs it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <h2>Serene about our stance<br></h2> <p>In September, with the economy continuing to show signs of resilience since the referendum, Carney rejected criticism that the central bank had overcooked warnings of a hit to the economy from the Brexit vote. He also defended the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s post-referendum stimulus package.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am absolutely serene about the \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 judgments made both by the MPC and the FPC,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carney told parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Treasury committee, referring to the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary and financial policy committees. </p> <h2>Call me Carnage<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"58702c7fa74c6cd523a19f1ed5711bab5ee2cdd0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58702c7fa74c6cd523a19f1ed5711bab5ee2cdd0/0_0_3500_2254/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Bank of England governor Mark Carney\" width=\"1000\" height=\"644\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Bank of England governor admitted his childhood nicknames included \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCarnage\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCarnival\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Wattie/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fielding questions from schoolchildren in Coventry, Carney revealed he likes milk chocolate and dogs.</p> <p>Asked about childhood nicknames, he answered: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I was given nicknames that were variants of my last name which is Carney, so I was called Carnival, or Carnage, or things like that.

                "bodyText":"When Canadian Mark Carney accepted the job of Bank of England governor in 2012, he said he was honoured to accept the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153important and demanding role\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It is doubtful he could have foreseen, however, quite how demanding it would turn out to be. As the man charged with maintaining calm in the financial markets and the economy, Carney had the most testing of years in 2016. The year started with wild swings in global markets. As the EU referendum campaign got under way, Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit recession warning drew calls for his resignation from pro-leave supporters. The shock result sent the pound tumbling and sparked a political crisis. The Bank stepped in with an interest rate cut and more electronic money printing. There was a fresh onslaught from politicians in autumn as senior Tories lambasted the Bank over the effects of low interest rates, but after weeks of speculation over his future Carney agreed to stay on as governor for an extra year until the Brexit deadline is expected to expire in 2019. After Donald Trump won the US presidential race on an anti-globalisation ticket, Carney ended the year with a plea for politicians to do more to share out the gains from global trade. Here is Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s year in quotes: A new year warning Carney started the year on a gloomy note by pouring cold water on market talk of a rate rise, saying UK growth was still too weak. Amid turmoil in global markets in January, Carney said the UK faced \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a powerful set of forces\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The world is weaker and UK growth has slowed,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he added. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The year has turned and in my view the decision proved straightforward. Now is not yet the time to raise interest rates.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd His new stance marked something of a climbdown on his guidance in the summer of 2015 that a decision about raising rates would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153come into sharper relief\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at the end of the year. That did little to help shake off the tag of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unreliable boyfriend\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd given to the Bank governor by one MP. The kindness of strangers In one of many warnings to come about the potential consequences of a vote for Brexit, Carney said in January that concerns about a UK exit from the EU could test \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the kindness of strangers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a reference to the global investors who fund the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big current account deficit with the rest of the world. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The global general environment has become much more febrile, much more volatile, and relying on the kindness of strangers is not optimal in that kind of environment,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carney told MPs. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not out of ammunition In February at a G20 meeting in Shanghai, Carney argued that central banks still had some firepower left to prop up the global recovery, but he warned that politicians must not rely solely on low interest rates and should use government policy to help boost growth. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Several commentators are peddling the myth that monetary policy is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcout of ammunition\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 This is wrong, but the widespread absence of global price pressures demands that our firepower be well aimed,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carney said. Carney defends Bank over Brexit warnings In March, Carney was forced to fend off accusations that Threadneedle Street was being too supportive of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pro-EU line and described as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153entirely unfounded\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the suggestion from the pro-Brexit Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg that the Bank was being politically partisan. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am expressing the views of the Bank,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leant on by anybody.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brexit could stall UK economy In April, Carney said Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy could struggle to grow if the country voted to quit the EU, and warned that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy already appeared to be losing steam before the EU referendum. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Risks around the referendum are the biggest risks facing the UK economy, we have contingency planning to decrease the potential impacts of uncertainty,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told the Stockport Express newspaper. Carney drops the R-word At a press conference in May, Carney said a vote to leave the EU could possibly tip the UK into recession. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Material slowdown in growth, notable increase in inflation. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s judgement. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a judgment not based on a whim, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a judgment based on rigorous analysis and careful consideration. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a range of possible scenarios around those directions, which could possibly include a technical recession.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Prepared for referendum fallout After the referendum result is confirmed, with share prices crashing and David Cameron announcing his intention to step down as prime minister, Carney insisted: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are well prepared for this.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have taken all the necessary steps to prepare for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s events. In the future, we will not hesitate to take any additional measures required to meet our responsibilities as the United Kingdom moves forward.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Economic post-traumatic stress disorder A week after the referendum, Carney said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153some monetary policy easing will likely be required over the summer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, signalling that a rate cut was coming. In a wide-ranging speech he also highlighted a cocktail of economic, political and geopolitical uncertainty. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All this uncertainty has contributed to a form of economic post-traumatic stress disorder amongst households and businesses, as well as in financial markets,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today, uncertainty has meant an inchoate sense of economic insecurity for many people, despite generalised economic prosperity. Across the advanced economies, employment appears less secure, wages more subdued, and inequality more pronounced.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We were right to warn on Brexit In July, Carney faced questions from parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Treasury committee over whether the Bank had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153peddled phoney forecasts\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about the risks of a Brexit vote. The governor said accusations from critics that the Bank had been dishonest were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extraordinary\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have an obligation to give these assessments. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we view something as the biggest risk to financial stability, we have an obligation to parliament and to the people of the UK to make that clear.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Time for an interest rate cut Cutting official interest rates to a record low of 0.25% and expanding the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s electronic money-printing programme to shore up the post-referendum economy, Carney said it was time for action. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is a clear case for stimulus, and stimulus now, in order to have an effect when the economy really needs it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Serene about our stance In September, with the economy continuing to show signs of resilience since the referendum, Carney rejected criticism that the central bank had overcooked warnings of a hit to the economy from the Brexit vote. He also defended the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s post-referendum stimulus package. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am absolutely serene about the \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 judgments made both by the MPC and the FPC,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carney told parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Treasury committee, referring to the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary and financial policy committees. Call me Carnage Fielding questions from schoolchildren in Coventry, Carney revealed he likes milk chocolate and dogs. Asked about childhood nicknames, he answered: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I was given nicknames that were variants of my last name which is Carney, so I was called Carnival, or Carnage, or things like that. I like Carnage a little better than Carnival. It seemed a little more manly I guess.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We are actors in a play Carney made another call in September for politicians to stop relying on central banks to do all the heavy lifting on supporting economic growth. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Bank of England has long stressed that central bank policies are not the cause of low rates, but responses to them. We are actors in a play written by others. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Long-run prosperity was never in the gift of monetary policymakers. As the 10th anniversary of the start of the crisis approaches, a consensus is growing that escaping this low-growth, low-inflation trap will require a rebalancing between monetary, fiscal and structural policies.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take orders from politicians Just a week after Theresa May took a swipe at the impact of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ordinary\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd people, Carney said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are not going to take instruction on our policies from the political side.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Politics won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t scare me off After an onslaught on his performance by the Conservative party establishment, Carney insisted he would not be swayed by political issues as he weighed up the option of departing in two years or extending his contract by a further three years to 2021. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is entirely personal, and no one should read anything into that decision in terms of government policy, actual, imagined, potential, past, etc. This is a role that requires total attention, devotion, and I intend to give it for as long as I can.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see Brexit process through At the end of October, Carney ended weeks of speculation about his future by agreeing to stay on as governor of the Bank of England until 2019. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153By taking my term in office beyond the expected period of the article 50 process, this should help contribute to securing an orderly transition to the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new relationship with Europe,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Consumers are shrugging off Brexit vote so far Keeping interest rates at their record low of 0.25% and warning of higher inflation ahead, Carney and his colleagues on the monetary policy committee said individuals seemed to be resilient for now. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For households, the signs of an economic slowdown are notable by their absence. Perceptions of job security remain strong. Wages are growing at around the same modest pace as at the start of the year,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Central banks haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t raised inequality \u00e2\u20ac\u0153An excessive focus on monetary policy in many respects is a massive blame-deflection exercise. We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make the structural decisions that change the path of productivity. Monetary policy doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t drive fundamentals,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carney told MPs in November. Rest of Europe needs City of London In November, Carney warned that European economies could be damaged if their access to the City of London was disrupted after Britain leaves the EU. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK is effectively the investment banker for Europe.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Globalisation is leaving many behind Carney finished the year with a rallying cry to policymakers across advanced economies to tackle the causes of a growing sense of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153isolation and detachment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd among people who felt left behind by globalisation.

                "bodyText":"Right, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my news story about the FTSE 100 hitting a new record high tonight, for anyone just tuning in. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow for more live coverage of events in the markets and the world economy. Thanks, and goodnight (and enjoy the holidays, if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not back at work yet...). GW Wall Street is failing to match the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead. Shares are dropping back, so the Dow Jones is down almost 100 points at 19,847. That suggests that the Dow is not going to hit the 20,000 mark today. At least that gives us something to watch out for tomorrow. This is what I was banging on about earlier -- the FTSE 100 is actually down 6% this year if you measure it in US dollars (rather than up 13% in pounds). The London stock market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally has helped to drive up the wealth of the richest in society, as well as boosting the value of pension funds and other asset managers. Indeed, 2016 has been a vintage year for the ultra-rich - despite the backlash against populism this year (or perhaps helping to trigger it). Bloomberg has calculated that the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s billionaires are ending the year owning $237 billion more than on January 1st. Some of the most famous, including Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, did particularly well \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nice to remember that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re donating much of their wealth to charity. It was a turbulent year, though, with the US election, the Brexit vote, and various other shocks and panics meaning fortunes fluctuated over the last 12 months. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: The World\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Richest Made $237 Billion This Year With excellent timing, Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s JP Spinetto has highlighted how the British pound has been one of the worst-performing currencies this year. Sterling has shed 17%, which puts the 13% jump in the FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value this year into some context. This chart of the FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best-performing shares shows how mining stocks drove the market to tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record close: But property firms fell, after housebuilder Bovis warned on profits early this morning after failing to build as many homes as planned. With just two trading days to go, the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mining sector in on track for its best year the aftermath of the financial crisis. The Telegraph\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tara Cunningham explains: London-listed miners are poised for their biggest annual gain since 2009 as firmer oil and commodity prices pushed the sector higher. So far this year, the FTSE 350 mining index has rallied by 102%. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s her full report. Ruth Lea, economic adviser at Arbuthnot Banking Group, points out that the FTSE 250 index of smaller UK firms has also rallied since June: City traders often talk about a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Santa Rally\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd this time of year, and once again the markets have provided. David Cheetham, market analyst at online trading group XTB, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Observers of the markets have for many years noticed a strong propensity for stocks to rise in the period between Christmas and the New Year and this phenomenon appears to be playing out once more.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (thanks to the Press Association for the quote). Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 record high comes 20 months after the previous historic closing level. That closing high, in April 2015, was followed by a sharp summer selloff triggered by fears over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. This was compounded by concerns of a global slowdown in December 2015 when the US central bank raised interest rates for the first time in a decade. But shares then recovered from February this year, and even the Brexit vote was only a blip in the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s march back over 7100 points. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally means the FTSE 100 is now 12% higher than on the day of the EU referendum in June. That means that the value of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest listed companies jumped by 12% in sterling terms since the vote. But... the pound is down by 10% against the euro since June, and around 17% weaker against the US dollar. NEWSFLASH: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has hit its new all-time closing high, driven by strong gains in the mining sector. The blue-chip FTSE 100 just closed 37 points higher at 7106.08, beating the 7103.98 point mark set in April 2015. Mining companies drove the rally, on hopes of robust US economic growth next year. That sent the prices of copper, oil, etc up today, along with precious metals producers. Silver miner Fresnillo and gold producer Randgold both gained around 5% today, followed by BHP Billiton (+4.2%) and Rio Tinto (+3.3%). Internationally focused companies also benefitted from the weaker pound today, as it makes their exports more competitive. However, housebuilding shares suffered following this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit warning from Bovis Homes (which ended down 5.2%). Chris Beauchamp, Chief Market Analyst at IG, says London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s traders came back from Christmas with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a festive bounce in their step\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The FTSE 100 is the star performer today, helped on its way higher by an excellent turn from the index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mining contingent. The sector was one of the really big winners in 2016, making a remarkable comeback over the past twelve months, and it makes sense to think that investors are looking to juice a few more points out of the rally as the year-end approaches. Meanwhile, Bovis Homes is down over 5%, dragging the housebuilder sector with it, as it issues an unexpected warning on completion levels. It is always tough to issue a profit warning, but doubly so in the fallow period between Christmas and the New Year. The sector has gone from being a star performer in recent years to one of the hardest hit since Brexit; miners were the contrarian play for 2016, so the same could be said of a housing sector still supported by healthy demand and constricted supply. As flagged earlier, though, there is one proviso -- the FTSE 100 is priced in sterling, so today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record high has not been adjusted for the fall in sterling since the Brexit vote. Right, the FTSE 100 has entered its closing auction.....so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find out any moment if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hit a new all-time closing high. Back in the City, the FTSE 100 is hovering around its highest ever closing level in late trading. The index is up 31 points at 7099, having earlier burst over its record closing level (7103.98). So we might get a new record high in around 30 minutes.... The Dow has now dropped into the red, down 23 points at 19,921, as the 20k mark proves a hurdle too far..... We haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen the Dow hitting 20,000 points yet, but we have had the next best thing -- a group of pets helping to ring the opening bell on Wall Street. Best Friends Animal Society had the honour of opening the session, to highlight their work preventing dogs and cats at America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shelters being put down. And the group delighted traders by turning up with several impeccably behaved pooches, as this video shows. The Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early rally is fizzling out, after just 20 minutes of trading. Rather than powering over the 20,000 point mark, the benchmark index has subsided back to its opening levels - like a Christmas diner who over-indulged on the mince pies and rather fancies a quiet day. US stock market watchers are bracing for another day of tension.... The Dow is rising at the start of trading... up 29 points to 19,974, and bringing the 20k landmark even closer. And the tech-heavy Nasdaq index has hit a new all-time high at the open, as the Trump Rally continues to drive shares higher. The opening bell is ringing on Wall Street, and traders are squinting at their screens to see if the Dow Jones will hit the 20,000 mark for the first time ever.... Tensions is building on Wall Street as traders wonder whether the Dow Jones industrial average could smash through the 20,000 point mark today. Last night, the Dow ended the day just 55 points shy of this new record. And the futures market suggests that the index could open higher at 9.30am local time (2.30pm GMT). Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says: Thee Santa rally for the equity market continues and every single day investors hope that the DOW index breaks that 20K mark, but so far their wish has not been granted. The 20K mark for the Dow has become a remarkable resistance and a break of this, could attract fresh capital. The London stock market isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only one rallying today. Overnight, the Australian ASX 100 index jumped by 1% to its highest level in 2016, also thanks to demand for mining company shares. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, analyst at London Capital Group, explains: Australian stocks hit the highest levels of this year and are set for a strong close on the back of higher commodity prices and firm appetite in global stock markets following Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory in the US presidential election. The FTSE 100 is rising partly because the pound is falling. Sterling remains at a two-month low against the US dollar, which pushes up the value of international firms listed in London. The euro is also losing ground against the dollar, down almost one cent at $1.0397: This chart shows how the FTSE 100 is back at April 2015\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record closing level, in sterling terms anyway (ignoring the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall against the US dollar since the Brexit vote) Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue-chip index of the biggest listed companies has just crept above its alltime closing high. In quiet trading, the FTSE 100 has risen by 35 points to above 7104 points, driven up by mining companies. That takes the index a whisker over the previous record closing high, of 7103.98, set in April 2015. This also puts the Footsie close to its highest ever level -- the all-time intraday high of 7128 points recorded in October. We should note that trading volumes are really rather thin, with many traders still off for Christmas (having banked their profits/losses for the year). And these figures don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take account of the slump in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote. But still, it illustrates that investors are anticipating a US fiscal stimulus package next year. Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong American consumer confidence figures, which were the best in 15 years, have also bolstered sentiment, helping to push up the price of copper and oil today. BHP Billiton, which produces iron ore, copper, coal and gold, is leading the risers with a 4.3% gain, with silver miner Fresnillo close behind, followed by fellow mining giants Anglo American (+4%) and Rio Tinto (+3.5%). Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Equities are posting small gains amid thin intra-holiday trading that is maintaining the Santa Rally into year-end. The FTSE is boosted by higher oil prices supporting the commodities space, offsetting weakness among some big defensives, airlines (Airbus problems) and real estate (rates to rise and prices to fall in 2017?) Sterling has fallen to its lowest level since late October, as it ends the year on a weak note. The pound has dropped by 0.4% this morning against the US dollar, to $1.223. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no obvious trigger for the move, which comes as City experts predict further losses next year. A new survey by financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown found that a majority of respondents expect the sterling/US dollar rate to end 2017 at lower than $1.25. Some 40% predicting steeper declines to under $1.20. Many of those polled predicted that the US dollar could rally, if Donald Trump pushes through a new fiscal stimulus plan. One respondent says: Full implementation will likely [lead to] a second material leg higher of the US dollar as the Fed is priced to react to inflationary pressures such a package would bring. However, implementation of President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s protectionist and isolationist rhetoric would narrow the breadth of any dollar rally, with the Japanese yen and the euro the beneficiaries.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Other forecasters, though, think the pound has been oversold, and could bounce back once Brexit negotiations begin. Stockbroking firm Numis is hopeful that Bovis will get back on track next year, despite missing its housebuilding targets for 2016. They say: Bovis has announced that due to production delays and the deferral of 180 completions into 2017, it now anticipates full year results to be c11% below Numis expectations. We are leaving 2017 estimates unchanged reflecting the expected completion of the deferred units and a better position with regard to planning and production. The drop in UK mortgage approvals last month could be a sign that the property sector will struggle next year. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight believes that prices could actually fall, after several years of strong increases. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his reaction to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BBA report: We believe the fundamentals for house buyers will progressively deteriorate during 2017 with consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 purchasing power weakening markedly and the labour market likely softening. Increasing economic uncertainty is also likely to weigh down on consumer confidence and willingness to engage in major transactions such as buying a house. Housing market activity and prices are also likely to be pressurized by stretched house prices to earnings ratios and tight checking of prospective mortgage borrowers by lenders However, the downside for house prices will be limited markedly by a shortage of houses for sale. On balance, we suspect that house prices will be essentially flat over the year. Indeed, we believe that a small drop in house prices in 2017 is just as likely to occur as a small rise. BREAKING: The number of new mortgage approved in the UK fell last month, in another sign that the property sector is slowing. High street banks approved 40,659 new loans for home purchases in November, down from 40,835 in October, and 9% lower than a year ago. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also rather less than City expectations -- some economists expected as many as 41,400 new loans to be approved: The British Bankers Association also reports that gross mortgage borrowing fell by 5% compared to November 2015, to \u00c2\u00a312.2bn. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key slide from the BBA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly report: The report also shows that consumers are continuing to borrow to fund their shopping. The BBA says: Consumer credit annual growth fell back in November to around 6% despite strong retail sales. Growth continues to be supported in the case of personal loans by favourable interest rates. Bovis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure to hit its sales targets this year could be a sign that the UK housing sector is now suffering from the Brexit vote. Analyst Russ Mould of stockbrokers AJ Bell says: A profit warning from FTSE 250 firm Bovis is another crack in the wall when it comes to the house builders sector.... Bovis has today stated that legal completion volumes will rise by just 1% to 2% in 2016 year, rather than the targeted 5% as the sale of 180 homes has slipped from this year to next, owing to slower-than-expected build production in December. This means completion volumes fell by 1% to 2% year on year in the second half, raising questions as to whether the market is slowing down in a post-Brexit world after all. Even if Bovis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 average selling price rose 10% to around \u00c2\u00a3255,000 for the year that again implies a marked second-half deceleration, as prices rose 14% to an average of \u00c2\u00a3254,500 in the first six months of this year. Management guidance for pre-tax profits of between \u00c2\u00a3160 million and \u00c2\u00a3170 million implies a 10% miss relative to the analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 consensus of \u00c2\u00a3184 million at the mid-point and that helps to explain why the shares are down 4% this morning at the opening. Despite Bovis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes, the London stock market has risen slightly in the first trading day of the week. The blue-chip FTSE 100 has gained 15 points to 7084, led by mining companies such as BHP Billiton (+4%) and Anglo American (+3%). Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jump in US consumer confidence to the highest level since 2001 is fuelling hopes for robust economic growth in 2017, which would drive demand for copper, iron ore, nickel and the like. Shares in UK housebuilders are falling in early trading, following Bovis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unscheduled warning on profits. Bovis fell over 5%, followed by rival building firms Crest Nicholson (-1.7%), Berkeley Group (-1.6%) and John Laing (-1.3%). Traders must be worried that Bovis isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only company to experience a slowdown last month. Financial journalist Daniel Coatsworth points out that Bovis weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expected to released results until early January. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more reaction: Newsflash: One of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest housebuilders has warned that it will fail to sell as many homes as planned this year. Bovis Homes has sent an early shiver through the chilly City of London, by reporting that production was slower than expected this month. That means Bovis will sell around 180 homes less than expected, which will make a dent in its profits for the year too. In a statement to the City, Bovis warns: We expect the volume delivery for 2016 will be lower than previously anticipated at between 3,950 and 4,000 homes, the exact number depending on the extent of legal completions in the remaining days of the year. We have experienced slower than expected build production across the Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sites during December, resulting in approximately 180 largely built and sold private homes which were expected to complete in 2016 being deferred into early 2017. Bovis now expects to bank pre-tax profits of around \u00c2\u00a3160m to \u00c2\u00a3170m for 2016 -- compared with \u00c2\u00a3160.1m in 2015. Analysts had expected around \u00c2\u00a3183m, so the City will be disappointed. Reaction to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial workers are making their way back to their desks through the fog this morning, after a four-day Christmas holiday. Hopefully everyone had a lovely break, even though fears over what the future will bring may have dampened the atmosphere over the turkey and trimmings. In particular, the prospect of a new president in the Oval Office, and Britain triggering the process of exiting the European Union, is worrying many UK executives. The Chartered Management Institute is warning this morning that a majority of managers in the UK believe Brexit-related uncertainty will hold back economic growth in 2017, with many also expecting long-term economic damage. My colleague Katie Allen explains: In a survey of 1,118 managers, the CMI found 65% were pessimistic about the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic outlook for the next 12-18 months. Their caution over 2017 followed what appeared to be a tough year for many organisations, when only 39% said they had grown, the lowest proportion since 2012 when the shockwaves from the eurozone debt crisis hit the UK economy. A further 39% said business levels had stayed roughly the same in 2016 and 22% said their business had declined. Asked about the impact of Brexit on economic growth in the next three to five years, 49% thought it would be negative. But a sizeable 37% believed leaving the EU would have a positive impact on the UK economy and 14% said it would have no impact. The findings follow signs that businesses are becoming more nervous about hiring and investing as Brexit negotiations approach. Companies and individuals have also become more concerned about costs because the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp fall since the referendum has made imports such as fuel and food ingredients to the UK more expensive. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: Also coming up today At 9.30am, the British Bankers Association will report how many new mortgage loans were approved in November. Economists expect a small rise, from 40,851 to 41,100, despite that Brexit uncertainty. European stock markets are likely to be fairly subdued, after a thin trading day yesterday. Wall Street was also open on Tuesday, but the Dow Jones index again failed to smash through the 20,000 point mark even though US consumer confidence jumped to a 15-year high. The figures underline how the US economy has strengthened this year. However, a certain someone thinks he should get the credit.... We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

                "bodyText":"The FTSE 100 may have been toasting a new closing peak, but elsewhere in Europe shares were drifting lower, with banking stocks proving a drag on markets. The final scores in Europe showed: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.21% to 11,451.05 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.2% lower at 4838.47 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.18% to 19,203.94 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.19% at 9327.1 But in Greece, the Athens market added 0.15% to 636.67 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is drifting away from the 20,000 level and is currently down 18 points at 19,815. Meanwhile, after initially shrugging off an unexpected rise in US crude inventories, oil prices have edged marginally lower, with Brent now down 0.37% at $56.01 a barrel. As for the FTSE 100, it has hit a record high for the second day running, so here is our story giving the background to Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new peak: On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow for the last trading day of the year. It looked a bit unlikely as the FTSE 100 drifted lower for much of the day, but the leading index managed a last minute dash to a new closing high. The index ended 14.18 points higher at 7120.26, within sight of the all time record reached on 11 October this year. With gold and silver prices moving higher, precious metal miners such as Randgold Resources and Fresnillo helped push the index into record territory. Meanwhile the more UK-focused FTSE 250 added just 2.61 points to 18,015.42 and is some distance away from its own peak of 18,607 achieved in early October. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has dipped lower - down around 7 points - while the FTSE 100 has shied away from a new closing high and is now 4 points lower. On the Dow, Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: After yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisive turn lower for US markets there has been little sign of fresh bullish momentum. Barring a miracle, Dow 20,000 looks off the cards, although the rebound in the index over the past year, as in other US markets, has been astounding. Only time will tell if the Trump euphoria can be sustained, or whether we are due another correction early on in the New Year. Oil prices are little changed following the release of the latest US data, with Brent crude up 0.5% at $56.50 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate more or less flat at $54.03. US crude stocks showed a surprise rise last week, according to official figures. Inventories rose by 614,000 barrels to 486m compared to forecasts of a 2.1m barrel decrease, according to the Energy Information Administration. But gasoline stocks fell by 1.6m barrels rather than the expected 1.3m barrel increase. Despite the Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reluctance to surge towards 20,000, the FTSE 100 has just edged into positive territory. Could we yet have a new closing high? US markets are mainly edging ahead in early trading, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average regaining a little ground after Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s triple digit decline and moved another step closer to the so far elusive 20,000 barrier. The Dow is currently up 36 points at 19869 while the S&amp;P 500 opened marginally higher and the Nasdaq composite marginally lower. Oil is holding steady ahead of the latest US inventory figures from the Department of Energy. On Wednesday the American Petroleum Institute reported a surprise 4.2m barrel increase in weekly US crude stocks compared to an expected fall of 2.1m barrels. But ahead of the official DoE figures, Brent crude is up 0.44% at $56.47 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate is 0.18% lower at $53.96. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters on the US data: A drop in U.S. exports last month pushed the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit in goods higher while the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell last week in a positive sign for the labor market. The two reports released on Thursday suggested that when Donald Trump becomes president next month, the labor market will likely be at roughly full strength and international trade could be weighing on the economy. In an initial estimate that does not include trade in services, the Commerce Department said America exported $1.2 billion less in November than in October. Imports rose by $2.2 billion during the month. The full trade report for November is due on Jan. 6... Separately, initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 265,000 for the week ended Dec. 24, the Labor Department said. It was the 95th straight week that claims were below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market. That is the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller. The department said in a statement there were no special factors affecting claims last week although estimating the data can be more difficult around holiday periods. The department said the actual number of claims was estimated by government staff for 10 states. More on the US trade gap, from Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief US economist: Gracious me, we have TWO little pieces of economic news. Firstly, America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit has swelled by 5.5%. New figures from the Commerce Department show that the US trade gap widened to $65.3bn in November, up from $61.9bn in October. Exports shrank by $1.2bn to $121.7bn, while America imported $187bn of stuff, $2.2bn more than in October. Secondly, the number of Americans filing new unemployment claims has fallen by 10,000, to 265,000. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s broadly in line with forecasts, and shows that the US labour market remains resilient. That will reassure the US Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates earlier this month. As it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quiet, what better time to catch up with the biggest business stories of 2016? We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve crunched the numbers, and found that the Brexit vote, and the US election\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impact on the markets, were the most popular issues this year. Our daily liveblog did well again too - so thanks to all readers for keeping our numbers up :) Fiona Walsh, business editor of Theguardian.com, explains: Six of our 10 most-read articles covered the aftermath of the shock EU referendum result, from the trillions wiped off global markets to the plummeting pound and the prospect of negative interest rates. There was Donald Trump too, of course, and an apocalyptic warning from economists in January to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sell everything\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd before a new crash. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full 10 Ten: I fear America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bring much excitement today either. The futures market is suggesting Wall Street will open little changed, in 90 minutes time, after the S&amp;P 500 fell by almost 0.9% yesterday (its biggest drop since the US election). Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, has now criticised the European Central Bank for demanding that Monte Dei Paschi raise more new capital than previously planned. Gentiloni told reporters that he got the news on Christmas Day - which may have rather spoiled the turkey and sprouts. And Gentiloni wants to see the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s workings out, echoing finance minister Padoan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns. Reuters has the story: The European Central Bank should discuss with Italy the reasons behind its assessment that Banca Monte dei Paschi had a greater need for capital than previously thought, Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said on Thursday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is important that the motives for this assessment are shared in discussions in the coming months,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Gentiloni told a news conference. He added he had been surprised on December 25 to receive news that the regulator wanted Monte Paschi to plug a capital shortfall of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac8.8bn, higher than a previous estimate of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn. Pier Carlo Padoan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism of the ECB comes as Italian banking shares post fresh losses today. UBI Banca, Unicredit and Banca Popolare di Milano are all among the biggest fallers on the Stoxx Europe 600 banks index (which tracks Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stocks). Investors are edgy that the cost of recapitalising the Italian banking sector may be going up, after the ECB demand that Monte Dei Paschi raises more capital than expected. Over in Italy, finance minister Pier Carlo Padoan has lashed out at the European Central Bank over its handling of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest bank, Monte Dei Paschi (MPS). Earlier this week, the ECB told MPS that it needs to raise almost \u00e2\u201a\u00ac9bn in new capital, sharply higher than the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn which it had tried, and failed, to attract from private investors. Rome\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government is now stepping in to rescue MPC, and Padoan sounds rather unimpressed that the bill had gone up. Speaking to financial newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore, Padoan said the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new demands would leave MPS \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hyper-capitalised\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He also criticised the Frankfurt-based central bank for not explaining its thinking more clearly: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It would have been useful to receive additional information from the ECB Supervisory Board on the criteria used for such a valuation, since it has consequences for the other banks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In addition to a letter of five lines and three numbers, some explanation would have been useful; opaque moves without an explanation lead people to think that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something wrong behind it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd MPS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liquidity position has been worsening in recent months, with some savers taking money out of the lender. More here: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointingly quiet out there.... There may still be time for another Santa Rally! After a festively slow start, the FTSE 100 has roused itself after its 8am selloff, and crept back to 7106 points - last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record closing level. Trading is still pretty quiet, with many City workers still enjoying a Christmas break. Many mining stocks are still in the red today, following commodity prices down. And banks across Europe are under pressure, partly due to worries over Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking bailout. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, analyst at London Capital Group, says the markets are being cautious after commodity prices retreated in Asia overnight, meaning: A combination of profit-taking and risk-off is weighing on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 100 largest caps in London. She also suggests the US stock market could fall, if the latest trade and unemployment figures, due at 1.30pm, miss expectations. The US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s November trade balance and the weekly jobless claims are due out today. Any disappointment could cause a further disillusion regarding the US recovery and encourage a deeper correction in the US markets, given that there is room for significant pullback following the relentless, two-month rally in the US stock markets following Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appointment as the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 next president. Is London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s house price boom fizzling out? Prices in the capital only rose by an annual rate of 3.7% in in the last quarter, compared to a UK average of 4.5%, according to new figures from the Nationwide building society. This is the first time since 2008 that London prices have lagged the national average (although obviously houses are still much pricier than elsewhere). Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, expects prices to rise by 2% in 2017, although there is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a greater degree of uncertainty than usual\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The story of UK house price growth in 2016 was one of relative stability. Annual house price growth ended 2016 at 4.5%, the same as the rate recorded in 2015. There were signs that London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s significant period of outperformance may be drawing to a close.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Nationwide also reports that a typical first-time buyer in London would have to be in the top 90th percentile of earners (ie, one of the best paid 10% of the population), while in the North typical buyers are in the top 30th. Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent, says this is a serious concern: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcLondon clearly has suffered more in the price stakes than elsewhere in the country, a reverse of what we were seeing earlier in the year and for most of 2015. But for us it is the steep fall in number of transactions and market accessibility, which remains a challenge particularly for first-time buyers, rather than the ups and downs of prices which is more important. More here: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been another torrid day for Toshiba. Shares in the Japanese manufacturer tumbled by 19% in Asian trading, following losses of 20% on Wednesday and 12% on Thursday. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump was driven by continued fears that the company faces a massive charge relating to the purchase of a nuclear construction business called Stone &amp; Webster a year ago. Toshiba shocked investors earlier this week by admitting that it may have to write off several billion US dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgoodwill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, having bought Stone &amp; Webster for $229m. Analysts are concerned that the full cost is still unknown; last night, Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slashed Toshiba\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating and warned that the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s operating and financial performance could deteriorate. More here: Money is flowing out of shares and into bonds this morning. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign that investors might be taking a safety-first approach ahead of the New Year break. So bond prices are up, pushing yields (interest rates) down to their lowest levels in several weeks: Precious metals producers Randgold and Fresnillo are leading the risers in London, both up over 2%. But other mining firms are dropping back, with Rio Tinto and Glencore both down over 1%. Mining stocks had driven yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally, but are now suffering from falling commodity prices today (steel and copper prices have both dipped). The pound has bounced back from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two-months low, rising 0.25% to $1.225. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s helping to pull the FTSE 100 down (as a weak pound is good for internationally focused firms) Having closed at a record high last night, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is subsiding at the start of trading. The blue-chip index dropped by 35 points, or 0.5%, in early deals to 7074 points. Other European markets have also dipped, as the selloff on Wall Street last night casts a shadow. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets explains: US markets stumbled yesterday as investor optimism cooled and hopes faded of the Dow Jones hitting 20,000 before year-end. However volumes remain light and this doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean the 2016 election fuelled rally is done with. It may just be taking a well needed breather. The biggest fallers in London are BT and Dixons Carphone, which has gone \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcex-dividend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 this morning (you had to own the shares last night to receive the next payment to investors) Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It could be another red letter day in the City. The FTSE 100 closed at a record high last night, and traders are now wondering if the index could smash through its all-time intraday high today. The omens aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t great, though, with spreadbetters predicting small falls this morning as investors book profits before the year end. The FTSE 100 is expected to drop by 27 points at the open, having closed at 7106 last night. The alltime high is 7129 points. Later today, America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dow Jones industrial average could have another tilt at the fabled 20,000 point mark. Yesterday it fell by 111 points - only its second triple-digit decline since last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential election, suggesting the rally may be fading. On the economic front, the City will be digesting new house price figures from Nationwide, which show prices jumped by 0.8% in December (more on that shortly). At 1.30pm, we get the latest US trade figures, and the weekly unemployment numbers. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll keep an eye on Italy, for any developments in its banking bailout. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day.....",
