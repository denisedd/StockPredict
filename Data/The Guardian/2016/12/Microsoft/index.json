                "body":"<p>The digital download, ushered in to the mass market more than a decade ago by Apple\u2019s iTunes music store, is in rapid decline as people shift to streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music.</p> <p>The shift from downloads to streaming is highlighted by the biggest-selling singles of this year and 2006, when Gnarls Barkley\u2019s Crazy became the first download-only song to top the UK charts, in a sign the digital format was eclipsing CD sales. Crazy shifted nearly 661,000 units during its nine weeks at UK No 1 and went on to sell more than 1m downloads.</p> <p>This summer, Drake\u2019s One Dance matched the record achieved by Wet Wet Wet\u2019s Love Is All Around for 15 weeks at No 1 in the UK singles chart \u2013 which now combines download, physical and streaming equivalent sales. By the end of September, it had racked up 1.695m sales, including nearly 505,000 downloads and a whopping 119m streams.</p> <p>Streaming\u2019s advantages are that you can listen to any of millions of tracks whenever you like, and create playlists; paying subscribers can also download individual tracks for offline listening. The disadvantage: if you stop paying the monthly stipend of about \u00a310, the access, playlists and downloads evaporate.</p> <p>By contrast, a purchased download lasts forever \u2013 but it\u2019s the only thing you can listen to.</p> <p>The people who embraced downloading, started in 2003 by Apple\u2019s iTunes music store, were the tech-savvy types who shifted easily over to streaming. Thus the download is in rapid decline \u2013 so much so that at the end of November, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/dec/06/tables-turned-as-vinyl-records-outsell-digital-in-uk-for-first-time\">the value of sales in the old vinyl format surpassed those of digital in the UK over a week</a>, by \u00a32.4m to \u00a32.1m. At about \u00a320 an album, vinyl sold about 120,000 units, against the equivalent of 2.6m digital tracks costing 79p. </p> <p>But look more closely and the gap isn\u2019t that big: at 10 songs per album, digital downloads were only the equivalent of 260,000 albums.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8a2409c2da710a9104e04dae43861539ca455982\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a2409c2da710a9104e04dae43861539ca455982/198_0_1300_780/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Streaming songs becoming ever more popular with fans.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Streaming songs is becoming ever more popular with music fans.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So how much longer do downloads have? A few years and they\u2019re dead, says Mark Mulligan, music analyst at Midia Consulting: \u201cIt\u2019s going to die before the CD. The CD has a fairly universal player, where there\u2019s always at least one in a house. And the people who grew up buying CDs are the older music consumers \u2013 the CD will literally die out only when they do.\u201d</p> <p>Downloads outsold physical formats for the first time in the UK in 2011, when streaming services were in their infancy. But even by 2014 they were falling, from \u00a3397.3m the previous year to \u00a3338.1m, while streaming grew to \u00a3175m. That trend is continuing.</p> <p>Apple still controls the digital download market, with about 65% to 70% of the total, says Mulligan: he suggests that the death knell for downloads will come with a redesign of the iTunes app interface that de-emphasises downloads in favour of the Music subscription streaming service. \u201cLast year downloads declined by 16% in nominal terms,\u201d he says. \u201cThis year they are tracking to decline by between 25% and 30%.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/dec/2016-12-20T13:14:48/embed.html\" data-alt=\"The growth of revenue from streaming services since 2011\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/dec/2016-12-20T13:14:48/embed.html\">The growth of revenue from streaming services since 2011</a> <figcaption>The growth of revenue from streaming services since 2011</figcaption> </figure>  <p>By 2019 the business could be worth just $600m (\u00a3485m) globally, compared with a high of $3.9bn in 2012; by 2020, Apple might decide that the download business isn\u2019t worth troubling with, and make the iTunes store effectively invisible, Mulligan suggests. \u201cThe narrative of services-based music would be complete.\u201d</p> <p>Apple, however, resists the suggestion that it\u2019s about to turn off the download tap. \u201cThere\u2019s no end date \u2026 our music iTunes business is doing very well,\u201d Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s senior vice-president of internet software and services, told Billboard magazine in June, on the first anniversary of the Music subscription service. \u201cDownloads weren\u2019t growing, and certainly are not going to grow again, but it\u2019s not declining anywhere near as fast as any of them [in record labels] predicted.

                "bodyText":"The digital download, ushered in to the mass market more than a decade ago by Apple\u2019s iTunes music store, is in rapid decline as people shift to streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music. The shift from downloads to streaming is highlighted by the biggest-selling singles of this year and 2006, when Gnarls Barkley\u2019s Crazy became the first download-only song to top the UK charts, in a sign the digital format was eclipsing CD sales. Crazy shifted nearly 661,000 units during its nine weeks at UK No 1 and went on to sell more than 1m downloads. This summer, Drake\u2019s One Dance matched the record achieved by Wet Wet Wet\u2019s Love Is All Around for 15 weeks at No 1 in the UK singles chart \u2013 which now combines download, physical and streaming equivalent sales. By the end of September, it had racked up 1.695m sales, including nearly 505,000 downloads and a whopping 119m streams. Streaming\u2019s advantages are that you can listen to any of millions of tracks whenever you like, and create playlists; paying subscribers can also download individual tracks for offline listening. The disadvantage: if you stop paying the monthly stipend of about \u00a310, the access, playlists and downloads evaporate. By contrast, a purchased download lasts forever \u2013 but it\u2019s the only thing you can listen to. The people who embraced downloading, started in 2003 by Apple\u2019s iTunes music store, were the tech-savvy types who shifted easily over to streaming. Thus the download is in rapid decline \u2013 so much so that at the end of November, the value of sales in the old vinyl format surpassed those of digital in the UK over a week, by \u00a32.4m to \u00a32.1m. At about \u00a320 an album, vinyl sold about 120,000 units, against the equivalent of 2.6m digital tracks costing 79p. But look more closely and the gap isn\u2019t that big: at 10 songs per album, digital downloads were only the equivalent of 260,000 albums. So how much longer do downloads have? A few years and they\u2019re dead, says Mark Mulligan, music analyst at Midia Consulting: \u201cIt\u2019s going to die before the CD. The CD has a fairly universal player, where there\u2019s always at least one in a house. And the people who grew up buying CDs are the older music consumers \u2013 the CD will literally die out only when they do.\u201d Downloads outsold physical formats for the first time in the UK in 2011, when streaming services were in their infancy. But even by 2014 they were falling, from \u00a3397.3m the previous year to \u00a3338.1m, while streaming grew to \u00a3175m. That trend is continuing. Apple still controls the digital download market, with about 65% to 70% of the total, says Mulligan: he suggests that the death knell for downloads will come with a redesign of the iTunes app interface that de-emphasises downloads in favour of the Music subscription streaming service. \u201cLast year downloads declined by 16% in nominal terms,\u201d he says. \u201cThis year they are tracking to decline by between 25% and 30%.\u201d By 2019 the business could be worth just $600m (\u00a3485m) globally, compared with a high of $3.9bn in 2012; by 2020, Apple might decide that the download business isn\u2019t worth troubling with, and make the iTunes store effectively invisible, Mulligan suggests. \u201cThe narrative of services-based music would be complete.\u201d Apple, however, resists the suggestion that it\u2019s about to turn off the download tap. \u201cThere\u2019s no end date \u2026 our music iTunes business is doing very well,\u201d Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s senior vice-president of internet software and services, told Billboard magazine in June, on the first anniversary of the Music subscription service. \u201cDownloads weren\u2019t growing, and certainly are not going to grow again, but it\u2019s not declining anywhere near as fast as any of them [in record labels] predicted. There are a lot of people who download music and are happy with it and they\u2019re not moving towards subscriptions.\u201d Cue recently said that 60% of people using Apple Music had not bought content from the iTunes music store in the past 12 months, suggesting they were either \u201clapsed\u201d downloaders, or never were. That makes their monthly revenues all gravy for the music industry, he said. Certainly the good news for labels and musicians is that the streaming services are attracting growing numbers of subscribers, paying monthly fees of up to \u00a310: Spotify has 40 million, and Apple recently said it has passed 20 million. Smaller services such as Deezer and Tidal have a few million between them. However, the music industry, which has fretted that each shift in music format since 1995, from MP3 piracy to downloads to streaming, is driving down revenues, is now so worried about the effect of YouTube on streaming revenues that the US labels tried to push streaming payments on to the agenda of Donald Trump\u2019s \u201ctech summit\u201d in mid-December, when representatives of Apple, Google, Microsoft and others met the US president-elect. What the RIAA, which represents US labels, was complaining about is known in the industry as the \u201cvalue gap\u201d \u2013 the difference in effective per-play payments between audio services such as Spotify, and YouTube. YouTube, though, remains the world\u2019s biggest venue for music streaming, with millions of videos that can be combined into playlists.
