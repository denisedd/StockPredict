At the test store near Amazon\u2019s HQ in Seattle, an app tracks customers as they walk about, recording the items they pick up and take away. The store is currently only available to company staff, but will open to shoppers from next year. The cost of purchases will be automatically billed to their account.</p> <p>The company has registered the Amazon Go trademark in the UK for an extensive list of potential uses, from technology, telecommunications and retail services to food and drink services and even pet food.</p> <p>The retailer claims the Amazon Go store is \u201cthe world\u2019s most advanced shopping technology\u201d but other businesses are also trialling shop-assistant-free concepts. The Na\u0308raffa\u0308r convenience store based in an isolated village in Sweden, for example, relies on a mobile app which lets residents access the store, scan their shopping and then pay via a monthly invoice. They\u2019re part of a wave of new gadgetry which could dramatically change the way we shop:</p> <h2><strong>Robot assistants</strong></h2> <p>Some may argue that many stores have these already, but retailers are moving on, with a view to replacing staff with sophisticated software.</p> <p>The American DIY chain Lowe\u2019s is testing LoweBot, a customer service robot that speaks several languages, helps shoppers find items and provides information on products. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/08/robot-shop-assistant\">First trialled as OSHbot two years ago</a>, it is currently being tested in 11 Lowe\u2019s stores.</p> <p>US electricals retailer Best Buy has Chloe, a robot that is a glorified grabber arm for CDs and DVDs, while Aldebaran Robotics, part of the Japanese telecoms firm Softbank, has created Pepper, a humanoid robot which has been deployed in some Nescaf\u00e9 stores in Japan.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/20/robocop-robot-mall-security-guard-palo-alto-california\">Some US shopping centres are even adopting robotic security guards</a> \u2013 a cross between a CCTV camera and a Dalek that can detect people who may be loitering in the wrong place and read car number plates in car parks. But it\u2019s not all been straightforward: a robot guarding a shopping centre in California recently ran over a toddler after its navigational scanning systems failed to detect the small boy.</p> <h2><strong>A virtual you</strong></h2> <p>For many shoppers, buying clothes online is a very hit-and-miss affair. Sizes vary between outlets and getting the right fit means many clothing items are returned \u2013 which is bad for both the shopper and the shopkeeper. That could change thanks to new software that creates an accurate 3D model of the shopper, meaning it is possible to \u201ctry on\u201d clothes.</p> <p>Cambridge based startup Metail, which has raised $20m to date and is backed by Hong Kong clothing giant Tal, is setting the pace. The company\u2019s technology can be plugged into retailers\u2019 websites so customers can create what it calls \u201cMe Models\u201d as well as 3D images of the products on sale. Shoppers can then find out if a pair of tight jeans will give them a muffin top.

                "bodyText":"Amazon may be set to bring its hi-tech till-free stores to the UK after registering the Amazon Go brand name in the UK last week. At the test store near Amazon\u2019s HQ in Seattle, an app tracks customers as they walk about, recording the items they pick up and take away. The store is currently only available to company staff, but will open to shoppers from next year. The cost of purchases will be automatically billed to their account. The company has registered the Amazon Go trademark in the UK for an extensive list of potential uses, from technology, telecommunications and retail services to food and drink services and even pet food. The retailer claims the Amazon Go store is \u201cthe world\u2019s most advanced shopping technology\u201d but other businesses are also trialling shop-assistant-free concepts. The Na\u0308raffa\u0308r convenience store based in an isolated village in Sweden, for example, relies on a mobile app which lets residents access the store, scan their shopping and then pay via a monthly invoice. They\u2019re part of a wave of new gadgetry which could dramatically change the way we shop: Robot assistants Some may argue that many stores have these already, but retailers are moving on, with a view to replacing staff with sophisticated software. The American DIY chain Lowe\u2019s is testing LoweBot, a customer service robot that speaks several languages, helps shoppers find items and provides information on products. First trialled as OSHbot two years ago, it is currently being tested in 11 Lowe\u2019s stores. US electricals retailer Best Buy has Chloe, a robot that is a glorified grabber arm for CDs and DVDs, while Aldebaran Robotics, part of the Japanese telecoms firm Softbank, has created Pepper, a humanoid robot which has been deployed in some Nescaf\u00e9 stores in Japan. Some US shopping centres are even adopting robotic security guards \u2013 a cross between a CCTV camera and a Dalek that can detect people who may be loitering in the wrong place and read car number plates in car parks. But it\u2019s not all been straightforward: a robot guarding a shopping centre in California recently ran over a toddler after its navigational scanning systems failed to detect the small boy. A virtual you For many shoppers, buying clothes online is a very hit-and-miss affair. Sizes vary between outlets and getting the right fit means many clothing items are returned \u2013 which is bad for both the shopper and the shopkeeper. That could change thanks to new software that creates an accurate 3D model of the shopper, meaning it is possible to \u201ctry on\u201d clothes. Cambridge based startup Metail, which has raised $20m to date and is backed by Hong Kong clothing giant Tal, is setting the pace. The company\u2019s technology can be plugged into retailers\u2019 websites so customers can create what it calls \u201cMe Models\u201d as well as 3D images of the products on sale. Shoppers can then find out if a pair of tight jeans will give them a muffin top. Retailers will also be able to use customer data to suggest outfits, creating a \u201cNetflix style\u201d shopping experience. Digital butlers Doing the shopping may soon require nothing other than a shiny little box. Nearly all the major tech firms, including Amazon, Google, Apple and Facebook, are developing digital home assistants that respond to voice commands.

Drone deliveries As retail sales increasingly transfer from the high street to the internet, one of the biggest problems for retailers is making deliveries. In busy cities where traffic congestion is a problem, one solution already being tested is using drones. In the summer, Amazon started working with the UK government to test the viability of delivering small parcels \u2013 which make up 90% of Amazon\u2019s sales \u2013 by drone. In the US, Mercedes-Benz is collaborating with drone startup Matternet on the \u201cVision Van\u201d, where a vehicle\u2019s roof doubles as a launch pad for drones capable of sorties of up to 12 miles.

Speaking to Damien Gayle he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s important to understand that it would be quite a crass oversimplification of the dispute to boil it down to one issue. </p> <p>It\u2019s multifaceted, but safety is certainly one of the key factors and that\u2019s in terms of operational safety of the railway. At the moment we have trains that are dispatched by the guard or conductor and the guard is responsible for monitoring the safe dispatch of those trains.</p> <p>The guard will ensure it is safe to dispatch those trains and will tell the driver it\u2019s safe to do so.</p> <p>What they are looking to do under driver-only operation is to transfer those duties to the driver so the driver would have full responsibility for dispatching the train. How that would work is that there are bodyside cameras that view down the side of the train and the driver would have to view down a set of monitors to check all the doors.</p> <p>There are issues relating to that because, particularly with very long formations of coaches, effectively 24 sets of doors, for the driver to do that in a short period of time. The images produced by the bodyside cameras are really unreliable, particularly in poor lighting, whether that be at night or just dusk or when it\u2019s overcast, particularly in the rain \u2013 even light drizzle has caused some of the images to be really poor. That\u2019s quite clearly an unsafe method of operation. </p> <p>The other thing of course, in terms of safety, is that the guard performs other safety duties, for example at a time when a driver might become incapacitated, particularly looking at worst case scenarios like in a train crash.</p> <p>The reality of a train crash is that the driver is often the first casualty; who is in place to ensure that safety duties are being conducted?</p> <p>That\u2019s the safety angle, but there is also a customer service issue. If you think about access for the disabled, there might be a Good Samaritan to help someone in a wheelchair on board, but not necessarily. What Southern have said is that they expect people with a disability to give them advance notice so there can be someone at the station. I think they have said 48 hours notice.

On many occasions I have spent the morning on the way to work far too close to many of the other commuters who are desperate to get to work and not be late in order to keep their job. This brings me into the southern railway strike which is happening in London today. Many people are unhappy with their jobs however most of us still get up in the morning and make our way to work in order to make a living and ensure that we have food to put on the table for our families and ourselves. Multitudes of people are in desperate need of a job and I am sure that if the people on the trains are unhappy then they can leave their jobs and someone else will take their place. I am a strong believer that if you are unhappy you need to make a change, I do however believe that we should appreciate what we have and been thoughtful to others in the world as well who are also trying to make a living. London transport needs to run smoother, but it is with the help of everyone as a team which can make this happen. The drivers going against the people whose money goes into the system and pays their wages is not the way to go about it.  As seen in the photo above people are even standing on the top deck? Therefore everyone&#39;s safety has also been compromised due to this strike. Change needs to happen but we needn&#39;t to work together in order to make it successful for us all. It is as if people in this world have forgotten how to talk to each other.</p> </div>   </figcaption>  </div> <footer class=\"element-witness--footer\"> <p class=\"element-witness--source\">Sent via <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/\" class=\"element-witness--brand\" itemprop=\"provider\">GuardianWitness</a></p> <div class=\"element-witness--metadata\"> <p class=\"element-witness--author\" itemprop=\"author\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\">  By  <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/Piinkbezzi\" class=\"element-witness--author-name\" itemprop=\"name\">Piinkbezzi</a> </p> <p class=\"element-witness--date\"> <time itemprop=\"dateCreated\" datetime=\"2016-12-13T09:55:38Z\">13 December 2016, 9:55</time> </p> </div> </footer>  </figure>  <p>Despite the crush, reader GydaGwen, still supports the strikes</p>  <figure class=\"element element-witness element-witness-text\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/WebPageElement\" data-canonical-url=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/584fa5dae4b0e02f2b16b929/5017468\"> <div class=\"element-witness--main\">    <h3 class=\"element-witness--title\" itemprop=\"name\"><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/584fa5dae4b0e02f2b16b929/5017468\" itemprop=\"url\">Inconvenienced but supportive</a></h3>  <div itemprop=\"text\"> <p>I managed to get a very busy Thameslink to work this morning but others weren&#39;t so lucky.

My daughter was super excited about the trip and having her mum with her, and there was flood of tears this morning at finding out the trip was cancelled for today.\u201d </p> <p>One commuter who usually uses Southern Rail to get from Sydenham in south-east London to King\u2019s Cross left the house more than two hours early to avoid overcrowding on the alternative Overground service. </p> <p>Carmen Butterworth left at 5.45am instead of 8am to avoid being late for work. </p> <p>Butterworth, 33, a personal assistant, told the Press Association: \u201cI knew that everyone would be forced to use the already overcrowded Overground and it would probably be a struggle to even board and I can\u2019t be late to work. </p> <p>\u201cThe blame doesn\u2019t just fall with Southern. However I do not think much of how they have handled the strike \u2013 telling half a million people not to attempt to travel on a work day isn\u2019t practical.\u201d </p> <p>People\u2019s tweets caused #southernstrike and #southernrail to trend on Twitter. </p> <p>Natasha Gourlay-Harris took to Twitter to call on Southern to refund her pre-paid 30 Christmas work lunch, which she feared she would miss because of the strike. </p> <p>Gourlay-Harris, 45, travels from Cheam, near Sutton, to London Victoria via Hackbridge and was stuck on a bus \u201cin appalling traffic\u201d for half an hour before finding the main entrance to Sutton station had been closed - with commuters being funnelled through a smaller second entrance. </p> <p>The personal assistant said: \u201cWhen will the Government step in?! I pay over 2,000 a year for a really awful service and then I read the company that owns Southern are taking in 90+ million in profits? It\u2019s criminal. And criminal that these profits are not going back into the system that makes all this money.\u201d</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-12-13T13:27:08.668Z\">at 1.27pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-584fc69fe4b025760cee4518\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-13T10:01:48.217Z\">10.01am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Some car drivers have been tooting support for striking train drivers at the Selhurst depot picket in south London, PA\u2019s Jemma Crew reports.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jemmacrew/status/808606824970784768\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Passing cars hoot in support of drivers on the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/southernstrike?src=hash\">#southernstrike</a> picket line outside Selhurst depot <a href=\"https://t.co/X23fOvG5jv\">pic.twitter.com/X23fOvG5jv</a></p>&mdash; Jemma Crew (@jemmacrew) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jemmacrew/status/808606824970784768\">December 13, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-12-13T10:13:26.444Z\">at 10.13am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-584fc381e4b077e984850648\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-13T09:57:22.153Z\">9.57am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, has rejected London mayor <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/sadiq-khan-for-commuters-sake-the-government-must-let-us-run-the-railways-a3414416.html\">Sadiq Khan\u2019s proposal</a> to put Transport for London in charge of the suburban rail services currently run by Southern and other operators.</p> <p>In a letter to MPs, Grayling said: \u201cTransport for London has no experience of running a mainline railway like this.\u201d</p> <p>He also claimed the rail unions were being unreasonable.

                "bodyText":"Here\u2019s a summary of what\u2019s happened so far: Tens of thousands of commuters have faced travel chaos on the Southern rail network in an escalating dispute over who closes train doors. A strike by train drivers has brought Southern rail services to a complete halt after the court of appeal rejected a second attempt by the rail company to block the action. Transport secretary Chris Grayling dismissed the strike as \u201cfutile\u201d and threatened to introduce measures to restrict strikes on the rail network. He said: \u201cWe are thinking very carefully about how we take things forward. I\u2019m not going to rule anything in or anything out today.\u201d The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, urged Grayling to return to talks with the unions. \u201cRather than threaten strike bans, he should do his job and get on with negotiations,\u201d he said. All of Southern\u2019s 2,242 weekday services were cancelled, causing the worst disruption on the network for more than 20 years. Commuters were urged not to travel. Mick Whelan, general secretary of the train drivers\u2019 union Aslef, said the union was prepared to negotiate to end the dispute and accused Grayling of \u201cplaying games\u201d behind the scenes. \u201cI would hope that we were getting round a table very very soon,\u201d he said. Judges upheld last week\u2019s ruling by the high court to dismiss claims by Southern\u2019s owner, Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), that industrial action called by the train drivers\u2019 union, Aslef, infringed rights under European law. GTR had already urged passengers not to travel on Tuesday, irrespective of the court\u2019s decision, warning that it would not be able to run a service. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said passengers had been abandoned by the government and called on ministers to allow Transport for London to take control of Souther Rail. Grayling dismissed the suggestion as \u201cnonsense\u201d. The RMT general secretary, Mick Cash, rejected government claims that the strike is political. He said: \u201cThis morning Chris Grayling claimed again that the action on Southern is political \u2013 it isn\u2019t, it\u2019s about safe train operation for both passengers and staff alike.\u201d Commuters are planning a demonstration outside the Department for Transport on Thursday. They are demanding that Grayling resign if he can\u2019t end the strike. We\u2019re going to pause the blog for now but we\u2019ll return to it if there are major developments. And there\u2019ll be more soon on Southern section. Southern is topping one performance table, writes Gwyn Topham. The website Sorry for the Inconvenience, tracks the number of apologies issued by train companies on social media to passengers. Southern has apologised over 38,000 times this year, well ahead of nearest rival Great Western Railway. Industrial action could threaten that though: with no services to apologise for during the strike, it has said sorry only 36 times by 2pm \u2013 a third of the usual daily total. A cartoon in the Times portrays the dispute as trench warfare between commuters and the rail unions. When, where and why is the Southern rail strike taking place? Our transport correspondent, Gwyn Topham, has all the answers. Aslef accuses Grayling of \u2018playing games\u2019 Mick Whelan, general secretary of the train drivers\u2019 union Aslef, said the union was prepared to negotiate to end the dispute and accused Chris Grayling of \u201cplaying games\u201d behind the scenes. \u201cWe offered to go to talks,\u201d he told Sky News. Whelan added: \u201cI would hope that we were getting round a table very very soon. We hope people listen to us, come talk to us and find a real way through this.\u201d Asked if he had confidence in the transport secretary, Whelan said: \u201cHe has quoted items today that I wasn\u2019t even aware he was involved in. I had no idea that he was the guiding hand behind the scenes over the offer on Sunday that came from the company, in a private and confidential conversation, which miraculously appeared on the DfT website yesterday. So I do wonder who in all of this is playing games.\u201d Asked about Grayling\u2019s claims that he had threatened the government with 10 years of industrial action, Whelan said: \u201cNormally meetings between ministers and ourselves are [subject to] Chatham House rules. But I\u2019m quite happy to give my version of events. I relayed our concerns over safety. He was quite intransigent about our concerns. I then quite openly said then we will have years of problems going ahead if that is going to be the case. I never threatened him. It was an open statement about the likelihood of where we would be industrially if that was the position that was maintained.\u201d Whelan added: \u201cThis isn\u2019t about a victory over the government. This is about a long-held policy for over 15 years, where our members have become increasingly concerned about the ability to safely operate these trains. We are not doing it for gain. We are doing it for safety reasons. We want a safer railway.\u201d The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, has rejected Chris Grayling\u2019s threat to restrict future strike action. He urged the transport secretary to find a negotiated solution. But Tory MP Paul Scully, who represents many Southern commuters in his Sutton, Cheam and Worcester Park constituency, blamed unions for refusing to negotiate without preconditions. In a statement on the strike he said: Southern and the unions need to remember the commuters they represent rather than point-scoring. I am deeply disappointed that the unions are refusing to come to talks even without any preconditions. This is all about who presses a button to close the doors. Driver-only operated trains operate on over a third of the rail network already, all trains that go through Sutton are driver-only operated and Thameslink drivers are at work today, represented by the same union, and they are driving driver-only operated trains. This makes this strike look vindictive rather than about a credible safety concern. I continue to call for these strikes to be called off. People are losing or quitting their jobs because of how appalling the train service is \u2013 this cannot be allowed to continue. The strike and wider industrial action needs to end now so we can go back to tackling the underlying issues that have dogged this network for years. Sadiq Khan has more on his call for responsibility for London rail services to be handed to Transport for London. Setting out a business case for the move the mayor\u2019s office said: TfL has a proven track record of making rail services better. Devolving this responsibility to TfL would allow us to work towards a fully integrated transport service, structured fares and transparent management. Londoners \u2013 regardless of age, income or background \u2013 rely on train services to be fast, frequent and affordable every day. Services on the rail network should meet the same high standards achieved by the rest of London\u2019s transport network. Currently this is not the case across the suburban rail network. By taking advantage of TfL\u2019s proven track record of making rail services better, there is an opportunity to provide a truly integrated, reliable and affordable rail network. Rail devolution would also lead to economic benefits within communities. The biggest impact would be in south London, where house building rates are less than half the rest of London, because of poorer transport connections. A single mother who faces travelling more than six hours to get to and from work each day during the strike has set out her plight in a letter to her MP. PA reports: Jenny Lehane was forced to get her six-year-old son Matthew out of bed at 5.30am on Tuesday - an hour and a half early - so she could drop him at a friend\u2019s house and travel from Coulsdon, Croydon, to Camden in north London. The 37-year-old catering manager\u2019s usual commute is 1hr 20min \u2013 taking a Southern service from Coulsdon South to London Bridge before catching the Jubilee line to West Hampstead. But on Tuesday she says it took 3hr 30min. She had to get a bus before squashing on to an \u201cabsolutely packed\u201d tram after not being able to squeeze on to two earlier ones, before taking the Jubilee line from Wimbledon to West Brompton. In an emotional email to Chris Philp, MP for Croydon South, Lehane wrote: \u201cI am writing this on a bus with tears streaming down my face at the utter failure of our MPs and government to do anything to stop this completely intolerable failure by Southern to run the service that my fares and taxes are paying for. \u201cIt depresses me that the government, voted for by us, the hardworking, tax-paying commuters, will do nothing to help us.\u201d Lehane told the Press Association: \u201cWhen I saw the sign advising people not to travel I got so cross. People have to work, businesses have to run. We can\u2019t all march to their tune. \u201cI have worked hard for the same company for 15 years. I should be able to get a train and live my life without this stress.\u201d People who gave up trying to get into the office have been telling us what it\u2019s like to work from home, writes Rachel Obordo. Rebecca, 24, from East Grinsted, normally commutes daily on Southern rail. She said: I\u2019ve had to stay at home today because I can\u2019t face the stress and hassle, not to mention the additional cost and time loss, of finding an alternative route to my office in London. Not that a non-strike day is much better \u2013 yesterday my journey home took over three hours, with the majority of delays and cancellations attributed to ongoing industrial action. Unfortunately my workload doesn\u2019t disappear just because I can\u2019t be in the office. This is far from ideal in the run-up to Christmas. The stress and anxiety this dispute is causing passengers is shameful. I feel for tourists visiting the UK who are met with this turmoil and are unprepared to make alternative arrangements, and for passengers with disabilities, or those more vulnerable, who have to put up with chaos and dangerous conditions on a daily basis. Luckily for Lee, an understanding employer means working from home is not really an issue. But, for Fiona and her partner, working from home has been tricky. Under Southern plans drivers will be solely responsible for the safety of up to 1,500 people, according to Aslef\u2019s Graham Morris. Speaking to Damien Gayle he said that level of responsibility as well as driving the train is \u201cunacceptable\u201d. He added: \u201cThis is about them saving money.\u201d Southern has confirmed that none of its trains are operating today because of the strike. Passengers are advised not to travel, it says. This map shows the lines hit: Google Trends has a list of the top five Southern rail related queries on its search engine. Mark Colombini, Aslef executive committee member for south London and the south-east, has been outlining the safety concerns behind the strike. Speaking to Damien Gayle he said: It\u2019s important to understand that it would be quite a crass oversimplification of the dispute to boil it down to one issue. It\u2019s multifaceted, but safety is certainly one of the key factors and that\u2019s in terms of operational safety of the railway. At the moment we have trains that are dispatched by the guard or conductor and the guard is responsible for monitoring the safe dispatch of those trains. The guard will ensure it is safe to dispatch those trains and will tell the driver it\u2019s safe to do so. What they are looking to do under driver-only operation is to transfer those duties to the driver so the driver would have full responsibility for dispatching the train. How that would work is that there are bodyside cameras that view down the side of the train and the driver would have to view down a set of monitors to check all the doors. There are issues relating to that because, particularly with very long formations of coaches, effectively 24 sets of doors, for the driver to do that in a short period of time. The images produced by the bodyside cameras are really unreliable, particularly in poor lighting, whether that be at night or just dusk or when it\u2019s overcast, particularly in the rain \u2013 even light drizzle has caused some of the images to be really poor. That\u2019s quite clearly an unsafe method of operation. The other thing of course, in terms of safety, is that the guard performs other safety duties, for example at a time when a driver might become incapacitated, particularly looking at worst case scenarios like in a train crash. The reality of a train crash is that the driver is often the first casualty; who is in place to ensure that safety duties are being conducted? That\u2019s the safety angle, but there is also a customer service issue. If you think about access for the disabled, there might be a Good Samaritan to help someone in a wheelchair on board, but not necessarily. What Southern have said is that they expect people with a disability to give them advance notice so there can be someone at the station. I think they have said 48 hours notice. That\u2019s frankly discrimination. I would suggest that\u2019s contrary to the Disability Discrimination Act. Here\u2019s a summary of what\u2019s happened so far: A strike by train drivers has brought Southern rail services to a complete halt after the court of appeal rejected a second attempt by the company to block the action. All of Southern\u2019s 2,242 weekday services have been cancelled, causing the worst disruption for more than 20 years. Judges upheld last week\u2019s ruling by the high court to dismiss claims by Southern\u2019s owner, Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), that industrial action called by the train drivers\u2019 union, Aslef, infringed rights under European law. GTR had already urged passengers not to travel on Tuesday, irrespective of the court\u2019s decision, warning that it would not be able to run a service. Transport secretary Chris Grayling dismissed the strike as \u201cfutile\u201d and threatened to introduce measures to restrict strikes on the rail network. He said: \u201cWe are thinking very carefully about how we take things forward. I\u2019m not going to rule anything in or anything out today.\u201d The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said passengers had been abandoned by the government and called on ministers to allow Transport for London to take control of Souther rail. Grayling dismissed the suggestion as \u201cnonsense\u201d. The RMT general secretary, Mick Cash, rejected government claims that the strike is political. He said: \u201cThis morning Chris Grayling claimed again that the action on Southern is political \u2013 it isn\u2019t, it\u2019s about safe train operation for both passengers and staff alike.\u201d Commuters are planning a demonstration outside the Department for Transport on Thursday. They are demanding that Grayling resign if he can\u2019t end the strike. Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said it was an insult to passengers to blame Southern\u2019s failures on trade unions rather than the incompetence of management and government ministers. He said: \u201cThe truth is that ministers are defending this failed franchise as a point of political pride when they should be sticking up for taxpayers and commuters.\u201d Tory MP Nick Herbert, who represents many Southern commuters as MP for Arundel and South Downs, has backed measures to end strikes on the rail network. Speaking to BBC News he said: \u201cWe should look at what more can be done to prevent essential public services being disrupted in this way. It is deeply unfair on the travelling public and something really has got to be done about it.\u201d When it was pointed out that banning strikes would flout human rights laws, Herbert said: There are a range of things that could be looked at. For instance it might be possible to have some kind of \u2018no strike\u2019 agreement in return for compensation, or some kind of arrangement for binding arbitration on pay claims. There are options and they should be looked at, because what he have here is a few hundred militant staff effectively bringing a key public service to a standstill on a completely unreasonable demand. The former home office minister added: \u201cTheir claim is bogus, it is a political campaign. That\u2019s why the government does need to look at the options for dealing with it.\u201d The Association of British Commuters has set out its demands ahead of Thursday\u2019s protest outside the Department for Transport. It has three main demands: Urgent and transparent intervention into the industrial dispute. A fully independent public inquiry into the collapse of Southern rail. Transparency from the government in the form of answers to our crowdsourced questions. If these can\u2019t be met it is calling on Grayling to resign. It says: We demand that the secretary of state for transport not only intervenes but does so openly and transparently. Our message to the government is this: we are not only commuters, we are citizens for whom his department is responsible and we have urgent questions that need answering. The British public should know that southern commuters have experienced a year-long nightmare with the collapse of Southern rail. We have desperately called for government action and have been repeatedly ignored; even while many of us have lost our jobs, or relocated our homes because of it. Our thousands-strong network of commuters has been at the centre of this catastrophe throughout; and with the complete lack of government action on the matter, many have put all their efforts into investigating the true story behind the crisis. What is rotten in Southern rail started long before the current industrial action, which now takes place on top of a broken infrastructure, chronic understaffing and a company whose relations with the public have irretrievably broken [down]. Its relationship with the Department for Transport is that of a subcontractor, not a typical franchise; therefore, it is firmly within their remit to step in, and their urgent responsibility. We\u2019ve been hearing from commuters who have been forced to find alternative ways of getting into work, writes Rachel Obordo. Richard, from Tattenham Corner, had to spend extra time and money to get into central London. Another GuardianWitness contributor shares a picture of an overcrowded train. Despite the crush, reader GydaGwen, still supports the strikes The RMT\u2019s Steve Hedley insists the strike is about removing the \u201csafety critical\u201d role of guards on trains. Speaking to Damien Gayle at London Bridge he said hoped the government would allow Govia, which operates the Southern rail franchise, to negotiate in good faith. \u201cAs you can see there is a total shutdown today of the entire network,\u201d he said. The strike continues to divide politicians along party lines. Labour MP Rob Flello reacted with anger after Grayling suggested the government was considering changing union law to ban strikes on the rail network. Former Tory MP and children\u2019s minister Tim Loughton pointed out Labour\u2019s financial ties to the unions involved in the dispute. The SNP\u2019s Gavin Newlands calls for a more geographical perspective. Chris Grayling has dismissed Sadiq Khan\u2019s call to switch control of Southern to Transport for London as \u201csimply nonsense\u201d. Speaking to LBC he said: \u201cWhat the Mayor is doing is promising one thing to people inside London and another thing to people outside. \u201cThe Mayor\u2019s just said we\u2019ll provide faster more frequent services. Well the reality is if you get a suburban train in the morning, you know that these these tracks are jammed full. The challenge is getting any space for any more trains. He\u2019s also promised people outside London that he won\u2019t actually introduce more trains because of the fears outside London that actually there might be fewer services from the coast for example. So I don\u2019t buy this. \u201cHe\u2019s been Mayor for four and a half months, he\u2019s got some significant problems with Transport for London having big financial difficulties, the Piccadilly Line is in a state of chaos, he\u2019s running out of money for projects already in the pipeline and he\u2019s making grand promises about things like bridges over the Thames he hasn\u2019t got the money to build. \u201cSo I\u2019m afraid people should take what the Mayyor says with a pinch of salt. \u201cLet\u2019s concentrate this week on trying to get a resolution to the Southern rail dispute, which is all about services in Cambridge to Brighton not services that are just within London.\u201d Damien Gayle has been talking to pickets outside London Bridge station. One driver, who preferred not to be named, said the issue they were striking over was safety. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a 12 carriage train coming up from Brighton, it could have a thousand people onboard.\u201d One driver without a guard was not able to ensure the safety of so many passengers, he added. The Press Association has stories of commuter woe: A man who will miss telling his two young children a bedtime story because of the Southern strike is just one of the thousands of angry commuters to vent their frustrations. Jim Boyden, a management consultant, from Shoreham, West Sussex, said he will be forced to stay in a London hotel until Thursday because of the lack of trains between his home and Victoria. The 38-year-old shared a photo of his one-year-old son Zac and wrote an emotional tweet to Southern: \u201cBecause of your strike, I am unable to travel home until Thursday and read him and his sister a story. Because of your strike, we will not discover what animal is hiding in his favourite book tonight, or tomorrow night. \u201cBecause of your strike, he will be unable to take me by the hand and show me his favourite toy, which is ironically, a choo choo train. \u201cBecause of your strike, I will miss his smile. \u201cYou can refund me my Season Ticket. You can refund me my hotel. I can even make up time at work, but how \u2013 how \u2013 are you going to give me back the things money can\u2019t buy? \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, sort it out.\u201d Another parent who took to the social media site to complain was a mother whose six-year-old daughter was left in tears after a school trip to the British Museum was called off at the last minute due to the train chaos - which included problems on TfL\u2019s Victoria Underground line. Monica Corduff-Gonzalez, 44, from Forest Hill, south-east London, said: \u201cWith the anticipated extra pressure on the Overground created by there being no Southern service, and severe delays at Highbury and Islington, the school decided to postpone the trip to the new year. \u201cI was going to be going on the trip with my daughter and my husband was taking the day off work to look after my toddler. My daughter was super excited about the trip and having her mum with her, and there was flood of tears this morning at finding out the trip was cancelled for today.\u201d One commuter who usually uses Southern Rail to get from Sydenham in south-east London to King\u2019s Cross left the house more than two hours early to avoid overcrowding on the alternative Overground service. Carmen Butterworth left at 5.45am instead of 8am to avoid being late for work. Butterworth, 33, a personal assistant, told the Press Association: \u201cI knew that everyone would be forced to use the already overcrowded Overground and it would probably be a struggle to even board and I can\u2019t be late to work. \u201cThe blame doesn\u2019t just fall with Southern. However I do not think much of how they have handled the strike \u2013 telling half a million people not to attempt to travel on a work day isn\u2019t practical.\u201d People\u2019s tweets caused #southernstrike and #southernrail to trend on Twitter. Natasha Gourlay-Harris took to Twitter to call on Southern to refund her pre-paid 30 Christmas work lunch, which she feared she would miss because of the strike. Gourlay-Harris, 45, travels from Cheam, near Sutton, to London Victoria via Hackbridge and was stuck on a bus \u201cin appalling traffic\u201d for half an hour before finding the main entrance to Sutton station had been closed - with commuters being funnelled through a smaller second entrance. The personal assistant said: \u201cWhen will the Government step in?! I pay over 2,000 a year for a really awful service and then I read the company that owns Southern are taking in 90+ million in profits? It\u2019s criminal. And criminal that these profits are not going back into the system that makes all this money.\u201d Some car drivers have been tooting support for striking train drivers at the Selhurst depot picket in south London, PA\u2019s Jemma Crew reports. The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, has rejected London mayor Sadiq Khan\u2019s proposal to put Transport for London in charge of the suburban rail services currently run by Southern and other operators. In a letter to MPs, Grayling said: \u201cTransport for London has no experience of running a mainline railway like this.\u201d He also claimed the rail unions were being unreasonable. The letter says: \u201cI wish we were dealing with reasonable people on the union side. For all the shortcomings of the train operator \u2013 and there have been many \u2013 and the failures of the infrastructure \u2013 also many \u2013 it is difficult to resolve any of the other problems on this network while the union leadership seem hell bent on fermenting this dispute.\u201d At London Bridge station, a key Southern rail terminus, every platform was marked with a large red X, writes Damien Gayle. A few passengers were waiting, scratching their heads. Benan Yolcu, 21, a law and criminology student at Brighton University, said the strike had affected her \u201chorribly\u201d. \u201cI have an exam today and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to make it on time.\u201d She said she knew a strike was coming, but added: \u201cI thought it was not going to be today, and when I checked online [on a rail timetable app] it said that everything was running normally.\u201d She held up her phone to prove her point. Yolcu said she had no idea why the train drivers had gone on strike. Still, she had some sympathy for them. \u201cI understand that they might have their reasons,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, [Brighton trains] every hour? Come on. People have things to do. I understand people have their situations, but other people have jobs.\u201d Departure boards at London Victoria and London Bridge make grim reading. Damien Gayle at London Bridge says there are very angry passengers on the concourse. His snap of the departure board explains why. If you\u2019ve been affected by the strike we\u2019d like to hear from you. Are you using alternative means to get into work or are you staying at home? If you won\u2019t be making it into the office, what are you doing instead? You can share your experiences, photos and videos with us by clicking on the blue \u2018Contribute\u2019 button on the blog. Opposition politicians continue to blame the government for the strike. The Green party joint leader, Caroline Lucas, urged ministers to do more to resolve the dispute. Labour\u2019s former shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher says the strike highlights systemic problems with the rail network. Shadow Welsh secretary, Jo Stevens, is also backing the strike. But the Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who had the party whip withdrawn after a sexting scandal, is sceptical about the strike. The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, has been giving a series of broadcast interviews expressing his view that the strike is \u201cfutile\u201d. His department has also posted a defiant video address in which Grayling says: \u201cWe are not prepared to end the modernisation of the railways.\u201d He said he didn\u2019t understand why the unions were so resistant to modern technology. Julian Glover, the former special adviser at the Department for Transport, insists the strike is about union pride and their control of the railways rather than safety as the unions claim. Commuters at Balham station are being forced to take taxis to work, writes Damien Gayle. Andrea Dunn, 24, and Gemma, who declined to give her surname, 32, were waiting outside Balham station to share an Uber taxi. \u201cWe\u2019re total strangers waiting to share an Uber now,\u201d Gemma said. Dunn, who works at Sky, said she had no idea what the strike action was about. But Gemma, who said she would miss a client meeting as a result of the strike, had stronger opinions. \u201cI\u2019m blaming the RMT,\u201d she said. \u201cI think they are too aggressive, too frequent.\u201d Asked what she knew about the reasons for the strike, Gemma said: \u201cTrain guards and locking doors, I think. Not having enough train guards; they want to take train guards away so there\u2019s no one to lock doors in person.\u201d Gemma\u2019s assessment of the strike was even shared by one Southern rail worker directing passengers to alternative routes. \u201cThese drivers are never happy, but they earn \u00a355k,\u201d the worker said. \u201cThey are making these problems up. I saw my manager \u2026 normally the RMT and him, they should be different things, right? But they go out for drinks together. It\u2019s all planned, we know that. \u201cThey are going to have a very nice Christmas.\u201d In his video message, the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, urged the government to give Transport for London control of commuter lines such as Southern, Southeastern and South West. Addressing commuters, he said: \u201cYou pay too much for delays, cancellations and disruption. You deserve a better service. Southern commuters have been abandoned by the government. You\u2019ve had months of chaos. But it doesn\u2019t have to be like this.\u201d The mayor urged commuters to write to the transport secretary and the prime minister for TfL to have control \u2013 promising a \u201cmore frequent and more reliable\u201d service \u201cwith fewer strikes\u201d and \u201cmore affordable fares\u201d. \u201cThis is far more important than party politics. Together we can secure the decent and affordable commute that you deserve.\u201d Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Grayling said: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things after this is over we are going to have to take a careful look at. We can\u2019t leave our railways exposed. \u201cThere are issues on this line that go beyond just the issue of these strikes.\u201d Asked what he would do to stop future strikes, Grayling said: \u201cWe are thinking very carefully about how we take things forward. I\u2019m not going to rule anything in or anything out today. \u201cThere is a lot to think about when this strike is over. The important thing now is to get the services running again.\u201d Chris Grayling says the government will look \u201cvery carefully\u201d at possible changes to strike rules on railways to prevent the kind of action taking place today. Paul Plummer, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, claimed rail companies were trying to modernise the way they worked to give customers better services. \u201cHundreds of thousands of passengers are suffering needless disruption because of these strikes \u2013 despite independent expert evidence that safety isn\u2019t at risk. Trains where drivers close the doors are safe. \u201cThe truth is that these strikes are not about safety, not about jobs and not about customer service.\u201d Mick Whelan, general secretary of the train drivers union Aslef, has accused Grayling of being \u201cless than honest on all counts\u201d, PA reports. He also referred to a speech made at a public meeting in Croydon earlier this year by a DfT official. \u201cEarlier this year Peter Wilkinson, the \u00a3265,000-a-year director of rail passenger services, said on a public platform that the aim of the DfT is to force train drivers \u2013 men and women he derisively referred to as \u2018muppets\u2019 \u2013 \u2018out of my industry\u2019. \u201cMr Wilkinson said he was determined to provoke industrial confrontation and, indeed, was looking forward to \u2018punch-ups\u2019 with trade unions. \u201cThe strikes this week are not, whatever Mr Grayling tries to suggest, politically motivated. We have a trade dispute with GTR/Southern, and only a poor government would seek to spin it any other way. I think their motives are clear.\u201d Back on Balham station, Joseph Volcy, 32, is wondering how he will get to work at a digital marketing company. \u201cI just didn\u2019t know [about the strike] and it\u2019s awful. By the way I\u2019m seeing it I won\u2019t get to work until 11am, because it\u2019s in Kingston. \u201cI need to get on my phone, talk to all my clients one by one. \u201cIt\u2019s not the first time. I\u2019m really disappointed. The train is never on time, sometimes it says it\u2019s coming and just disappears. I\u2019m thinking I have to move house. It\u2019s bad because it really affects your morale.\u201d The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, has accused the government of abandoning Southern rail commuters. Damien Gayle has been talking to angry commuters at Balham station in south London. Jessica Knight, 23, was on her way to work at Saviles estate agent in Richmond. \u201cIt\u2019s a pain in the arse,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll have to work from home. My boss won\u2019t be happy. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise it was completely not working. It\u2019s really annoying because there\u2019s so many people trying to get to work and do their jobs. They need to sort it out really.\u201d Asked if she had any sympathy for those taking strike action, she replied: \u201cNo, I couldn\u2019t care less.\u201d The RMT general secretary, Mick Cash, has rejected government claims that the strike is political and urged Chris Grayling to end a \u201cmisinformation\u201d campaign about the action. In a statement he said: This morning Chris Grayling claimed again that the action on Southern is political \u2013 it isn\u2019t, it\u2019s about safe train operation for both passengers and staff alike. The transport secretary wants to ask himself why the unions have been able to resolve disputes and reach agreements on Scotrail and elsewhere if our motivation is purely political. Mr Grayling also claimed again that the RSSB is an independent safety body - it isn\u2019t, it\u2019s funded by the private train companies. Finally, Mr Grayling claimed that there is a campaign of unofficial action organised by the unions \u2013 there isn\u2019t, and the evidence points to Southern sabotaging services to try and turn the blame on to the staff.\u201d Now is the time for Chris Grayling to make it clear that all of that rhetoric and misinformation is being swept away and that both him and his contractors, GTR, are serious about talks with the unions involved in today\u2019s action. Cash\u2019s statement added: RMT drivers on Southern rail are standing shoulder to shoulder with their Aslef colleagues this morning in a fight for safe train operation. This strike action is wholly the responsibility of a government and a company that have sought to bulldoze through changes that are ill-conceived, finance-led and fraught with danger. RMT remembers only too well the words of top government transport official Peter Wilkinson who told Southern passengers he wanted a punch-up with the unions, that train drivers were muppets and that he would starve our members back to work. That was the top government rail official making it clear he was hellbent on confrontation and it is that position which has led us to today\u2019s shutdown. Welcome to our live coverage of the latest Southern rail strike, which looks set to be the most disruptive yet. The strike by train drivers has brought services to a complete halt after the court of appeal rejected a second attempt by the rail company to block the action. Judges upheld last week\u2019s ruling by the high court to dismiss claims by Southern\u2019s owner, Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), that industrial action called by the train drivers\u2019 union, Aslef, infringed rights under European law. All of Southern\u2019s 2,242 weekday services have been cancelled, causing the worst disruption for more than 20 years. Aslef members have mounted picket lines outside stations at the start of the 48-hour walkout in a dispute over driver-only trains. Another strike is planned for Friday. Commuters are planning a protest outside the Department for Transport on Thursday evening. The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, has continued to blame the unions for the months of disruption to Southern services and urged them to sit down with the company to resolve long-running disputes over driver-only trains and changes to the role of conductors. But Aslef and the Rail, Maritime and Transport union attacked the government, saying ministers had been preventing Southern from negotiating properly.",

However, it is understood that Fox believes that the industry landscape has changed significantly since then and that there should be less concern over the impact of a deal on the diversity of viewpoints across the media.</p> <p>Murdoch\u2019s stance emerged as a group of Sky shareholders called for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/13/murdoch-deal-sky-shareholders--ofcom-fox\" draggable=\"true\">\u201crobust\u201d safeguards to protect the broadcaster\u2019s \u201cfuture probity\u201d</a> if Fox takes full control of the business. Alongside its call for safeguards, the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum, an association of 71 funds that control about 0.7% of Sky, also called for Ofcom to scrutinise the deal. Fox, which already owns 39% of Sky, is seeking to buy the remaining 61%. </p> <p>Referring to the phone-hacking scandal that derailed the previous Murdoch bid for Sky, the LAPFF said: \u201cAny recommendation by the board in favour would have to be based on an appropriate premium as well as safeguards for future probity given the past track records of the businesses controlled by the Murdochs. </p> <p>\u201cFurther clarity may also be needed so that public shareholders have full confidence that proposals are not being unduly influenced by the well-known relationships between Sky and 21st Century Fox.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/09/the-sky-takeover-deal-all-you-need-to-know\">Sky takeover deal \u2013 all you need to know</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If Fox tables a formal bid for Sky, the culture secretary, Karen Bradley, has 10 working days to decide whether to ask Ofcom to investigate the deal. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/dec/12/pressure-grows-to-refer-rupert-murdochs-sky-bid-to-ofcom\">\u201cThe role of Ofcom would be helpful in bringing its expert scrutiny on a deal that will have a broader impact on the future of the broadcasting and print media marketplace in the UK,</a>\u201d said Kieran Quinn, chairman of LAPFF.<br></p> <p>Five years ago, the Murdoch vehicle bidding for Sky was the now defunct News Corporation, then the parent of Fox.

                "bodyText":"Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox is not expected to offer Sky News as a regulatory pawn to secure an \u00a311.2bn takeover of Britain\u2019s largest pay-TV broadcaster. Under a previous acquisition attempt in 2011, Murdoch struck a deal to spin off the loss-making Sky News in a bid to appease concerns raised by Ofcom, the media industry watchdog. However, it is understood that Fox believes that the industry landscape has changed significantly since then and that there should be less concern over the impact of a deal on the diversity of viewpoints across the media. Murdoch\u2019s stance emerged as a group of Sky shareholders called for \u201crobust\u201d safeguards to protect the broadcaster\u2019s \u201cfuture probity\u201d if Fox takes full control of the business. Alongside its call for safeguards, the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum, an association of 71 funds that control about 0.7% of Sky, also called for Ofcom to scrutinise the deal. Fox, which already owns 39% of Sky, is seeking to buy the remaining 61%. Referring to the phone-hacking scandal that derailed the previous Murdoch bid for Sky, the LAPFF said: \u201cAny recommendation by the board in favour would have to be based on an appropriate premium as well as safeguards for future probity given the past track records of the businesses controlled by the Murdochs. \u201cFurther clarity may also be needed so that public shareholders have full confidence that proposals are not being unduly influenced by the well-known relationships between Sky and 21st Century Fox.\u201d If Fox tables a formal bid for Sky, the culture secretary, Karen Bradley, has 10 working days to decide whether to ask Ofcom to investigate the deal. \u201cThe role of Ofcom would be helpful in bringing its expert scrutiny on a deal that will have a broader impact on the future of the broadcasting and print media marketplace in the UK,\u201d said Kieran Quinn, chairman of LAPFF. Five years ago, the Murdoch vehicle bidding for Sky was the now defunct News Corporation, then the parent of Fox. Ofcom determined that News Corporation\u2019s control of media \u2013 which at the time included the Times, Sunday Times, Sun and now-closed News of the World \u2013 would give Murdoch too much influence over news in the UK combined with full ownership of Sky. Fox also believes that structural changes within the Murdoch empire since 2011 will benefit its bid. Following the phone-hacking scandal and the abandonment of the News Corporation bid, Murdoch split his media group in two by putting his publishing assets into a new company, News Corp, and putting the TV and Hollywood studio assets into Fox. Fox believes this move to create two separate companies means there is not the same issue of media concentration as six years ago. In addition, the digital revolution has seen huge growth from Murdoch\u2019s traditional publishing rivals, coupled with the rise of newer players such as Google and Facebook as distributors of news and new arrivals such as Huffington Post, BuzzFeed, Mashable and Vice Media. However, given that the Murdoch family will be the ultimate owner of both newspaper and TV assets in the UK, Ofcom could still raise concerns if it is asked to investigate. Ofcom\u2019s public-interest test report into the 2011 bid states that the regulator has \u201cwide discretion\u201d in assessing the issue of media plurality. Sky and Fox declined to comment.",

Wall Street quickly shrugged off the quarter-point rise in borrowing costs and the indication that 2017 would see three further increases.</p> <p>There were two main reasons for this. First, recent form suggests the Fed might not go ahead with next year\u2019s monetary tightening. When it raised rates a year ago, it hinted at four increases in 2016. Only one was actually delivered: the one last week. Second, Wall Street thinks that even if the Fed does go ahead, the economic impact will be modest.</p> <p>In the short term, at least, both assumptions seem reasonable. The Fed is certainly not trigger-happy when it comes to rates and Trump\u2019s fiscal policy should guarantee growth next year. But investors need to be wary. Most of the fiscal boost is going to come through tax cuts, which will inject both demand and inflation into an economy already running up against capacity constraints. At some point in 2017 the Fed will adopt a more aggressive stance. Shares will suffer as the economy slows down.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d083642685df7103f2d5c0ea78d5f6e155ec1e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d083642685df7103f2d5c0ea78d5f6e155ec1e4/0_204_3636_2182/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeff Bezos, chief executive officer of Amazon, during the meeting with Donald Trump last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeff Bezos, chief executive officer of Amazon, during the meeting with Donald Trump last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Tech v Trump?

In a meeting at Trump Tower last week the president-elect of the United States, Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/14/donald-trump-google-facebook-amazon-microsoft\">held talks with a group of technology bosses</a> that included Tim Cook of Apple, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook, Larry Page and Eric Schmidt of Google\u2019s owner Alphabet, and Elon Musk of Tesla.</p> <p>The executives left claiming it had gone well: Bezos even said he was \u201csuper-excited\u201d about the prospect of working with an \u201cinnovation administration\u201d. But photos of the meeting show a different story. Bezos looked grim, even frightened at times.</p> <p>This is hardly surprising. Trump waged a war of words with Bezos throughout the election, pledging to cause \u201cproblems\u201d for Amazon. He has also criticised Apple for its factories in China. The dynamics between Trump and tech \u2013 which will involve issues of trade, security and manufacturing \u2013 promises to be fascinating.</p>",

Hence the surge in the Dow towards the 20,000 mark. The upbeat mood was only briefly interrupted by the Fed\u2019s interest-rate announcement last week. Wall Street quickly shrugged off the quarter-point rise in borrowing costs and the indication that 2017 would see three further increases. There were two main reasons for this. First, recent form suggests the Fed might not go ahead with next year\u2019s monetary tightening. When it raised rates a year ago, it hinted at four increases in 2016. Only one was actually delivered: the one last week. Second, Wall Street thinks that even if the Fed does go ahead, the economic impact will be modest. In the short term, at least, both assumptions seem reasonable. The Fed is certainly not trigger-happy when it comes to rates and Trump\u2019s fiscal policy should guarantee growth next year. But investors need to be wary. Most of the fiscal boost is going to come through tax cuts, which will inject both demand and inflation into an economy already running up against capacity constraints. At some point in 2017 the Fed will adopt a more aggressive stance. Shares will suffer as the economy slows down. Tech v Trump? Could be interesting Rarely can so much wealth and power have gathered around one table. In a meeting at Trump Tower last week the president-elect of the United States, Donald Trump, held talks with a group of technology bosses that included Tim Cook of Apple, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook, Larry Page and Eric Schmidt of Google\u2019s owner Alphabet, and Elon Musk of Tesla. The executives left claiming it had gone well: Bezos even said he was \u201csuper-excited\u201d about the prospect of working with an \u201cinnovation administration\u201d. But photos of the meeting show a different story. Bezos looked grim, even frightened at times. This is hardly surprising. Trump waged a war of words with Bezos throughout the election, pledging to cause \u201cproblems\u201d for Amazon. He has also criticised Apple for its factories in China. The dynamics between Trump and tech \u2013 which will involve issues of trade, security and manufacturing \u2013 promises to be fascinating.",

Helena Smith reports:</p> <blockquote> <p>Greece\u2019s latest standoff with creditors has sparked widespread conjecture that early elections are not far off. Lenders\u2019 demands for additional austerity beyond 2018, when the country\u2019s current bailout programme ends, has put Athens\u2019 leftist-led government increasingly on the defensive. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 surprise announcement of fiscal support for vulnerable groups appears only to have toughened the hard line approach with the European Stability Mechanism, the euro zone\u2019s financing arm abruptly freezing short-term debt relief measures last week.</p> <p>Senior cadres in the ruling Syriza party say they are now being told that unless \u20ac4.5 bn worth of extra measures in the form of pension and tax reforms are legislated, a crucial second review of the economy will be delayed. That could once again raise the spectre of Greece\u2019s ejection from the eurozone. Earlier today the credit ratings agency, Moody\u2019s, said it would increase the risk of Greece defaulting on bond payments in July. </p> <p>\u201cWe are being blackmailed,\u201d said one. \u201cWe have accepted reforms that ideologically have been very difficult to swallow. Asking us to vote through more is democratically unacceptable.\u201d </p> <p>With the two-party government\u2019s wafer thin majority of 153 in the 300-seat house it was far from sure that further belt-tightening could be endorsed. Approval ratings of Syriza and Tsipras have plummeted precipitously on the back of fury over unpopular reforms. </p> <p>\u201cEarly elections are not part of our plans,\u201d the government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos said. \u201cIn 2018 Greece will exit the memoranda and [international] supervision,\u201d he said referring to the latest bailout programme. \u201cEven if the review is delayed we will not have elections. The country does not need elections.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p><em>On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day.

The Ifo index increased to 110.0 in December, from 110.4 in November. The increase was mainly driven by a better current assessment component (116.6, from 115.6). The expectations component remained almost unchanged. The December increase suggests that German businesses are not (yet) afraid of negative economic implications from the new president in the US.</p> <p>Today\u2019s Ifo was the last important macro indicator for the German economy this year. As always, the upcoming Christmas break is a good occasion for a reflective moment. A look at the German economy through the rear mirror. A look which shows an impressive, though slightly slowing growth performance. The German economy has continued its recovery and defied many external risks and turmoil, like Chinese stock market turbulences and economic slowdown, low oil prices, Brexit and continued weakness in many Eurozone countries. The key for economic success has been domestic demand. Strong domestic demand on the back of a strong labour market, low inflation, low interest rates and higher wages, partly fueled by the ECB and refugees.</p> <p>Unfortunately, as with so many good things, the current positive growth cycle is also coming to an end. Gradually, not abruptly. Looking into 2017, the upside for the German economy is that the main growth drivers of 2016 should still be the main growth drivers of 2017, only weaker. Construction, the best-performing sector currently, should continue to benefit from low interest rates and excess demand for housing in urban areas. Consumption should continue to thrive on the back of the strong labour market, higher real wages and low interest rates. Finally, government consumption should remain high as the influx of refugees requires continued expenditure. However, these three drivers are unlikely to gain momentum as interest rates are unlikely to drop further, inflation is gradually moving upwards and the labour market has reached its natural rate of unemployment.</p> <p>Real risks to the German outlook mainly seem to stem from the outside. The still unknown impact from president-elect Trump on trade and economic policies, the ongoing Brexit uncertainty and renewed political tensions in Europe due to several elections or a new flaring up of the Greek crisis are in our view the biggest risks for 2017. On top of everything, national elections in Germany do not pose a risk in itself but should clearly absorb time that could be used to implement new reforms and investments.</p> <p>All in all, it very much looks as if 2017 could be the slimmed down version of 2016. The growth ingredients should remain the same but it will be a bit less of everything. A good recipe to lose some weight after the holidays but not the best recipe for more economic growth.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5857a9a5e4b0525ea8569da1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-19T09:42:03.404Z\">9.42am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.cesifo-group.de/ifoHome/facts/Survey-Results/Business-Climate/Geschaeftsklima-Archiv/2016/Geschaeftsklima-20161219.html\">The German economy is in a festive mood</a></strong>, according to Clemens Fuest the president of the IFO institute. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The German economy is making a strong finish to the year.</p> <p>In the manufacturing sector, the index rose. Assessments of both the current business situation and expectations improved. Demand picked up significantly and the order back log grew. More companies plan to ramp up production in the months ahead as a result. </p> <p>In wholesaling, the business climate index rose to its highest level in almost three years. This was primarily due to more favourable assessments of the business situation. Wholesalers, however, scaled back their optimistic expectations slightly. In retailing the index remained unchanged at a high level. While retailers assessed their current business situation slightly less favourably, their business expectations improved. Electrical goods retailers reported brisk Christmas business. </p> <p>The construction sector continues to break records. Since Germany\u2019s reunification business has never been better for contractors. Improved business expectations indicate that the boom will continue in the months ahead.</p> </blockquote> <p>But it was not so joyous in the service sector:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the service sector the mood deteriorated in the run-up to Christmas. The indicator fell to 31.7 balance points in December from 35.0 balance points in November. Service providers assessed their current business situation less favourably. They also scaled back their business expectations slightly. Both indices, however, are significantly above their long-term average.

                "bodyText":"Over in Greece the government is once again denying any suggestion that elections are on the horizon despite mounting speculation that a national ballot may soon be inevitable. Helena Smith reports: Greece\u2019s latest standoff with creditors has sparked widespread conjecture that early elections are not far off. Lenders\u2019 demands for additional austerity beyond 2018, when the country\u2019s current bailout programme ends, has put Athens\u2019 leftist-led government increasingly on the defensive. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 surprise announcement of fiscal support for vulnerable groups appears only to have toughened the hard line approach with the European Stability Mechanism, the euro zone\u2019s financing arm abruptly freezing short-term debt relief measures last week. Senior cadres in the ruling Syriza party say they are now being told that unless \u20ac4.5 bn worth of extra measures in the form of pension and tax reforms are legislated, a crucial second review of the economy will be delayed. That could once again raise the spectre of Greece\u2019s ejection from the eurozone. Earlier today the credit ratings agency, Moody\u2019s, said it would increase the risk of Greece defaulting on bond payments in July. \u201cWe are being blackmailed,\u201d said one. \u201cWe have accepted reforms that ideologically have been very difficult to swallow. Asking us to vote through more is democratically unacceptable.\u201d With the two-party government\u2019s wafer thin majority of 153 in the 300-seat house it was far from sure that further belt-tightening could be endorsed. Approval ratings of Syriza and Tsipras have plummeted precipitously on the back of fury over unpopular reforms. \u201cEarly elections are not part of our plans,\u201d the government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos said. \u201cIn 2018 Greece will exit the memoranda and [international] supervision,\u201d he said referring to the latest bailout programme. \u201cEven if the review is delayed we will not have elections. The country does not need elections.\u201d On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The US economy continues to perform reasonably despite signs of a slowdown between November and December.

The composite index came in at 53.5 in December compared to 54.9 the previous month. Here\u2019s our report on the Christine Lagarde guilty verdict. Kim Willsher reports: Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, has been found guilty of negligence in approving a massive payout of taxpayers\u2019 money to controversial French businessman Bernard Tapie, but avoided a jail sentence. A French court convicted the former government minister, who had faced a \u20ac15,000 fine and up to a year in jail, but decided she should not be punished and that the conviction would not constitute a criminal record. The verdict came as a surprise as even the public prosecutor had admitted the evidence against Lagarde was \u201cweak\u201d during a five day trial last week. Jean-Claude Marin told the court Lagarde\u2019s actions fell into the category of politics and not criminality and called for her to be acquitted. Lagarde, who has always argued she did nothing wrong and acted \u201cin the public interest\u201d, was not present for the judgment. Her lawyer Patrick Maisonneuve said she had flown back to Washington DC, where the IMF is based. Lagarde had appeared before the Cour de Justice de la R\u00e9publique, a special tribunal set up to judge ministers and public officials for alleged crimes committed while in office. It is made up of three judges and 12 politicians from the French houses of parliament. It was only the fifth time the court had sat and its judgements cannot be appealed against.

The index is currently up 36 points at 19,880, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are both marginally higher. Elsewhere: Reports that the German bank would have to pay that much spooked investors back in September. The IMF board is meeting shortly to discuss the Christine Lagarde situation. Gerry Rice, the fund\u2019s director of communications, said: The Executive Board has met on previous occasions to consider developments related to the legal proceedings in France. It is expected that the Board will meet again shortly to consider the most recent developments. Here\u2019s AP on the Lagarde news: A special French court has declared International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde guilty of criminal negligence in a long-running arbitration case. But the court decided not to punish her or give her a criminal record. The Court of Justice of the Republic ruled that her negligence while servicing as finance minister allowed for the misappropriation of funds by other people. The others, in a separate case, haven\u2019t yet been tried. International Monetary Fund managing director Christine Lagarde has been convicted on one count of negligence by a French court, Bloomberg is reporting. Lagarde was accused of failing to prevent a government payout to businessman Bernard Tapie when she was French finance minister eight years ago. Uh oh. There could be a spanner in the works of the Monte dei Paschi fundraising. Reuters reports: Italian bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena is trying to resolve differences with a key investor over its 5 billion euro ($5.2 billion) rescue plan to allow the deal to go ahead and avoid a state bailout. Italy\u2019s third-largest bank has until the end of December to raise capital and offload 28 billion euros in gross bad loans as requested by European Central Bank supervisors. Monte dei Paschi has failed to find buyers for its shares so far. On Monday, it shook the market again with a warning that Italian bank industry bailout fund Atlante was rethinking its 1.5 billion euro purchase of bad loans from the lender. Atlante had expressed \u201cdeep reservations\u201d in a Dec. 17 letter over the terms of a bridge loan that Monte dei Paschi had secured as part of the sale of bad loans, the bank said. Monte dei Paschi shares extended losses on the news, erasing a week\u2019s gains to trade down 7.7 percent at 19.3 euros each. \u201cIf issues raised by (Atlante\u2019s manager) Quaestio cannot be solved, the operation could not be concluded by Dec. 31, 2016 as requested by the European Central Bank,\u201d the bank said in a statement. However, Carlo Messina, chief executive of Intesa Sanpaolo, one of Atlante\u2019s top contributors, said he believed the investment fund should go ahead with the deal and that it would reach a decision by Tuesday at the latest. Italy is ready to bail out Monte dei Paschi, the world\u2019s oldest bank,to prevent it being wound down and destabilising the euro zone\u2019s fourth-largest banking sector. Time for an update on the markets, and it\u2019s an uncertain pattern. Most European markets are still marginally lower, although off their worst levels, while Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is up 0.3% despite the fall in Monte dei Paschi as the bank starts its \u20ac5bn refinancing. The FTSE 100 has also edged higher - just - up 0.09%. But France\u2019s Cac is 0.26% lower, Germany\u2019s Dax has dipped 0.03% and Spain\u2019s Ibex is down 0.66% Meanwhile with the strength of the dollar continuing in the wake of last week\u2019s rate rise from the US Federal Reserve, the pound fell around 1% to its lowest level for a month, although it has recovered a little ground and is now down 0.75% at \u00a31.2394. Against the euro, sterling is down 0.5% at \u20ac1.1882. Tomorrow could see more developments in the row between Greek and its lenders over the government\u2019s plan to pay pensioners a Christmas bonus, something which was not approved by the lenders. Greece\u2019s Kathimerini reports: The Euro Working Group (EWG) is to meet Tuesday to discuss the impact on the Greek program of the SYRIZA-led government\u2019s decision to grant a one-off supplement to pensioners. The European Stability Mechanism reacted to the measure by suspending for the time being the implementation of the short-term debt relief measures that were only rubber stamped by eurozone finance ministers on December 5. EWG is expected to discuss a report by representatives of the institutions on the actual cost of the handout. The report was requested by German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble. Clemens Fuest, the president of Germany\u2019s IFO institute, has told Bloomberg that current interest rates may be too low for the eurozone. He presumably then welcomes signs of inflationary pressures in the latest wages data. The International Monetary Fund is positive about the actions taken by Ukraine over its biggest lender, PrivatBank. IMF managing director Christine Lagarde, who also has other things on her mind at the moment, said: Today\u2019s decision of Ukrainian authorities to nationalize PrivatBank is an important step in their efforts to safeguard financial stability. This decision was taken to ensure the smooth operations of the bank given its systemic role in Ukraine\u2019s financial system, and in view of insufficient efforts to strengthen its capital adequacy in recent months... It is now important that the process of nationalisation be followed by firm efforts to maximise the repayment of related-party loans, and the appointment of an independent management team to restore the bank\u2019s viability, minimising the cost to the state and taxpayers in line with existing legislation and international best practice. The IMF will continue to support Ukraine in its efforts to build strong institutions, enhance transparency, and advance structural reforms which are critical to achieve strong and sustainable economic growth. And in Italy: The details of the European Union\u2019s decision against Apple in a dispute over the tax it pays to Ireland have been released. Jennifer Rankin reports from Brussels: Apple could reduce its \u20ac13bn (\u00a310.8bn) tax bill to Ireland if it increased payments to its US parent company or paid back taxes to other EU countries, the European commission has said, as it revealed the full text of its landmark ruling against the US tech giant for the first time. Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition commissioner, suggested Ireland may not see the full \u20ac13bn in back taxes, if Apple chose to pay larger amounts to its US headquarters to fund research and development. Speaking to the Irish Independent, she also said the total paid to Ireland could be reduced because other EU member states may demand more tax from Apple if they concluded that the US tech firm had underpaid them, because it had been routing profits to Apple\u2019s Irish headquarters in Cork. The full text of the EU\u2019s decision, published on Monday, sets the stage for a titanic legal battle, which pits the European commission against Apple and Dublin, with implications for hundreds of companies. In August, the commission said a sweetheart deal devised by the Irish government had allowed Apple to pay tax of just 0.005% in 2014 and an average rate of 1% over many years. The UK Competition and Markets Authority will investigate the secondary ticketing market. It said: The CMA has today launched an enforcement investigation into suspected breaches of consumer protection law in the online secondary tickets market. This follows concerns that people are not getting the full range of information required by law when buying tickets put up for resale. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will specifically look at if information is provided on who the seller is and any connections the seller may have with the platform or event organisers; whether there are any restrictions on the use of resold tickets which could result in the person being denied access to the event; and where a seat is located in the venue. Andrea Coscelli, CMA Acting Chief Executive, said: \u201cA night out at a concert or a trip to a big match is something that millions of people look forward to. So it\u2019s important they know who they are buying from and whether there are any restrictions that could stop them using the ticket. \u201cWe have heard concerns about a lack of transparency over who is buying up tickets from the primary market. We also think that it is essential that those consumers who buy tickets from the secondary market are made aware if there is a risk that they will be turned away at the door.\u201d Meanwhile eurozone construction activity was also on the rise: Annual growth in hourly eurozone wages rose 1.6% in the third quarter, compared to an increase of just 0.9% in the previous three months and 1.7% in the first quarter. Hourly labour costs - which include wages and non-wage costs - rose by 1.5% in the eurozone and by 1.9% in the wider 28 member European Union in the third quarter of 2016, compared with the same quarter of the previous year. Report compiler Eurostat said: The two main components of labour costs are wages &amp; salaries and non-wage costs. In the euro area, wages &amp; salaries per hour worked grew by 1.6% and the non-wage component by 1.2% in the third quarter of 2016 compared with the same quarter of 2015. In the second quarter of 2016, the annual changes were +0.9% and +1.5% respectively. In the EU28, hourly wages &amp; salaries rose by 2.0% and the non-wage component by 1.5% in the third quarter of 2016. In the second quarter of 2016, annual changes were +1.4% and +1.7% respectively. Howard Archer, chief European and UK economist at IHS Markit, said the data could be encouraging for the European Central Bank: A rise in Eurozone wage costs and total labour costs in the third quarter of 2016 may fuel hope within the ECB that underlying Eurozone inflationary pressures may just be starting to pick up. The ECB has been frustrated and disappointed by the lack of a pick-up in underlying Eurozone in recent months, even though the headline consumer price inflation rate has picked up... However, while the ECB may well take some comfort from the third-quarter Eurozone labour costs and wage data, the Governing Council will still be wary about the current weakness of underlying price pressures \u2013 the ECB will likely note that while annual growth in Eurozone total labour costs and wages both picked up in the third quarter, this followed a sharp relapse in the second quarter and both were still just below the levels seen in the first quarter. Over to Greece, and this: If the festive mood in the German economy is not enough for you, then head over to our Christmas quiz for a bit more seasonal cheer. 44 out of 50 is the score to beat in my case (which is less impressive than it sounds given I wrote four of the questions.....) Economists have mixed views on what the December German IFO index portends for 2017: But economist Carsten Brzeski at ING Bank is less sanguine: Germany\u2019s most prominent leading indicator, the Ifo index, closes the year with another improvement. The Ifo index increased to 110.0 in December, from 110.4 in November. The increase was mainly driven by a better current assessment component (116.6, from 115.6). The expectations component remained almost unchanged. The December increase suggests that German businesses are not (yet) afraid of negative economic implications from the new president in the US. Today\u2019s Ifo was the last important macro indicator for the German economy this year. As always, the upcoming Christmas break is a good occasion for a reflective moment. A look at the German economy through the rear mirror. A look which shows an impressive, though slightly slowing growth performance. The German economy has continued its recovery and defied many external risks and turmoil, like Chinese stock market turbulences and economic slowdown, low oil prices, Brexit and continued weakness in many Eurozone countries. The key for economic success has been domestic demand. Strong domestic demand on the back of a strong labour market, low inflation, low interest rates and higher wages, partly fueled by the ECB and refugees. Unfortunately, as with so many good things, the current positive growth cycle is also coming to an end. Gradually, not abruptly. Looking into 2017, the upside for the German economy is that the main growth drivers of 2016 should still be the main growth drivers of 2017, only weaker. Construction, the best-performing sector currently, should continue to benefit from low interest rates and excess demand for housing in urban areas. Consumption should continue to thrive on the back of the strong labour market, higher real wages and low interest rates. Finally, government consumption should remain high as the influx of refugees requires continued expenditure. However, these three drivers are unlikely to gain momentum as interest rates are unlikely to drop further, inflation is gradually moving upwards and the labour market has reached its natural rate of unemployment. Real risks to the German outlook mainly seem to stem from the outside. The still unknown impact from president-elect Trump on trade and economic policies, the ongoing Brexit uncertainty and renewed political tensions in Europe due to several elections or a new flaring up of the Greek crisis are in our view the biggest risks for 2017. On top of everything, national elections in Germany do not pose a risk in itself but should clearly absorb time that could be used to implement new reforms and investments. All in all, it very much looks as if 2017 could be the slimmed down version of 2016. The growth ingredients should remain the same but it will be a bit less of everything. A good recipe to lose some weight after the holidays but not the best recipe for more economic growth. The German economy is in a festive mood, according to Clemens Fuest the president of the IFO institute. He said: The German economy is making a strong finish to the year. In the manufacturing sector, the index rose. Assessments of both the current business situation and expectations improved. Demand picked up significantly and the order back log grew. More companies plan to ramp up production in the months ahead as a result. In wholesaling, the business climate index rose to its highest level in almost three years. This was primarily due to more favourable assessments of the business situation. Wholesalers, however, scaled back their optimistic expectations slightly. In retailing the index remained unchanged at a high level. While retailers assessed their current business situation slightly less favourably, their business expectations improved. Electrical goods retailers reported brisk Christmas business. The construction sector continues to break records. Since Germany\u2019s reunification business has never been better for contractors. Improved business expectations indicate that the boom will continue in the months ahead. But it was not so joyous in the service sector: In the service sector the mood deteriorated in the run-up to Christmas. The indicator fell to 31.7 balance points in December from 35.0 balance points in November. Service providers assessed their current business situation less favourably. They also scaled back their business expectations slightly. Both indices, however, are significantly above their long-term average. Service providers remain keen to recruit additional staff. German business confidence improved in December, with the IFO index rising to 111 much as expected: Ukraine\u2019s largest lender has been declared insolvent, with the country\u2019s central bank saying that nationalisation was the best way forward. Reuters reports: Ukraine declared the country\u2019s largest lender PrivatBank insolvent on Monday and said bringing it under state ownership was the only way to protect the money of 20 million Ukrainian clients and stave off threats to the financial system. The central bank said in a statement that PrivatBank had not fulfilled its recapitalisation programme and 97 percent of its corporate loans had gone to companies linked to the bank\u2019s shareholders. As of Dec. 1, the bank\u2019s capital shortfall stood at 148 billion hryvnia ($5.65 billion). \u201cWe are sure that moving the bank into state ownership is the only possible way to save the money of the bank\u2019s clients and to save the financial system,\u201d the central bank said in a statement. The central bank said that Ukraine was ready to support PrivatBank with liquidity if needed, adding that it did not see the nationalisation process as significantly impacting the currency market or inflation levels. PrivatBank\u2019s former shareholders had agreed to restructure loans paid to insiders by July 1 next year, the central bank said, while the finance minister said the bank would be sold once it was back on its feet. Under Western-backed banking reforms, Ukraine is meant to shut lenders that cannot meet capitalisation targets, but PrivatBank is considered too big to fail. The nationalisation comes just days before parliament has to vote on next year\u2019s budget, which must stick to a shortfall of 3 percent of economic output, as agreed with Ukraine\u2019s international backers. Meanwhile the Ukrainian president said the state assured PrivatBank\u2019s clients that their money was safe, and called for people to remain calm. Over in Italy, shares in Monte dei Paschi have opened and are down 8.5%, triggering another suspension. The Santa rally in markets that we have seen since the start of December appears to be running out of steam a little. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: It may be the start of the final week before Christmas, but so far the European markets are looking rather Santa-less this Monday. To be fair, the FTSE has actually had a rather impressive December already, finally climbing back above 7000 last Friday, so it can be forgiven for not drastically building on that level this morning. The index is still flirting with that landmark level, though currently it lacks the kind of momentum that could lead it to a fresh all-time high later in the day. As for the pound, it\u2019s still struggling below 1.25 against the dollar, while against the dollar it has shed 0.2%. Over in the Eurozone the situation was similar, with the DAX and CAC both dipping after the bell. Like the FTSE the German and French indices have had a very strong December; the DAX, for example, has risen around 800 points since the start of the month, in part thanks to the ECB\u2019s (sort of) QE boost in its most recent meeting. Defying expectations, stock markets have started the last trading week before Christmas on the back foot. The FTSE 100 has fallen around12 points or 0.18% while Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac have lost 0.2%. Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB has opened down 0.3%. Mining and financial stocks are proving a drag in early trading, with Italy\u2019s Monte de Paschi failing to open but called lower on news of its plans to launch a \u20ac5bn cash call in a last ditch effort to avoid a state bailout. The bank said on Sunday its offer to institutional investors, who account for 65% of the total, would be open until 1pm GMT on Thursday. The offer to retail investors would close a day earlier. Here\u2019s Unicredit\u2019s forecast for the German IFO business confidence index, due in an hour or so: \u201cWe expect the Ifo climate index to improve to 111.0 in December after the stabilization at 110.4 in November.\u201d And Mike van Dulken and Henry Croft at Accendo Markets said: On a quiet day for macro data, in focus today will be German December IFO Surveys, all expected to show slight improvement since November with the Business Climate figure attempting to post a fresh 2016 high (albeit by a very slim margin). These figures have obvious importance for the Eurozone given Germany\u2019s position as the powerhouse for the European economy. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s the last trading week before Christmas, and many investors are already winding down for the festive season. But with thin trading volumes in the markets, there might be some volatile moves to look out for. Will the FTSE 100 hit a new peak, beating the closing high of 7103 reached in April 2015 or the record intra-day level of 7129 in October this year? Will the Dow pass the key 20,000 barrier. On the agenda come German confidence figures and US services and composite PMI numbers, and ahead of that European markets are expected to open higher: We\u2019ll also be keeping an eye on struggling Italian bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena, which is attempting to refinance its huge debts, and could affect the general direction of the markets. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: As we head into the final full trading week of 2016, having come off a decent December so far for European stocks which have seen a number of significant breakouts, the key question as we head into year-end is whether these gains of the past two weeks are likely to be sustained. Initial impressions look positive, however the elephant in the room remains the Italian banking sector after last week\u2019s announcement by Italy\u2019s largest bank Unicredit to draw a line under its recent problems by announcing a significant recapitalisation plan. This week all eyes will return to Monte dei Paschi di Siena who are expected to launch their plans to sell \u20ac5bn of stock in the days leading up to Christmas to institutions and retail investors, in the hope that over \u20ac25bn of bad loans can then be sold on, and the bank rescued without having to bail in retail bondholders. While the political picture at the top of Italian government has become a little clearer there is no reason that this particular attempted restructuring package is likely to be any more successful than the previous three, given the continued weakness of the Italian economy, which is probably why so far there has been so little investor interest. There may also be developments in the Greek crisis, after lenders objected to the government\u2019s plans to give Christmas bonuses to pensioners.",

                "bodyText":"Ireland may never see the full \u20ac13bn (\u00a310.8bn) in unpaid taxes owed by Apple, the European commission has said, if other EU countries go after the American tech giant for a share. The EU executive also said Apple could reduce its multibillion-euro tax bill to Ireland if it increased payments to its US parent company, as it revealed the full text of its landmark ruling against the US tech giant for the first time. Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition commissioner, suggested Ireland may not see the full \u20ac13bn in back taxes if Apple chose to pay larger amounts to its US headquarters to fund research and development. Speaking to the Irish Independent, she said the total paid to Ireland could be reduced because other EU member states may demand more tax from Apple if they concluded that the US tech firm had underpaid them, because it had been routing profits to Apple\u2019s Irish headquarters in Cork. The full text of the EU\u2019s decision, published on Monday, sets the stage for a titanic legal battle, which pits the European commission against Apple and Dublin, with implications for hundreds of companies. In August, the commission said a sweetheart deal devised by the Irish government had allowed Apple to pay tax of just 0.005% in 2014 and an average rate of 1% over many years. Speaking on Monday, Vestager said the full amount may not be payable to Ireland. Apple created two companies in Ireland, Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe, as it went on a journey to become the biggest profit-making firm in the world. \u201cThe amount to be paid back to Ireland would also be reduced if the two companies were required to pay larger amounts of money to their US parent company to fund the research and development efforts,\u201d Vestager said. However, she also suggested other EU member states may want a slice. \u201cOther countries, in the EU or elsewhere, can look at our investigation. If they conclude that Apple should have recorded its sales in those countries instead of Ireland, they could require Apple to pay more tax locally. That would reduce the amount to be paid back to Ireland,\u201d she said. Earlier in the year, the Danish politician said Ireland had given Apple a sweetheart deal worth \u20ac13bn. But the full 130-page ruling was only published on Monday, to allow lawyers to ensure confidential commercial information was kept out of the final report. Hours ahead of publication, Dublin and Apple stepped up their war of words, vowing to fight the commission in court. As it announced plans to lodge its appeal this week, Apple accused European regulators of a political crusade against a successful American company. In a personal attack on the Danish competition commissioner, a senior company executive said Apple was a convenient target for an official chasing headlines. The company\u2019s chief general counsel, Bruce Sewell, told Reuters: \u201cApple is not an outlier in any sense that matters to the law. Apple is a convenient target because it generates lots of headlines. It allows the commissioner to become Dane of the year for 2016,\u201d he said, referring to the title accorded by Danish newspaper Berlingske last month. Under Vestager, the commission has also taken on McDonald\u2019s, Starbucks and Italy\u2019s Fiat over tax, and launched investigations into overcharging by Gazprom, one of Russia\u2019s most powerful companies. In a submission to Europe\u2019s second-highest court, Apple also accused the commission of ignoring Ireland\u2019s tax experts. \u201cThe Irish have put in an expert opinion from an incredibly well-respected Irish tax lawyer,\u201d Sewell said. \u201cThe commission not only didn\u2019t attack that \u2013 didn\u2019t argue with it, as far as we know \u2013 they probably didn\u2019t even read it.

Apple has already agreed to pay \u20ac318m to the Italian authorities to settle a case of suspected fraud, where it failed to declare its earnings between 2008 and 2013. Ireland is expected to create a \u20ac13bn escrow account to store the money, pending potential claims by other member states. Only national tax authorities can decide whether they wish to pursue Apple for taxes on profits booked in Ireland. While Brussels is confident it will win its case, the Irish government accused the commission of riding roughshod over Ireland\u2019s sovereignty, by trying to rewrite the country\u2019s corporation tax rules. Unveiling its formal legal submission on Monday, the finance department described how low taxes are the point of its sales pitch to foreign investors, arguing it was perfectly legal to levy far less tax on profits than imposed by competitors. Under EU rules, governments have powers to set their own corporate tax rates, but are forbidden from giving an unfair competitive advantage to firms on their territory. Ireland levies a tax rate of 12.5%, one of the lowest in the EU, nearly a third of the US rate of 35%. Irish ministers have stressed its low corporate tax rate is non-negotiable, viewing it as the linchpin of the economy. The low headline rate, combined with complex use of shell companies, has helped Ireland to draw in scores of tech and pharmaceutical firms. Apple employs 6,000 people in Cork, Ireland\u2019s second city, and has pledged to remain loyal to the city it chose as its European base more than 30 years ago. Ireland\u2019s finance ministry contended that the commission had misunderstood EU competition rules, which are intended to ensure a level-playing field across the union. \u201cThe state aid rules by their nature cannot remedy mismatches between tax systems on a global level,\u201d it said, contesting the EU\u2019s argument that Apple got benefits denied to other companies based in Ireland. Vestager made clear the commission was standing its ground: \u201cThis decision sends a clear message: member states cannot give unfair tax benefits to selected companies. No matter if they are European or foreign, large or small, part of a group or not.\u201d",

                "bodyText":"An influential committee of MPs is poised to launch an investigation into Britain\u2019s \u00a31bn online shopping VAT fraud crisis after sellers on Amazon and eBay evaded hundreds of millions of pounds in tax in the run-up to Christmas. Conservative MP Richard Bacon, who sits on the public accounts committee, said: \u201cI think this is absolutely an issue we need to look at. \u201cWe\u2019ve already been discussing VAT fraud in online retailing informally and I expect that it is something the committee will want to turn to.\u201d The National Audit Office could also be asked to examine the subject, and how well it has been addressed by HM Revenue &amp; Customs. In recent years, overseas sellers, particularly from China, have come to dominate many popular goods categories on eBay and Amazon, illegally selling goods without VAT. As a result, many small British businesses have been left unable to compete. Parliament\u2019s public accounts committee has previously played a central role in shining a spotlight on other tax scandals involving the likes of Starbucks, Google and Amazon. Its work has helped trigger international tax reforms as well as generating important evidence for European commission inquiries into alleged sweetheart tax deals for multinational corporations. Now the MPs are expected to turn their attention to the issue of overseas traders committing VAT fraud on an industrial scale through well-known online shopping sites \u2013 a scandal first highlighted by a Guardian investigation last year. HMRC has since admitted VAT evasion in online shopping had become a \u201cvery big issue\u201d, estimating it cost up to \u00a31.5bn a year in lost tax. But officials have been frustrated by what is seen as the uncooperative approach taken by some big websites, including Amazon. In January, Lin Homer, then head of HMRC, told a parliamentary committee: \u201cWe do feel, just as with beer and alcohol, that those people who manage the supply chain should ensure enough diligence is built into it. Marketplace providers [such as Amazon and eBay] have responsibilities.\u201d Two months later, the Treasury announced new powers for HMRC to make large marketplace websites liable \u2013 in some circumstances \u2013 for VAT revenues lost to fraudulent overseas sellers. News of a likely parliamentary inquiry came as the Treasury minister Jane Ellison claimed HRMC\u2019s new measures, which came into force in September, were already proving successful. Latest figures show 7,185 overseas sellers have come forward to register for VAT since January, compared with just 695 in 2015 \u2013 a rush, she said, in anticipation of tough action from HMRC. But Ellison\u2019s claim that HMRC was now tackling online VAT fraud \u201cin time for Christmas\u201d was greeted with scepticism by Bacon and tax fairness campaigners. \u201cI think it\u2019s a bit early to declare HMRC\u2019s actions an unbridled success,\u201d said Bacon, who added the public accounts committee would want to scrutinise such claims closely. Last month, a second Guardian investigation showed widespread evidence of ongoing VAT fraud by sellers on Amazon and eBay \u2013 despite the HMRC\u2019s new powers. HMRC insists action is being taken. \u201cWe are already using new powers granted from September to directly tackle these overseas businesses,\u201d it said. Meanwhile, Amazon and eBay have repeatedly said they cooperate with HMRC where required, but that they are not responsible for policing the VAT compliance of independent sellers. A spokesman for Ellison would not comment on whether HMRC had recovered back taxes and penalties from the influx of overseas traders now belatedly registering for VAT. A spokesperson for campaign group VATfraud.org said: \u201cIt\u2019s all well and good HMRC handed out 7,185 VAT numbers to internet retailers in the last year; it just proves this fraud is enormous. \u201cWhat HMRC failed to say is how much undeclared VAT they have recovered from these retailers. We want to know if HMRC is simply giving out VAT numbers without any due diligence or investigation into these retailers\u2019 online trading history.\u201d",

Hook your phone or computer up to a speaker, and it\u2019s just like Spotify: you\u2019ll get the music, and the audio from any video ads, and then can pick and choose from a huge catalogue.</p> <p>Though the latest figures only cover the first half of 2015, the monitoring service Nielsen reckons that YouTube delivered 60% more music streams than all the on-demand music streaming services combined \u2013 and that the gap had grown since the same period in 2014. The arrival of Apple Music in June 2015 might shift that, but it\u2019s unlikely.</p> <p>What riles the music business is that the amount that YouTube pays it per track played works out as substantially less than Spotify or Apple Music. </p> <p>Whereas the latter two services have complex agreements with the record labels setting a per-play fee, YouTube pays out a share of the ad revenue that any track identified as belonging to a company earns. That tends to be lower than a per-track fee, because advertising prices and value varies enormously. Mulligan says: \u201cVideo consumption went through the roof in 2015, but there weren\u2019t enough ads to put against it \u2013 so the ad revenues paid grew more slowly than consumption.\u201d</p> <p>Hence the RIAA\u2019s push to get streaming payments on to Trump\u2019s mind at the tech summit. It\u2019s unclear whether it succeeded.</p> <p>YouTube says the ad-funded model has transformed the music video from a costly promotional tool into a new source of revenue. \u201cIn the last 12 months, we\u2019ve paid out $1bn to the music industry in ad revenues alone, and are working collaboratively with them to bring more money to artists,\u201d it says. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f3dd3bdd90f9357e9ba57a3080099ec6f7d5baa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f3dd3bdd90f9357e9ba57a3080099ec6f7d5baa/15_200_5142_3086/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vinyls are back in vogue\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vinyls are back in vogue</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Bowles/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This doesn\u2019t sit comfortably with the music industry. David Price, director of insight at the IFPI, the global trade body for the recording industry, says: \u201cWe don\u2019t believe YouTube is properly rewarding artists for the huge consumption that\u2019s going on there. But in the last year we have seen the EU take positive steps towards creating a better and fairer licensing environment in Europe.\u201d The BPI, the UK music industry\u2019s trade body, complained in May that artists earn less from YouTube than they do from vinyl.</p> <p>But in the long run, streaming is the only game in town \u2013 along, perhaps, with the CD and vinyl. The download once looked like the future; now, the question is how much more of a future it has. </p>",

The arrival of Apple Music in June 2015 might shift that, but it\u2019s unlikely. What riles the music business is that the amount that YouTube pays it per track played works out as substantially less than Spotify or Apple Music. Whereas the latter two services have complex agreements with the record labels setting a per-play fee, YouTube pays out a share of the ad revenue that any track identified as belonging to a company earns. That tends to be lower than a per-track fee, because advertising prices and value varies enormously. Mulligan says: \u201cVideo consumption went through the roof in 2015, but there weren\u2019t enough ads to put against it \u2013 so the ad revenues paid grew more slowly than consumption.\u201d Hence the RIAA\u2019s push to get streaming payments on to Trump\u2019s mind at the tech summit. It\u2019s unclear whether it succeeded. YouTube says the ad-funded model has transformed the music video from a costly promotional tool into a new source of revenue. \u201cIn the last 12 months, we\u2019ve paid out $1bn to the music industry in ad revenues alone, and are working collaboratively with them to bring more money to artists,\u201d it says. This doesn\u2019t sit comfortably with the music industry. David Price, director of insight at the IFPI, the global trade body for the recording industry, says: \u201cWe don\u2019t believe YouTube is properly rewarding artists for the huge consumption that\u2019s going on there. But in the last year we have seen the EU take positive steps towards creating a better and fairer licensing environment in Europe.\u201d The BPI, the UK music industry\u2019s trade body, complained in May that artists earn less from YouTube than they do from vinyl. But in the long run, streaming is the only game in town \u2013 along, perhaps, with the CD and vinyl. The download once looked like the future; now, the question is how much more of a future it has.",
