                "bodyText":"Right, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. A quick recap. December has got off to a lively start in the financial markets, with big moves in the commodity and foreign exchange arenas. Traders have driven the oil price sharply higher for the second day running. Brent crude has hit its highest level since October 2015, jumping by almost 5% to $54.31 per barrel. Despite questions over compliance, yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Opec deal is being seen as a real game-changer that could push prices higher - meaning fresh inflationary pressures and higher prices at the petrol pumps. The pound has also romped higher today, after Brexit minister David Davis offered the tantalising prospect of the UK paying to access the EU single market. The comments, made in parliament, fuelled hopes that Britain might avoid a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Sterling hit two-month highs, before dipping a little -- and is currently up 0.5% at $1.257. Government bonds have also sold off today, driving up the yield on benchmark US debt. UK borrowing costs also rose, with the yield on 10-year gilts up from 1.5% to 1.51%. And European stock markets have closed in the red: FTSE 100: down 30 points at 6752, -0.45% German DAX: down 106 points at 10534, -1% French CAC: down 17 points at 4560, -0.4% Investors are fretting about Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Italian referendum on constitutional reforms, and Austria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential election (between a far-right candidate and a Green). Get swotting up now! Over on Wall Street, machine and equipment firm Caterpillar briefly suspended its shares today so it could warn that analysts profit expectations are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctoo optimistic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Caterpillar cited various headwinds, such as Brexit uncertainty, Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slow recovery and volatility in the oil price. It also warned that any infrastructure programme from Donald Trump probably wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help its earnings in 2017. This is the key slide from its presentation to analysts: Caterpillar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price has been rising for weeks, on speculation that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to upgrade America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highways, airports and schools will mean more demand for its diggers and trucks. But Wall Street isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too worried by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning; Caterpillar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have resumed trading, up 0.25% on the day. Now this is interesting....oil giant BP has signed off on a $9bn project to expand its Mad Dog oil field in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The decision follows extensive work bringing the cost of the project down (at one stage, it was going to cost $20bn). And it shows that oil firms are prepared to invest in new projects, if they think the oil price makes it worthwhile. BP chief executive Bob Dudley says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This announcement shows that big deepwater projects can still be economic in a low price environment in the US if they are designed in a smart and cost-effective way. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It also demonstrates the resilience of our strategy which is focused on building on incumbent positions in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most prolific hydrocarbon basins while relentlessly focusing on value over volume.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But.... BP can never shake off memories of an earlier project in the Gulf, the Deepwater Horizon disaster at the Macondo oil field in 2010. Eleven workers were killed when the rig caught fire, creating one of the worst environmental disasters ever. Central Bank news! Agustin Carstens, head of the Bank of Mexico, has resigned. Carstens, one of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most experienced central bankers, has been appointed to run the Bank of International Settlements (BIS is basically the central bankers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 central bank). He will leave the Bank of Mexico in July 2017, and start at BIS three months later. Carstens deserves a change of job, having been battling to handle the impact of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pronouncements on the Mexican Peso. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michael McDonough says the news adds extra uncertainty, with Mexico already expected to hike interest rates next month: The top rung of central banking is a little like Formula 1 -- with a small number of candidates moving between a limited number of seats. So Carstens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 appointment may have a knock-on effect on the European Central Bank; board member Beno\u00c3\u00aet C\u00c5\u201cur\u00c3\u00a9 could possible have got the BIS job, but is now free for other challenges... Boom! The Brent crude oil price has just hit its highest level of the year. A barrel of Brent for February delivery just changed hands at $53.79, which is the most expensive since October 2015. Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprise supply cut is forcing traders to rapidly reassess their expectations. Jane Sydenham, investment director at Rathbone Investment Management, calls it a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcknee jerk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reaction to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whilst at present the news is good for the markets, it is much more difficult to say how this will play out in the longer term. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re currently experiencing a knee-jerk reaction, unsurprising since this is the biggest co-ordinated action in eight years. It is likely that this will run on for a little while longer but how the markets price in the unexpected oil inflation is something we are yet to see.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Former cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith, who campaigned for Brexit, has criticised the idea that Britain might make payments to the EU after leaving the bloc. He was responding to David Davis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suggestion that the UK would consider the idea. PA has the story: Prominent Brexit-backer Iain Duncan Smith claimed Mr Davis had given a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153convoluted\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd answer and may have been talking about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bridging arrangements\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to phase out UK contributions to the EU. The former cabinet minister insisted there was no way of reaching a deal to pay the EU for access to the single market. He told BBC Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s The World At One: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My sense is that I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that he was absolutely answering the question that was posed to him. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talking about here is how do you get a deal that allows British and Europeans to access each others\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 markets without the necessity of tariff barriers or artificial barriers against service etc. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s any way in which you can reach a deal whereby you say \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pay some money in and therefore you allow us access\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, because you might as well have tariff barriers at that point.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Other Brexit supporters have also expressed disquiet about this idea in the past; but it all depends on the kind of Brexit deal that Theresa May goes for. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pound rally follows the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best month since 2009. Sterling gained 6% against the euro in November, 1,5% against the US dollar, and almost 15% against the Japanese yen. It may show that the markets are becoming less worried about the UK, following more solid economic data since June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says: Momentum is particularly strong against the yen and its recent performance has been staggering, GBPJPY is up more than 14% since the start of November! Political risks around Brexit are receding, as political risks elsewhere start to bite. The cost to insure UK sovereign debt has fallen sharply since spiking back in June. Good economic news from America: its factory sector is growing at its fastest pace since the Brexit vote. The ISM manufacturing index has jumped to 53.2 in November, from 51.9 in October, which is the fastest rate since June. Firm said they were benefitting from strong domestic demand. A rival survey, from Markit, was also just released. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s even more encouraging, showing activity rising at a 13-month high. No wonder City traders may be looking frazzled: The US crude oil price has hit a five-week high, as traders push it through the$50 per barrel mark. Oil is surging even higher, as commodity traders continue to react to the Opec supply cut deal hammered out yesterday. Brent crude is now up 3% at $53.44 per barrel, a near two-month high, and a really substantial surge from $46/barrel before the Opec meeting. Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to cut output by 1.2m barrels per day looks like a real game-changer. The group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s secretary general, Mohammed Barkindo, is telling Bloomberg TV right now that it was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153historic landmark\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sam Wahab, director of oil and gas research at Cantor Fitzgerald Europe, believes the price could keep rising: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement has truly changed the landscape for oil over the coming years, putting a floor of $50 a barrel under oil prices. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Prior to this agreement, the environment of sub $50 oil was likely to persist, but this move sufficiently addresses the supply/demand dynamics, with some 3.5% of supply being cut from January. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It means 2017 will likely see prices around the $55-$60 a barrel mark, and we may yet see further jumps in prices as soon as next week if the non-OPEC members also agree a production cut at their meeting on Friday 9th December. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally has pushed the pound to nearly a three-month high against the euro. That means it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just 8% below its pre-referendum levels (having been down 15% at one stage). The pound just spiked even higher against the US dollar, after the latest American unemployment figures hit the wires. Sterling hit $1.268, up 1.7 cents, as data showed that the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefit has hit a 5-month high. The initial jobless claims figure rose to 268,000 last week, up from 251,000. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some more reaction to David Davis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments, and the bounce in the pound: Craig Erlam, chief market analyst with retail brokerage Oanda: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The idea that single market is still a priority is a move away from the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 line. Since the two or three major selloffs we saw earlier this year, the Bank of England has changed its stance to holding rates next year, the data has been better and now the rhetoric has softened.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sterling is on the tear this morning on hopes for a soft Brexit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153David Davis said the UK could contribute to the EU budget in return for access to markets and that has fuelled a rally for the pound.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chris Saint, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Currency Service \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rehabilitation is gathering steam, having broken through the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.19 level against the euro today for the first time in almost three months. A surge of nearly 1% versus the US dollar has also lifted the pound back above US$1.26. Gains come amid signs of a more compromising approach to upcoming Brexit negotiations from the UK government, with Brexit minister David Davis saying Britain would consider contributing to the EU budget in return for retaining access to European markets. Our Politics Live blog has full coverage of David Davis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments on Brexit: David Davis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suggestion that the UK could pay for access to European markets after Brexit have also sent the pound rallying against the euro. Sterling has gained nearly one eurocent to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.19, its highest point since September 7th. Caxton FX analyst Alexandra Russell-Oliver says that Davis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments are pushing the pound up. She also points out that the euro is suffering from fears of political instability, with two important votes taking place on Sunday: The pound rally, which has occurred against most major currencies has follows comments from Brexit Secretary Davis, which indicate that the UK may be willing to make trade-offs for access to the single market. The euro is currently under pressure in anticipation of the Italian Constitutional Referendum and Austrian Presidential Election, taking place on Sunday, where shock results could result in further volatility. The pound has surged by 1% this morning after Brexit secretary David Davis suggested that the UK could make payments in return for access to the European markets. The comments have fuelled hopes in the City that Britain might avoid a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial services industry, for example, could retain access to the single market after 2019 (the likely exit date). Our political reporter Jess Elgot explains what happened: David Davis has suggested that the government would consider making contributions to the EU budget in exchange for access to the single market, saying his Department for Exiting the EU would consider all options to get the best deal with the bloc. During questions in the House of Commons, the Labour MP Wayne David asked if the Brexit secretary would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153consider making any contribution in any shape or form for access to the single market\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Davis said the government would look at the options during the article 50 process over the next two years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The major criterion here is that we get the best possible access for goods and services to the European market,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And if that is included in what he is talking about, then of course we would consider it. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s her full story: This chart shows how the pound surged by one and a half cents, or 1.2%, since Davis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments, to $1.2650. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its highest level since the US election three weeks ago. Neil Jones, head of FX hedge fund sales at Mizuho, told Reuters that some traders have been racing to buy the pound -- or unwind bets against sterling. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These headlines suggesting Britain may be able to access the single market are generating substantial sterling demand from traders and investors looking to reduce their short positions and unwind hedges.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Consumers should brace for higher petrol prices soon, warns Michelle McGrade, chief investment officer of TD Direct Investing: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been clear for some time that the low price of oil has been hurting producers. In my view, it was only a matter of time before OPEC decided to cut production. A higher oil price, together with a strong US dollar, makes things tougher for UK consumers because not only will petrol be more expensive, but this could fuel a stronger surge in inflation than originally expected, as inflation is highly correlated to the price of oil. The combination makes for an unwelcome gift just before Christmas. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve checked with the AA about the report that filling up a car will soon cost an extra \u00c2\u00a35. They say that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s based on oil hitting $60 -- so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not there yet. But the 12% jump in the oil price this week is still going to hurt drivers... Back to Opec.... and the oil price is clinging onto today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains, as analysts keep kicking the tires of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal. Brent crude is hovering around $52.50, a 1.2% gain today. That means it has surged by 12% since yesterday morning, just before Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s members sat down and hammered out the supply cuts deal. City traders are pondering: Will Opec members actually deliver the production cuts they signed up to yesterday? Will non-Opec members support the deal by cutting supply (as Opec hopes)? Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says this uncertainty means the oil price could fall back: OPEC has suggested the deal is contingent on getting this 600,000 b/d from non-OPEC \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet know if it could unravel if this doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen. There are lots of pieces in the jigsaw that are yet to fall into place. If OPEC members stick to the script and if non-OPEC comes up with the goods we might be on for further gains in crude. If not this rally could easily lose momentum and fade. And.... the more the oil price goes up, though, the more incentive there is for US shale producers to turn their pumps back on. Bloomberg Gadfly writer Liam Denning reckons this issue will be crucial: Supporting the market in this way hands an opportunity to U.S. exploration and production firms to hedge future production at higher prices and expand their own drilling budgets to fill some of the gap left by Saudi Arabia, Russia and others. Over the next six months, we will see if OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coalition can hold. Assume it does -- a huge assumption at this point -- and in the following six months we will see how much the frackers will do to undermine it. His full take is here: Now this really is a moment..... unemployment across the eurozone has fallen below 10% for the first time in over five years, and is now at a seven-year low. Eurostat reports that the jobless rate fell to 9.8% in October. September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure has been revised down to 9.9% (from 10%). Eurozone unemployment hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been below 10% since April 2011, and October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading is actually the lowest since 2009. Over the last year, unemployment has fallen in 24 of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 28 members. The largest annual decreases were registered in Croatia (from 16.1% to 12.7%), Spain (from 21.2% to 19.2%) and Slovakia (from 11.1% to 9.1%). Italy and France have also reported falls in unemployment, as Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slow-but-steady recovery continues. Economists fear that British factories could hike their prices to help them handle a sharp rise in raw material costs since the summer. George Nikolaidis, senior economist at EEF, says the weaker pound is both a challenge and an opportunity for manufacturing: While the more competitive exchange rate means UK manufacturers are well positioned to capitalise on the recovery in demand in key export markets, higher input costs are coming through the manufacturing supply chain thick and fast to put the squeeze on profit margins. Manufacturers are inevitably looking to pass these costs on to customers adding to the inflationary pressures already building up in the UK economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mike Rigby, head of manufacturing at Barclays also believes consumers will be hit by higher prices next year: Exporters continue to take advantage of a weak sterling but it is increasingly looking like a case of having to take the rough with the smooth as businesses start to pass on higher import costs, which could accelerate inflationary pressures as we enter 2017.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And Jeremy Cook of World First fears that the recent jump in output could be slowing: Breaking: Growth in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector slowed last month, despite the weak pound helping firms export abroad. The UK factory PMI, which measures activity across the sector, has fallen to 53.4, down from 54.4 in October. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker than the City expected, but it does still show that the sector has expanded for four month running -- as the initial Brexit shock quickly ebbed away. Firms reported that output and new orders both expanded at a solid date. Markit, which compiles the figures, also warns that the weak pound is driving up import costs -- as well as making UK goods more attractive to overseas buyers. The effects of the weak sterling exchange rate continued to be felt by manufacturers during November. On the plus side, the boost to export competitiveness led to a further increase in new business from abroad. Companies reported improved demand from the USA, mainland Europe and the Middle East. The negative impact of the exchange rate was felt on the cost side. Average purchase prices rose at a pace close to October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s near six-year record and again at one of the fastest rates in the survey history. The Financial Times has a good piece about how some Opec members are paying a higher price than others to get the deal through: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: Saudi Arabia and its Gulf Arab allies, including Kuwait, United Arab Emirates and Qatar, have agreed to shoulder the bulk of the cuts. They are banking on a quick recovery in price to ensure they do not lose revenues or surrender market share to other suppliers. Iran and Iraq, which sit outside the Gulf bloc in the Middle East, have sacrificed less. Most oil analysts see the limited concessions they made to let the deal succeed as largely face-saving technical measures to placate the Saudis. Other members from Venezuela to Angola, which have agreed to cut part of their output in support of a 1.2m barrel-a-day reduction, have a patchy record of compliance with past deals. Despite Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s price surge, they may need an ongoing recovery to be convinced to do their share. Newsflash: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factor sector has posted its strongest growth in close to three years. Data firm Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly manufacturing PMI has risen to 53.7, up from 53.5 in October. Any reading over 50 shows an expansion, and this is the best reading since January 2014. The sector was driven by the Netherlands, Austria and Spain - while poor old Greece suffered its biggest contraction in a year. Factories also reported that cost pressures are rising sharply, meaning they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re paying more for raw materials. Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s production cut may make that worse.... Dominic Rossi, global CIO equities at Fidelity International, urges caution: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I would not get too excited by the Opec cut. Compliance will be a problem, and the Russians will pump more gas instead. In the meantime, the long-run marginal cost of US shale continues to fall. I would not chase this oil price rally too hard.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd City experts are a little sceptical that Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal will actually push oil prices much higher. Spanish banking group BBVA suggest warn that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153implementing and monitoring\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the deal could be constrained by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153geopolitical factors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (for example, Saudi Arabia and Iran are already backing rival sides in the Yemen conflict) Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ANZ bank point out that US shale producers could boost their own output, keeping a lid on prices. City analyst Louise Cooper questions suggests Iraq can stick to the deal: (Some of Iraq\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil fields are based in Iraqi Kurdistan, to the north of the country, where the peshmerga military forces are based) The Wall Street Journal has created an excellent graphic, showing how Opec has created the current oil glut by pumping harder, while US shale producers have cut back: The WSJ also explains how Saudi and Iran managed to settle on a deal: The member countries were faced with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very deep\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd abyss of low oil prices, and that won out over politics, said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of IHS Markit and a longtime oil-market watcher. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153OPEC is back in business,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mr. Yergin said in an interview. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This will rank as one of their historic decisions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Saudi Arabia and Iran, whose differences blocked a deal that aimed to freeze production earlier this year, made the deal possible by coming to a tortured compromise on production figures. Iran was allowed to increase its production by 90,000 barrels a day, a significant victory for the Islamic Republic as it tries to rebuild its economy after the end of Western sanctions. But the deal allows both Iran and Saudi Arabia to claim a win, by pointing to different sets of numbers. Iran, using production figures generated by OPEC, can say it is raising output, while Saudi Arabia can point to the Islamic Republic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s output figures and say that Iran is agreeing to a cut. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good day for the oil market, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good day for the oil industry,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said after the deal was reached. Shares in energy companies are jumping today too. In London, Royal Dutch Shell and BP are leading the risers on the FTSE 100; a higher oil price should mean higher profits. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says trader are ignoring concerns that the deal may not stick (especially if non-Opec members don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree their own cuts). Long-term apprehension surrounding the deal (and the potential for a pick-up in US shale production) will be thrown to the back of investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 minds as Brent regains a $52 handle and US Crude fast approaches $50 per barrel. How long can the post-deal rally last? Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal is bad news for motorists, as higher crude prices will swiftly lead to more expensive petrol. The front page of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Times declares that it could mean a litre of fuel costs 10p more, which swiftly adds up: Motorists face paying \u00c2\u00a35 more to fill up an average family car after a Saudi-led cartel struck a rare deal to boost the price of oil. Oil prices jumped by 8.9 per cent to $50.45 a barrel yesterday after the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec), which pumps a third of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil, agreed to limit output for the first time in eight years. Motoring groups warned that the agreement was likely to create an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unwelcome Christmas present\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for families by sharply pushing up prices on the forecourt. Petrol fell to 101p a litre in February after oil plunged to $27 a barrel as Iran increased production when sanctions were lifted. Some analysts now predict that oil could rise to $60 a barrel. According to estimates, this could push petrol to a two-year high of 123p a litre, from 114p today. The oil price has extended its gains this morning as the financial markets continue to digest Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s output cut deal. US crude oil smashed through $50 per barrel for the first time in a month this morning. Brent crude - oil sourced from the North Sea - jumped by another 1% to $52.73. Yesterday, oil surged by over 8% as it became clear that Opec had, for once, come up with a plan to tackle the oil glut. Traders are genuinely surprised that Opec members put their differences behind them in Vienna this week, and agreed to cut 1.2m barrels off their daily output, to 32.5m. Russia also caught the experts out; it is backing Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal by promising to trim its own output by 300,000 barrels per day. That means that non-Opec members may, as Opec hopes, chip in with a 600,000bpd reduction. Chris Weston of IG explains that this could give the deal extra teeth: The consensus was that we would get some sort of loose agreement from the collective that kept oil supported, but left the market asking many more questions. What we have seen however has been real meat on the bone, not just from gaining an understanding around production cut allocations from the more tricky OPEC members, including Iran and Iraq, but it seems Russia was so enthused by what they heard that they have increased their own production cut levels from 200,000 to 250,000 to 300,000 a day through the first half in 2017. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Opec members are still in celebratory mood after agreeing their first output cut in almost a decade. The oil cartel defied the sceptics yesterday, by announcing it would slash production by 1.2m barrels per day, in an attempt to tackle the glut of crude oil in the market. As we covered yesterday, this sent the oil price soaring - and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing further gains this morning. Analysts are now wondering if the deal will hold, and what it means for other producers, consumers, and the global economy. Also coming up today... Data firm Markit is publishing its latest manufacturing PMI reports, showing how factories around the globe fared last month. The big news overnight is that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector beat forecasts, expanding at its fastest rate in over four years. This may signal that China is, once again, relying on traditional smokestack \u00e2\u20ac\u0153industries\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd industries for growth, rather than transforming into a consumer-driven economy. We find out how Britain, and Europe, performed in the next couple of hours: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what to watch out for: 9am GMT: eurozone manufacturing PMI 9.30am GMT: UK manufacturing PMI 2.45pm GMT: US manufacturing PMI And there are also signs today that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing market is slowing. The Nationwide building society has reported that prices only rose by 0.1% in November, meaning prices were just 4.4% higher than a year ago.",

                "bodyText":"European stock markets are now closed, so let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wrap up: Financial markets are expecting higher inflation after a group of oil producers sealed their first joint production cut deal since 2001. Brent crude is trading at a 17-month high, up 3.6% or $2 per barrel at $56.27, after 11 non-Opec members including Russia agreed to cut their production by around 550,00 barrels per day. That commitment means Opec will now deliver the 1.2m bpd cut agreed at the end of November, potentially putting a floor under oil prices. However the move has also sparked a selloff in European government bonds, driving borrowing costs higher as investors anticipate a spike in consumer price inflation, and higher interest rates. UK 10-year bond yields hit 1.5% for the first time since March. Mihir Kapadia, CEO and Founder of Sun Global Investments, sum up the situation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The historic OPEC deal over the weekend has led to confidence in the market pushing up to a 5 % surge in Oil prices. Euro Zone government bond yields have risen significantly reflecting among other things an expectation of higher inflation. As Saudi Arabia made greater than expected cuts and non-OPEC countries agreed cuts of 558,000 barrels a day, oil prices peaked at a 17 month high with WTI trading at $54.2 and U.S. Brent rising 4.4% at $56.73 per barrel, steadily clawing out from the slump \u00e2\u20ac\u201c boosting oil stocks and Middle Eastern bonds among other assets. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been drama on Wall Street, where $4bn was wiped off Lockheed Martin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value in early trading after Donald Trump tweeted that its F-35 jets were too expensive. Investors rushed to sell Lockheed shares, as the defence firm rushed out a statement defending the cost of the project and offering to discuss it with the president-elect. Another sign that the president-elect can move the markets with a tweet. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been little progress in the frenzied push to recapitalise Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking sector. That could be a good sign -- Rome\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t given up persuading private investors from injecting fresh cash into Monte dei Paschi (MPS) Italian bank stocks have gained ground today, with MPS closing 3.7% higher tonight. Paolo Gentiloni is being sworn in as Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next prime minister today, so he should soon be able to crack on with tackling the situation. Sources in the Italian Treasury have said that they are prepared to bail out MPS if needed, but hope that the bank can raise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn from investors. A senior ECB policymaker has said the bank has never discussed resorting to helicopter money, in an attempt to stimulate the eurozone economy. Over in Paris, Christine Lagarde has faced judges over claims of negligence during her time as finance minister. And European stock markets have just closed after a fairly unimpressive day. In London the FTSE 100 shed 63 points, or almost 1%, to 6890. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly because the pound had a good day against the US dollar, up almost one cent (bad news for exporters). That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for tonight. Thanks for reading and commenting! GW True to her word, Christine Lagarde has not stayed silent - instead, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s told judges in Paris that she will fight the allegations that she was negligent by allowing the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac400m payment to Bernard Tapie in 2008. Lagarde told the court that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I would like to show you that I am in no way guilty of negligence, but rather that I acted in good faith with only the public interest in mind.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Was I negligent? No. And I will strive to convince you allegation by allegation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (thanks to Reuters for the quotes) Rupert Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempt to take over broadcaster Sky has taken an interesting twist, as my colleague Mark Sweney explains: Advisers on the transaction between Sky and Fox, which is expected to lodge an official bid later this week, are pursuing a so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153scheme of arrangement\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This tactic, which requires Sky to gain approval from investors representing 75% of the voting rights, will ensure that all shareholders against the deal are forced to sell once the threshold is reached. This would protect Murdoch from the unfortunate scenario where he finally claims his prize, but is left with a mutinous rump of investors who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sell their Sky shares. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full statement from Lockheed Martin, defending the cost of its F-35 fighters following Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism. [Lockheed Martin delivered Israel its first two F-35 jets today] My colleague Kim Willsher reports that Christine Lagarde isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t planning to keep silent during her trial: The president of the court asked Lagarde how she intended to defend herself and if she wished to exercise her right to remain silent. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have no intention of keeping silent, madame la presidente,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lagarde replied. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kim\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report: Christine Lagarde\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lawyer has urged the judges at the Plais de Justice to pause her trial for negligence during her time as French finance minister. Associated Press has the latest details from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s court hearing. International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde went on trial Monday in a Paris court, accused of negligence for allowing a huge handout to a well-connected businessman when she was in the French government. Poised and serious, Lagarde took notes as the judge summed up the years-long legal saga that led to charges against her charges she contests. A well-respected pioneer for women in leadership, Lagarde faces up to a year in prison if convicted. A lawyer for Lagarde, Patrick Maisonneuve, pleaded for a delay in the proceedings, arguing that it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make sense for her to face trial while a separate investigation in the broader case is still underway. It is unclear whether the judges will decide Monday on the appeal or adjourn for deliberations. The case revolves around a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac403m ($425 million) payout to tycoon Bernard Tapie in an arbitration deal in 2008 over the botched sale of sportswear maker Adidas in the 1990s, when Lagarde was finance minister. The amount of the award prompted indignation in France. Investigators suspect that the whole process was rigged in favor of Tapie, a business magnate with close connections with political circles, including then-President Nicolas Sarkozy. Civil courts have since quashed the unusually generous award, declared the arbitration process and deal fraudulent and ordered Tapie to pay the money back. Lagarde is accused of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153serious negligence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that allegedly allowed other people in the case to commit a suspected major misappropriation of public funds. Investigating judges say Lagarde committed a series of serious errors when she made the arbitration choice and also, later on, when she refused to challenge the deal, suggesting she may have been influenced by the political connections between Tapie and Sarkozy, according to court documents. Despite Lockheed Martin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problem, the S&amp;P 500 index has hit a fresh record high in early trading on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average has also hit a new high, and at 19,776 is getting close to the 20,000 mark. Energy companies are rallying on the back of the oil production cut deal agreed over the weekend. A Lockheed Martin executive has responded to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attack, insisting that the company has taken steps to cut the costs of its F-35 programme. Reuters has the details: Since the beginning, we have invested hundreds of millions of dollars to reduce the price of the airplane by about 70% since its original costing, and we project it to be about 85 million dollars in the 2019 or 2020 time frame\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, said Jeff Babione, Lockheed Martin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s F-35 programme leader. That hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stopped the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares falling by almos 5% in early trading, knocking almost $4bn off its value. The European Central Bank has never discussed flooding the eurozone with helicopter money. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to ECB board member Beno\u00c3\u00aet C\u00c5\u201cur\u00c3\u00a9, who has just completed an online Q&amp;A about monetary policy. Asked if the ECB could embrace helicopter funding (which means either a) handing the public money, or b) creating money to explicitly fund government spending), C\u00c5\u201cur\u00c3\u00a9 indicated that it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agenda. C\u00c5\u201cur\u00c3\u00a9 also defended the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to trim its QE programme to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60bn per month of new bond purchases, from April, even though it sees inflation below target in 2019. C\u00c5\u201cur\u00c3\u00a9 also argued that banks shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t grumble too much about record low interest rates -- ultraloose monetary policy does benefit them too: And he gets a bonus mark for playing this delivery too: The president-elect has done it again..... Shares in US defence firm Lockheed Martin are losing altitude in pre-market trading after Donald Trump tweeted that the F-35 fighter jet programme was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153out of control\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd/ Trump is promising to make big cuts once in office, which will wipe 2% off the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price when trading begins on Wall Street in 45 minutes. The F-35 Lightning II joint strike fighter is a stealth jet, designed and manufactured by Lockheed Martin in partnership with other defence firms. Last month the Pentagon awarded Lockheed Martin a $6.1bn contract to produce 57 F-35 stealth fighters -- the ninth batch, and 58% cheaper than the first order. Clearly not enough of a saving for Mr Trump.... The Russian rouble has leapt by 2%, after oil producers hammered out that deal to cut global output by 1.8m barrels per day. One US dollar now buys just 61.2 ruble, the lowest since October 2015 - before fears over Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy hammered the currency: Newsflash: Christine Lagarde has now arrived at the Paris courthouse where she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tried of allegations of negligence (as explained earlier). Security is tight outside the courthouse: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Patrick Maisonneuve, Lagarde lawyer: Officials representing Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors will head back to Athens tomorrow, in another attempt to complete the latest review of its bailout. European Commission officials say they hope to complete the work soon: But...the two sides still seem someway apart, with Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lenders demanding economic reforms to hit its bailout targets. And finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has warned creditors not to be too hardline, urging them to consider compromises. As Tsakalotos put it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Greek expression is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcput water into wine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not an expression I like, because I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like my wine watered down, but you know what I mean, to reach an honest compromise.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Caroline Connan has tweeted from inside France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cour de Justice, where the head of the IMF will face a special tribunal over the Tapie Affair today. Bloomberg also have a snappy summary of the case against Christine Lagarde: Basically, that Lagarde didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do enough to stop a payout to [businessman Bernard] Tapie. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accused of gross negligence in the use of public funds, a rarely used charge brought in cases where the evidence suggests the defendant didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t knowingly participate in activities to defraud the state. According to the indictment, Lagarde got at least two things wrong. First, she gave her go-ahead in October 2007 to the arbitration procedure even though the French investment agency, Agence des Participations de l\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Etat, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153repeatedly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd advised her against it. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also accused of waiving the right to appeal the arbitration decision even though she was told that a possible legal challenge was available.

You can post them on Twitter using the #AskECB hashtag. Italian bank shares are rallying this morning, on hopes that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new government can resolve the problem in its financial sector. UBI Banca, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fifth largest lender, has jumped by over 4% while Unicredit and Banco Populare di Milano have both gained over 2.5% And this is helping Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market to outperform the rest of Europe; Milan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB is the only index up today. The City is hoping that the appointment of Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, will create an opportunity to resolve the crisis. Lena Komileva of G+ Economics explains: Gentiloni\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appointment is expected to mean the current Finance Minister, Padoan, stays in his post to focus on resolving the banking sector. While Monte dei Paschi is teetering on the brink of a collapse, an interim technocratic government is more likely to take on the difficult political capital cost involved in plugging in the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capital gap, by bailing in retail shareholders, with the promise of some fiscal compensation after the next election. The fact that private investors are shunning Italian political risk after the Referendum means that onus lies with the interim government to ensure successful political containment and prevent Eurozone systemic risk. Thus, while investors will continue to dislike uncertainty, the political risk-rewards of a likely compromise with Monte dei Paschi shareholders in the next few weeks, together with the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own backstop mechanisms, means that the situation will likely be contained. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borrowing costs have hit their highest level in around 18 months, as the yield on US Treasury bills rises. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly due to the inflationary impact of the oil deal, and partly due to predictions that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates on Wednesday. Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 source at the Italian Treasury has given more details about how a state bailout of Monte dei Paschi might be handled: European government bonds are taking a bath this morning, amid fears that the deal to curb oil production will drive inflation higher. Prices are falling across the board, which pushes up the yield (or interest rate) on sovereign debt. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-year gilt yield hit 1.5% for the first time since May, up from 1.43% on Friday night. Most eurozone debt is also out of favour. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-year bond yield has hit 0.396%, up from 0.347% on Friday, while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-year yield has hit an 11-month high of 0.919%. And the gap between Italy and Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borrowing costs has widened to its widest level since February 2012 -- the heights of the eurozone debt crisis. Rising bond yields usually signify that the City is expecting higher inflation -- and thus demanding a higher rate of return when buying bonds. Reuters is reporting that Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government is prepared to recapitalise Monte dei Paschi if necessary - but still hopeful that private investors will stump up for the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn cash call. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the story: Italy is ready to pump capital into Monte dei Paschi di Siena if the ailing bank fails to get the money it needs to remain in business from investors, a Treasury source said on Monday. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third-biggest bank is pressing ahead with a plan to raise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn ($5.3 billion) on the market this year,despite political uncertainty in the country after a constitutional referendum triggered a government crisis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is confidence at the economy ministry that Monte dei Paschi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cash call can succeed. If the operation failed, the state would carry out a precautionary recapitalisation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the Treasury source said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s existence and its clients\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 savings will be preserved under any circumstances,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the source added. Last night, MPS reopened its debt-to-equity swap -- which would allow retail investors to convert their bonds into shares. That could help to hit its target of raising \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn in new capital. Over in Italy, shares in Monte dei Paschi (MPS) have jumped by 7.5% at the start of trading. The move came as EU economics commissioner Pierre Moscovici declared that Italy can tackle its banking problems without creating a new crisis. Moscovici was in best \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t panic!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd mode on France Info radio, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is not and there will not be a banking crisis in Italy, there will not be a European financial crisis coming from Italy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have the capacity to deal with the situation and it will be dealt with from both in Italy and at the European level.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still no word on whether private investors will provide MPS with a lifeline, or whether its cash call will fail. Shares in oil companies are jumping this morning as investors anticipate higher profits once the output cuts kick in. Royal Dutch Shell have jumped by 3%, while BP are up 2%. Smaller oil exploration and production are also benefiting, with Tullow Oil up 8% and Cairn Energy gaining 6%. City experts agree that the deal agreed by Opec and non-Opec members are significant. But some suspect that prices may not rise much higher, because America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shale industry has not made promised to make any cuts. Morgan Stanley say this the deal should \u00e2\u20ac\u0153add to bullish sentiment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the market, especially if producers actually comply with the cuts: FXTM Chief Market Strategist Hussein Sayed believes the oil price could push higher -- at which point US shale producers could easily return to the market. With 1.758 million barrels expected to be slashed out of the market, or about 2% of the global oil supply starting January 1, oil prices have more room to rally with Brent potentially crossing above $60 in the next couple of weeks. The market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focus will then switch to compliance with the agreement, and U.S. shale producers who are not a part of the agreement. U.S. rig counts rose by 21 last week to 498, the biggest increase since mid-2015, and the questions now becomes how fast will US shale ramp up production and at what level is it possible to cap the current rally? These production cuts show that Opec and non-Opec members are serious about putting a floor under the oil price, says Naeem Aslam of Think Markets. Saudi Arabia has shown a willingness to bring its oil production below the 10 million barrels a day mark. This is surely a sign that the country is serious about lowering the supply glut on the market. Moreover, this also shows that they are willing to do more than the non-OPEC countries to push the price of oil higher. Traders are also cheering the news that Russia is also going to cut its oil production by 300K barrels a day by May 2017. But Barclays believe prices will fall back during 2017. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are too many moving parts for OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new policy to be sustainable in the long term. The strategy is bound to overshoot, in our view, leading to lower prices in the second half of next year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The oil price is surging this morning, after energy producers hammered out a historic deal to cut output over the weekend. A group of 11 countries who are not part of the Opec cartel collectively agreed to cut output by 558,000 barrels per day, from January 1. That bolsters the production cuts agreed by Opec late last month; they are cutting 1.2m barrels per day in an attempt to cut the worldwide glut in oil and drive prices higher. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the first such deal between Opec and non-Opec members in 15 years. And in further drama, Saudi Arabia also signalled that it might be prepared to make deeper cuts, on top of what it initially pledged. Saudi Oil Minister Khalid al-Falih said after Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I can tell you with absolute certainty that effective January 1, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to cut and cut substantially to be below the level that we have committed to on November 30.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This is having a serious effect on oil this morning, driving Brent Crude and US Crude price to their highest level since last July. Brent, the benchmark for global oil price, is up 4.4% at $56.73 per barrel. Great news for Opec. But if prices stay at the levels, motorists can expect to pay more at the pump, and heating our homes might get pricier too.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Coming up today.... The battle to rescue Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks will continue this week, now that foreign minister Paolo Gentiloni has been chosen to replace Matteo Renzi as prime minister. Executives at Monte dei Paschi, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest bank, are making a final attempt to persuade private investors to back its \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn cash call. If they fail, the bank could soon find itself swept into a bail-in. From Rome, my colleague Stephanie Kirchgaessner reports: Executives at Monte dei Paschi of Siena (MPS) were fighting on Sunday night to salvage a multibillion-euro rescue by private investors in a frantic attempt to prop up the bank. In a statement released after a board meeting on Sunday, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest bank said it would forge ahead with a debt-for-equity swap offer for tens of thousands of retail investors. The offer still requires regulatory approval. If MPS manages to convince investors to go along with the plan, it would help it avoid a government bailout by Italy, which would have far-reaching economic and political consequences. A deal to prop up MPS was thrown into doubt last week after the European Central Bank (ECB) reportedly said it could not have more time to secure the private investment. MPS had sought an extension until 20 January. Also on the agenda: Investors are watching the oil price closely, after producers agreed an output deal over the weekend (more on that shortly). IMF chief Christine Lagarde is appearing before judges in Paris this afternoon, over charges relating to the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac400m payment made to businessman Bernard Tapie when she was French finance minister. Lagarde denies charges of negligence, but could potentially face up to a year in jail and a fine of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15,000 if convicted. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already pleaded her case on France 2 television, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Negligence is a non-intentional offence. I think we are all a bit negligent sometimes in our life. I have done my job as well as I could, within the limits of what I knew.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And traders are also counting down the hours until Wednesday afternoon, when America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank, the Federal Reserve, is widely expected to raise US interest rates. Fed chief Janet Yellen will also face a lot of questions about president-elect Donald Trump, we assume. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

Nevertheless, it can still improve its economic performance to ensure a continuing rise in incomes and employment within a stable macroeconomic environment. To this end, a comprehensive package of structural and fiscal reforms can raise low GDP growth and ensure the steady decline of public debt in the long term. Financial system stability needs to be maintained in a challenging environment. </p> <p> Austria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery has strengthened. In 2016, we project growth at 1.4 percent, an improvement over the average growth of 0.6 percent in 2012-15. Growth has been broad based, driven by private consumption supported by income tax reductions, a recovery in investment, and higher public consumption due to spending on refugees. At 1.4 percent y/y in October, inflation remains low, but is above the Euro Area average (0.5 percent). Employment growth has picked up in 2016, catching up with the rising labor supply driven by migration and higher labor force participation. As a result, unemployment has stabilized recently, although it remains elevated relative to historical levels...</p> <p>A reform package combining structural reforms with deficit-neutral fiscal measures could permanently boost potential GDP by some 3 percent over the medium term. Efficiency gains in public spending would create fiscal space for further growth-supporting policies and ensure the continued decline of public debt. Maintaining financial stability is a key component of a stable overall macroeconomic environment.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a6741389514cacfc0ca0c5af43f98e6073ab373\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a6741389514cacfc0ca0c5af43f98e6073ab373/0_117_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vienna.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vienna.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Heinz-Peter Bader/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-584ffca7e4b025760cee4680\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-13T13:56:25.185Z\">1.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">European shares move higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Time for a quick look at the European markets.</p> <p>The <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/13/italian-banking-crisis-unicredit-to-raise-13bn-euros\">moves by Italian bank Unicredit to bolster its balance sheet </a> </strong>have lifted the banking sector, while after the excitement of the Murdoch bid for Sky, Italian broadcaster Mediaset is also in demand after France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Vivendi said it planned to raise its 3% stake to as much as 20%.</p> <p>So the pan-European Stoxx 600 index is up 0.74% to an 11 month high.

Is it likely when around 45% of pensioners receive monthly payments below the poverty line of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac665, and almost four million people, that is more than a third of the population, have been classed as being at risk of poverty or social exclusion, that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main problem is that pensions and tax credit allowances are too generous?</p> <p>At the same time, the only reason why more people are exempt from paying income tax is that fewer people have decent incomes. So the IMF that is supposedly rethinking the relationship between development and inequality, and is rightly emphasizing the importance of inclusive growth, seems to be unaware that further reducing pensions and the tax credit allowance cannot but fail to increase both inequality and social exclusion. But at least then the numbers will add up.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>The Greek finance minister emphatically denied that Athens had agreed with the demand of its euro zone partners to pursue a primary surplus of 3.5% of GDP in the post-programme period.</strong></p> <p>Instead, he said the Greek government had offered a compromise solution when euro zone finance ministers held their last meeting on December 5th. <br> \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I laid out the position of the Greek government that high primary surpluses for an economy like Greece and what it has gone through during the crisis make no economic or political sense,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he insisted. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some member states were supporting the position that the 3.5% figure should be preserved for ten years; others were working towards a compromise of five years. The Greek position was that neither would work for Greece and we suggested the compromise of going down immediately to 2.5%, but agreeing with the institutions that the one percentage point reduction from 3.5% should be spent entirely on reducing taxes on small and medium sized enterprises, thus enhancing competitiveness and growth. What was the IMF response? The IMF argued within the Eurogroup that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter to us whether it is three, five or ten years of high surpluses, we will still need to see more measures to make the numbers add up since we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that 3.5% is achievable without such measures\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It did not bother to address our compromise suggestion.</p> <p>So Greece has not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153agreed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to anything yet. However, it is under intense pressure from its creditors to do so. The IMF has done little to alleviate that pressure. Instead of having the courage of its convictions and helping us reduce the size and/or the timespan of the surpluses, it is putting all the pressure on us to specify new austerity measures for 2019 and beyond.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Phew!</strong> And separately, the Athens government has just suggested that talks with its lenders over its bailout programme could be completed early next month.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/dgatopoulos/status/808626581669347332\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Govt Spokesman: Deal with bailout lenders could be in &#39;first few days of January&#39; - Athens still wants IMF in Program<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash\">#Greece</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bailout?src=hash\">#Bailout</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/C3yWKcHcD9\">pic.twitter.com/C3yWKcHcD9</a></p>&mdash; Derek Gatopoulos (@dgatopoulos) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dgatopoulos/status/808626581669347332\">December 13, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-12-13T11:52:06.150Z\">at 11.52am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-584fd7a6e4b077e9848506b6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-13T11:13:20.754Z\">11.13am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Rebecca Long-Bailey MP</strong>, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, is concerned that the cost of living in Britain jumped in November</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153This rise in inflation, following many independent forecasts expecting it to go up further while earnings are set to fall back in coming years, only continues to underline why Labour have been calling on the government to change direction and reverse their cuts to in-work benefits such as Universal Credit, and disabled people on ESA.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-584fd2dae4b0e02f2b16b9b1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-13T11:02:31.447Z\">11.02am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Nick Dixon, Investment Director at investment group Aegon, believes rising inflation will prompt the Bank of England to raise interest rates in 2017:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Low interest rates are reaching the end of the road.

Investors have turned positive ahead of the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expected interest rate increase on Wednesday, as the Santa rally continues. the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 78.15 points or 1.13% higher at 6968.57, its highest close since the end of October Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax added 0.84% to 11,284.65 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac climbed 0.91% to 4803.87 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB finished 2.49% higher at 18,827.61, with Unicredit up nearly 16% Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 1.58% better at 9331.3 But in Greece, as a row about its bailout continued, the Athens market dipped 0.1% to 639.71 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 105 points or 0.5% at 19.901. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Back with Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras and his visit to the island of Nisyros: The continuing rise in the US stock market ahead of Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve interest rate decision continues to drag Europe higher. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: There seems no stopping the Dow, as the headline index of US stocks lurches towards the 20,000 mark. The rally was supposed to start from the middle of the month, but with the Fed looming tomorrow, everyone seems keen to jam the index higher now, regardless of the consequences. In reality, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably look back on 2016 as the year when the Santa rally began in November; no one really thought Santa would be a US businessman and TV personality with a penchant for outrageous statements, but in this seventh year of the post-financial crisis rally, we really should be prepared for anything. Perhaps the post-Fed environment will be different, but those expecting a big slump before the end of the year should be prepared for disappointment (and frankly, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d spoil the festive mood anyway). Instead, the next two weeks will most likely see the market drift, before the real work begins anew in January. Meanwhile Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras has further racheted up the pressure by announcing economic relief measures for Greeks living on far flung Aegean isles. Helena Smith reports: Islands which have borne the brunt of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s refugee crisis will henceforth be exempt from a special VAT tax demanded by creditors keeping the country afloat, said Tsipras making the announcement during a flying visit to one of the isles. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Citizens on these islands must feel sure that the state is looking after them,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the leader said speaking from the tiny island of Nisyros this afternoon. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They are shouldering the burden of reception and hospitality and, ultimately, the entire burden of Europe.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The prime minister, who has already raised hackles announcing a one-off Christmas bonus for pensioners surviving on \u00e2\u201a\u00ac800 or less, said his leftist-led government would not buckle under pressure to rescind the measure. The supplement, he insisted, came from money saved. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will keep to the programme completely but we are not going to ask anyone about giving surplus money to those most in need.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Senior government sources said the IMF had repeatedly got it wrong when it came to Greece. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It has gone from being excessively optimistic when it participated [in the last rescue programme] precisely because it wanted to stress its viability to overly pessimistic precisely because it is not participating in it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said one. Emergency funding to Greek financial institutions from the central bank continues to fall, according to new figures. Assistance from the Bank of Greece fell by 2.8% or \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.3bn in November to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac45bn compared to the previous month. Ahead of the US rate decision on Wednesday - with the first hike in a year widely expected - Wall Street is on the front foot again. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has hit a new intra-day high of 19,915, although it has come off its best level to sit at 19901, up 105 points. The S&amp;P 500 has added 0.34% to a new high, while the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.37%. Back with Greece and the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s insistence it was not demanding more austerity. The eurozone appears very unhappy at the fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments, and called for the discussions over Greece not to be aired in public. Reuters reports: Euro zone officials hit back at the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday for publishing an article on the way forward for Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal and economic policy that thrust into the open a row between the lenders over Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bailout. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The European institutions were surprised that the IMF staff published a blog post on the ongoing negotiations with the Greek government as new talks in Athens are starting with the aim of concluding the second review,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said a spokesman for the euro zone bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We hope that we can return to the practice of conducting program negotiations with the Greek government in private.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The IMF article appeared as the Fund and the euro zone struggle to find common ground on Greek policies that would allow the IMF to take part in the latest bailout, the third one since 2010 and now fully financed by the euro zone. The IMF, which a group of countries led by Germany very much want to join the latest program for credibility reasons, says euro zone targets set for Greece are too ambitious and assumptions on reform implementation too optimistic. It said it was against further austerity in Greece and that a primary surplus target of 3.5 percent of GDP in 2018, on which the euro zone insists, risks damaging the nascent recovery. The head of the European Department Poul Thomsen and chief economist Maury Obstfeld said a Greek primary surplus of 1.5 percent in 2018 would be enough and stood a better chance of being sustained for several years. After its latest contribution to the Greek debt crisis, the IMF has also issued its latest thoughts on Austria. In its latest assessment of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s situation it said: Austria is stable and prosperous. Nevertheless, it can still improve its economic performance to ensure a continuing rise in incomes and employment within a stable macroeconomic environment. To this end, a comprehensive package of structural and fiscal reforms can raise low GDP growth and ensure the steady decline of public debt in the long term. Financial system stability needs to be maintained in a challenging environment. Austria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery has strengthened. In 2016, we project growth at 1.4 percent, an improvement over the average growth of 0.6 percent in 2012-15. Growth has been broad based, driven by private consumption supported by income tax reductions, a recovery in investment, and higher public consumption due to spending on refugees. At 1.4 percent y/y in October, inflation remains low, but is above the Euro Area average (0.5 percent). Employment growth has picked up in 2016, catching up with the rising labor supply driven by migration and higher labor force participation. As a result, unemployment has stabilized recently, although it remains elevated relative to historical levels... A reform package combining structural reforms with deficit-neutral fiscal measures could permanently boost potential GDP by some 3 percent over the medium term. Efficiency gains in public spending would create fiscal space for further growth-supporting policies and ensure the continued decline of public debt. Maintaining financial stability is a key component of a stable overall macroeconomic environment. Time for a quick look at the European markets. The moves by Italian bank Unicredit to bolster its balance sheet have lifted the banking sector, while after the excitement of the Murdoch bid for Sky, Italian broadcaster Mediaset is also in demand after France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Vivendi said it planned to raise its 3% stake to as much as 20%. So the pan-European Stoxx 600 index is up 0.74% to an 11 month high. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB is up 1.4%, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac have both climbed 0.51%. In the UK, the FTSE 100 is 0.6% better after stronger than expected UK inflation figures. Ahead of the expected US rate rise on Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is expected to open around 66 points higher. Shareholders in the Bank of Cyprus have overwhelmingly backed plans for a London listing. Some 99.74% have approved the move, which will see the bank keep its listing in Cyprus but abandon its quote on the Athens stock exchange. The bank said the standard listing in London was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a key milestone\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in its recovery since 2013. It added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A holding company has been established in Ireland in order for the Group to be considered eligible for inclusion in the FTSE UK Index Series following a step up to a premium listing at a future date.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It said the London listing would improve the liquidity of its stock and give it access to a wider range of investors capable of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153supporting the Bank in the long-term.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit, and Manos Giakoumis of analyst service Macropolis both sound pessimistic about the Greek bailout: Back in the UK, drivers for the Argos retail chain have called a 72-hour strike in a row over holiday pay. The industrial action could make it harder to get presents from Argos in time for Christmas: Our friends at The Telegraph have published a handy Q&amp;A on the Greek bailout saga, as relations between the various parties appear to deteriorate. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: Right now Greece and the EU have lined up an $86bn bailout, hoping that the IMF will join in. Germany in particular is keen to have the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seal of approval, as it is seen as a sign that the deal is rigorous. Much of the discussion currently focuses on the degree of fiscal tightening that can take place, as the IMF fears the EU is being too tough, while the EU thinks the IMF is too pessimistic over what can be achieved. Those talks will continue into the new year, rather than the IMF joining in 2016 as had been hoped in Brussels and Athens. A short-term deal has been agreed that cancels a planned rise in interest rates on Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debts, and aims to guarantee the current low cost of funds for years to come. But the underlying economy is still in a dire shape - unemployment is above 23pc, and sustained GDP growth remains elusive. In the longer term, the IMF wants major reforms to the Greek economy. This new war of words between Greece and the IMF suggests that the Greek debt crisis, rarely dormant for long, is flaring back into life again. The Wall Street Journal suggests today that early elections are a possibility, if Athens and its creditors cannot agree on what measure to take to ensure Greece is complying with its bailout. The WSJ says: The embattled prime minister Alexis Tsipras, who is due to hold talks with the leaders of Germany and France in the coming days, surprised Greeks and creditors last week with fiscal gifts that were widely seen as preparing the option of elections. He promised 1.6 million pensioners a Christmas bonus of between \u00e2\u201a\u00ac300 ($319) and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac800. He also suspended a planned increase in sales tax for Aegean islands that have received large numbers of Middle-East refugees. EU officials said they would study whether Mr. Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promises are compatible with Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout commitments. Snap elections next year would lead to Syriza\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defeat, party officials expect, and a new government led by the conservative New Democracy party. Syriza officials say their goal in possible elections would be to avoid being crushed\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhich they view as a danger if they hold on too long without concessions from creditors. Gabriel Sterne of Oxford Economics flags up how Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to boost tax receipts have backfired spectacularly since its first bailout: The European Commission has also been defending itself from the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism of the Greek bailout: Breaking away from UK inflation, because Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister has got in touch with us. Euclid Tsakalotos isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happy with the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim last night that it hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been forcing more austerity on Greece. [As explained earlier, the Fund says it shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be blamed for asking if the targets agreed between Greece and the rest of Europe are credible] Tsakalotos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments come as monitors arrive in Athens for fresh talks about the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout programme. From Athens, Helena Smith reports: Greece is being boxed into a corner and the International Monetary Fund is economizing with the truth when it says it is not asking for more austerity but rather is the victim of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bizarre predilection to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153agree\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to higher primary fiscal targets of 3.5% of GDP. That is the verdict of Euclid Tsakalotos, the Greek finance minister who in exclusive comments to the Guardian this morning responded witheringly to the Washington-based body\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assertion that Athens will need to make yet more pension and tax cuts after its bailout programme expires in mid-2018 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a demand that no government, after seven years of relentless recession, could accept or survive. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Oxford philosopher J L Austen was particularly critical of forms of argument that relied on the following technique: there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the bit where you say it, and then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the bit where you take it back. The IMF is particularly open to this criticism,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tsakalotos told me. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In effect it is arguing for Greek pensioners and poorer wage earners to make further economies, while it economizes on the truth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Oxford-educated economist, who was raised in Britain, said in its obsession to make the numbers add up the IMF was now advocating policies that would increase inequality and social exclusion \u00e2\u20ac\u201c contradicting its own self-avowed goal of emphasising the importance of inclusive growth. In their blog overnight, the Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Europe director Poul Thomsen and chief economic counsellor Maurice Obstfeld argued that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greece cannot modernize its economy by boosting funding for infrastructure and well-targeted social programs while exempting more than half of households from income taxes and paying public pensions at the level of the richest European countries.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tsakalotos disputes this claim, arguing that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greek expenditure on both pensions and other subsidies is about 70% of the EU average and 52% of that of Germany. Is it likely when around 45% of pensioners receive monthly payments below the poverty line of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac665, and almost four million people, that is more than a third of the population, have been classed as being at risk of poverty or social exclusion, that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main problem is that pensions and tax credit allowances are too generous? At the same time, the only reason why more people are exempt from paying income tax is that fewer people have decent incomes. So the IMF that is supposedly rethinking the relationship between development and inequality, and is rightly emphasizing the importance of inclusive growth, seems to be unaware that further reducing pensions and the tax credit allowance cannot but fail to increase both inequality and social exclusion. But at least then the numbers will add up.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Greek finance minister emphatically denied that Athens had agreed with the demand of its euro zone partners to pursue a primary surplus of 3.5% of GDP in the post-programme period. Instead, he said the Greek government had offered a compromise solution when euro zone finance ministers held their last meeting on December 5th. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I laid out the position of the Greek government that high primary surpluses for an economy like Greece and what it has gone through during the crisis make no economic or political sense,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he insisted. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some member states were supporting the position that the 3.5% figure should be preserved for ten years; others were working towards a compromise of five years. The Greek position was that neither would work for Greece and we suggested the compromise of going down immediately to 2.5%, but agreeing with the institutions that the one percentage point reduction from 3.5% should be spent entirely on reducing taxes on small and medium sized enterprises, thus enhancing competitiveness and growth. What was the IMF response? The IMF argued within the Eurogroup that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter to us whether it is three, five or ten years of high surpluses, we will still need to see more measures to make the numbers add up since we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that 3.5% is achievable without such measures\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It did not bother to address our compromise suggestion. So Greece has not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153agreed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to anything yet. However, it is under intense pressure from its creditors to do so. The IMF has done little to alleviate that pressure. Instead of having the courage of its convictions and helping us reduce the size and/or the timespan of the surpluses, it is putting all the pressure on us to specify new austerity measures for 2019 and beyond.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Phew! And separately, the Athens government has just suggested that talks with its lenders over its bailout programme could be completed early next month. Rebecca Long-Bailey MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, is concerned that the cost of living in Britain jumped in November \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This rise in inflation, following many independent forecasts expecting it to go up further while earnings are set to fall back in coming years, only continues to underline why Labour have been calling on the government to change direction and reverse their cuts to in-work benefits such as Universal Credit, and disabled people on ESA. Nick Dixon, Investment Director at investment group Aegon, believes rising inflation will prompt the Bank of England to raise interest rates in 2017: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Low interest rates are reaching the end of the road. Inflation is now on the rise and sentiment amongst monetary policy makers is hardening in the UK and US. With expectations that UK inflation will exceed its 2% target in early 2017, we can expect monetary belt tightening during the next 6-9 months. Whilst savers will cheer signals that interest rates will follow suit, mortgage holders are already starting to see the best rates disappear and may want to speak to their adviser about fixing rates quicker than the Bank can make its move.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd You can see the full inflation report here. Andrew Sentance, PwC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, says Britain is now feeling the effect of the plunge in the pound since the Brexit vote. And further price rises are on the horizon, he warns: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Inflation is picking up as expected - to its highest level for over two years. Prices in the shops and on the garage forecourt are starting to reflect the big drop in sterling since the EU referendum result. Clothing prices have risen by over 4% since June and motor fuel prices are 7.4% up on a year ago. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is more inflation coming through the pipeline. The prices of UK manufactures are already 2.3% up on a year ago and the cost of raw materials, energy and other inputs into the manufacturing process are nearly 13% higher than a year ago. We should therefore expect inflation to rise to close to 3% by the end of next year, which will squeeze consumer spending and slow economic growth. We are leaving behind the very favourable world of near-zero inflation which has benefited consumers over the past couple of years. Digging into the inflation report, the ONS points out that some tech firms have been hiking their price because of the weak pound. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key section: Recreation and culture: Prices, overall, increased by 0.5% between October and November 2016, compared with a negligible change a year ago. The upward effect came principally from data processing equipment where prices rose this year but fell a year ago, particularly for peripherals. There have been reports from some IT equipment manufacturers over the last few months of prices being affected by changes in the exchange rate with products generally being priced in US dollars. The ONS is is absolutely right - Apple raised the prices of several MacBook pros by hundreds of pounds in October, for example. The report also contains the surprising news that leather sofas have got pricier: Clothing and footwear: the upward effect came mainly from clothing (in particular women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outerwear) for which prices, overall, increased by 1.6% between October and November this year, compared with a fall of 0.1% between the same 2 months a year ago. Furniture, household equipment and maintenance: Prices, overall, increased by 0.5% between October and November 2016, compared with a fall of 0.2% a year ago. Within this group, the largest contribution to the change in the rate came from prices for furniture and furnishings, particularly leather settees. There was also an upward contribution from non-durable household goods such as household cleaner cream and bleach. Transport: The upward contribution to the change in the rate came from motor fuels, with petrol prices rising by 1.6 pence per litre between October and November this year but falling by 1.5 pence per litre a year ago. Similarly diesel prices rose by 2.0 pence this year but fell by 0.6 pence a year ago. Fuel prices tend to reflect movements in oil prices and part of the increase in oil prices during 2016 to date can be explained by depreciation of sterling against the US dollar. Food and non-alcoholic beverages: Prices, overall, increased by 0.4% this year compared with 0.1% a year ago leading to a small upward contribution to the change in the rate. The main upward effects came from: bread and cereal products such as garlic bread and pizza; and milk, cheese and eggs, particularly milk and yoghurt/fromage frais. These were partly offset by a small downward effect from confectionery. The ONS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of inflation Mike Prestwood, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slight rally in the value of sterling eased the inflationary pressure on businesses importing raw materials but consumer prices continued to edge upwards, due mainly to the rising cost of clothing and fuel.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at city firmi Xtrade, also fears that British households face difficult times: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Inflation has soared to a 25-month high as Brexit uncertainties and sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s devaluation continue to filter through the UK economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These latest figures are expected to limit the buoyant consumer spending which has accounted for the resilience in growth since June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum. Meanwhile, the increasing weakness of the Brexit-hit pound is likely to provide households with a painful few months as rising prices take their toll. The pound has risen almost half a cent since the inflation data was released, to $1.2718. Tom Stevenson, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International, warns that inflation appears to be heading over the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target: Higher inflation means the pound in your pocket won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stretch as far and many will be thinking how they can make their money work harder. There is little evidence so far that rising inflation will translate into much higher interest rates, so anyone with savings still sitting in cash will struggle to generate real returns. To stand any chance of achieving an inflation-adjusted real return they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need to look further up the risk spectrum, investing in bonds issued by companies rather than the Government or moving into stocks and shares. The jump in inflation last month may show that the slump in the pound since the EU referendum is now hitting families. Hannah Maundrell of money.co.uk says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwake-up call\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Household finances have been protected against the backlash of Brexit so far but today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s higher than expected figures show it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finally starting to bite. This is the start of things to come and next year we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be battling rising prices head on. This will get worse mid-way through the year as retailer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forward pricing starts to run out and we have to foot the bill for the real cost of purchases. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is an important wake up call and one we should all bear in mind as we head towards the most expensive time of the year. Blow your budget on Christmas now and you could be setting yourself up for a very difficult year ahead. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no better argument for keeping tabs on your festive spending and only celebrating with cash you can afford to part with.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Duncan Weldon of the Resolution Group shows how the cost of consumer goods is now rising, for the first time in two years: Separate data from Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factories shows that their output costs (what they charge for their wares) jumped by 2.2% in November. That may drive inflation higher, once those goods hit the shops. Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Jamie McGeever says it will erode real earnings: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccore consumer prices index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rate, which strips out volatile items like energy and food, has risen to 1.4%. That suggests that underlying price pressures are building. At 1.2%, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate is heading back towards the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target: Almost every category of goods and services pushed the inflation rate up: On a monthly basis, the consumer prices index rose by 0.2% between October and November - with clothing and food prices up during the month. Higher petrol and diesel costs, and a fall in food price deflation, drove UK inflation up last month. The Office for National Statistics says: Rises in the prices of clothing, motor fuels and a variety of recreational and cultural goods and services, most notably data processing equipment, were the main contributors to the increase in the rate. These upward pressures were partially offset by falls in air and sea fares. Breaking! Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate has jumped to 1.2% in November, up from 0.9% in October. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the highest level since October 2014, and more than economists had expected. More to follow... Milan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is giving Unicredit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan a thumbs-up - shares in the bank are now up 7%. The pound is flat this morning, at $1.2685 against the US dollar, but that could change once November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation figures hit the wires at 9.30am. Kathleen Brooks of City Index explains what traders will be looking for: CPI data out later this morning is worth watching for a couple of reasons, it is expected to rise to 1.1%, which would be the fastest pace of price growth for 2 years, this comes at an interesting time for sterling as the market ponders another leg higher in its recovery. Prices are expected to resume their upward trend after a 0.1% decline in October. Fuel price increases and a reduction in food price deflation is likely to drive CPI higher in November. The one-off factors that weighed on October prices, such as the large drop in clothing sales, are unlikely to be repeated in November. A jump in inflation could trigger concerns that consumers will rein in their spending, she adds. Rising prices could also raise questions about the future for UK consumption, a key pillar of GDP growth. Retail sales have held up well in the last few months as consumers brush off Brexit-uncertainty. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial markets are rather subdued ahead of November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation data, in just under 30 minutes. Defensive stocks, such as consumer good firms, are in favour. The FTSE 100 has risen by 14 points, led by fashion chain Burberry (up 2.7%), with Unilever (+1.6%) also making ground. Italian bank shares are rising, as Unicredit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turnaround plan creates a little more confidence that the sector can get over its problems. Shares in Monte dei Paschi have gained 1.4%, as traders watch to see if it can get its own cash call, of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn, out of the door soon. UniCredit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revamp is a key moment in Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bank crisis, says Reuters columnist Neil Unmack: A cost cull, bad debt purge and mega-cash call mean the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest bank should soon be less of a worry. With Rome facing a volatile 2017, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just as well. Investors may need persuading to back such a huge rights issue, at a time of political uncertainty, he adds. They may conclude that the growth forecasts underpinning the plan are too optimistic. But still: [CEO Jean-Pierre] Mustier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan is robust enough, and healthier bigger lenders could mean more options for smaller ones. Assuming Europe can muddle through, UniCredit shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to. After falling 4% at the start of trading, Unicredit shares are now up almost 3% as investors digest its restructuring plan. Unicredit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rescue plan also involves purging itself of almost \u00e2\u201a\u00ac18 of bad debt. It plans to bundle these non-performing loans into new securities that will be sold off to investors. And it is booking an \u00e2\u201a\u00ac8.1bn provision against losses on bad loans, taking its total charge to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac12.2bn (which is why it needs to hold a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn rights issue to raise new funds from shareholders) Banking analyst Benjie Creelan-Sandford of Jefferies says Unicredit has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gone aggressive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with the restructuring plan announced today. Creelan-Sandford explains: Unicredit has announced a a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn rights issue, much of which will be consumed by writedowns and restructuring charges. The upfront bill of a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn is clearly large but as we have highlighted previously we think an aggressive balance sheet clean-up paves the way for a more substantial re-rating. The aggressive cost reduction is to be supported by substantial IT investment while the bank envisages net headcount reduction of 14,000 people by 2019 (equivalent to over 11% Group headcount). Speaking of banks... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government has just sold another tranche of Lloyds Banking Group shares. This takes its stake below 7% - eight years after Lloyds (and Royal Bank of Scotland) were bailed out. The race to fend off a crisis in Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking sector has taken a decisive shift this morning, as the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest lender unveiled a wide-ranging restructuring plan. Unicredit will raise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn by issuing new shares to investors, clean up the bad debts on its balance sheet and attempt to boost long-term productivity. It is also planning to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153transform\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd its operating model and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153streamline\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd its products and services, to cut costs. And that means cutting jobs too -- Unicredit is announcing another 6,500 job cuts today, which means 14,000 staff will have been culled by 2019. CEO Jean Pierre Mustier, calls it a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pragmatic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd plan, that will tackle its exposure to non-performing loans - the bad debts that have build up over many years and never been tackled. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are taking decisive actions to deal with our NPE legacy issues to improve and support recurring future profitability to become one of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most attractive banks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some instant reaction: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Is inflation back? We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find out at 9.30am GMT when new cost of living data is released. Economists predict that the consumer prices index (CPI) rose to 1.1% in November, up from October, partly due to rising petrol and food prices. If so, that would suggest that the weak pound is now feeding through to consumers, by pushing up import costs. A month ago, UK inflation surprisingly dipped, but analysts at RBC Capital Markets believe CPI will bounce back today: Last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unexpected dip back below 1% y/y on the headline CPI measure had a lot to do with the negative contribution from the clothing and footwear sector. The arithmetic suggests the hurdle is low for somewhat of a reversal this month. Furthermore, it looks likely that petrol prices will also add to the headline annual inflation rate. With oil producers now working together to stem supply, petrol prices are probably heading higher too..... Also coming up today Unicredit, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest bank, is announcing plans to restructure itself and raise billions in new capital. The plan is being unveiled as Rome continues pushing for private investors to rescue Monte dei Paschi, its oldest bank. more on that shortly. Things are hotting up in Greece too, after the International Monetary Fund denied it was forcing more austerity on Athens. In a new blogpost last night,top officials warned that the Greece was not implementing the right sort of policies that would actually lead to growth. In a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blame us!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd moment, Poul Thomsen, director of the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European department, and Maurice Obstfeld, the fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, wrote: It is not the IMF that is demanding more austerity, either now or as a means to lower the need for debt relief over the medium-term. Or to be more direct, if Greece agrees with its European partners on ambitious fiscal targets, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t criticize the IMF for being the ones insisting on austerity when we ask to see the measures required to make such targets credible. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll watch out for reaction to that, plus all the other key events through the day...",

As prime minister Alexis Tsipras prepares to meet his French and German counterparts later this week, speculation is mounting that he will ask the organisation to withdraw from the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current bailout program. Helena Smith reports from the Greek capital:</p> <blockquote> <p>Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relations with the IMF were never easy. The Washington-based institution has long been blamed fore the gruelling austerity visited on Greeks even when it wholeheartedly endorsed the cause of debt relief. But the latest spat may be a spat too far. Sources close to the Greek prime minister say in the wake of the fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to go public with its views \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in a blog penned this week by IMF European director Poul Thomsen and chief economist Maruice Obstfeld \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Tsipras will propose that the organisation abstains altogether from the bailout programme currently keeping the country afloat. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Fund has never officially joined this programme and we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really need it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said one. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At most it could be reduced to a technical, consultative role.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd </p> <p>The leftist leader, who on Tuesday blasted the body for being staffed by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153irrational technocrats,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is said to be incensed that it is now asking for more pension and tax cuts once the programme expires in 2018. Far too often, he said, the IMF had got it wrong with assessments that either over-estimated or under-estimated the impact of recessionary policies on Greece. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44dbfa8f15cc450f71670ad164171fa390fce696\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44dbfa8f15cc450f71670ad164171fa390fce696/0_203_6016_3610/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tsipras visits the island of Nisyros on Tuesday\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tsipras visits the island of Nisyros on Tuesday</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrea Bonetti/PM office Andrea Bonetti</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>In the blog, Thomsen and Obstfeld sought to clarify what they described as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153misinformation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd surrounding the Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role in Greece insisting that far from advocating more austerity the organisation wanted less.

                "bodyText":"We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve waited a whole year for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. And when the big day arrived, the shock result of last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US presidential election rather overshadowed it. So what did we learn? 1) Fed chair Janet Yellen insisted that the US economy was in decent shape, as America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank delivered its first hike in borrowing costs since December 2015. She said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our decision to raise rates should certainly be understood as a reflection of the confidence we have in the progress the economy has made and our judgment that that progress will continue. It is a vote of confidence in the economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But this sunny view didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t last long, with Yellen admitting during the press conference that the Fed was operating under a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccloud of uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, until it knows more about what Donald Trump will do. 2) In the nicest way possible, Yellen indicated that the labour market was doing fine, thanks, without Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan for a $1 trillion infrastructure plan. She said: There may be some additional slack in labor markets, but I would judge that the degree of slack has diminished. So I would say at this point that fiscal policy is not obviously needed to provide stimulus to help us get back to full employment. But nevertheless let me be careful that I am not trying to provide advice to the new administration or to Congress as to what is the appropriate stance for policy. There are many considerations that Congress needs to take account of and many bases for justifying changing fiscal policy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 3) Fed press conferences can be quite dry affairs, but Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most stirring moment came as she defended recent regulations brought in since 2008. Asked about Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to roll back these rules, Yellen reminded us that Dodd-Frank was introduced to avoid another \u00e2\u20ac\u0153devastating financial crisis\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I would say it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very important not to roll back. There maybe some changes that could be made and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve suggested a few, like eliminating the burden of compliance with the Volcker rule or incentive compensation regulations for smaller banks or modestly raising the threshold for banks that are subject to enhanced credential supervision. But I would urge that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to keep this in place.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 4) Yellen found herself in Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crosshairs several times during the election campaign, but she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not planning on quitting the Fed earlier. Asked about her own future, the Fed chair indicated she was going nowhere until her first term expires in 2008: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I do intend to serve out my four-year term. I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t made any decision about the future. I recognize I might or might not be reappointed. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a decision I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to make and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have thoughts on at this time. As you said I recognize too thatI could stay on as a board member, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a decision for another day.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 5) Markets react, despite Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s calming words. Janet Yellen took some pains to insist that the Fed hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t radically changed its approach, even though it now expects an extra rate hike next year (three, not two). This is a very modest adjustment in the path of the fed funds rate, and involves changes by only some of the participants. But with shares down, and the dollar rallying, investors may have concluded that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election win changes the monetary policy landscape. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little more reaction: And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all from us after a busy day on both sides of the Atlantic. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow for more Fed reaction, the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final policy meeting of 2016, and possibly more bailout drama in Greece. Goodnight, and thanks for reading and commenting. GW You can take off the Dow 20,000 hats, folks. The US stock market has closed in the red, with the Dow Jones index shedding 0.6% to finish at 19,792, a drop of around 118 points. The wider S&amp;P 500 lost 0.8%, while the Nasdaq handed back 0.5%. That shows that the Fed was more hawkish than Wall Street expected, or wanted. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wall Street correspondent Rupert Neate on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s developments: The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised interest rates for the first time in a year, and only the second time since the 2008 financial crisis. The US central bank also predicted three further rates increase in 2017, up from previous expectations of two rate hikes. Janet Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153growth is a touch stronger, unemployment is a shade lower\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as she announced a 0.25% increase in the benchmark rate to 0.50-0.75%. It is the first time rates have been raised since December 2015 when the benchmark rate was lifted from near-zero for seven years since the crisis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My colleagues and I are recognizing the considerable progress the economy has made towards our dual objectives of maximum employment and price stability,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yellen said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We expect that the economy will continue to perform well, with the job market strengthening further, and inflation rising to 2% over the next couple of years.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Capital Economics are even more bullish than the Fed, and expects FOUR interest rate rises next year. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly due to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans for a fiscal stimulus package (even though Yellen argues that the labour market doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need the extra help). Capital Economics analysts say: As universally expected, the Fed today raised interest rates for the second time in this economic cycle, with that hike coming a full year after the first increase and more than seven years after the current expansion began. With the economy much closer to full employment now and a strong likelihood of a fiscal stimulus next year, however, we expect the Fed to accelerate the pace of tightening next year, with one rate hike in the first half of next year followed by three in the second half. Dean Turner, Economist at UBS Wealth Management, says we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t underestimate the importance of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate hike: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While this was universally expected, we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget that this is still a big milestone. It marks only the second interest rate increase in a decade from the Fed. The Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anticipation of a faster pace of hikes (three next year vs two previously) and the nudge up in the long-run rate forecast to 3% shows that confidence in the growth outlook is increasing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Investors are also dumping US government debt, sending the interest rate (or yield) on Treasury bills higher. Yields rise when prices fall, so traders are concluding that the Fed was more hawkish about monetary policy than expected (because it now expects three rate rises next year, up from 2 in September) I\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdll post a snap summary of Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference next. In the meantime, shares have fallen on Wall Street over the last 90 minutes as investors digest the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate hike and guidance for 2017. All the main indices are in the red, which means anyone hoping to see the Dow Jones smash through 20,000 points today will be disappointed. The dollar continues to rally, though, as traders react to the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecast for three rate hikes in 2017. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up one whole cent against the euro, which has dropped to $1.052. And finally, we get another question about the US election... Q: Many people are angry about the economy, even though the aggregate performance levels seem pretty good. So are you reevaluating how you see the economy? Yellen says she has long been worried about income inequality, wealth inequality, and the fact that many families haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen real wage gains. These are long-standing concerns. These are not new phenomenons, but the recession was very severe and probably exacerbated them. And the Fed chair insists that central bankers can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t solve these problems -- this is one for politicians. Our policies can affect the overall levels of economic activity, the inflation rate, but policymakers must be alert to these issues, she adds. Yellen then singles out the unemployment level among black and African American workers is higher than the average, before ending the press conference and heading to the door. Q: virtually every economist expected a rate rise today - does the Fed need that level of certainty before taking the plunge? Yellen says this is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not a prerequisite\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Q: You have been criticised by Donald Trump several times, so are you still planning to serve your full term, and would you like a second term? Yellen must have known this would come up; and, smiling politely, she says she would still like to serve her full term (it expires in 2018). She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not considered if she would like a second term, and if she would still serve on the Fed board otherwise. I recognise that I may or may not be reappointed as Fed chair, Yellen adds. Q: Did you discuss Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic plans at this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, and the effect that his victory has had on the financial markets? Yellen reveals that the FOMC did indeed talk about this. All the participants agreed there was considerable uncertainty about how economic policies will change, she says, adding: We are operating under a cloud of uncertainty at the moment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The next question is also about Donald Trump, and his pledge to scrap some financial regulation, such as the Volcker Rule (which stops banks making riskier bets with their own money). Yellen launches a strong defence of the measures taken in recent years, saying: We lived through a devastating financial crisis that took a huge impact on our economy. Most policymakers came away from that crisis thinking we must take steps to avoid a repeat, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I feel we have done that\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, she adds. Q: What do you think about Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweeting, and his attacks on individual companies? (such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin)? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not about to offer the president-elect advice, says Yellen. But she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not rolling over either, saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a strong believer in the independence of the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Q: Why is it riskier to run \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 fiscal policy to strengthen the economy and drag more people into the labour market, rather than relying on monetary policy? [Another question about Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s infrastructure spending ideas] Yellen insists that she has never favoured \u00e2\u20ac\u0153running a high-pressure economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Asked again about potential tax and spending changes, Janet Yellen says that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no obvious need to change fiscal policy to get America back to full employment. But she insists that she is not trying to provide advice to the new administration, or to Congress. Some snap reaction to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference. This is from Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ed Conway: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Meg Greene, economist at Manulife: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Neil Irwin of the New York Times: Q: What will today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate hike, and three more rate rises in 2017, mean for US families? Yellen says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate rise reflects the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confidence in the economic recovery. The economy has been remarkable resilient, she says, adding: It is a vote of confidence in the economy. Households and firms will see very modest changes from this decision, she says. Q: Would tax cuts boost the productivity of the US economy? And how would the Fed react to new policies that improve productivity growth, or didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t? Yellen says policies that boost education, improve the quality of capital, or encourage innovative new companies would all boost the productive potential of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. Q: Do would you have to raise rates faster if we saw fiscal policies that do not improve productivity? Yellen won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speculate about potential policy changes. Onto questions: Q: Why is the Fed now expecting three interest rate rises, not two? Is it because of the economy, or because of Donald Trump? Fed chair Yellen says there is only a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very modest change\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the forecasts, with only a couple of policymakers changing their view (by moving their dot on that chart I showed earlier) Looking ahead, Yellen expects that the US economy will only warrant \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gradual rate increases\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. And then she touches on politics, saying that: Changes in fiscal policy, or other policies, could potentially affect the economic outlook. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a coded reference to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans for an infrastructure spending boost once he takes office. Yellen rattles through the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest economic projections, before concluding that they are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very similar\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ones. GDP growth is a touch stronger, unemployment is a shade lower, and inflation is unchanged, she declares. Over the past seven years, since the depths of the US recession, 15 million new jobs have been created, the Fed chair tells reporters. On inflation, Yellen reminds us that consumer prices rose by an annual rate of 1.5% in October, up more than one percentage point over the last year. And core inflation (excluding fuel and food) came in at 1.75%.. Janet Yellen begins by confirming that the Fed raised interest rates by a quarter point today, to 0.5%-0.75%. She says that 2.25 million net new jobs have been created in the last 12 months, the labour market has improved, and inflation has moved closer to the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target. We expect the economy will continue to perform well, she adds. Janet Yellen has just arrived at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference, to explain why the Fed has raised interest rates today. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a live feed (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also added it to the top of this liveblog) Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans for an aggressive fiscal spending plan have forced the Fed to predict faster rate hikes next year. So argues Lee Ferridge of State Street Global Advisors: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As widely expected the FOMC delivered the second rate hike in this cycle, precisely 12 months after its first move. However, in a major surprise it increased its expectations for the likely rate path in 2017 to three hikes rather than the two forecast following its September update. It seems that in light of the forthcoming Trump fiscal stimulus plan and, signs of both rising price pressures and inflation expectations (helped by the recent OPEC decision to cut oil output) the Fed felt that it needs to adopt a more aggressive rate hiking path. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate hike is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vote of confidence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the US economy. But she also cautions that the economic outlook is still \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfinely balanced\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: Though unemployment is at a nine year low, wages and the participation rate have recently come in flat, which should give some reason for caution. The economy is not yet firing on all cylinders. This trend will likely be observed closely in the New Year, particularly if inflation continues to run below its 2% target, and we might expect Yellen to look for more sustainable labour market improvements before further rises. Ian Kernohan, Economist at Royal London Asset Management, expects the Fed to tread cautiously, until Donald Trump has made his tax and spending plans clearer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed rate hike was long anticipated, so there was no surprise when it came. Attention will now turn to the outlook for monetary policy in 2017. We do expect a sizeable fiscal stimulus to be announced next year; however the size and shape of that package may not be visible for some time. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As a consequence, we expect the Fed to remain cautious on the pace of rate hikes, at least in the first half of next year. The post-election rise in the dollar and bond yields also adds weight to arguments for a cautious approach.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some snap reaction to the decision, starting with Michelle Jamrisko of Bloomberg who remembers how the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts were wrong last year: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new dot plot - showing where its policymakers expect interest rates to be over the next few years: As you can see, a majority of policymakers expect three rate rises in 2017 (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the widest collection of dots in the second column). There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more uncertainty about 2018 and 2019 (which is why the dots are more scattered). Note that one policymaker expects only one rate hike next year, and none in 2018 and 2019! (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the lonely dot that lags behind the rest). The dollar has strengthened, after the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdot plots\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 predicted three rate hikes in 2017. It has gained 0.6% against the euro, meaning \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1 is now worth $1.056, down from $1.062. Shares moved wildly on Wall Street as the Fed decision hit the wires, but things quickly calmed down. The Dow Jones Industrial Average nearly hit 20,000 points, but is now up just 0.12% at 19,936. The Federal Reserve says it has raised borrowing costs because the US economy has continued to strengthen. In today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement (online here), it explains: Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in November indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace since mid-year. Job gains have been solid in recent months and the unemployment rate has declined. The Fed is also confident that the recovery will continue, taking inflation back to its target: The Committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further. Inflation is expected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, it adds. IMPORTANT: The Federal Reserve is also predicting that it will raise interest rates three times in 2017. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from the two rate hikes expected back in September. BREAKING: The US Federal Reserve has voted to raise American interest rates for the first time this year, and only the second time in a decade. Borrowing costs are going up by a quarter-point, to 0.5%-0.75%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what Wall Street expected, and shows that the Fed is confident that the labour market is in solid shape. More to follow.... Just 15 minutes to go, until we get the most eagerly anticipated Fed decision of the year. Michael Scanlon, managing director of Manulife Asset Management, agrees that the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guidance on interest rate policy will be crucial today. He says (via Reuters): The most important thing that investors will be looking atis the interpretation of the commentary from the Fed. I think the market is pricing in about two hikes for 2017 but if the Trump administration is able to reduce corporate taxes, I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be surprised to see four hikes next year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Colin Cieszynski of CNC Markets predicts that the Fed will be cautious about future rate hikes: The big question on everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lips is whether Donald Trump can resist the temptation to tweet about the Fed decision. Currency expert Kathleen Brooks, of City Index, says we must watch Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s twitter activity after the Fed meeting: If Janet Yellen threatens to take away the punch bowl at his growth party could he throw his toys out of the pram, and tweet his displeasure? If he does, then this could cause major volatility in financial markets, and it could also be bad news for stocks, as it is likely to lead to questions about the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence from Presidential meddling in the coming years... On the other hand, if Trump can keep himself away from his Twitter account this evening then this would send a positive message to the markets that he will respect the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence going forward, which could be seen as positive for markets. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible that Yellen could upset the president-elect during her press conference, if journalist ask her about bank reglation. Brooks explains: One area where Yellen and Trump could clash is the Volcker Rule. This is one of the most controversial elements of Dodd-Frank regulation, which essentially bans banks from proprietary trading, and Donald Trump hates it. So if Yellen suggests she might oppose Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to loosen bank regulation, there could be fireworks.... Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Carl Riccadonna reckons the Federal Reserve will deliver an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ambivalent hike\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd today. A what?! He means they will raise borrowing costs by a quarter-point, but avoid making any firm comments on what Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election win means for the economy. Tension in building on Wall Street as investors brace for the Fed decision. The Dow Jones industrial average is bobbing around last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record close, at 19,910 points. The Dow has never been over 20,000 points, but today could be the day....if Janet Yellen reassures the markets. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at City firm IG, says the Fed chair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments today will be crucial: With markets seeing a rate rise as a foregone conclusion, there will be a significant focus upon the language and Fed projections which should shed further light on the 2017 plan. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank is preparing to announce its final monetary policy decision of 2016 at 2pm EST (7pm UK time, or 8pm in most of Europe). Investors and economists are united in predicting that the Federal Reserve will raise US interest rates, probably by a quarter-point to 0.5%-0.75%. This would be the first rate rise for a year, and mean that the Fed thinks America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, and labour market, is strong enough to handle higher borrowing costs. The Fed should also release its latest economic and financial forecasts at the same time; showing how its rate-setting committee sees the future. Fed chair Janet Yellen will then explain the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision at 2.30pm EST. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll liveblog that press conference here. Anyone hoping that the US central bank will also offer insights on president-elect Trump will probably be disappointed. Yellen is likely to stick strictly to the numbers, rather than speculate on what Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic plans might mean for monetary policy. As Jim Caron, fixed income portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, put it (via CNBC) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think too much is unknown. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not going to involve themselves in that. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to do what they can do based on the economic evidence at hand.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dial back a year, and Fed policymakers were predicting four rate hikes in 2016. Instead, a series of shocks - including Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote - have encouraged them to sit tight. So US interest rates have been pegged at 0.25-0.5% for 12 months. But it will be an almighty shock if the Fed doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hike today.... The chances of snap elections in Greece next year have risen, says Wolfango Piccoli of Teneo Intelligence. He says the eurogroup\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to suspend Greek debt relief puts prime minister Alexis Tsipras in a very difficult position. If Tsipras goes ahead with the one-off payment to pensioners, this would further antagonize the EZ creditors, putting at risk the promised short-term debt relief. On the other side, giving in to the creditors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pressure would make Tsipras look amateurish at best, and at worst, further undermine his credibility and standing domestically. This would come on the back of a significant drop in popularity of his own SYRIZA. This new spat between Greece and its Eurozone partners means that the conclusion of the second review will be further delayed. It also increases the chances of snap elections in Greece as after overplaying his hand and facing increasing difficulties in concluding the review, Tsipras may be tempted to cut his losses by calling early elections before SYRIZA loses more support for adopting unpopular measures. Syriza would probably lose an early election, given the right-wing New Democracy party has a significant lead in the polls. Back with Greece: Markets paused for breath as investors awaited the Federal Reserve interest rate decision in less than two hours. An increase for the first time in a year is widely expected, but there will be more focus on what the Fed outlines in terms of future rises, not to mention any comments on the economy and the policies of president-elect Donald Trump. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 19.38 points or 0.28% at 6949.19 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.35% to 11,244.84 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.72% at 4769.24 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 1.18% to 18,606.32 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 1.21% to 9218.4 In Greece, the Athens market lost 3.21% to 619.19 as the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lenders put debt relief on hold On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 18 points or 0.09%. Perhaps the news that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lenders are putting debt relief on hold has not reached prime minister Alexis Tsipras. Or perhaps it has. In any case he has now announced his government will extend a pilot programme to give 30,000 school children free meals come January, which may well add to the annoyance shown already by creditors over his plans for Christmas bonuses for pensioners. Helena Smith reports: After announcing a one-off bonus for pensioners and suspension of a special sales tax on far flung Aegean isles, the leftist leader today turned to school children saying his government would ease the plight of those living in poverty-stricken areas of northern Greece. A pilot programme will, as of January, be funded from the government surplus to feed 30,000 school children living in those parts of Thessaloniki hardest hit by unemployment, he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This programme has been factored into the budget of 2017. It is worth around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac11.5m,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said adding that wherever it had been enforced it had ameliorated the problem of malnourishment among young children and improved their performance at school. Asked if the hand-outs would derail the adjustment programme Greece has agreed to enforce, Tsipras appeared in especially defiant mood. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think everyone has to respect the Greek people, who for the last seven years, have made huge sacrifices in the name of Europe. We have carried the weight of the refugee crisis. In the name of Europe we have, in recent years, implemented an extremely harsh policy of austerity. There has to be respect from all. I have, if you will, no doubt whatsoever because everything that we are doing is absolutely within the framework of the Accord which we are keeping and which our partners should keep too.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Oil prices have recovered from the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lows after the latest US inventory figures showed a bigger than expected dip in crude stocks. In contrast with the American Petroleum Institute\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures on Tuesday, the Energy Information Administration said crude stocks fell by 2.6m barrels last week, compared with expectations of a 1.6m fall. But stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub rise by 1.2m barrels. David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spread Co, said: This data was at odds with yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s API update. This showed an increase in crude inventories of 4.7 million barrels for the week ending 9th December. This was way above the consensus expectation which was for a decline of 1.6 million barrels. In addition, gasoline inventories showed their biggest rise since January. Crude has also been under pressure after OPEC released a report predicting that, despite promised production cuts, the oil market wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rebalance until the second half of 2017. Earlier in the week the International Energy Agency (IEA) had forecast that supply and demand would be in balance in the first half of next year. Traders will be keeping a close eye on the WTI contract to see if it can hold above the $52 level. If it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, then technically the stage could be set for a significant pull-back. Brent crude is currently down 0.5% at $55.43 a barrel having fallen as low as $54.76 during the day. West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is down 0.98% at $52.46 a barrel. Back with Greece: Some more positive news from the eurozone. Italian prime minister Paolo Gentiloni won a confidence vote in the upper house of the Senate, allowing his coalition government to take office. Gentiloni replaced Matteo Renzi, who resigned last week after he lost a referendum on constitutional reform. The Greek stock market is down 2.9% following the news that lenders have put short term debt relief for the country on hold. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters on the latest Greek debt developments: Euro zone lenders have put on hold the implementation of a short-term debt relief deal for Greece on Wednesday after the Greek government proposed to make a one-off payout to pensioners in December, the euro zone bailout fund ESM said. Euro zone finance ministers agreed on Dec 5 to grant Greece short-term debt relief that would reduce the amount of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public debt by 20 percentage points of GDP by 2060. But on Dec 8, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said, without consulting euro zone lenders, that his government would spend 617 million euros in one-off benefits for low-income pensioners ahead of Christmas because Greece exceeded its 2016 primary surplus target. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Following recent proposals by the Greek government to spend additional fiscal resources for pensions and VAT our governing bodies have put their decisions temporarily on hold,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a spokesman for the ESM said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Institutions are currently assessing the impact of Greek government decisions vis a vis the ESM programme commitments and targets. (We) will then analyze the institutions\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 assessment and subsequently decide how to proceed,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. And it seems that Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 plan to give struggling pensioners a Christmas bonus has riled the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors, who had not agreed the deal. The spokesman for the Eurogroup has just said there was no agreement now to implement the latest short term debt measures: Over to Greece where tensions between Athens and the International Monetary Fund continue. As prime minister Alexis Tsipras prepares to meet his French and German counterparts later this week, speculation is mounting that he will ask the organisation to withdraw from the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current bailout program. Helena Smith reports from the Greek capital: Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relations with the IMF were never easy. The Washington-based institution has long been blamed fore the gruelling austerity visited on Greeks even when it wholeheartedly endorsed the cause of debt relief. But the latest spat may be a spat too far. Sources close to the Greek prime minister say in the wake of the fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to go public with its views \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in a blog penned this week by IMF European director Poul Thomsen and chief economist Maruice Obstfeld \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Tsipras will propose that the organisation abstains altogether from the bailout programme currently keeping the country afloat. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Fund has never officially joined this programme and we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really need it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said one. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At most it could be reduced to a technical, consultative role.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The leftist leader, who on Tuesday blasted the body for being staffed by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153irrational technocrats,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is said to be incensed that it is now asking for more pension and tax cuts once the programme expires in 2018. Far too often, he said, the IMF had got it wrong with assessments that either over-estimated or under-estimated the impact of recessionary policies on Greece. In the blog, Thomsen and Obstfeld sought to clarify what they described as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153misinformation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd surrounding the Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role in Greece insisting that far from advocating more austerity the organisation wanted less. Instead, they said, it was the agreement of Athens to achieve higher fiscal targets that made more austerity inevitable. Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 new stance has not been met with universal applause. Many see it as counter-productive, arguing that despite popular myth the IMF is by far Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best ally supporting it on the need for debt relief and primary surplus requirements to be reduced. Wolfgang Manchau, the prominent European affairs columnist, tweeted that Tsipras was making a huge strategic mistake aligning himself with the Europeans against the IMF. Stefanos Manos, Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former finance minister, also said he welcomed the IMF officials\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 intervention. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m glad they went public with their views. Their [blog] comments amounted to a very balanced presentation and made quite a lot of sense,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told me. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some of their points \u00e2\u20ac\u201c like the one that more than 50 % of people in Greece are not taxed at all - were hair-raising, absolutely maddening to read but needed to be aired.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ahead of the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate decision, US markets have edged lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average - which has been toying with the 20,000 barrier for the first time - is down 11 points at 19,900 while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are also marginally lower. All three indices hit new peaks on Tuesday. Oil prices have slipped lower after their surge since the weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement between Opec and non-Opec producers to cut output. The fall follows data from the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday showing a 4.7m weekly rise in US crude inventories compared to expectations of a 1.6m decline. Official figures from the US Energy Information Administration are due later. Meanwhile Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest report showed a growing oil surplus next year unless members stick to their output curbs. Opec said with the cuts the 2017 overhang would reach 1.24m barrels a day, up 300,000 on its previous estimate. Brent crude is currently down 1.29% at $55 a barrel. Something for the Federal Reserve to think about as they sign off on their latest interest rate decision, with the first rise for a year widely expected. Retails sales growth cooled off in November after two months of strong gains. They edged up just 0.1% as consumers cut back on car purchases, while October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure was revised down from the initial 0.8% gain to 0.6%. Economists had been expecting a rise of 0.3%. Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, said: Retailers will be more than a little disappointed with November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drop in retail sales, as well as October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revised figure, which overall leaves question marks hanging over the sector going in to the festive shopping season. However, observers will point to the contentious presidential election as a prime reason for shoppers keeping their wallets closed amid the swirling uncertainty. With retailers making the bulk of their profits in December, the sector will be hoping the lure of sales will be too tempting for shoppers to resist. But signs of rising inflation have come from another set of data. US producer prices climbed 0.4% last month, the largest gain since June, after being unchanged in October. This is higher than the 0.1% increase expected by analysts. Economist Rob Carnell at ING Bank said: ..What really grabs the attention is the 1.3% month on month rise in trade services. This is mainly due to wider margins in the wholesale and retail sector. And as such, could well be echoed in the November CPI release on December 15. With the consensus expectation for only a 0.2% month on month increase in November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headline CPI, we now think that the risk of a higher (say 0.4% month on month) figure is looking more likely. If so, then headline inflation will rise from 1.6% in October, to 1.9% in November - in excess of the 1.7% year on year consensus estimate. With markets looking for little further tightening from the Fed after what looks a near-certain rate hike today - the Fed may start to look as if it is either allowing the economy to run a little hot, or alternatively, falling behind the curve, unless today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expected hike is coupled with more hawkish guidance. Labour market expert Paul Bivand has tweeted some useful charts on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK unemployment report, which show how the labour market appears to be cooling: With the UK employment figures out of the way, investors are waiting patiently for the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rates decision in six hours time. European stock markets are basically flat (the FTSE 100 has lost 7 points, or 0.1%), and Wall Street is expected to open quietly in 75 minutes time. Back in the City, shares in British\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second largest pub chain have soared by a third as a takeover battle breaks out. Punch Tavern is being pursued by Heineken, the Dutch brewer which produces Strongbow and Foster\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, and also by Alan McIntosh, one of Punch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cofounders. This two-way battle, broken by Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mark Kleinman this morning, has excited the City. Shares in Punch have rocketed by 35% to 172p, from 128p, a two-year high. The company leases urban and rural pubs across the country to tenant landlords, and has been spending years tackling its huge debt pile build up before the financial crisis. Punch has just issued a statement, confirming that it is in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153advanced discussions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with the Heineken side, Patron Capital Advisers ,about an offer of 174p per share. It is also in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153discussions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with McIntosh\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consortium, Emerald Investment Partners, which are offering 185p per share (subject to due diligence etc). Punch cautions that: There can be no certainty that any firm offer will be made by either Patron or Emerald. A further announcement will be made in due course. Both groups have until 11 January to make a firm bid, or walk away. That might not be the end of it, though -- industry regulators might have concerns about such a large pub estate changing hands, especially as Heineken already owns 1,100 leased pubs. The Resolution Foundation have helpfully fired some charts over., showing how real wage growth is still below its pre-crisis levels (pay rises minus inflation). They also warn that inflation could overtake pay rises in 2017, hitting workers with another pay squeeze: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report shows that there are now 4.75 million self-employed people in the UK, up 129,000 compared to last year. Mike Cherry, National Chairman at the Federation of Small Businesses, is urging the government to provide more help for these workers - who aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t entitled to the full range of benefits which employees receive. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The huge rise in self-employment since the recession must be met with action. There is much to do to improve our social security and financial systems in particular. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Social security and our tax system have not kept up with the changing nature of 21st century work. It is urgent that Government gets to grips with the new reality of more people striking out on their own and working for themselves. In maternity, low pay, pensions and the housing market, the self-employed lose out from systems designed for a different age. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Taylor review is a crucial opportunity to help the wellbeing of the self-employed and the companies they start. Maternity support must be raised to a level closer with the employed and the design of Universal Credit changed so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no longer a threat to business start-ups. The financial system must ensure the self-employed have the same chance to buy their own homes and save for retirement as those in traditional employment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), predicts that the unemployment rate will rise from its 11-year lows next year: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The labour market remains a source of strength for the UK economy. The number of people in work remains close to historically high levels, with unemployment levels continuing to fall. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, there are signs that the UK labour market may be beginning to cool, with a small fall in employment and the continued rise in the claimant count measure. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is likely that UK unemployment will start to drift upwards in the coming months, as uncertainty over Brexit and the increasing input costs faced by businesses weigh on jobs growth. However, while we currently forecast the unemployment rate will peak at 5.5% in early 2018, this is still well below the long-term average. Dr John Philpott, Director of The Jobs Economist, is also concerned that the labour market is cooling down: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK labour market finally appears to be suffering a bout of post-Brexit vote blues which is now hitting recruitment. The number of people employed in the private sector has fallen by 17,000 and vacancies have levelled off, though an offsetting rise of 12,000 in public sector employment (mostly in education and the NHS) has limited the fall in both the overall job total and the employment rate. Despite this headline unemployment is down 16,000 on the quarter but only because the jobs slowdown is disguised by a sharp rise of 76,000 in the number of people out of work who are economically inactive. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market is cooling after a solid run: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data provides the clearest evidence yet that the jobs market has started to cool off since the Brexit vote. Total employment in the three months to October was broadly flat compared to the previous three months, having been rising strongly in the year before the EU referendum. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The official unemployment rate held steady at 4.8%, but this disguised a marked rise in economic inactivity of over 100,000 in the latest three months. The more timely but less comprehensive claimant count measure of unemployment edged up again in November for the fourth month in a row. Hawksworth adds that it will be hard for firms to hand out pay rises and take on more staff: Regular pay growth edged up to 2.6%, and is now close to 3% on average in the private sector. This is good news for workers facing the prospect of rising consumer price inflation over the next year, but could dampen future jobs growth if it continues.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Professor Geraint Johnes, director of research at Lancaster University\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Work Foundation, has dug into today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data and found that more self-employed workers are now only working part time hours. That may be a sign that some firms are suffering a drop in demand. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The number of full-time self-employed workers fell by some 55000 while those of part-time self-employed workers rose by 53000. The nature of many jobs undertaken by self-employed workers is precarious, and it is not at this stage clear to what extent the shift towards part-time work is voluntary. To the extent that it is not, there may be clouds on the horizon.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The rise in wage growth, from 2.4% to 2.6%, will unfortunately be eroded by inflation - which jumped from 0.9% to 1.2% in November. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady urges the government to help workers, particularly in the public sector. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Wages are still struggling to get off the ground with increases in pay offset by rising inflation. After the longest wage squeeze since Victorian times, this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the pay boost working people need to get their living standards back on track. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government needs to act fast to avoid another living standards crisis. That means a clear plan for Brexit that will protect jobs, pay and rights. And we need a quick end to the unfair public sector pay cap, which will see public sector workers face year-on-year cuts to real pay.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market report also suggests that Britain became a little more productive in the last quarter. We worked a combined total of 1.01 billion hours in the August to October quarter, which is five million hours fewer than in May to July. The ONS says: people worked, on average, 31.9 hours per week, down slightly compared with May to July 2016 and with a year earlier people working full-time worked, on average, 37.3 hours per week in their main job, a decrease of 0.2 hours compared with May to July 2016 and down slightly compared with a year earlier people working part-time worked, on average, 16.1 hours per week in their main job, unchanged compared with May to July 2016 but down slightly compared with a year earlier. And as the economy grew by an estimated 0.4% in August-October, that means productivity has gone up (as we took less time to do more work. Economist Rupert Seggins flags up that the claimant count has been rising for several months - a sign that the UK labour market may be weakening. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key points from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market report: For August to October 2016, there were 31.76 million people in work in Britain -- 6,000 fewer than in May to July 2016 but 342,000 more than for a year earlier. The employment rate (the proportion of people aged from 16 to 64 who were in work) had fallen to 74.4%, from the joint record high of 74.5% recorded for May to July 2016, but higher than for a year earlier (73.9%). There are 1.62 million unemployed people, 16,000 fewer than for May to July 2016 and 103,000 fewer than for a year earlier. The unemployment rate remained at 4.8%, down from 5.2% for a year earlier. It has not been lower since July to September 2005. The number of economically inactive people (not in work or seeking work) jumped by 76,000 in the last quarter to 8.91m. Average weekly earnings rose by 2.5% including bonuses and by 2.6% excluding bonuses. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good news for workers: Average weekly earnings excluding bonuses rose by 2.6% year-on-year in the three months to October, up from 2.4% last month. Pay including bonuses rose by 2.5%, up from 2.4%. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s snap take of the unemployment report: U.K. employment fell for the first time in more than a year in the three months through October as the labor market showed some signs of weakness. The number of people in work fell by 6,000 to 31.76 million people, the Office for National Statistics said on Wednesday. While the decline was small, and the jobless rate was unchanged at 4.8 percent, the statistics office said the labor market \u00e2\u20ac\u0153appears to have flattened off in recent months.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Single-month data showed that the unemployment rate rose to 4.9 percent in October from 4.6 percent in September. Unemployment also fell over the three-month period, though that was offset by an increase in the inactivity rate. Breaking: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobless rate remains at an 11-year low of 4.8% for the three months to October. That matches last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures. But the number of people in work has dropped by 6,000 to 31.762m, the first fall since the second quarter of 2015. And the number of people claiming unemployment benefit has gone up again, by 2,400 in November, to 809,000. More to follow! Italian banking shares have hit their highest level since June, having gained 1.3% this morning. Traders haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t given up hope that the sector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker banks can be recapitalised, especially after Unicredit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn cash call received a warm welcome yesterday. Italian bank shares have now jumped by a quarter since the referendum on constitutional reform, and the resignation of Matteo Renzi: Kit Juckes of Societe Generale predicts that the Federal Reserve will play a very straight bat today, when it (probably) raises US interest rates for the first time in 2016. A year ago, markets expected the Fed Funds rate to be in a 0.75-1% range by now. By this evening, they are likely to have crawled to 0.50-0.75%. If for no other reason, that should caution anyone expecting much in the way of a hawkish message from the FOMC - this is a Fed leadership group whose main feature is its dovishness. Given that the single biggest source of economic uncertainty hanging over the US economy right now is the outlook for fiscal policy -what will President Trump do? - the temptation to be very, very bland in the statement that accompanies a thoroughly-discounted rate hike at 7pm GMT, is likely to be irresistible. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no drama in the foreign exchange markets either, where the pound is sticking firmly to $1.267 against the US dollar, up just 0.1% Traders may be reluctant to take big positions ahead of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve meeting, which could spark volatility depending how hawkish or dovish Janet Yellen is. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets have opened cautiously, as investors sit tight ahead of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK unemployment report, and the Fed meeting tonight. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has dipped by 16 points, or 0.25%, and there are similar declines in France and Germany. Dixons Carphone are the biggest faller, down 3% in volatile trading, despite posting a 14% jump in profits and telling the City it had its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbiggest ever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Black Friday. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets agrees that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earnings figures are particularly important, following the rise in inflation from 0.9% to 1.2% yesterday. Inflation certainly appears to be on the way back in the UK in numbers released yesterday, which showed that CPI hit its highest levels in two years driven primarily by clothing and fuel prices, while a rise in import prices to their highest levels since 2011 was an unwelcome portend of what could be around the corner in 2017. Unemployment is expected to remain at 4.8%, while average earnings are expected to remain at 2.3%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main event is the latest UK unemployment report at 9.30am GMT, which will show whether Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market is ending the year with a bang or a whimper. The figures will be poured over for signs that the economy is weakening in the face of continued Brexit uncertainty. Economists predict that the headline jobless rate will stay low, but the number of people signing on for unemployment benefit may rise. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what the City expects: the unemployment rate will remain at an 11-year low of 4.8% in the three months to October The employment total will rise by 50,000 during the quarter. Wage growth will remain at 2.3% (but may accelerate to 2.5% if bonuses are stripped out). The claimant count will jump by 6,500 in November, following last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 9,800 rise. Yesterday we saw inflation jump to 1.2%, so if wages don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rise too people will face a real earnings squeeze in 2017. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets believe the jobless rate could rise a little, to 4.9%, but are cautious about jumping to many Brexit conclusions. Employment growth momentum is fading but it is still early days as far as capturing the referendum effect is concerned. Also coming up today. The US Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise American interest rates today, at its final FOMC meeting of the year (at 7pm GMT or 2pm EST). Fed chair Janet Yellen will then give a press conference, to discuss the state of the US economy - and probably field a few questions about politics too. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll keep an eye on Greece, where relations between Athens, the IMF and the EU are deteriorating in a familiar fashion: On the corporate front, consumer electronics group Dixons Carphone are reporting results this morning. They look decent, at first glance, with first-half profits up 19%, but the firm is also talking about uncertain times ahead. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re holding a press with journalists right now, so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have more shortly...",

After 16 months of faithfully toeing the line, the leader rebelled, cautiously at first and then almost jubilantly, casting off the fiscal straightjacket that has encased his government with thinly veiled glee.</p> <p>First came the announcement that low-income pensioners, forced to survive in tax-heavy post-crisis Greece on \u00e2\u201a\u00ac800 or less a month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/09/greece-under-fire-over-christmas-bonus-for-low-income-pensioners\" title=\"\">would receive a one-off, pre-Christmas bonus</a>. Then came the news that Greeks living on Aegean isles which have borne the brunt of refugee flows would not be subject to a sales tax enforced at the behest of creditors keeping the debt-stricken country afloat.</p> <p>Finally, another announcement both antagonising and pointed: 30,000 children living in poverty-stricken areas of northern Greece will henceforth be entitled to free meals in schools.</p> <p>The reaction wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t instant but, when it came, it was delivered with force. The European Stability Mechanism, the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financing arm, announced that short-term relief measures, agreed only a week before to ease Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt pile, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/14/greece-on-collision-course-with-lenders-as-esm-freezes-debt-relief\" title=\"\">would be frozen with immediate effect</a>.</p> <p>It did not take long before the German finance ministry, under the unwavering stewardship of Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble, followed suit, requesting that creditor institutions assess whether Tsipras had acted in flagrant violation of Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bailout commitments with his unilateral moves.</p> <p>The leftist insisted that the aid \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u201a\u00ac61m in supplementary support for pensions and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac11.5m for the school meals \u00e2\u20ac\u201c would be taken from the primary surplus his government, unexpectedly, had managed to achieve.

Seven years after the scale of its deficit was revealed, prompting the first of three bailouts to avert bankruptcy, Greece is nowhere near economic recovery. Despite rosy prognostications by the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on Friday, it predicted that the economy, which grew by a mere 0.1% in 2016, would expand by 2.5% next year and 3% in 2018 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the nation has lost a third of its economic output.</p> <p>The byproducts of the crisis, starting with an unemployment rate of 27% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and 52% among the young \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are the backdrop against which the drama is played.</p> <p>Tsipras has seen his support haemorrhage as fury has grown over his embrace of the very austerity measures his Syriza party once pledged to overthrow.

                "bodyText":"Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister, likes to shake things up and, in recent days, he has reverted to form. After 16 months of faithfully toeing the line, the leader rebelled, cautiously at first and then almost jubilantly, casting off the fiscal straightjacket that has encased his government with thinly veiled glee. First came the announcement that low-income pensioners, forced to survive in tax-heavy post-crisis Greece on \u00e2\u201a\u00ac800 or less a month, would receive a one-off, pre-Christmas bonus. Then came the news that Greeks living on Aegean isles which have borne the brunt of refugee flows would not be subject to a sales tax enforced at the behest of creditors keeping the debt-stricken country afloat. Finally, another announcement both antagonising and pointed: 30,000 children living in poverty-stricken areas of northern Greece will henceforth be entitled to free meals in schools. The reaction wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t instant but, when it came, it was delivered with force. The European Stability Mechanism, the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financing arm, announced that short-term relief measures, agreed only a week before to ease Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt pile, would be frozen with immediate effect. It did not take long before the German finance ministry, under the unwavering stewardship of Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble, followed suit, requesting that creditor institutions assess whether Tsipras had acted in flagrant violation of Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bailout commitments with his unilateral moves. The leftist insisted that the aid \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u201a\u00ac61m in supplementary support for pensions and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac11.5m for the school meals \u00e2\u20ac\u201c would be taken from the primary surplus his government, unexpectedly, had managed to achieve. The assistance would help \u00e2\u20ac\u0153heal the wounds of crisis\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We want to ... alleviate all those who have over these difficult years made huge sacrifices in the name of Europe,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he announced before holding talks with German chancellor Angela Merkel late Friday. Those who live in Athens know that while the Greek crisis may ebb and flow, it never goes away. Everyone involved \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s paymaster, Germany, the 19-member euro group of eurozone finance ministers, the ESM and the International Monetary Fund \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are acutely aware that almost any move could reignite the problems. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Let us not play shadowy games with Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd wrote EU economic affairs commissioner Pierre Moscovici in the pages of the Financial Times, urging that decisions be made \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in the common interest\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But, inexorably, the next act has already begun. Seven years after the scale of its deficit was revealed, prompting the first of three bailouts to avert bankruptcy, Greece is nowhere near economic recovery. Despite rosy prognostications by the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on Friday, it predicted that the economy, which grew by a mere 0.1% in 2016, would expand by 2.5% next year and 3% in 2018 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the nation has lost a third of its economic output. The byproducts of the crisis, starting with an unemployment rate of 27% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and 52% among the young \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are the backdrop against which the drama is played. Tsipras has seen his support haemorrhage as fury has grown over his embrace of the very austerity measures his Syriza party once pledged to overthrow. If elections were held tomorrow, he would lose outright to the conservative New Democracy party shown to be leading by as many as 15 percentage points in a recent poll. But that also makes the leftist leader unpredictable. Demands for further tax increases, wage and pension cuts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c reforms Athens says it is under immense pressure to apply by the International Monetary Fund if it is to come anywhere close to achieving a projected primary budget surplus of 3.5% by 2018 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have created a tinderbox situation. And that, say analysts, is one that at 42, with much of his political career still before him, Tsipras may well elect to exploit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All scenarios are open, including fresh elections,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says professor Dimitris Keridis, who teaches political scientist at Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Pandeion University. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s playing the resistance fighter on the one hand and the leader who wants resolution and Greece to remain in the euro on the other,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told the Observer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But the reality is very hard and he is also hostage to his rhetoric.

But now the real challenge begins: delivering substantive growth in 2017.</p> </blockquote> <p>Economist Howard Archer at IHS Markit said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>An encouraging boost to Eurozone growth prospects as consumer confidence rose for a fourth month running in December to reach a 20-month high. Furthermore, consumer confidence is now at a very decent level compared to long-term norms. Consumers across the Eurozone are currently benefiting from pretty decent fundamentals overall, notably including higher employment and still limited inflation.</p> <p>This reinforces hopes that the Eurozone will have seen some pick-up in GDP growth in the fourth quarter and is set to see a decent start to 2017...</p> <p>While there are no details available, it seems reasonable suspect that the marked rise in Eurozone consumer confidence in December was due to improved perceptions on the economic situation and outlook. It is also likely that job concerns eased further across the Eurozone after a marked dip in November (following increased worries during August-October). Significantly, latest data showed that Eurozone unemployment dropped at an increased rate in October and September after labour markets had shown signs of losing momentum over the summer.</p> <p>Any improvement in Eurozone consumer confidence \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly a decent increase \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is to be welcomed as the consumer clearly is vital to Eurozone growth prospects...</p> <p>However, there is the danger that an increasingly uncertain political and economic environment could cause companies to become more cautious over employment during 2017.</p> <p>Furthermore, consumer confidence in the Eurozone could very well be pressurised by increasing political uncertainty over the coming months, especially given that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote in June and November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election of Donald Trump as US President fuels concern over potential political shocks in the Eurozone.

                "bodyText":"In quiet pre-Christmas trading, the banking sector came under pressure on concerns that Italian bank Monte dei Pashi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fundraising was in trouble, helping push European markets into negative territory. The moves were hardly dramatic however, ahead of the holiday period, and the German market managed to just about buck the trend. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has so far failed to test the 20,000 barrier. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 0.04% at 7041.42 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax edged up 0.03% to 11,468.64 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.33% lower at 4833.82 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.16% to 19,215.59 with Monte dei Paschi itself down 12% Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.38% at 9371.7 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.71% to 638.99 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down around 13 points at 19,961. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day, barring any late developments on Wall Street. Thanks for all your comments and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Worries about European banks are undermining stock markets, particularly in Italy and Spain. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Banking concerns have played across European markets once again today, as Monte dei Paschi looks set for a government takeover. The rescue plan has fallen apart, with Rome unable to find an anchor investor; for understandable reasons, no one wants to be first \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcover the top\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 should the crisis worsen. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt will get bigger, but a major government stake should, paradoxically, boost risk appetite among investors, who will be glad to see the Italian government taking the tough decisions. Meanwhile, Spanish banks are under pressure after the ECJ ruled they would have to pay back funds to mortgage borrowers. 2016 saw plenty of concerns about European banks, but while it made sense for everyone to buy Deutsche shares at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10, it will be harder to find investors willing to take stakes in southern European firms. Still, the overall tone on markets is only slightly negative, although the patient watch for Dow 20,000 goes on. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters on the Monte dei Paschi situation: Ailing Italian bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena has been unable to find an anchor investor willing to put money in its privately funded rescue plan, less than 24 hours before the offer ends, two sources close to the matter said on Wednesday. The bank needs to raise 5 billion euros ($5.2 billion) by the end of this month to avert being wound down. The Italian government is expected to step in this week to bail it out. The Tuscan lender, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third biggest bank and the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest, had pinned its hopes on Qatar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereign wealth fund investing 1 billion euros in its cash call, but that option is no longer on the table, the sources said. As a result, the bank entire share sale, which closes at 2 p.m. (1300 GMT) on Thursday, has drawn very little interest from the wider investment community, they added. The bank declined to comment. Ratings agency DBRS is keeping an eye on Italy: Over in Italy, the rescue package for struggling bank Monte dei Paschi is looking in trouble, bringing the prospect of a state bailout closer: Which suggests that Qatar is unwilling to invest in the bank. But Italy could find out whether any bailout breaches EU rules, if taxpayers have to foot the bill but investors are left untouched. In the wake of its recent blog on Greece, the International Monetary Fund has responded to questions about its comments, mainly to do with tax and pensions. A tweet from the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokesperson explains: Oil prices have slipped slightly as the latest US figures show an unexpected rise in crude stocks. West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is 0.15% lower at $53.22 a barrel while Brent crude is down 0.38% to $55.14. US crude stocks have defied expectations with a hefty jump last week. They rose by nearly 2.3m barrels, according to the Energy Information Administration, compared to forecasts of a fall of around 2.5m barrels. The figures go against Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news from the American Petroleum Institute of a much larger than expected 4.1m decline in crude. Analyst welcomed the improvement in European consumer confidence, but there was some caution over the future outlook. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: European consumers appear to have shrugged off concerns including Brexit, the Italian banking crisis and the upcoming inauguration of President Trump to post the year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strongest confidence figures for December, albeit still firmly in negative territory. While today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data will encourage ECB chief Mario Draghi, the Christmas cheer may not last long, especially if markets start to waver as Brexit negotiations begin in earnest next year. Draghi must be congratulated for steering Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy through choppy waters during what has been a particularly testing 12 months. But now the real challenge begins: delivering substantive growth in 2017. Economist Howard Archer at IHS Markit said: An encouraging boost to Eurozone growth prospects as consumer confidence rose for a fourth month running in December to reach a 20-month high. Furthermore, consumer confidence is now at a very decent level compared to long-term norms. Consumers across the Eurozone are currently benefiting from pretty decent fundamentals overall, notably including higher employment and still limited inflation. This reinforces hopes that the Eurozone will have seen some pick-up in GDP growth in the fourth quarter and is set to see a decent start to 2017... While there are no details available, it seems reasonable suspect that the marked rise in Eurozone consumer confidence in December was due to improved perceptions on the economic situation and outlook. It is also likely that job concerns eased further across the Eurozone after a marked dip in November (following increased worries during August-October). Significantly, latest data showed that Eurozone unemployment dropped at an increased rate in October and September after labour markets had shown signs of losing momentum over the summer. Any improvement in Eurozone consumer confidence \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly a decent increase \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is to be welcomed as the consumer clearly is vital to Eurozone growth prospects... However, there is the danger that an increasingly uncertain political and economic environment could cause companies to become more cautious over employment during 2017. Furthermore, consumer confidence in the Eurozone could very well be pressurised by increasing political uncertainty over the coming months, especially given that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote in June and November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election of Donald Trump as US President fuels concern over potential political shocks in the Eurozone. General elections are due 2017 in the Netherlands (in March), France (in April/May) and Germany (around September), and may also well occur in Italy after the December referendum defeat on constitutional reform. Eurozone consumer confidence has improved so far in December. The provisional reading for the month from the European Commission shows a rise of 1.1 points to -5.1, compared to expectations of a figure of -6. The Commission said: In December 2016, the...flash estimate of the consumer confidence indicator increased markedly in both the euro area (by 1.1 points to -5.1) and the EU (by 1.2 points to -4.6) compared to November. On the home sales, Lawrence Yun, the association\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, said the last three months had been outstanding for the housing market. He said: The healthiest job market since the Great Recession and the anticipation of some buyers to close on a home before mortgage rates accurately rose from their historically low level have combined to drive sales higher in recent months. Furthermore, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no coincidence that home shoppers in the Northeast \u00e2\u20ac\u201d where price growth has been tame all year \u00e2\u20ac\u201d had the most success last month. Existing housing supply at the beginning of the year was inadequate and is now even worse heading into 2017. Rental units are also seeing this shortage. As a result, both home prices and rents continue to far outstrip incomes in much of the country. US existing home sales unexpectedly jumped in November, hitting their highest level in nearly ten years. Sales rose 0.7% to an annualised 5.61m units, the best since February 2007, according to the National Association of Realtors. Analysts had been expecting a fall from October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure of 5.57m units - itself revised down from 5.6m - to 5.5m. Well that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t last. The Dow is now down 14 points as investors shy away from pushing it above 20,000. For the moment at least. After an initial dip, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is slightly higher, edging ever nearer to the 20,000 barrier. But the trend is not exactly certain in early trading. The Dow is currently at 19,982, up 8 points. Elsewhere the S&amp;P 500 opened down just 1.55 points while the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.05%. Analysts have been waiting for a few days now for the Dow Jones Industrial Average to break the 20,000 barrier for the first time, and on Tuesday it came tantalisingly close at 19,987 before closing at 19.974. Could today be the day? The futures are indicating a slight rise, so it looks like edging ever closer. Kit Juckes at Societe Generale said: I have no insight into what happens once the Dow breaks 20,000 but some people see this as a major milestone. And until it is broken it acts as Pied Piper, or perhaps Rudolph\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nose, lighting the way for the risk-hungry and those scared of being left behind. The Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly Brexit Watch has just been published. It shows how the impact June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote is now hitting the economy, with inflation up and retail sales growth slowing. Economists Danny Blanchflower and Andrew Sentance both agree that growth is slowing: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, has just warned that public borrowing in the final four months of this financial year will be slightly higher than a year ago. In its official response to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finance data, the OBR warns that tax receipts may weaken in the December-March period, while government spending will pick up. The OBR says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Considerable uncertainty remains over prospects for borrowing in the remaining third of the year, but we expect public sector net borrowing to rise slightly relative to the same period in 2015-16. This is due to: onshore corporation tax, where strength in October instalment payments that was factored into our November forecast is not expected to persist over the rest of the year; stamp duty land tax, where we expect much weaker growth over the rest of the year. SDLT receipts in April 2016 were up 48 per cent on a year earlier, reflecting forestalling ahead of the introduction of an additional rate of stamp duty on additional properties (i.e. buy-to-let investments and second homes). We expect the weakness in receipts seen since the EU referendum to persist over the rest of the year; and central government spending, where a number of factors are expected to boost growth later in the year. These include debt interest spending, which is expected to rise due to higher RPI inflation (with a lag of three to eight months) and higher planned investment spending.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However (as flagged earlier), Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borrowing since April is down by \u00c2\u00a37.7bn, so the annual deficit should still fall. Over in Greece, relations with creditors remain awkward and tense following Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inconclusive euro working group (representing Greek creditors) Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens: The tensions stirred by the announcement of relief measures for those hardest hit by the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seemingly relentless economic crisis show no sign of abating. Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s euro group meeting was a test case in humiliation for the embattled Greek government with Athens being forced to accept in writing that the bonus proclaimed by prime minister Alexis Tsipras for pensioners is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one off\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that will never be repeated. Germany, the main contributor to the emergency bailouts keeping the debt-stricken economy afloat, apparently remains unconvinced that the pre-Christmas gifts (including exempting Aegean islands from a planned sales tax) will not throw the economy off-course. The leftist-led government insists that fiscal targets can be met because the supplementary help will be extracted from the primary surplus Athens, by dint of hard effort, has managed to achieve. The deputy prime minister Yiannis Dragasakis highlighted the tensions on Tuesday evening saying it was the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sovereign right\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to distribute the excess surplus as it felt fit. Finance ministry sources say with the handwringing still ongoing, Athens has yet to send the letter. Without it, euro zone partners have said the retaliatory decision to freeze short-term debt relief measures \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a huge setback for Athens \u00e2\u20ac\u201c cannot be lifted. One of Monte dei Paschi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s riskier bonds has tumbled in value today, in another sign that investors believe its \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn cash call will fail. That capital raising exercise ends tomorrow afternoon; if it hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t attracted enough support, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government might then step in and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbail in\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 some bond holders, making them share the cost of a rescue. Back in Italy, shares in Monte dei Paschi bank have taken an almighty dive - only to bounce right back up again  . They initially slumped by 18% in a panicky selloff, as news broke that the bank might run out of liquidity within four months. BUT then they rallies sharply, after Italian MPs approved plans to borrow an extra \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20bn to fund bank bailouts (potentially starting with Monte dei Paschi) It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear, though, that shareholders would be left with much if the Rome government is forced to intervene -- which is why shares are down 99.8% from their record high.... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tax receipts have risen by 4.4% this financial year, or \u00c2\u00a317.8bn, to \u00c2\u00a3421.8bn. That helped to pull borrowing down since April -- but not by enough to prevent the national debt hitting record highs. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), is concerned that the UK tax take isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t growing faster: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Government borrowing in November, while higher than expected, was still marginally lower in annual terms. Despite the slight improvement, debt levels remain unsustainably high. \u00e2\u20ac\u01532017 is likely to be a challenging period for the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances, with economic growth likely to soften, which will hamper the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to generate tax receipts. The more flexible approach to deficit reduction announced in the Autumn Statement is a sensible step given the broader uncertainty. However, the acid test for the Chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new fiscal rules will be whether they are able to reverse the ongoing shortfall in tax revenue, which has persistently hampered previous attempts to reduce the deficit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chancellor Philip Hammond may find some Christmas cheer in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances. Even though the deficit was higher than expected, Britain seems to be on track to hit the (new) budget targets which were announced in November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s autumn statement. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153welcome news\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for Hammond. Reassuring news for the Chancellor as the public finances saw modest improvement in November compared to a year earlier \u00e2\u20ac\u201c thereby keeping the government on track to meet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or even slightly undershoot - its upwardly revised target for 2016/17 contained in November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Autumn Statement. It would have been somewhat embarrassing if the first set of public finance figures after the November Statement had immediately put question markets over his new fiscal targets. Howard has also crunched through today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data, and reports that: There was a slowdown in growth in tax receipts in November, primarily due to income tax related receipts dipping 1.1% year-on-year. ONS data show that employment growth has slowed recently, although it needs to be borne in mind that the tax data can be erratic from month to month, partly depending on when exactly the receipts come in. It is also notable that national insurance contributions were up 6.3% year-on-year. VAT receipts were up 4.4% year-on-year in November and corporation tax receipts were up 22.9% year-on-year, which points to still resilient economic activity. City experts aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s net borrowing spiked to \u00c2\u00a312.6bn last month, up from just \u00c2\u00a34.2bn in October. Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The outlook for the UK heading into the new year is a rather bearish one and investors are unlikely to be flying in with both feet as uncertainty continues to swirl. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The gap between UK government spending and income has risen sharply in November, raising a number of red flags with investors who will interpret this as a sign that a significant economic slowdown is coming in the new year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Chancellor Philip Hammond has announced the final spring budget for early March where he will attempt to plan for an uncertain future, with the triggering of Article 50 set for later that month. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If borrowing levels continues to rise at this rate, Hammond may not have too much room for manoeuvre when setting out his fiscal policy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This chart, from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances, shows how Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national debt hit a new record high in November - up to \u00c2\u00a31.655bn from \u00c2\u00a31.641bn in October. And this chart shows how net borrowing this financial year has fallen by \u00c2\u00a37.7bn, compared to 2015-2016. Newsflash: Britain borrowed more than \u00c2\u00a312.6bn to balance the books in November. The public sector net borrowing requirement (excluding the impact of our state-owned banks) came in at \u00c2\u00a312.647bn. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s around \u00c2\u00a3400m ahead of City expectations but lower than the \u00c2\u00a313.2bn borrowed in November 2015. And it pushes the national debt up to \u00c2\u00a31.655 trillion, a new record high, equivalent to 84.5% of GDP. More to follow... If the public\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation expectations are accurate, then pay packets are going to be eroded by rising prices in the next few years. This chart from the Resolution Foundation shows how real wages could start falling in 2017, as inflation overtakes nominal pay growth: Eek..... Now this is interesting.... three of the six policymakers at Sweden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Riksbank voted against extending its QE programme by six months. One deputy governor wanted a smaller QE boost, while two more opposed any extension. That forced governor Stefan Ingves to use his casting vote to get today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision through. Shares in Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Monte dei Paschi (MPS) have just been temporarily suspended in Milan after plunging over 8%. The selloff was triggered, I think, by a Reuters report showing that MPS is burning through its \u00e2\u201a\u00ac11bn cash reserves faster than expected. It is now on track to run out of funds in four months time, rather than having almost a year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth of liquidity. Reuters said: Monte dei Paschi said it now expected its net liquidity position, currently standing at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10.6bn, to turn negative after four months. On Sunday the bank had forecast that a current net liquidity position, which was of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac11bn, would turn negative after 11 months under a number of assumptions. Remember, MPS must find \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn of fresh capital by the end of this month. Newsflash from Stockholm: Sweden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank has voted to leave interest rates at their current record low of minus 0.5%. The Riksbank has also extended its asset-purchase scheme by another six months, to maintain its current expansionary monetary policy. The pound is dipping in early trading, down 0.25% against the US dollar to $1.2334, and 0.4% against the euro to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.185. The US dollar itself is edging away from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 14-year high, but remains strong -- possibly too strong, given the political uncertainty in America. Jeremy Cook of World First says: Once again, we have to think that the market is irrationally exuberant heading into the New Year and while the economic side of the new politics is being fully priced in \u00e2\u20ac\u201c US and Chinese stimulus \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the political side of the economics \u00e2\u20ac\u201c policy mistakes and antagonistic trade stances \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are not. The dollar has made an impressive run but our minds keep circling back to the inauguration of Donald Trump on January 20th as a possible turning point. Markets like to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbuy the rumour and sell the fact\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and the swelling of asset prices, the dollar and inflation expectations could be a monster version of this trading plan. We cannot be sure until Trump is in the White House and that is in a month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. Have City traders clocked off for Christmas already? European stock markets have barely shifted in early trading, and are hovering close to their highest level in 11 months. In London, the FTSE 100 has risen by 4 points, or 0.07%. Some breaking news: Britons are expecting inflation to pick up speed over the next few years, according to a new survey. Reuters has the details: The British public\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term expectation for inflation rose to 3% in December, a more than two year high, according to a closely watched survey by polling company YouGov. The survey for U.S. bank Citi showed that in December, people on average expected inflation in 5-10 years to reach 3%, the highest level since September 2014 and up from a November forecast of 2.8%. In the shorter term, respondents to the survey expect inflation in 12 months\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time to be at 2.43% from an earlier forecast of 2.36%. Last month, inflation picked up to 1.2% - and economists expect it to keep rising in 2017. The survey comes after a series of Brexit-inflation stories, including the row between Unilever and Tesco over the price of marmite, and price hikes by US technology firms such as Apple. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Even though its unseasonably mild, this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic data may send a shiver through the City. At 9.30am, we find out how much Britain had to borrow last month to balance the gap between government income and spending. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely to show that the deficit widened to \u00c2\u00a312.2bn in November, up from just \u00c2\u00a34.8bn in October. A poor reading may reignite concerns over the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public finances as we head towards 2017, and a likely economic slowdown. The data may put a few investors off their mince pies, with analysts at RBC Capital Markets saying: November is traditionally a seasonally difficult month for the public finances, and we see a deficit of \u00c2\u00a312bn on the public sector net borrowing (ex-banking groups) measure. Also coming up.... Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government will be pushing on with a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20bn rescue package for its banks, with time running short. Monti dei Paschi, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest lender, is making a last-ditch attempt to raise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn by selling shares to retail investors and investors. But this plan hit another roadblock last night, when the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bank rescue fund expressed concerns about a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.5bn loan that would underpin the deal. If the rescue plan fails, then the Italian state will have to step in. European stock markets are expected to dip this morning, after Wall Street hit record highs (again) last night, and the dollar hit a new 14-year high. Traders will be watching New York later, to see if the Dow Jones index can hit 20,000 for the first time (it rose to 19,974 yesterday). And at 3.30pm GMT, we get a new reading on America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil inventories - a good barometer of demand in the energy sector.",

The shares \u00e2\u20ac\u201c down 85% this year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c slumped by 7.5%. MPS is under instruction from the European Central Bank to bolster its finances after it was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/29/rescue-package-in-place-as-europes-oldest-bank-fails-stress-tests\">weakest of 51 European banks subjected to stress tests</a>.</p> <p>The inability to convince Qatar to put in up to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1bn is expected to lead the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board to concede it would not be able to secure a solution to its capital gap without the Italian government.

It is also expected to have political consequences for Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s controlling Democratic party and Matteo Renzi, the former prime minister who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/11/italy-paolo-gentiloni-to-succeed-matteo-renzi-as-prime-minister\">stepped down from office earlier this month</a> after he was roundly defeated in the 4 December referendum.

With Qatar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereign wealth fund pulling out from the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn cash call, the bank now needs a state bailout to stay afloat. Under the current scenario of low interest rates, massive fines and negligible earnings, the reluctance of the private investors to take on such weak structures is understandable. The Italian parliament has vowed to inject more than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20bn into the bank, in order to prevent a collapse which would have far reaching consequences. If the bank fails, there are strong fears that its collapse could pull down much of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bad debt ridden banking sector with it.</p> <p>The bank had been named as the weakest lender in Europe because of billions of euros of risky loans, failing the EU stress test in July this year. Given this, the Italian government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts cannot end with simple state support, but rather large-scale banking reforms and stringent policy measures are needed.

                "bodyText":"All has gone quiet in Italy, so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to pause this liveblog - but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll try to pop back if anything dramatic happens. Otherwise, keep an eye on the Guardian Business page for fresh developments. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the situation right now, by my colleagues Jill Treanor and Stephanie Kirchgaessner (out in Rome): The Italian government is braced to bail out the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest bank, Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS), which is expected to reveal it has failed to win support from private investors for a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn (\u00c2\u00a34.2bn) rescue package. The board of Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third largest bank was meeting on Thursday after it failed to secure an anchor investor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c thought to be the Qatar sovereign wealth fund \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to support its fundraising effort. Shares in the bank were volatile, lifting off record lows but then falling back in confusion about the next steps. The shares \u00e2\u20ac\u201c down 85% this year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c slumped by 7.5%. MPS is under instruction from the European Central Bank to bolster its finances after it was the weakest of 51 European banks subjected to stress tests. The inability to convince Qatar to put in up to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1bn is expected to lead the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board to concede it would not be able to secure a solution to its capital gap without the Italian government. This means Italy would have to impose losses on bondholders before it could stump up cash because of new EU rules intended to stop taxpayers having to pick up the bill for bank losses. However, about \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2bn of the bonds are held by private investors and there are expectations that an arrangement would be put in place to limit their losses. The Italian cabinet is expected to convene on Thursday to discuss its options for protecting retail investors and to try to limit its eventual stake in the bank to below 50%. The bailout is not just a financial issue. It is also expected to have political consequences for Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s controlling Democratic party and Matteo Renzi, the former prime minister who stepped down from office earlier this month after he was roundly defeated in the 4 December referendum. Paolo Gentiloni has taken over as prime minister for now, but Renzi is expected to run for election again as early as next year. Wolfango Piccoli, an analyst with Teneo Intelligence, said a government rescue might not be immediately damaging politically, in large part because public attention will be diverted from the issue during the Christmas period. But the issue could become \u00e2\u20ac\u0153politically toxic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd later, once it becomes clear how many of the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s junior bondholders are eventually compensated for their losses, and how long it takes for them to be paid.... Piccoli said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In terms of the junior bondholders, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s see what happens. it will eventually be decided by Brussels,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Once MPS is saved, a number of other banks could also require government support, keeping the issue in the news for the foreseeable future. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This will drag on for some time. If we have elections in May or June, it will be used then [against Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Democratic party], and there is no way to deflect that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s their full story: Shares on Monte dei Paschi (MPS) have slumped to a new all-time low tonight, as investors anticipate a state bailout for the bank. After another volatile day, they closed down 7.5% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15.08 - around 99.85% lower than in early 2007. MPS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apparent failure to raise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn in new capital means investors now expect the Italian government to step in; a move which could end up with it owning a large stake in the bank. Paresh Davdra, CEO and Co-Founder of RationalFX, says: The failure of MPS to secure \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn from an anchor investor will have far ranging implications, as the Italian government prepares for a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20bn bailout. With the Italian banking sector in an incredibly fragile state and the ongoing Deutsche Bank situation creating uncertainty in Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking system as a whole, an unsuccessful rescue effort could destabilise the Eurozone. So, what happens next with Monte dei Paschi? We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re basically waiting for the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board to conclude their meeting, and submit their request for state aid (having failed to raise the necessary \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn from private investors to strengthen their balance sheet). Then the ball is in new prime minister Paolo Gentiloni\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s court; will his cabinet meet this evening, or push the decision back to Friday? Reuters reckons it could go either way. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s their latest report: Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government will meet late Thursday or early Friday before European markets open to discuss an emergency decree to bail out troubled bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. The salvage of Monte dei Paschi would be part of a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20bn safety net that Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni plans to set up beneath the banking industry. Gentiloni said on Thursday the cabinet would meet on Friday to discuss measures to help Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s under-developed southern regions. He did not mention the banking decree, leaving open the door on a late-night meeting on Thursday. European stock markets have closed for the night, after a fairly dull day dominated by worries over Monte dei Paschi. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 gained 22 points, or 0.3%, to 7063, led by precious metals producers and defensive stocks including ITV, Whitbread and Tui Travel. Mining stocks, and banks, led the fallers. Across Europe, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB weakened by 0.5% as investors braced for the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest banking bailout in many years, while the German DAX lost 0.2% and the French CAC closed flat. Meanwhile on Wall Street, the Dow Jones has slipped a little deeper into the red, and a little further from the 20,000 point milestone. Robert O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Daly of The Economist Intelligence Unit agrees that Monte dei Paschi is heading for a state rescue, now that its attempt to raise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn from private investors has faltered. He also predicts that populist parties could get an electoral boost, if more banks require government help. O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Daly writes: We expect the state to approve the MPS board\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s request to inject capital. This will require a bail-in of junior bondholders, though the state may move to compensate retail bondholders. The government is putting in place a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20bn fund to shore up MPS and other weak banks. More broadly, we believe that addressing Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking woes would be manageable from an economic standpoint, as market estimates place the costs of cleaning up the banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bad loans at 2.5% of GDP or less. If mishandled, MPS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recapitalisation and future efforts to address other problematic banks could further inflate populist rhetoric at Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next national election campaign, following the boon for anti-establishment parties provided by the resounding \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd vote at the referendum. Over in New York, the US stock market has opened with barely a grunt. The Dow Jones industrial average has dipped by 8 points in muted trading, to 19,933. That takes it away from its record highs, and further way from the much-obsessed about 20,000 mark. Back to Monte dei Paschi.... and the Financial Times also reckons that the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board will meet later today to discuss their next move,. With MPS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capital raising push now over, the FT says: According to people close to the matter, the Italian cabinet will meet to approve the bailout of MPS late on Thursday or early on Friday, after the MPS board has requested help. The MPS board was not expected to make any statement until after the end of trading on Thursday, those people said. The FT also reports that Rome\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government will try to protect small bondholders, if there is a bailout: Due to EU rules designed to limit the hit to taxpayers, the government rescue will impose losses on MPS shareholders and junior bondholders, making them share some of the financial burden. Italian officials said that they would move to compensate some of the 40,000 MPS retail bondholders who might take a hit, though institutional investors would not be spared. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The scheme is ready\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, said one senior Italian official. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The burden-sharing principle will be respected but we will try to limit the damage to savers as much as possible. Breaking news from America: the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy grew even faster than previously thought in the third quarter of 2016. US GDP expanded by an annual rate of 3.5% in the July-to-September period, up from a previous estimate of 3.2%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the equivalent of a quarterly growth rate of around 0.85% -- much faster than Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 0.5% growth in the same period. This shows that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is growing at the fastest pace in two years, driven by a 3% rise in consumer spending, a 10% jump in exports, and a rise in companies restocking their inventories: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flurry of other economic data flashing across my terminal too, including the news that New orders for US-made capital goods (heavy-duty machinery, electronics) jumped by 0.9% last month (excluding aircraft sales). The number of new claims for unemployment benefit hit a six-month high of 275,000 last week. The clocks in Siena have chimed two o\u00e2\u20ac\u2122clock, which means that Monte dei Paschi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempt to raise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn from private investors has officially ended. Unless something remarkable happened in the last few hours, MPS will have failed to hit its target. As we flagged up this morning, MPS had only managed to raise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2bn, once the Qatar sovereign wealth fund declined to back the plan last night. One insider tells us that the Monte dei Paschi board will now meet to plan their next move. They could decide to ask Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government for assistance tonight, to help the bank reach its \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn target. Any rescue plan could also force losses on investors who hold MPS bonds; under European banking rules, these bondholders must be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbailed in\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, before the state can help. But the Italian government will be keen to avoid penalising the retail investors (individuals, families, small businesses...) who hold debt issued by the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest bank..... So they could look to find a way of compensating them (one theory is that anyone holding less than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac100,000 of bonds is protected, as with retail savings accounts). Monte dei Paschi isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only Italian bank in a fix. Economists estimate that Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking sector needs more than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac50bn in fresh capital, to help it tackle its bad debts. Unicredit, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest bank, got the ball rolling with a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13bn cash call last week, but many other lenders have not yet acted. This chart from Bloomberg shows how the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20bn set aside by the Italian government this week might not be enough: Mihir Kapadia, CEO and Founder of Sun Global Investments, argues that the sector needs deep-rooted reforms, as well as fresh capital. He writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Shares of Monte dei Paschi di Siena have fallen further as efforts to raise private capital failed at the eleventh hour. With Qatar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereign wealth fund pulling out from the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn cash call, the bank now needs a state bailout to stay afloat. Under the current scenario of low interest rates, massive fines and negligible earnings, the reluctance of the private investors to take on such weak structures is understandable. The Italian parliament has vowed to inject more than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20bn into the bank, in order to prevent a collapse which would have far reaching consequences. If the bank fails, there are strong fears that its collapse could pull down much of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bad debt ridden banking sector with it. The bank had been named as the weakest lender in Europe because of billions of euros of risky loans, failing the EU stress test in July this year. Given this, the Italian government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts cannot end with simple state support, but rather large-scale banking reforms and stringent policy measures are needed. Unless this is achieved a banking crisis looks almost inevitable. This is not just a threat to Italy, but for the larger Eurozone, the euro and the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political future.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Electric carmaker Tesla has become the latest firm to raise the cost of its products in the UK, in response to the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline this year. The company told some UK showrooms that prices will go up at the start of next month. In an email, Tesla said: We have just received some information that we need to share with you \u00e2\u20ac\u201c due to currency fluctuations we will be increasing our UK prices for custom orders by 5% on 1 January 2017.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Prices on showroom and pre-owned cars will remain fixed at current prices.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: The fog has now lifted in London, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little else to report from the City. After three hours of trading, Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial markets still seem becalmed, as people wait for Monte dei Paschi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cash call to formally end after lunchtime (2pm in Italy, or 1pm GMT). Some investors are hopeful that the saga will soon end. As LC Macro Advisors head, Lorenzo Codogno, explains (via Reuters):. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This situation has dragged on for years without a clear solution. Now a solution is in sight. My perception is that the government backstop will be welcomed by financial markets and it will be a plus for the (Italian) economy as well.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pleased that a rescue might take three whole months (see earlier post): Risk appetite remains hampered by thinner holiday trading into Christmas as well as talk of a Monte dei Paschi bailout taking a whopping 3-months to complete, taking us well beyond a supposed 31 Dec deadline for shoring up Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s knackered banks. An official announcement still eludes markets which understandably want clarity on the issue. The Financial Times flag up that some Monte dei Paschi savers have been taking money out of the bank in recent months, as its funding crisis accelerated. More here (\u00c2\u00a3). Toby Nangle, top multi-asset manager at Columbia Threadneedle, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced that the Treasury Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new inquiry into the Bank of England will crack the mysteries of monetary policy. After all, the BoE does devote plenty of time to assessing whether its measures are working. So MPs (or their staffers) may find themselves wading through long, competing theories about how interest rates and quantitative easing works. Toby tweets: But...economist Shaun Richards is encouraged that MPs have launched an inquiry into the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work: Newsflash from London: A group of influential MPs have just launched an inquiry into the effectiveness of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy since the financial crisis struck. The Treasury committee will investigate whether the Bank of England was right to slash interest rates to record lows, and buy up hundreds of billions of government bonds with new money. They will examine whether this policy has actually worked, what impact it has had on savers, house prices and struggling companies, and whether policymakers are now out of ammunition to fight the next crisis. The move follows growing criticism of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions in the crisis, most notably from prime minister Theresa May. The BoE, though, insists that it has acted sensibly to protect the economy and preserve jobs. Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie explains why MPs are now taking action: Interest rates are stuck near zero, the Bank of England has used increasingly unconventional forms of quantitative easing, and inflation has been below the two per cent target for three years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The efficacy of monetary policy or otherwise, its unintended consequences, and its prospects, need careful examination. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Treasury Committee will continue to act as a safeguard on the operational independence of the Bank. The Treasury indemnity, which underpins parts of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy, could all too easily encourage the Treasury, or politicians, to put undue pressure on the Bank. The Committee will examine the risks of that, too.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here are the terms of reference for the inquiry: The effectiveness of monetary policy in meeting the inflation target: The effectiveness of holding Bank rate near zero and whether extremely low rates can encourage more, rather than less, saving The effectiveness of quantitative easing and whether it has met with diminishing returns The scope for further expansion of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153qualitative easing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (e.g. corporate bond purchases) Whether forward guidance effectively binds the Bank to a policy course, and the desirability of doing so The unintended consequences of monetary policy The impact on asset-price inflation, the housing market and financial stability The implications for the long-term sustainability of pensions and savings income The distributional impact The impact on competition, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153zombie companies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and productivity The effects on the structure of relative prices in capital and commodity markets and the consequences for capital allocation, productivity and the trade cycle The implications of a large balance sheet and the Treasury indemnity for Bank accountability and its relationship with the government and other agencies The use of macro-prudential, fiscal and other policy to counterbalance any unintended consequences of monetary policy The prospects for monetary policy The drivers behind and prospects for low real interest rates in the UK and globally What is the significance for monetary policy of rises in bond yields since the US election? The impact and trade-offs of tightening monetary policy in the near-term Whether monetary policy is currently out of ammunition for the next crisis Options for raising the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153natural rate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of interest (e.g. fiscal policy, promoting investment) Scrap what we said about MPS buyers being in short supply -- its shares are now up 3% on the day. At this stage in proceedings, and with prices so low, we probably shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t read too much into it. Monte dei Paschi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are having one of those mornings; they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already been suspended once, after plunging over 6%: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets have dipped into the red in early, subdued trading. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no sign of the traditional \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Santa Rally\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd yet; perhaps it has been lost in the fog gripping London this morning. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx sums up the mood: Once again the main news surrounded Monte dei Paschi. With the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest bank rapidly running out of time to raise the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5 billion in capital it desperately needs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only managed \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2 billion so far, with a key Qatari investors choosing not to invest a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1 billion chunk \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it looks like MPS will be forced into a government bailout. Italy approved a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20 billion increase to its debt ceiling yesterday, freeing up money for its ailing banks, starting with Monte dei Paschi. This news has begun to drag on the rest of the European banking sector, with the likes of Deutsche Bank, Barclays and Lloyds all dipping their toes into the red after the bell. This in turn capped the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s indices, with the DAX and CAC falling 0.1% and 0.2% respectively. Update: Shares in Monte Dei Paschi have finally opened, and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re down 6.75% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15.20. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already shed more than 99% of their value in the last decade, as this graph from blogger Jeroen Blokland shows: Shares in Monte dei Paschi have failed to open at the start of trading in Milan. Buyers may be in short supply today, as they risk being wiped out if the Italian state has to bail the bank out  . Italian newspaper Il Sole 24 is reporting that the rescue of Monte Dei Paschi might take two or three months. The paper says that the details haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been worked out yet, but that MPS would initially be able to tap state guarantees to bolster its liquidity. That would help MPS avoid running out of cash, now that Qatar has declined to back its \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn cash call. A long-term recapitalisation plan would take longer; and involve MPS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s management presenting a new business plan. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Monte dei Paschi di Siena has been through a lot since it was founded back in 1472, twenty years before Columbus discovered America. And the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest bank finds itself in the undignified position of needing a bailout this morning, after efforts to persuade private investors to provide desperately needed fresh capital floundered. Monte dei Paschi di Siena admitted last night that Qatar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereign wealth fund had not been persuaded to become the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153anchor investor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to underpin its \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn cash call. So a saga that has been dragging on for months could finally be resolved today, when the cash call closes at lunchtime today. Without private sector capital, MPS is now likely to miss an end of year deadline imposed by the European Central Bank to raise fresh funds. So the Italian government is now under serious time pressure to step in and put in fresh capital itself. As we wrote last night, MPS is running out of time and options. Shares in the bank, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third largest, gyrated wildly in Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading session, plunging 18% to record lows before closing 12% lower amid rumours that the fund-raising effort would fail. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The idea that Qatar could be an anchor investor has vanished and without an anchor investor there is no demand from anyone else,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd one source told Reuters. In the last few minutes, the bank reported that it had only raised \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2bn in new capital through the debt-for-equity swap, far short of the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn target. Yesterday, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government prepared for a rescue bid by approving a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20bn fund for bank recapitalisation. Ministers have also insisted that there will be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153minimised or non-existent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd impact on savers. But shareholders, and those who hold MPS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s junior, and riskier, bonds could suffer losses. Also coming up today The Dow Jones industrial average will have another tilt at smashing through the 20,000 point mark, after faltering and falling back from record highs yesterday. We get a flurry of US economic data, including new personal consumption and durable goods orders at 1.30pm GMT, plus the latest weekly jobless report -- and a new estimate of American growth in the last quarter. And rumours continue to swirl that Deutsche Bank might be close to a settlement with the Department of Justice, over misconduct before the 2008 financial crisis.",

Meanwhile, Bovis Homes is down over 5%, dragging the housebuilder sector with it, as it issues an unexpected warning on completion levels.</p> <p>It is always tough to issue a profit warning, but doubly so in the fallow period between Christmas and the New Year.

                "bodyText":"Right, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for today. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my news story about the FTSE 100 hitting a new record high tonight, for anyone just tuning in. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow for more live coverage of events in the markets and the world economy. Thanks, and goodnight (and enjoy the holidays, if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not back at work yet...). GW Wall Street is failing to match the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead. Shares are dropping back, so the Dow Jones is down almost 100 points at 19,847. That suggests that the Dow is not going to hit the 20,000 mark today. At least that gives us something to watch out for tomorrow. This is what I was banging on about earlier -- the FTSE 100 is actually down 6% this year if you measure it in US dollars (rather than up 13% in pounds). The London stock market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally has helped to drive up the wealth of the richest in society, as well as boosting the value of pension funds and other asset managers. Indeed, 2016 has been a vintage year for the ultra-rich - despite the backlash against populism this year (or perhaps helping to trigger it). Bloomberg has calculated that the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s billionaires are ending the year owning $237 billion more than on January 1st. Some of the most famous, including Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, did particularly well \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nice to remember that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re donating much of their wealth to charity. It was a turbulent year, though, with the US election, the Brexit vote, and various other shocks and panics meaning fortunes fluctuated over the last 12 months. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: The World\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Richest Made $237 Billion This Year With excellent timing, Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s JP Spinetto has highlighted how the British pound has been one of the worst-performing currencies this year. Sterling has shed 17%, which puts the 13% jump in the FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value this year into some context. This chart of the FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best-performing shares shows how mining stocks drove the market to tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record close: But property firms fell, after housebuilder Bovis warned on profits early this morning after failing to build as many homes as planned. With just two trading days to go, the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mining sector in on track for its best year the aftermath of the financial crisis. The Telegraph\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tara Cunningham explains: London-listed miners are poised for their biggest annual gain since 2009 as firmer oil and commodity prices pushed the sector higher. So far this year, the FTSE 350 mining index has rallied by 102%. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s her full report. Ruth Lea, economic adviser at Arbuthnot Banking Group, points out that the FTSE 250 index of smaller UK firms has also rallied since June: City traders often talk about a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Santa Rally\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd this time of year, and once again the markets have provided. David Cheetham, market analyst at online trading group XTB, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Observers of the markets have for many years noticed a strong propensity for stocks to rise in the period between Christmas and the New Year and this phenomenon appears to be playing out once more.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (thanks to the Press Association for the quote). Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 record high comes 20 months after the previous historic closing level. That closing high, in April 2015, was followed by a sharp summer selloff triggered by fears over China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. This was compounded by concerns of a global slowdown in December 2015 when the US central bank raised interest rates for the first time in a decade. But shares then recovered from February this year, and even the Brexit vote was only a blip in the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s march back over 7100 points. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally means the FTSE 100 is now 12% higher than on the day of the EU referendum in June. That means that the value of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest listed companies jumped by 12% in sterling terms since the vote. But... the pound is down by 10% against the euro since June, and around 17% weaker against the US dollar. NEWSFLASH: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has hit its new all-time closing high, driven by strong gains in the mining sector. The blue-chip FTSE 100 just closed 37 points higher at 7106.08, beating the 7103.98 point mark set in April 2015. Mining companies drove the rally, on hopes of robust US economic growth next year. That sent the prices of copper, oil, etc up today, along with precious metals producers. Silver miner Fresnillo and gold producer Randgold both gained around 5% today, followed by BHP Billiton (+4.2%) and Rio Tinto (+3.3%). Internationally focused companies also benefitted from the weaker pound today, as it makes their exports more competitive. However, housebuilding shares suffered following this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit warning from Bovis Homes (which ended down 5.2%). Chris Beauchamp, Chief Market Analyst at IG, says London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s traders came back from Christmas with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a festive bounce in their step\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The FTSE 100 is the star performer today, helped on its way higher by an excellent turn from the index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mining contingent. The sector was one of the really big winners in 2016, making a remarkable comeback over the past twelve months, and it makes sense to think that investors are looking to juice a few more points out of the rally as the year-end approaches. Meanwhile, Bovis Homes is down over 5%, dragging the housebuilder sector with it, as it issues an unexpected warning on completion levels. It is always tough to issue a profit warning, but doubly so in the fallow period between Christmas and the New Year. The sector has gone from being a star performer in recent years to one of the hardest hit since Brexit; miners were the contrarian play for 2016, so the same could be said of a housing sector still supported by healthy demand and constricted supply. As flagged earlier, though, there is one proviso -- the FTSE 100 is priced in sterling, so today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record high has not been adjusted for the fall in sterling since the Brexit vote. Right, the FTSE 100 has entered its closing auction.....so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find out any moment if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hit a new all-time closing high. Back in the City, the FTSE 100 is hovering around its highest ever closing level in late trading. The index is up 31 points at 7099, having earlier burst over its record closing level (7103.98). So we might get a new record high in around 30 minutes.... The Dow has now dropped into the red, down 23 points at 19,921, as the 20k mark proves a hurdle too far..... We haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen the Dow hitting 20,000 points yet, but we have had the next best thing -- a group of pets helping to ring the opening bell on Wall Street. Best Friends Animal Society had the honour of opening the session, to highlight their work preventing dogs and cats at America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shelters being put down. And the group delighted traders by turning up with several impeccably behaved pooches, as this video shows. The Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early rally is fizzling out, after just 20 minutes of trading. Rather than powering over the 20,000 point mark, the benchmark index has subsided back to its opening levels - like a Christmas diner who over-indulged on the mince pies and rather fancies a quiet day. US stock market watchers are bracing for another day of tension.... The Dow is rising at the start of trading... up 29 points to 19,974, and bringing the 20k landmark even closer. And the tech-heavy Nasdaq index has hit a new all-time high at the open, as the Trump Rally continues to drive shares higher. The opening bell is ringing on Wall Street, and traders are squinting at their screens to see if the Dow Jones will hit the 20,000 mark for the first time ever.... Tensions is building on Wall Street as traders wonder whether the Dow Jones industrial average could smash through the 20,000 point mark today. Last night, the Dow ended the day just 55 points shy of this new record. And the futures market suggests that the index could open higher at 9.30am local time (2.30pm GMT). Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says: Thee Santa rally for the equity market continues and every single day investors hope that the DOW index breaks that 20K mark, but so far their wish has not been granted. The 20K mark for the Dow has become a remarkable resistance and a break of this, could attract fresh capital. The London stock market isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only one rallying today. Overnight, the Australian ASX 100 index jumped by 1% to its highest level in 2016, also thanks to demand for mining company shares. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, analyst at London Capital Group, explains: Australian stocks hit the highest levels of this year and are set for a strong close on the back of higher commodity prices and firm appetite in global stock markets following Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory in the US presidential election. The FTSE 100 is rising partly because the pound is falling. Sterling remains at a two-month low against the US dollar, which pushes up the value of international firms listed in London. The euro is also losing ground against the dollar, down almost one cent at $1.0397: This chart shows how the FTSE 100 is back at April 2015\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record closing level, in sterling terms anyway (ignoring the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall against the US dollar since the Brexit vote) Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue-chip index of the biggest listed companies has just crept above its alltime closing high. In quiet trading, the FTSE 100 has risen by 35 points to above 7104 points, driven up by mining companies. That takes the index a whisker over the previous record closing high, of 7103.98, set in April 2015. This also puts the Footsie close to its highest ever level -- the all-time intraday high of 7128 points recorded in October. We should note that trading volumes are really rather thin, with many traders still off for Christmas (having banked their profits/losses for the year). And these figures don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take account of the slump in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote. But still, it illustrates that investors are anticipating a US fiscal stimulus package next year. Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong American consumer confidence figures, which were the best in 15 years, have also bolstered sentiment, helping to push up the price of copper and oil today. BHP Billiton, which produces iron ore, copper, coal and gold, is leading the risers with a 4.3% gain, with silver miner Fresnillo close behind, followed by fellow mining giants Anglo American (+4%) and Rio Tinto (+3.5%). Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Equities are posting small gains amid thin intra-holiday trading that is maintaining the Santa Rally into year-end. The FTSE is boosted by higher oil prices supporting the commodities space, offsetting weakness among some big defensives, airlines (Airbus problems) and real estate (rates to rise and prices to fall in 2017?) Sterling has fallen to its lowest level since late October, as it ends the year on a weak note. The pound has dropped by 0.4% this morning against the US dollar, to $1.223. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no obvious trigger for the move, which comes as City experts predict further losses next year. A new survey by financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown found that a majority of respondents expect the sterling/US dollar rate to end 2017 at lower than $1.25. Some 40% predicting steeper declines to under $1.20. Many of those polled predicted that the US dollar could rally, if Donald Trump pushes through a new fiscal stimulus plan. One respondent says: Full implementation will likely [lead to] a second material leg higher of the US dollar as the Fed is priced to react to inflationary pressures such a package would bring. However, implementation of President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s protectionist and isolationist rhetoric would narrow the breadth of any dollar rally, with the Japanese yen and the euro the beneficiaries.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Other forecasters, though, think the pound has been oversold, and could bounce back once Brexit negotiations begin. Stockbroking firm Numis is hopeful that Bovis will get back on track next year, despite missing its housebuilding targets for 2016. They say: Bovis has announced that due to production delays and the deferral of 180 completions into 2017, it now anticipates full year results to be c11% below Numis expectations. We are leaving 2017 estimates unchanged reflecting the expected completion of the deferred units and a better position with regard to planning and production. The drop in UK mortgage approvals last month could be a sign that the property sector will struggle next year. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight believes that prices could actually fall, after several years of strong increases. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his reaction to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BBA report: We believe the fundamentals for house buyers will progressively deteriorate during 2017 with consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 purchasing power weakening markedly and the labour market likely softening. Increasing economic uncertainty is also likely to weigh down on consumer confidence and willingness to engage in major transactions such as buying a house. Housing market activity and prices are also likely to be pressurized by stretched house prices to earnings ratios and tight checking of prospective mortgage borrowers by lenders However, the downside for house prices will be limited markedly by a shortage of houses for sale. On balance, we suspect that house prices will be essentially flat over the year. Indeed, we believe that a small drop in house prices in 2017 is just as likely to occur as a small rise. BREAKING: The number of new mortgage approved in the UK fell last month, in another sign that the property sector is slowing. High street banks approved 40,659 new loans for home purchases in November, down from 40,835 in October, and 9% lower than a year ago. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also rather less than City expectations -- some economists expected as many as 41,400 new loans to be approved: The British Bankers Association also reports that gross mortgage borrowing fell by 5% compared to November 2015, to \u00c2\u00a312.2bn. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key slide from the BBA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly report: The report also shows that consumers are continuing to borrow to fund their shopping. The BBA says: Consumer credit annual growth fell back in November to around 6% despite strong retail sales. Growth continues to be supported in the case of personal loans by favourable interest rates. Bovis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure to hit its sales targets this year could be a sign that the UK housing sector is now suffering from the Brexit vote. Analyst Russ Mould of stockbrokers AJ Bell says: A profit warning from FTSE 250 firm Bovis is another crack in the wall when it comes to the house builders sector.... Bovis has today stated that legal completion volumes will rise by just 1% to 2% in 2016 year, rather than the targeted 5% as the sale of 180 homes has slipped from this year to next, owing to slower-than-expected build production in December. This means completion volumes fell by 1% to 2% year on year in the second half, raising questions as to whether the market is slowing down in a post-Brexit world after all. Even if Bovis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 average selling price rose 10% to around \u00c2\u00a3255,000 for the year that again implies a marked second-half deceleration, as prices rose 14% to an average of \u00c2\u00a3254,500 in the first six months of this year. Management guidance for pre-tax profits of between \u00c2\u00a3160 million and \u00c2\u00a3170 million implies a 10% miss relative to the analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 consensus of \u00c2\u00a3184 million at the mid-point and that helps to explain why the shares are down 4% this morning at the opening. Despite Bovis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woes, the London stock market has risen slightly in the first trading day of the week. The blue-chip FTSE 100 has gained 15 points to 7084, led by mining companies such as BHP Billiton (+4%) and Anglo American (+3%). Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jump in US consumer confidence to the highest level since 2001 is fuelling hopes for robust economic growth in 2017, which would drive demand for copper, iron ore, nickel and the like. Shares in UK housebuilders are falling in early trading, following Bovis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unscheduled warning on profits. Bovis fell over 5%, followed by rival building firms Crest Nicholson (-1.7%), Berkeley Group (-1.6%) and John Laing (-1.3%). Traders must be worried that Bovis isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only company to experience a slowdown last month. Financial journalist Daniel Coatsworth points out that Bovis weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expected to released results until early January. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more reaction: Newsflash: One of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest housebuilders has warned that it will fail to sell as many homes as planned this year. Bovis Homes has sent an early shiver through the chilly City of London, by reporting that production was slower than expected this month. That means Bovis will sell around 180 homes less than expected, which will make a dent in its profits for the year too. In a statement to the City, Bovis warns: We expect the volume delivery for 2016 will be lower than previously anticipated at between 3,950 and 4,000 homes, the exact number depending on the extent of legal completions in the remaining days of the year. We have experienced slower than expected build production across the Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sites during December, resulting in approximately 180 largely built and sold private homes which were expected to complete in 2016 being deferred into early 2017. Bovis now expects to bank pre-tax profits of around \u00c2\u00a3160m to \u00c2\u00a3170m for 2016 -- compared with \u00c2\u00a3160.1m in 2015. Analysts had expected around \u00c2\u00a3183m, so the City will be disappointed. Reaction to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial workers are making their way back to their desks through the fog this morning, after a four-day Christmas holiday. Hopefully everyone had a lovely break, even though fears over what the future will bring may have dampened the atmosphere over the turkey and trimmings. In particular, the prospect of a new president in the Oval Office, and Britain triggering the process of exiting the European Union, is worrying many UK executives. The Chartered Management Institute is warning this morning that a majority of managers in the UK believe Brexit-related uncertainty will hold back economic growth in 2017, with many also expecting long-term economic damage. My colleague Katie Allen explains: In a survey of 1,118 managers, the CMI found 65% were pessimistic about the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic outlook for the next 12-18 months. Their caution over 2017 followed what appeared to be a tough year for many organisations, when only 39% said they had grown, the lowest proportion since 2012 when the shockwaves from the eurozone debt crisis hit the UK economy. A further 39% said business levels had stayed roughly the same in 2016 and 22% said their business had declined. Asked about the impact of Brexit on economic growth in the next three to five years, 49% thought it would be negative. But a sizeable 37% believed leaving the EU would have a positive impact on the UK economy and 14% said it would have no impact. The findings follow signs that businesses are becoming more nervous about hiring and investing as Brexit negotiations approach. Companies and individuals have also become more concerned about costs because the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp fall since the referendum has made imports such as fuel and food ingredients to the UK more expensive. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: Also coming up today At 9.30am, the British Bankers Association will report how many new mortgage loans were approved in November. Economists expect a small rise, from 40,851 to 41,100, despite that Brexit uncertainty. European stock markets are likely to be fairly subdued, after a thin trading day yesterday. Wall Street was also open on Tuesday, but the Dow Jones index again failed to smash through the 20,000 point mark even though US consumer confidence jumped to a 15-year high. The figures underline how the US economy has strengthened this year. However, a certain someone thinks he should get the credit.... We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

                "bodyText":"The FTSE 100 may have been toasting a new closing peak, but elsewhere in Europe shares were drifting lower, with banking stocks proving a drag on markets. The final scores in Europe showed: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dipped 0.21% to 11,451.05 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.2% lower at 4838.47 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.18% to 19,203.94 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.19% at 9327.1 But in Greece, the Athens market added 0.15% to 636.67 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is drifting away from the 20,000 level and is currently down 18 points at 19,815. Meanwhile, after initially shrugging off an unexpected rise in US crude inventories, oil prices have edged marginally lower, with Brent now down 0.37% at $56.01 a barrel. As for the FTSE 100, it has hit a record high for the second day running, so here is our story giving the background to Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new peak: On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow for the last trading day of the year. It looked a bit unlikely as the FTSE 100 drifted lower for much of the day, but the leading index managed a last minute dash to a new closing high. The index ended 14.18 points higher at 7120.26, within sight of the all time record reached on 11 October this year. With gold and silver prices moving higher, precious metal miners such as Randgold Resources and Fresnillo helped push the index into record territory. Meanwhile the more UK-focused FTSE 250 added just 2.61 points to 18,015.42 and is some distance away from its own peak of 18,607 achieved in early October. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has dipped lower - down around 7 points - while the FTSE 100 has shied away from a new closing high and is now 4 points lower. On the Dow, Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: After yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisive turn lower for US markets there has been little sign of fresh bullish momentum. Barring a miracle, Dow 20,000 looks off the cards, although the rebound in the index over the past year, as in other US markets, has been astounding. Only time will tell if the Trump euphoria can be sustained, or whether we are due another correction early on in the New Year. Oil prices are little changed following the release of the latest US data, with Brent crude up 0.5% at $56.50 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate more or less flat at $54.03. US crude stocks showed a surprise rise last week, according to official figures. Inventories rose by 614,000 barrels to 486m compared to forecasts of a 2.1m barrel decrease, according to the Energy Information Administration. But gasoline stocks fell by 1.6m barrels rather than the expected 1.3m barrel increase. Despite the Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reluctance to surge towards 20,000, the FTSE 100 has just edged into positive territory. Could we yet have a new closing high? US markets are mainly edging ahead in early trading, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average regaining a little ground after Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s triple digit decline and moved another step closer to the so far elusive 20,000 barrier. The Dow is currently up 36 points at 19869 while the S&amp;P 500 opened marginally higher and the Nasdaq composite marginally lower. Oil is holding steady ahead of the latest US inventory figures from the Department of Energy. On Wednesday the American Petroleum Institute reported a surprise 4.2m barrel increase in weekly US crude stocks compared to an expected fall of 2.1m barrels. But ahead of the official DoE figures, Brent crude is up 0.44% at $56.47 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate is 0.18% lower at $53.96. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters on the US data: A drop in U.S. exports last month pushed the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit in goods higher while the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell last week in a positive sign for the labor market. The two reports released on Thursday suggested that when Donald Trump becomes president next month, the labor market will likely be at roughly full strength and international trade could be weighing on the economy. In an initial estimate that does not include trade in services, the Commerce Department said America exported $1.2 billion less in November than in October. Imports rose by $2.2 billion during the month. The full trade report for November is due on Jan. 6... Separately, initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 265,000 for the week ended Dec. 24, the Labor Department said. It was the 95th straight week that claims were below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market. That is the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller. The department said in a statement there were no special factors affecting claims last week although estimating the data can be more difficult around holiday periods. The department said the actual number of claims was estimated by government staff for 10 states. More on the US trade gap, from Deutsche Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief US economist: Gracious me, we have TWO little pieces of economic news. Firstly, America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit has swelled by 5.5%. New figures from the Commerce Department show that the US trade gap widened to $65.3bn in November, up from $61.9bn in October. Exports shrank by $1.2bn to $121.7bn, while America imported $187bn of stuff, $2.2bn more than in October. Secondly, the number of Americans filing new unemployment claims has fallen by 10,000, to 265,000. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s broadly in line with forecasts, and shows that the US labour market remains resilient. That will reassure the US Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates earlier this month. As it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quiet, what better time to catch up with the biggest business stories of 2016? We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve crunched the numbers, and found that the Brexit vote, and the US election\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impact on the markets, were the most popular issues this year. Our daily liveblog did well again too - so thanks to all readers for keeping our numbers up :) Fiona Walsh, business editor of Theguardian.com, explains: Six of our 10 most-read articles covered the aftermath of the shock EU referendum result, from the trillions wiped off global markets to the plummeting pound and the prospect of negative interest rates. There was Donald Trump too, of course, and an apocalyptic warning from economists in January to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sell everything\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd before a new crash. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full 10 Ten: I fear America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bring much excitement today either. The futures market is suggesting Wall Street will open little changed, in 90 minutes time, after the S&amp;P 500 fell by almost 0.9% yesterday (its biggest drop since the US election). Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, has now criticised the European Central Bank for demanding that Monte Dei Paschi raise more new capital than previously planned. Gentiloni told reporters that he got the news on Christmas Day - which may have rather spoiled the turkey and sprouts. And Gentiloni wants to see the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s workings out, echoing finance minister Padoan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns. Reuters has the story: The European Central Bank should discuss with Italy the reasons behind its assessment that Banca Monte dei Paschi had a greater need for capital than previously thought, Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said on Thursday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is important that the motives for this assessment are shared in discussions in the coming months,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Gentiloni told a news conference. He added he had been surprised on December 25 to receive news that the regulator wanted Monte Paschi to plug a capital shortfall of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac8.8bn, higher than a previous estimate of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn. Pier Carlo Padoan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism of the ECB comes as Italian banking shares post fresh losses today. UBI Banca, Unicredit and Banca Popolare di Milano are all among the biggest fallers on the Stoxx Europe 600 banks index (which tracks Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stocks). Investors are edgy that the cost of recapitalising the Italian banking sector may be going up, after the ECB demand that Monte Dei Paschi raises more capital than expected. Over in Italy, finance minister Pier Carlo Padoan has lashed out at the European Central Bank over its handling of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest bank, Monte Dei Paschi (MPS). Earlier this week, the ECB told MPS that it needs to raise almost \u00e2\u201a\u00ac9bn in new capital, sharply higher than the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5bn which it had tried, and failed, to attract from private investors. Rome\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government is now stepping in to rescue MPC, and Padoan sounds rather unimpressed that the bill had gone up. Speaking to financial newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore, Padoan said the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new demands would leave MPS \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hyper-capitalised\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He also criticised the Frankfurt-based central bank for not explaining its thinking more clearly: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It would have been useful to receive additional information from the ECB Supervisory Board on the criteria used for such a valuation, since it has consequences for the other banks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In addition to a letter of five lines and three numbers, some explanation would have been useful; opaque moves without an explanation lead people to think that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something wrong behind it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd MPS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liquidity position has been worsening in recent months, with some savers taking money out of the lender.

After a festively slow start, the FTSE 100 has roused itself after its 8am selloff, and crept back to 7106 points - last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record closing level. Trading is still pretty quiet, with many City workers still enjoying a Christmas break. Many mining stocks are still in the red today, following commodity prices down. And banks across Europe are under pressure, partly due to worries over Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking bailout. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, analyst at London Capital Group, says the markets are being cautious after commodity prices retreated in Asia overnight, meaning: A combination of profit-taking and risk-off is weighing on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 100 largest caps in London. She also suggests the US stock market could fall, if the latest trade and unemployment figures, due at 1.30pm, miss expectations. The US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s November trade balance and the weekly jobless claims are due out today. Any disappointment could cause a further disillusion regarding the US recovery and encourage a deeper correction in the US markets, given that there is room for significant pullback following the relentless, two-month rally in the US stock markets following Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appointment as the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 next president. Is London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s house price boom fizzling out? Prices in the capital only rose by an annual rate of 3.7% in in the last quarter, compared to a UK average of 4.5%, according to new figures from the Nationwide building society. This is the first time since 2008 that London prices have lagged the national average (although obviously houses are still much pricier than elsewhere). Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, expects prices to rise by 2% in 2017, although there is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a greater degree of uncertainty than usual\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The story of UK house price growth in 2016 was one of relative stability. Annual house price growth ended 2016 at 4.5%, the same as the rate recorded in 2015. There were signs that London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s significant period of outperformance may be drawing to a close.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Nationwide also reports that a typical first-time buyer in London would have to be in the top 90th percentile of earners (ie, one of the best paid 10% of the population), while in the North typical buyers are in the top 30th. Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent, says this is a serious concern: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcLondon clearly has suffered more in the price stakes than elsewhere in the country, a reverse of what we were seeing earlier in the year and for most of 2015. But for us it is the steep fall in number of transactions and market accessibility, which remains a challenge particularly for first-time buyers, rather than the ups and downs of prices which is more important.

Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slump was driven by continued fears that the company faces a massive charge relating to the purchase of a nuclear construction business called Stone &amp; Webster a year ago. Toshiba shocked investors earlier this week by admitting that it may have to write off several billion US dollar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgoodwill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, having bought Stone &amp; Webster for $229m. Analysts are concerned that the full cost is still unknown; last night, Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slashed Toshiba\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating and warned that the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s operating and financial performance could deteriorate. More here: Money is flowing out of shares and into bonds this morning. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign that investors might be taking a safety-first approach ahead of the New Year break. So bond prices are up, pushing yields (interest rates) down to their lowest levels in several weeks: Precious metals producers Randgold and Fresnillo are leading the risers in London, both up over 2%. But other mining firms are dropping back, with Rio Tinto and Glencore both down over 1%. Mining stocks had driven yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally, but are now suffering from falling commodity prices today (steel and copper prices have both dipped). The pound has bounced back from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two-months low, rising 0.25% to $1.225. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s helping to pull the FTSE 100 down (as a weak pound is good for internationally focused firms) Having closed at a record high last night, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 is subsiding at the start of trading. The blue-chip index dropped by 35 points, or 0.5%, in early deals to 7074 points. Other European markets have also dipped, as the selloff on Wall Street last night casts a shadow. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets explains: US markets stumbled yesterday as investor optimism cooled and hopes faded of the Dow Jones hitting 20,000 before year-end. However volumes remain light and this doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean the 2016 election fuelled rally is done with. It may just be taking a well needed breather. The biggest fallers in London are BT and Dixons Carphone, which has gone \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcex-dividend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 this morning (you had to own the shares last night to receive the next payment to investors) Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It could be another red letter day in the City. The FTSE 100 closed at a record high last night, and traders are now wondering if the index could smash through its all-time intraday high today. The omens aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t great, though, with spreadbetters predicting small falls this morning as investors book profits before the year end. The FTSE 100 is expected to drop by 27 points at the open, having closed at 7106 last night. The alltime high is 7129 points. Later today, America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dow Jones industrial average could have another tilt at the fabled 20,000 point mark. Yesterday it fell by 111 points - only its second triple-digit decline since last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential election, suggesting the rally may be fading. On the economic front, the City will be digesting new house price figures from Nationwide, which show prices jumped by 0.8% in December (more on that shortly). At 1.30pm, we get the latest US trade figures, and the weekly unemployment numbers. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll keep an eye on Italy, for any developments in its banking bailout. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day.....",
