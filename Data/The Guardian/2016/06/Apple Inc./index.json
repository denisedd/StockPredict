Looking beneath the headline though, the headline was lifted solely by a large pick-up in the supplier deliveries index. Aside from that, most other components remained roughly where they were last time around... Overall though, the index remains only tentatively within growth territory (ie above 50), but crucially, this is a much better position than where it was around the turn of the year.</p> <p>For the Federal Open Market Committee though, the ISM numbers are not essential in timing the next rate hike. Attention is now heavily centred on Friday\u2019s labour report. In advance of this, some emphasis is likely to be put on the employment components of this, and to a greater extent the non-manufacturing ISM, although we\u2019d note that neither are tightly correlated with non-farm payrolls. In any case, the employment component of the manufacturing ISM remained flat this time around.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"801e355c676e667c5f3d90323a93db6ebaf6bbb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/801e355c676e667c5f3d90323a93db6ebaf6bbb4/0_0_488_461/488.jpg\" alt=\"US jobs comparisons\" width=\"488\" height=\"461\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US jobs comparisons</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Macrobond, ING</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>We think that the risk of an above consensus non-farm payrolls (NFP) reading (currently at 160,000) is higher than a sub-consensus one. Although we tend to agree that job creation may be slowing as the economy reaches a point close to full employment, we feel that the month-on-month volatility in the headline NFP means that something at or above what we consider to be the underlying trend (around 185,000) is reasonably likely. Never-the-less, we feel that this element of the labour report is not critical to the FOMC\u2019s thinking at present. The Fed\u2019s labour market \u201ctick-box\u201d has effectively already been ticked (and arguably has for several months) and the key now lies with the activity data, which has improved slightly after a weak first quarter. Thus, we feel that the answer to the June/July/September debate now lies with chair Yellen (who speaks next week) and we currently think that July is the most likely timing for the next hike. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-574ef0bfe4b0467e825fbac1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-01T14:29:19.365Z\">3.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Both sets of US manufacturing figures may have come in better than expected but still show signs of weakness, said Connor Campbell at Spreadex:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Both the Markit and ISM PMIs surpassed expectations (at 50.7 and 51.3 respectively), though the performance from the former still points to a slowdown month-on-month while the latter is hardly a world-beating number, being lower than the Eurozone\u2019s own stagnant growth.</p> <p>It is hard to tell whether the Dow\u2019s negative start to the session stemmed from a) the general malaise that engulfed Europe this morning, b) the better than forecast PMIs giving a bit of extra heft to the Fed hawks or c) the fact that the manufacturing figures are still worryingly weak.</p> <p>Regardless the Dow Jones plunged 90 points after the open before settling at a 60-ish point loss, leaving the index at its lowest price in around a week.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-574eecece4b098522011d895\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-01T14:14:49.552Z\">3.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And there\u2019s more for the US Federal Reserve to consider ahead of this month\u2019s meeting, when a rate rise has still not been ruled out.</p> <p>US construction spending fell 1.8% in April, the largest monthly decline since January 2011.

                "bodyText":"Downbeat manufacturing data from around the globe, warnings from the OECD about the outlook and the repercussions of Brexit, and continuing concerns about a US rate rise have combined to get the new month off to an uninspiring start for investors. European markets have closed lower across the board but have come off their worst levels after a slight recovery in the oil price on hopes of an output agreement at Thursday\u2019s Opec meeting. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 38.86 points or 0.62% at 6191.93 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.57% to 10,204.44 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.67% lower at 4475.39 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.19% to 17,810.85 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 1.3% at 8916.9 In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.29% to 645.10 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has recovered much of its earlier fall and is currently down just 16 points or 0.09%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow for, among other things, the latest European Central Bank meeting. After the individual PMIs, the global index shows manufacturing stagnating: David Hensley at JP Morgan, which compiled the global index along with Marki, said: The May PMI data suggest that the global manufacturing sector remains in a low gear. Indices for output, new orders and the headline PMI were all at, or barely above, the stagnation mark. The move up in the finished goods inventory index suggests manufacturers are still working to realign stocks with demand. Of course, there are always conflicting reports ahead of any meeting of oil producers: Oil prices have recovered from earlier losses following a Reuters report that Opec ministers meeting in Vienna on Thursday are likely to consider a new ceiling on output. After falling as low as $48.65 a barrel, Brent crude is now up 0.12% at $49.95. But: But the ISM manufactuing numbers are not essential for the Federal Reserve in its interest rate deliberations, said James Smith at ING Bank: The ISM Manufacturing index surprised on the upside, ticking up from 50.8 to 51.3, rather than down to 50.3 as had been expected following a raft of weak regional surveys. Looking beneath the headline though, the headline was lifted solely by a large pick-up in the supplier deliveries index. Aside from that, most other components remained roughly where they were last time around... Overall though, the index remains only tentatively within growth territory (ie above 50), but crucially, this is a much better position than where it was around the turn of the year. For the Federal Open Market Committee though, the ISM numbers are not essential in timing the next rate hike. Attention is now heavily centred on Friday\u2019s labour report. In advance of this, some emphasis is likely to be put on the employment components of this, and to a greater extent the non-manufacturing ISM, although we\u2019d note that neither are tightly correlated with non-farm payrolls. In any case, the employment component of the manufacturing ISM remained flat this time around. We think that the risk of an above consensus non-farm payrolls (NFP) reading (currently at 160,000) is higher than a sub-consensus one. Although we tend to agree that job creation may be slowing as the economy reaches a point close to full employment, we feel that the month-on-month volatility in the headline NFP means that something at or above what we consider to be the underlying trend (around 185,000) is reasonably likely. Never-the-less, we feel that this element of the labour report is not critical to the FOMC\u2019s thinking at present. The Fed\u2019s labour market \u201ctick-box\u201d has effectively already been ticked (and arguably has for several months) and the key now lies with the activity data, which has improved slightly after a weak first quarter. Thus, we feel that the answer to the June/July/September debate now lies with chair Yellen (who speaks next week) and we currently think that July is the most likely timing for the next hike. Both sets of US manufacturing figures may have come in better than expected but still show signs of weakness, said Connor Campbell at Spreadex: Both the Markit and ISM PMIs surpassed expectations (at 50.7 and 51.3 respectively), though the performance from the former still points to a slowdown month-on-month while the latter is hardly a world-beating number, being lower than the Eurozone\u2019s own stagnant growth. It is hard to tell whether the Dow\u2019s negative start to the session stemmed from a) the general malaise that engulfed Europe this morning, b) the better than forecast PMIs giving a bit of extra heft to the Fed hawks or c) the fact that the manufacturing figures are still worryingly weak. Regardless the Dow Jones plunged 90 points after the open before settling at a 60-ish point loss, leaving the index at its lowest price in around a week. And there\u2019s more for the US Federal Reserve to consider ahead of this month\u2019s meeting, when a rate rise has still not been ruled out. US construction spending fell 1.8% in April, the largest monthly decline since January 2011. March\u2019s figure was revised up from a 0.5% rise to a 1.5% increase. Analysts had been expecting the April figure to show a rise of 0.6%. This piece of negative data in what has been a mixed batch of reports recently could see economists cutting their second quarter GDP forecasts. However there is a more positive sign from the ISM manufacturing survey. The manufacturing activity index came in at 51.3 in May, well ahead of expectations of a figure of 51.3, and ahead of April\u2019s 50.8. But the new orders index dipped from 55.8 in April to 55.7, while the employment index was flat at 49.2 after expectations of a rise to 49.7. The manufacturing PMI provides another sign of a slowing US economy, says Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. He said: The survey data indicate that factory output fell in May at its fastest rate since 2009, suggesting that manufacturing is acting as a severe drag on the economy in the second quarter. Payroll numbers are under pressure as factories worry about slower order book growth, in part linked to falling export demand but also as a result of growing uncertainty surrounding the presidential election. For those looking for a rebound in the economy after the lacklustre start to the year, the deteriorating trend in manufacturing is not going to provide any comfort. US manufacturing growth slowed slightly in May from the previous month, according to the latest Markit index. The final manufacturing PMI came in at 50.7, better than the preliminary estimate of 50.5, but down on the 50.8 recorded in April. Markit said this was the lowest level since September 2009. As forecast, US markets have started the trading day in negative territory. Falling oil prices and weak Chinese and European manufacturing data have combined to unsettle investors, who are already nervous at the prospect of another US interest rate rise. There is also caution ahead of Thursday\u2019s European Central Bank meeting, and the US non-farm payroll numbers a day later. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 120 points or 0.7% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdq both opened around 0.4% lower. The FTSE 100 has fallen 1.1% or 69 points, while Germany\u2019s Dax is down 0.8% and France\u2019s Cac nearly 1%. More US data is due shortly, with the Markit manufacturing PMI followed by the ISM manufacturing survey. Wall Street is expected to follow Europe\u2019s lead, and selloff when trading begins shortly. Over in Greece it\u2019s been an eventful day in parliament where MPs have voted overwhelmingly to rescind a law that would have allowed them to have holdings in offshore companies. In a roll call vote deputies dropped a law that many - ironically - had failed to see when endorsing a 7,500-page multi-bill of creditor-mandated reforms ten days ago. The clause, revealed by a Sunday\u2019s proto Thema newspaper, had caused prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 leftist led coalition extraordinary embarrassment. Tsipras was voted into power saying his Syriza party would abolish measures deemed to promote tax evasion. In a double whammy for the government, uproar over the clause has coincided with a tsunami of indirect taxes on luxury goods that comes into force today. Brazilians have woken up to the news that they face an even deeper recession than expected. In today\u2019s economic outlook, the OECD has predicted that Brazil\u2019s GDP will shrink by 4.3% in 2016, as joblessness spikes. Back in February the OECD expected a 4.0% contraction this year, before the recent impeachment of Dilma Roussef gripped the country. The OECD says: \u201cThe deep recession is set to continue in 2016 and in 2017 against the backdrop of high political uncertainty and ongoing corruption revelations that are undermining consumer and business confidence, leading to a continuous contraction in domestic demand. \u201cAs the economy shrinks, unemployment is set to rise further.\u201d With inflation also worryingly high, and its Petrobras oil giant mired in its money-laundering scandal, the outlook for Brazil does looks very challenging. Attendees at the OECD\u2019s Forum in Paris haven\u2019t lost their enthusiasm for free trade: In other news....the London Stock Exchange Group has just revealed that more than a thousands jobs could be lost through its merger with Germany\u2019s Deutsche B\u00f6rse. In a prospectus to investors, the LSEG explains that 1,250 positions will be eliminated across the combined group once the \u20ac20bn deal is approved (assuming nothing derails it). Most of the jobs will lost through \u201ctechnology enabled efficiencies\u201d, or by restructuring various back-office and HQ operations. However, it is sugaring the pill by predicting that 200 new roles could be created as a result of \u201cproposed growth initiatives\u201d. Here are the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 today: Building supply chain Wolseley is leading the selloff after it reported slowing revenue growth in the UK and Europe -- another sign that the world economy is weakening. And housebuilders Taylor Wimpey and Barratt Development are out of favour, after Nationwide building society reported that house price growth has slowed. European stock markets are heading deeper into the red, as the OECD\u2019s Brexit warning continue to haunt investors. The FTSE 100 is now down 67 points, of over 1%, at 6163. Banks and mining stocks are among the fallers, reflecting worries about global economic growth. The weak factory figures from China overnight also hurting confidence, as is the news that eurozone factory growth has hit a three-month low. Mike van Dulken, Head of Research at Accendo Markets, explains: \u201cEquities are nursing losses this morning as yesterday\u2019s breakdowns from comfortable consolidation/uptrends yesterday gather pace. This comes after a revival of geopolitical risk (Brexit poll) and a raft of mixed data from across the globe (run of poor US manufacturing; China and Eurozone PMIs failing to inspire; UK Consumers delaying borrowing). Here\u2019s Larry Elliott\u2019s news story about the OECD\u2019s latest warning about Brexit, and its new economic forecasts. Brexit uncertainty has also hurt some UK factories, according to a new survey. One in three manufacturers polled by Markit said June\u2019s referendum has had a detrimental, or very detrimental, effect on their business, while half reported no impact. There\u2019s a silver lining, though, almost one percent said Brexit uncertainty had been strongly beneficial. Maybe they manufacture campaign posters, or possibly ear plugs.... Markit also found that Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector basically stagnated last month. It\u2019s UK factory PMI came in at 50.1, just over the \u2018break-even\u2019 point between expansion and contraction. The prime minister has also tweeted about the OECD\u2019s report: Cameron D. failed to mention that the economy has already suffered from Brexit fears, according to the OECD (see earlier entry) The opposition Labour party have swiftly seized on the news that the OECD has slashed its UK growth forecasts, from 2.1% to 1.7% this year. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell says: \u201cToday\u2019s OECD report once again shows the absolute failure of the Chancellor\u2019s economic policy. Not only has productivity slumped, but the OECD also highlight the risk of further bubbles in the housing market whilst housebuilding continues at too low a level. Further proof that George Osborne\u2019s recovery is built on sand. \u201cWith the OECD forecasting a dramatic shock to the whole economy from a Tory Brexit, it\u2019s clear we can\u2019t risk failed Tory economic policy any more. We need a serious commitment from this government to invest in infrastructure and housing, backed up by a real industrial strategy to place the economy on a sound foundation and build the high-tech, high-wage economy of the future.\u201d If the OECD are right, then George Osborne could struggle to hit its economic targets. Back in March, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility predicted the UK would grow by 2% this year. Lower growth will probably translate to weaker tax receipts, making it harder to cut the deficit. Pro-Brexit campaigners often argue that it\u2019s impossible to say exactly how the UK economy would perform outside of the EU. After all, the government can\u2019t get its annual forecasts right, so how can we accurately project growth over a longer horizon? The OECD acknowledges this, with three different scenarios for Brexit. However, they all show that the economy would suffer: The pound has just weakened to a two-week low against the US dollar, at $1.4439, after another opinion poll hit the wires: You can see the full report from the OECD here. Amid the flurry of figures from the OECD, this one stands out. After Brexit, UK GDP would be 3% lower by 2020, while the European Union\u2019s economy would be 1% smaller, according to the Paris-based thinktank. The Financial Times have created a handy graph to show the likely impact if the Leave side are victorious on June 23. The OECD is adamant that this month\u2019s EU referendum has already hurt the British economy. In its report on the UK (online here), it says: Growth has slowed, and is projected to be 1\u00be per cent in 2016. Uncertainty about the outcome of the end-June 2016 referendum, which could lead to an exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Brexit), has undermined growth. This projection assumes that the United Kingdom remains in the European Union, in which case growth is projected to pick up in the second half of 2016 and then stabilise in 2017..... However: The outcome of the referendum is a major risk for the economy. A vote for Brexit would heighten uncertainty, raise the cost of finance and hamper investment. The OECD also points out the Britain\u2019s trade deficit is running at record highs: It adds that productivity has been \u201cexceptionally weak since 2007, and reviving it is essential to sustain growth and living standards.\u201d More here: Another chart showing how the OECD fears the impact of Britain leaving the EU: This chart highlights how pessimistic the OECD is about growth in advanced economies: Brexit fears are also driving up the cost of insuring against a plunge in the value of the pound. Sterling volatility has jumped to the highest level in more than seven years after a Guardian poll showed the Brexit camp is in the lead ahead of this month\u2019s EU referendum. One-month implied sterling volatility - the price of insuring against swings in the pound against the dollar - rose to 19.6% from 17% a day earlier, as Brexit fears mounted. It was the highest level since the depths of the financial crisis February 2009, a month before the Bank of England made the unprecedented moved of cutting interest rates to an all-time low of 0.5%. Sterling volatility is considered a sign of market anxiety, and Wednesday\u2019s surge followed a Guardian poll that showed voters are 52%-48% split in favour of leaving the European Union. Will Straw, executive director of the Britain Stronger In Europe campaign, says voters should take the OECD\u2019s Brexit warning seriously: The OECD is presenting its new Economic Outlook report in Paris right now: The youngest and oldest in society will suffer most if the world economy does not pick up pace, fears the OECD. Catherine Mann explains that governments will find it harder and harder to meet \u201cfundamental promises\u201d, such as jobs opportunity and pensions. \u201cIf we don\u2019t take action to boost productivity and potential growth, both younger and older generations will be worse off. The consequences of policy inaction will be low career prospects for today\u2019s youth, who have suffered so much already from the crisis, and lower retirement income for future pensioners.\u201d The OECD is urging governments across the globe to boost their spending, to spur growth. Their chief economist Catherine Mann says there is an \u201curgent\u201d need to use fiscal firepower to boost demand. She warns: \u201cThe longer the global economy remains in the low-growth trap, the more difficult it will be to break the negative feedback loops.\u201d In a gloomy update, the OECD has also lowered its growth forecast for the 34 countries who make up its \u2018club\u2019 to 1.8% this year and 2.1% in 2017. That\u2019s down from 2.2% and 2.3% six months ago. It has cut its US growth forecast to 1.8% this year, instead of the 2% it forecast in February. It also forecasts another year of recession in Russia. However, it has raised its forecast for eurozone growth this year to 1.6%, from 1.4%. Breaking: The OECD has slashed its forecast for UK growth this year to just 1.7%. That\u2019s down from an estimate of 2.1% three months ago, and much weaker than the 2.3% growth recorded in 2015. And the Paris-based body is also warning that Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union would have a serious impact on the global economy. Indeed, it claims that Brexit is as big a threat to the global economy as a hard landing in China. From Paris, our economics editor Larry Elliott reports: Catherine Mann, chief economist at the OECD said the uncertainty caused by the referendum came at a time when the global economy was caught in a low-growth trap. \u201cSpillovers could be significant to other countries\u201d, Mann said as she predicted that the world economy would grow by 3% in 2016 and by 3.3% in 2017 - forecasts that have remained unchanged since its last health check three months ago. \u201cWe have done a lot of work on what a hard landing in China would mean. It is in the same ball park as Brexit.\u201d More to follow.... Breaking: Growth across Europe\u2019s manufacturing base has slowed to its slowest rate since February, leaving factories in near-stagnation. The eurozone factory PMI, produced by data firm Markit, has dropped to 51.5 for May, down from 51.7 in April, closer to the 50-point mark that shows no growth at all. Markit reports that the French and Greek factory sectors shrank last month, while growth slowed in Spain, Italy and Ireland. Worryingly, firms across the eurozone reported that new order growth slowed last month, forcing them to slash prices (again) to stimulate demand. New export order growth hit a 16-month low, and job creation slowed too. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, fears that the eurozone recovery is faltering: \u201cManufacturing in the euro area remained stuck in a state of near-stagnation in May, failing to break out of the slow growth phase that has plagued producers since February. \u201cThe disappointing performance of manufacturing adds to suspicions that the pace of eurozone economic growth in the second quarter has cooled after a surprisingly brisk start to the year based on the latest estimate of GDP. \u201cNew orders grew at the slowest rate for over a year as demand showed signs of waning both within the euro area and further afield. Not surprisingly, companies remain reluctant to build capacity and take on extra workers, lacking signs of any imminent upturn in demand. Switzerland\u2019s economy has grown much less strongly than expected, reinforcing the OECD\u2019s concerns about growth. The Swiss economy grew 0.1 per cent in the first three months of 2016, missing expectations of 0.3% expansion. Switzerland\u2019s financial services and hotel and catering industry contracted, while the manufacturing, construction and the healthcare sectors grew. New factory data from Ireland suggest that its economy may have been hit as Brexit uncertainty drifts over the Irish Sea. The Irish manufacturing PMI fell to 51.5 in May from 52.6 in April. That\u2019s the weakest reading in 27 months, suggesting that factory growth slowed last month. Irish firms reported that new export orders fell, while output and new business grew at a slower rate. Investec, which compiles the PMI, argues that Britain\u2019s upcoming EU referendum is partly to blame. Philip O\u2019Sullivan, chief economist at Investec Ireland, says: We expect that at least some of the weakness relates to that event [the EU vote] and other international uncertainties. With momentum appearing to be building behind the \u2018Remain\u2019 campaign, sterling has recently begun to strengthen against the single currency, which augurs well for the near-term outlook for many Irish exporters. However, a poll published by the Guardian on Tuesday showed a pick-up in support for the Leave campaign, which sent the pound sliding against the euro. That makes it harder for eurozone manufacturers to sell goods into the UK market, which is the destination for roughly one-seventh of Irish merchandise exports. Angel Gurria\u2019s fears over the global economy may have hurt sentiment in the City. London\u2019s FTSE 100 has fallen by 40 points, or 0.6%, to a one-week low of 6,195 points. The other main European indices are also in the red. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx explains why investors are jittery this month: China set the tone this Wednesday, the country\u2019s continually limp manufacturing PMIs (the government-released figure remained at 50.1 while the Caixin reading slumped to a 3 month low of 49.2) an unwanted reminder of the global weaknesses circling the market like vultures. Along that theme the OECD also chimed in with a worldwide warning this morning, Angel Gurria stating that \u2018conditions are very difficult\u2019 due to sluggish global growth. So not exactly the best backdrop to begin the month against, especially with June\u2019s investor-concerning Fed meeting and UK EU referendum rapidly approaching. Angel Gurr\u00eda adds that the OECD is also concerned that Britain could vote to leave the EU in this month\u2019s referendum. It is a threat to the global economy, he tells Bloomberg TV, but particularly to the people of the UK. The OECD has calculated that Brexit is effectively a tax, of between \u00a32,000 and \u00a35,000 per year. A month\u2019s pay, for which you get nothing in return, he argues. Angel Gurr\u00eda also warns that more must be done to fight inequality, calling it the defining issue of our time. The global economy is struggling, due to weak trade and problems in emerging markets. That\u2019s according to the head of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Angel Gurr\u00eda, Secretary-General of the OECD, gave the warning hours before the OECD is due to release its new economic outlook. He told Bloomberg TV that global economic conditions are very difficult. And that means that the world economy faces \u201ca rather mediocre, a rather dismal outlook.\u201d Gurr\u00eda pinned the blame on problems with the engines of growth, which are dangerously misfiring. He explained: Trade is growing at 2% to 3%, it should be growing at 7%. Only five times in the last 50 years has trade been growing below the rate of growth of the GDP of the world. On those 5 occasions, there been a very serious deceleration, even a recession. I\u201dm not saying there will be a recession this time. I\u2019m just saying conditions are very difficult. Gurr\u00eda says that the world economy is only expected to grow by 3% in 2016 - matching 2015\u2019s less-than-stellar performance. He also predicted that there will only be a small improvement in 2017. Three months ago, the OECD expected 3.3% growth in 2017; so Gurr\u00eda may be hinting at a fresh downgrade today. The OECD issues its new forecasts at 9.30am UK time (10.30am in Paris). Our economics editor Larry Elliott is in Paris for the OECD forum, so we\u2019ll have more details through the day.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s a new month, which means we get a new healthcheck on the world\u2019s factory sectors. PMIs reports from Asia, Europe and America will show whether manufacturing output rose or fell in May, and thus highlight whether fears of an economic slowdown are justified. We\u2019ve already heard from China. The official Chinese May manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) has come in at 50.1, only fractionally above stagnation. That suggests its factory sector is stabilising, but not delivering much growth. We\u2019ll hear from eurozone countries, including German and France, between 8am and 9am BST. Other highlights include the UK at 9.30am, followed by the US at 3pm. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets predicts that French factories struggled in May. In Europe, while France has continued to underachieve in its manufacturing sector, with the recent fuel blockades unlikely to help matters in the coming weeks, a reading of 48.3 is expected here, we have seen the latest German, Spain and Italian numbers hold above the 50 levels quite comfortably, though they have been slowing on a month on month basis. Spain and Italy are expected to show readings of 52.6, 53.5, both down on April, while German activity has started to improve with a reading of 52.5 expected, up from 51.8. Also coming up today... The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is holding a forum in Paris. Economists will also be digesting new growth figures from Australia, which beat expectations: And in the City, cars-to-bikes group Halfords and building supplies group Wolseley are reporting financial results, while building society Nationwide is publishing monthly house price data. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events though the day....",
