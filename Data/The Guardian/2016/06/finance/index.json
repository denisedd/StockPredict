David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spread Co, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Over the last month it became apparent that the US Federal Reserve was unhappy that the market refused to price in the prospect of a summer rate hike. Consequently, over the past few weeks we saw a confusion of Fed Heads come out to declare that their conditions for monetary tightening were being met. Some were claiming that two, three or even four rate hikes were possible in 2016 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a ludicrous proposition given the few windows available due to the US Presidential Election, let alone the uncertain outlook for the US and global economies.</p> <p>This constant barrage of hawkishness pressed the markets to sharply cut the odds on a summer rate hike. This led to a rally in the dollar together with a nasty and protracted sell-off in precious metals. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all been reversed now thanks to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s payroll release.</p> <p>On Monday evening (17:30BST) Yellen is scheduled to speak about the economic outlook and monetary policy. It will be very interesting to hear what she has to say in the light of the jobs data. We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blame the Fed for weak data. But we can take them to task for their relentless effort to tell the market it was pricing financial assets incorrectly. The US Federal Reserve exerts too much influence over the markets these days and many investors will now believe that the Fed has taken them for a ride. Yellen is going to find it very difficult to winch back credibility for the central bank now. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f174ac4bd4175616f772f2a16f195c55932052c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f174ac4bd4175616f772f2a16f195c55932052c/0_0_3500_2334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yellen hinting at summer rate rises last week at Harvard.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yellen hinting at summer rate rises last week at Harvard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Snyder/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57519acae4b045bc9189e486\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-03T14:59:22.116Z\">3.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/may/27/markets-us-growth-figures-janet-yellen-putin-greece-live\">A week ago</a></strong> Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen was at Harvard suggesting a summer interest rate rise could on the cards.

Indeed, given that the US recession story has faded away over recent weeks, it is possible that the combination of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak non-farm payrolls figure and the drop in the ISM Non-manufacturing prompts the debate to resurface to some degree over coming weeks.

Not only was May a particularly weak month, the worst in almost six years, but revisions dragged previous months lower. The unemployment rate declined to 4.7% but that is because of a fall in the labour force participation rate: not what we want to see happening. Overall, the job market has added an average of 116,000 jobs/month over the past three months, a substantial slowdown from the 229,000/month averaged in 2015.</p> <p>What is the reason? The Verizon strike certainly weighed on the May numbers, so we can expect a bounce back in June. And as the US approaches full employment, the rate of job creation was always going to slow. This does not seem to be indicative of a broader economic slowdown: in April consumer spending rose by 1%, the largest monthly increase since 2009. </p> <p>The labour market slowdown will make the Federal Reserve reconsider its next move.

Senior economist Alasdair Cavalla said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[The report] does support our assessment that now is still too early for another rise. The main factor slowing down growth in the US is exports, which is precisely where the impact of tightening will fall most heavily in the form of a stronger dollar. Fed officials have explicitly highlighted a potential Brexit as another downside risk likely to stay its hand in June. This comes on top of a still fragile global economic environment. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news suggests there may be more to worry about than thought. A good year economically is thought to favour incumbent governments; the risk of a protectionist and isolationist administration by the end of the year is hardly going to give firms the reassurance they need to hire and invest. In the absence of any meaningful inflationary threat, raising interest rates in such an environment would be incomprehensible.</p> </blockquote> <p>And:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ReutersJamie/status/738719922319183872\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">May 27: Yellen says rate hikes in coming months &quot;appropriate&quot;<br><br>June 3: 38k May payrolls<br><br>June 6: Yellen to repeat &quot;appropriate&quot;?

                "bodyText":"The poor US jobs figures only add to the concerns about the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, which may still be too weak for a rate rise. That is the view expressed by Federal Reserve governor Lael Brainard in a speech in Washington. She said the non-farm payroll numbers suggested that the US labour market had slowed, and added that any rate rise should also wait until it was clearer that China and Europe are doing better, and the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum on EU membership was out of the way. She said: Recognising the data we have on hand for the second quarter is quite mixed and still limited, and there is important near-term uncertainty, there would appear to be an advantage to waiting until developments provide greater confidence. Prudent risk-management would suggest the risks from waiting until the totality of the data provides greater confidence in a rebound in domestic activity, and there is greater certainty regarding the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd vote, seem lower than the risks associated with moving ahead of these developments. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back next week. US energy companies added 9 oil rigs last week, bringing the total rig count up to 325 according to the latest Baker Hughes report. This is only the second time this year the rig count has gone up, and then it was only one rig in the middle of March. It comes as oil hit $50 a barrel despite this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Opec meeting failing to agree an output ceiling. The number of gas rigs fell however, making a total increase of four rigs: The disappointing non-farm payroll numbers gave a shock to investors who were expecting a calm end to the week, sending stock markets sharply lower, hitting the dollar and prompting a spate of bond buying. There was a two way pull between those who saw the job figures as positive, in that they would prevent the US Federal Reserve from raising interest rates this month, and those who worried about the signs of a weak US economy. By the close of trade in Europe, the former had regained some ground and markets recovered from their worst levels. Indeed UK shares, supported by rises in commodity companies as oil held fairly steady during the day, managed to end up in positive territory. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 24.02 points or 0.39% at 6209.63 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.03% to 10,103.26 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.99% at 4421.78 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 1.53% to 17,495.09 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 1.74% lower at 8801.6 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.48% to 648.63 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down just 39 points or 0.23%. Back with the US jobs: Friday rating agency update: S&amp;P said: We expect the new minority government in Ireland to keep pursuing open and proactive economic policies and continue fiscal consolidation. Thanks to rapid nominal GDP growth, we expect net general government debt to decline to below 80% of GDP in 2017. We are therefore affirming our \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcA+/A-1\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sovereign credit ratings on Ireland. The stable outlook balances our view of upside potential for the ratings if Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal position continues to improve against risks associated with external factors such as a potential Brexit, or weaker global demand. Bond prices rose and yields fell as investors looked for havens after the shock US jobs numbers. In the UK, 30 year yields fell to 2.084% after the US data, the lowest level since February 2015. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10 year Bund yield fell to 0.073%, its lowest this year. The poor jobs numbers following various hawkish comments from US Federal Reserve members make chair Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech on Monday evening a potentially tricky affair. David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spread Co, said: Over the last month it became apparent that the US Federal Reserve was unhappy that the market refused to price in the prospect of a summer rate hike. Consequently, over the past few weeks we saw a confusion of Fed Heads come out to declare that their conditions for monetary tightening were being met. Some were claiming that two, three or even four rate hikes were possible in 2016 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a ludicrous proposition given the few windows available due to the US Presidential Election, let alone the uncertain outlook for the US and global economies. This constant barrage of hawkishness pressed the markets to sharply cut the odds on a summer rate hike. This led to a rally in the dollar together with a nasty and protracted sell-off in precious metals. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all been reversed now thanks to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s payroll release. On Monday evening (17:30BST) Yellen is scheduled to speak about the economic outlook and monetary policy. It will be very interesting to hear what she has to say in the light of the jobs data. We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blame the Fed for weak data. But we can take them to task for their relentless effort to tell the market it was pricing financial assets incorrectly. The US Federal Reserve exerts too much influence over the markets these days and many investors will now believe that the Fed has taken them for a ride. Yellen is going to find it very difficult to winch back credibility for the central bank now. A week ago Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen was at Harvard suggesting a summer interest rate rise could on the cards. Now, after the poor jobs figures, maybe not: The disappointing US services sector data which followed quickly on from the poor jobs numbers provides another reason for the Federal Reserve to leave rates unchanged this month, says James Smith at ING Bank: After May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm payrolls plummeted, the ISM Non-manufacturing came crashing back down to 52.9 from 55.7, much lower than expected. Aside from supplier deliveries, the other main components that contribute to the headline recorded fairly sizable falls (employment and business activity), particularly new orders, where the size of the month-on-month drop was the largest since November 2008. This is especially concerning, given that in theory it sets the precedent for (or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153leads\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) future business activity. Although the ISM surveys are perhaps not the most central part of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee reaction function, the magnitude of the fall means that it will probably feature in the debate over near-term policy. Indeed, given that the US recession story has faded away over recent weeks, it is possible that the combination of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak non-farm payrolls figure and the drop in the ISM Non-manufacturing prompts the debate to resurface to some degree over coming weeks. Either way, it is another reason for the FOMC to leave rates unchanged in June, with focus now on Chair Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech on Monday to see how the latest data will affect policy in coming months. Still, US factory orders were more or less in line with expectations: More signs of weakness in the US economy, this time from two surveys of the service sector. First the ISM non-manufacturing PMI fell from 55.7 in April to 52.9, well below the consensus forecast of 55.5. The new orders index at 54.2, down from 59.9, was the lowest since February 2014. And the final reading of the Markit services PMI for May came in at 51.3, down from 52.8 in April. The index is marginally higher that the first estimate of 51.2 for May. Meanwhile the Markit composite index - manufacturing and services - fell from 52.4 in April to 50.9. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chart showing the jobs numbers: And unemployment rate Joey Lake, US analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said: The jobs report was bad, bad, bad: there is no positive spin to it. Not only was May a particularly weak month, the worst in almost six years, but revisions dragged previous months lower. The unemployment rate declined to 4.7% but that is because of a fall in the labour force participation rate: not what we want to see happening. Overall, the job market has added an average of 116,000 jobs/month over the past three months, a substantial slowdown from the 229,000/month averaged in 2015. What is the reason? The Verizon strike certainly weighed on the May numbers, so we can expect a bounce back in June. And as the US approaches full employment, the rate of job creation was always going to slow. This does not seem to be indicative of a broader economic slowdown: in April consumer spending rose by 1%, the largest monthly increase since 2009. The labour market slowdown will make the Federal Reserve reconsider its next move. It reduces the chance of a June rate increase and makes it more likely the Fed will wait until July, after the Brexit vote, which will also reduce the political risk from abroad. More reaction to the disappointing jobs figures. CEBR added its voice to those suggesting a US rate rise in June was now off the table. Senior economist Alasdair Cavalla said: [The report] does support our assessment that now is still too early for another rise. The main factor slowing down growth in the US is exports, which is precisely where the impact of tightening will fall most heavily in the form of a stronger dollar. Fed officials have explicitly highlighted a potential Brexit as another downside risk likely to stay its hand in June. This comes on top of a still fragile global economic environment. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news suggests there may be more to worry about than thought. A good year economically is thought to favour incumbent governments; the risk of a protectionist and isolationist administration by the end of the year is hardly going to give firms the reassurance they need to hire and invest. In the absence of any meaningful inflationary threat, raising interest rates in such an environment would be incomprehensible. And: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a possible explanation for the shock figures: The weaker than expected US jobs numbers have also sent European markets lower. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is now down 0.8% while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac is 0.78% lower. The FTSE 100 is just managing to stay in positive territory, up 4.5 points. The dollar has fallen to a two week low on the basis that the figures make a June rate rise unlikely now, despite the previous hints to the contrary from various Fed members. The dollar index dropped by more than 1% while the euro rose 1.3% and sterling hit a three day high of 1.4544. Wall Street is down in early trading following those horrible payrolls numbers - the worst in almost six years. Dow Jones: -0.3% at 17,780 S&amp;P 500: -0.2% at 2,101 Nasdaq: -0.3% at 4,958 Investors will be weighing up whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plain bad news (weak employment market) or good bad news (US rate hike delayed because of weak employment market). The biggest increase in jobs was in the healthcare sector, with 46,000 jobs added in May, while employment in professional and business services was up by 10,000. Mining, manufacturing and construction were among the sectors where jobs fell. Economists said a US rate hike in June - previously considered a strong possibility - was now unlikely because of the unexpectedly weak payrolls. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics: The 38,000 increase in non-farm payrolls in May, which is still only 73,000 if we adjust for the 35,000 striking Verizon workers, means that a June rate hike from the Fed is now very unlikely. In addition, the gains in the preceding two months were revised down by a cumulative 59,000. A July hike is still possible, but it would require clear evidence of a rebound in June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s payroll figures (and a UK vote to remain in the European Union). That sound you hear is Fed Chair Janet Yellen furiously re-writing her speech that she is scheduled to give on Monday. James Smith, economist at ING: Over recent weeks, the blocks appeared to have been gradually falling into place for another rate hike from the Fed, but the latest labour report has potentially put a large spanner in the works. In our opinion, this may well put the final nail in the coffin for a June hike, with confirmation of this potentially coming from Chair Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech on Monday. Donald Trump has given his verdict on the shockingly weak payrolls numbers: May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US jobs numbers were always going to be affected by a strike among Verizon workers, but they do not account for such a huge drop in payrolls (to 38k). As Jana Kasperkevic from the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s New York office explains: A strike by 40,000 Verizon workers impacted the numbers, the labor department said, and without the strike the number of jobs added would have been 72,000, which is still less than a half of expect job growth. Looking at the detail of the US jobs numbers, wage growth was in line with expectations at 0.2% in May. The unemployment rate eased to 4.7% from 5% in April, although the drop was partly explained by people who stopped looking for work and were therefore no longer classed as unemployed. From the US Labor Department report: In May, 1.7m persons were marginally attached to the labor force, little changed from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) These individuals were not in the labor force, wanted and were available for work, and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months. They were not counted as unemployed because they had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. Among the marginally attached, there were 538,000 discouraged workers in May, essentially unchanged from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) Discouraged workers are persons not currently looking for work because they believe no jobs are available for them. Manufacturing payrolls fell by 10,000 after rising by a (downwardly revised) 2,000 a month earlier. US futures dropped after the shock payrolls figures. On the one hand, it makes the prospect of a rate rise at the FOMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s June meeting less likely. But on the other, it suggests the labour market in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy is weaker than assumed. Here is the full story from our US team. This is a huge miss on US jobs, as companies dramatically slowed their hiring in May. Payrolls rose by just 38,000 in May, the slowest rate of growth since September 2010. This should get the member\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate-setting FOMC scratching their heads... Breaking: US non-farm payrolls have come in way below expectations. There were 38,000 jobs added in May, compared with expectations of a 164,000 increase. April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s number has been revised down too - to 123,000 from an earlier estimate of 160,000. More soon.... Earlier, there were some disappointing eurozone retail sales figures. Instead of the expected 0.3% month on month rise in April, sales were flat due to falls in Germany and Belgium in the wake of the Brussels terror attacks. This follows a 0.6% fall in the overall eurozone figure in March. The year on year rise in April was 1.4%, below forecasts of a 1.9% increase. The figures could point to slower GDP growth in the second quarter, analysts believe. The rise in the FTSE 100 today means after a volatile few months, the index is more or less back where it began the year. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, has this take on the markets: Having started the day strong a far better than expected services PMI (at 53.5 against the 52.5 forecast) ensured the FTSE continued to grow this Friday, the UK index rising by nearly 1%. While not quite as enthusiastic as the FTSE, the Eurozone indices nevertheless pushed forth with a near half a percent rise this Friday despite a fairly dismal morning for data. Unsurprisingly the Dow Jones couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite join in with Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rebound this Friday morning, the index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s futures resolute in their flatness ahead of this afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report. With June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed meeting less than a fortnight away today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm number is arguably the most important since last December. An update on how the other major markets in Europe are doing: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.6% at 10,266 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +0.5% at 4,487 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.03% at 8,955 The FTSE 100 is up 1% or 62 points at 6,248. It is the biggest riser among the major European indices. Investors are no doubt relieved that the UK services PMI did not deliver a nasty shock, but markets are also being boosted by the resilience of oil prices. Brent crude is hovering just above $50 a barrel despite the stalemate at Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Opec meeting in Vienna. In a couple of hours we will have May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm payroll report from the US, which always has the potential to move markets. Economists polled by Reuters are expecting payrolls to jump by 164,000, following a 160,000 rise in April. CMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michael Hewson: European markets have got off to a positive start ahead of this afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s keenly awaited US jobs data. Investors could do with some good news this week given that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen declines every day this week for the FTSE 100, despite the fact that the oil price looks on course for its fourth successive week of gains, with Brent prices looking to gain a foothold above $50 a barrel. It is expected that the US economy will have added 160k new jobs in May, while the unemployment rate is expected to drop to 4.9%. If the jobs number drops sharply to 130k or anywhere near that - quite possible given the Verizon strikes and the slowdown in manufacturing hiring - then any prospect of a move in rates in June, already seen as fairly low could well diminish further. Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JP Morgan, is the latest business leader to issue a dire warning on the potential consequences of Brexit. Addressing the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staff in Bournemouth, alongside the chancellor and remain campaigner George Osborne, Dimon said: I think it would be a terrible deal for the British economy and jobs. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if it means 1,000 jobs [would go at JP Morgan], 2,000 jobs, it could be as many as 4,000 jobs. And they would be jobs all around the UK. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want you to worry about it but when you vote you should be thinking about something like this. Charles Evans, president of the Chicago Federal Reserve has been speaking in London about the possible timing of US interest rate hikes. He said there was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reasonable case\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for delaying rate rises until core inflation reaches the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target. On current forecasts, that wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be until 2018. However, Evans said that as things stood, it was likely the Fed would vote for two rate hikes before the end of 2016, taking borrowing costs to a range between 0.75% and 1%. Speaking at the Global Interdependence Center in London, he said: Frankly, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m really of two minds at the moment, and I expect to take this quandary with me into the next FOMC meeting. On the one hand, under the committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current approach to renormalizing policy, I think it may be appropriate to have two 25 basis point moves between now and the end of the year. I see the value in making small and gradual adjustments to the fed funds rate as the data improve and confirm my positive baseline outlook for the US. And this is my base-case view of appropriate policy. On the other hand, if I think outside of the baseline, I also think that a reasonable case can be made for holding off increasing the funds rate until core inflation actually gets to 2% on a sustainable basis. In other UK news, Sir Philip Green has received more criticism over BHS - the high street retail chain he sold for \u00c2\u00a31 last year that has now collapsed with the loss of 11,000 jobs. Simon Walker, the head of the Institute of Directors accused Green of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lamentable failure of behaviour\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that risked \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deeply damaging\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the British business world as a whole. He told BBC radio 4: Sir Philip Green is a very high-profile business leader. He is the person who is on the front page with Kate Moss on his arm and who has a \u00c2\u00a3100m superyacht and so on. When someone like this ends up behaving like this, people think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how business is, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not. The majority of business leaders are people who are more likely to have mortgaged their homes to keep their company going than to own this kind of lavish thing. Read our full story here. Green will face questions by MPs on 15 June over his role in the demise of BHS. Here is the breakdown of how UK services companies felt their businesses were being affected by the looming possibility of Brexit... Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, Chris Williamson, was not overly cheered by the better-than-expected services PMI number for the UK. He says that taking into account all the data for the second quarter so far, growth is on course to halve between April and June, following 0.4% growth in the first quarter. The PMI surveys show that the pace of economic growth remained subdued in May, as Brexit worries exacerbated existing headwinds. The data so far indicate that the second quarter is likely to see the economy grow by just 0.2%. Growth has collapsed in manufacturing and construction, leaving the economy dependent on the service sector to sustain the upturn, though even here the pace of expansion has remained frustratingly weak so far this year. The detail of the PMI survey showed that UK services sector companies took on workers at the slowest rate in more than three years. The better-than-expected UK services PMI should come as a relief to investors. A weaker number for May would have started to build a more worrying picture of how the UK economy is performing in the second quarter. The big fear is that if Britain votes to leave the EU when it goes to the polls on 23 June, the UK will slide back into recession at a time when the economy is not fully healed following the last crisis. In May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI, Markit asked UK services companies an additional question: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Please state the extent to which the issue of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s potential exit from the EU is currently affecting your business.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Of those taking part in the survey, 28% said a potential Brexit was having a detrimental impact on business, while 9% said it was having a strongly detrimental impact. On the flip side, 51% said it was having no significant effect. Breaking: The UK services sector grew at a faster rate than expected in May. The headline index on the Markit/CIPS PMI increased to 53.5 from 52.3 in April. Economists were expecting a smaller rise to 52.5. Anything above 50 indicates expansion. So Italy let the side down on an otherwise positive set of services PMIs for the eurozone. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said combined with the manufacturing surveys published earlier in the week, the latest PMIs suggested the eurozone economy was moving along at a sluggish pace. He suggested the growth of 0.5% achieved in the first quarter would not be sustained into the second: The final PMI numbers for May have come in slightly ahead of the earlier flash readings, but still point a eurozone economy which seems unable to move out of low gear. The survey data are signalling a GDP rise of 0.3% in the second quarter, suggesting the growth spurt seen at the start of the year will prove frustratingly short-lived. The eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services sector expanded at the fastest rate in three months in May, boosted by growth in Germany, France, Spain and Ireland. The headline index measuring activity on the Markit PMI survey edged up to 53.3 last month from 53.1 in April. Employment in the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services industry increased for a nineteenth month, with jobs created at the fastest rate in Germany and Ireland. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services sector fared less well than its neighbours in the single currency bloc, with the headline index pointing to a contraction in activity in May. All major indices are higher this morning after Wall Street closed up last night. Investors are holding their nerve so far. There were no nasty shocks on Thursday from the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting of the governing council in Vienna, where all policy measures were left on hold. Activity in Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services sector grew at an accelerated pace in May according to the Markit PMI survey. The headline index increased to 55.4 from 55.1 in April. It was better than the 53.5 forecast by economists, and will no doubt be a source of relief for investors following weaker manufacturing numbers earlier in the week. Andrew Harker, senior economist at Markit and author of the PMI report, said: Following on from Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing Spain manufacturing PMI numbers, the latest services data are something of a relief, with growth in activity and new business ticking up slightly. The figures provide hope that the sector will be able to successfully weather headwinds such as a weak global environment and domestic political instability and remain in growth territory in the near-term at least. Brent crude oil has edged higher this morning, up 0.3% at $50.2 a barrel. It appears that a stalemate at Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting in Vienna on Thursday - where Tehran refused to support a plan by Riyadh and others to freeze their crude output - has been partially offset by the latest US stockpiles data. US crude stockpiles fell 1.4m barrels last week, reducing supplies for a second week according to the figures from the Energy Information Administration. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all eyes on the service sector this morning as the PMI reports for May are published for the UK and the eurozone. In the UK, the Markit/CIPS report will be closely watched by investors looking for clues on how the wider economy is doing in the second quarter. Economists are predicting the monthly survey will paint a stable picture of the the sector, which accounts for more than three quarters of the UK economy. The headline index is predicted to rise to edge up to 52.5 in May from 52.3 in April, where anything above 50 signals an expansion in activity. If the number comes in below that, investor nerves - already shot in the run up to the EU referendum - are likely to rise. As Michael Hewson chief market analyst at CMC Markets, puts it: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get further colour on whether the UK economy has hit a partially self-inflicted slump brought about by all the hysteria surrounding the upcoming referendum vote. A poor number here could well raise concerns about a potential negative quarter for the UK economy, in the process increasing speculation about a possible rate cut by the Bank of England. What was that about a possible DIY recession? Also coming up..... We will get the eurozone services PMIs, and this afternoon the closely watched non-farm payrolls report will be published in the US. Will the jobs report make the Fed more likely or less likely to raise US interest rates in the near future? We will bring you all the reaction.",

                "bodyText":"Dominic Chappell, the former owner of BHS, sent an abusive text message to the chief executive of the retailer just hours after administrators announced that it would close all its shops. Chappell described Darren Topp as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fucking prick\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the message and blamed him and Michael Hitchcock, BHS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former finance consultant, for the demise of the business. The text message highlights the breakdown in relationship between the key players in the scandal. When contacted by the Guardian over the message, Chappell said he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153meant absolutely every word\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and claimed that Topp and Sir Philip Green \u00e2\u20ac\u0153have driven this company to liquidation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In the message to Topp, Chappell wrote: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Well done. I hope you and Michael are happy that you got the out come [sic] you wanted. You fucking prick.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A spokesman for BHS said the text message was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new low\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for Chappell and that he is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fantasist\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The message was sent on Thursday evening, three hours after administrators said they had failed to secure a rescue deal for the 88-year-old business, its 163 stores, and 11,000 staff. Duff &amp; Phelps, the administrator, is now looking for buyers for BHS stores, the brand and its international business. Mike Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sports Direct and discount chain Primark are among the retailers looking at buying shops. Green is under growing pressure to give up his company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim to \u00c2\u00a335m from the administration. Arcadia is a secured creditor to BHS along with HSBC, Barclays, Gordon Brothers and Grovepoint, who are owned about \u00c2\u00a3120m in total. The secured creditors are ahead of employees, suppliers, landlords, and HMRC in the queue to be paid any proceeds from the sale of assets. The unsecured creditors, including the BHS pension scheme, are owed as much as \u00c2\u00a31.3bn. Lord Myners, the former chairman of Marks &amp; Spencer, called on Green to take responsibility for the collapse of BHS by forgoing his position at the front of the creditors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 queue. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He could give up that security and make sure the money is used for the benefit of the employees and pensioners and not claim to be in the front of the queue,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Myners told BBC Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today programme. The head of the Institute of Directors, Simon Walker, accused Green of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lamentable failure of behaviour\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and called the downfall of BHS a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153blight on the reputation of British business\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Serious questions need to be asked of almost everybody concerned in the running of BHS, the sale, and the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demise.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chappell, who will answer questions from MPs next Wednesday over the scandal, repeated his claims that Green could have helped to save BHS. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This company was totally and utterly saveable. It was through the actions of Philip and Darren Topp that it went into administration, and it was the actions of Philip and Darren that have caused this liquidation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The only person that had a qualifying floating charge was Philip and he called the shots. He could have reduced or helped or backed up one of the bids going through to save 11,000 jobs and he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. I think the deals on the table were good enough to save the company but it was Philip pushing for his \u00c2\u00a335m.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chappell, who said he was working on a bid for BHS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s international business, added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I meant absolutely every word I said in that text to Darren.

I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sleep at night. I am sick to my stomach with it. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to be this way.

Anyone with a conscience who has taken millions out of a failing business, leading to the loss of thousands of jobs, would hang their head in in shame, not send abusive text messages.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A source close to the administration denied that Green had prevented a rescue deal, saying the tycoon had gone \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ballistic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when he found out that BHS would be wound down. Arcadia declined to comment. The source said that the deal fell apart after a Portuguese-backed consortium led by Greg Tufnell, the brother of former England cricketer Phil Tufnell, failed to pay the \u00c2\u00a330m sale price by the deadline of Thursday morning. MPs on the work and pensions committee and the business, skills and innovation committee published further evidence on Friday relating to their investigation into the collapse of BHS. They raise further questions about why Green sold the company to Chappell, who has been declared bankrupt three times. Paul Budge, Arcadia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance director, told parliament last week that \u00c2\u00a3120m had been made available to Retail Acquisitions by Farallon, a San Francisco-based hedge fund that invests in the debt of distressed businesses. He said the credit facility made available by Farallon was important because it showed Retail Acquisitions had the funding to run BHS and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153their intentions were serious in that they wanted to run the business as a going concern\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But written evidence from Goldman Sachs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Anthony Gutman, who gave informal advice to Arcadia, shows the banker had several reservations about Farallon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s funding, not least that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it was not clear that Farallon understood the existence of a pension deficit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. His detailed notes on the interaction between Green, Budge, Chappell and their advisers, which run from October 2014 until about a week before the deal was completed in March 2015, show that Green\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team twice called off the deal because of concerns about the buyers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 credibility and funding. It does not shed light on why the deal went ahead despite concerns. Frank Field, chairman of the work and pension committee, said the information raised a number of questions including why a bid backed by Farallon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s money had become the preferred deal despite concerns about their backing.",

That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a terrible, terrible prospect.<br></p> <p>Second, it is very clear, extremely clear, that additional regulation on the economy at this point would be a burden on growth and whichever candidate imposes the most regulation is going to get the least growth. I give credit to Mr Trump, who says he is going to reduce regulation. If Mr Sanders were president, it would be an absolute, total catastrophe. He would regulate the American economy to death.

                "bodyText":"Ben Stein, writer, economist, actor and Republican, has seen a lot of elections but none like this. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It has been an extremely strange year,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says the 71-year-old who got his start as a speechwriter for Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. Stein has never voted for a Democrat, but he is appalled by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anti-free trade rhetoric that he says could lead to a trade war. Hillary Clinton probably has a better grasp of things, Stein thinks. Bernie Sanders, on the other hand, is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153willfully ignorant\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have seen a lot of elections and I have never seen anything like this. It seems to me it is a testament to the complete collapse of education that people can have such preposterous policies as an end to free trade and think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to help America. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just startling that: a) the candidates know so little and; b) that the voters have not been better informed about this. The American education system is in a state of freefall collapse so that certainly explains a lot,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. What do you think the economy would look like two years into the presidency of all three remaining presidential candidates? All the candidates are against free trade \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a disastrous mistake. Free trade is one of the main sources of economic growth. Any interference with free trade in the long run produces negative results for the country that imposes the restrictions. One of the great breakthroughs in all of human history has been free trade. When I hear Mr Trump or Mrs Clinton or Mr Sanders talk about how they are going to stop free trade and in some way block America from being part of the world trading system, it makes my blood run cold. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a terrible, terrible prospect. Second, it is very clear, extremely clear, that additional regulation on the economy at this point would be a burden on growth and whichever candidate imposes the most regulation is going to get the least growth. I give credit to Mr Trump, who says he is going to reduce regulation. If Mr Sanders were president, it would be an absolute, total catastrophe. He would regulate the American economy to death. Mrs Clinton, I think, would do a fine job. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry about her in terms of regulation at all. Except that her taxes on the fossil fuel industry are unwarranted and unwise. In terms of tax policy, all of them say they are going to cut taxes on the poor, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fake because the American poor already pay no taxes. Approximately 50% of American wage earners don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay any tax already, so that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fake. In terms of raising tax on the rich, frankly, I think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good idea. The rich in this country are really, really rich. And they can pay more tax. Whether that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be enough to substantially affect the deficit is very, very questionable. I applaud Mr Sanders for wanting to seriously raise rates on the rich. That is something that should happen. If he did it, there would be a lot of yelling and screaming but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the deficit would be affected very much. Mrs Clinton, I think, has a more balanced approach. I think probably a good approach. Mr Trump says he can both reduce taxes and reduce the deficit. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s complete nonsense. What do you think of Trump as a businessman? He is not a great businessman. He inherited a great deal of money. He did some successful real estate deals. Hardly anyone could miss doing successful real estate deals in New York considering the incredible boom that has taken place and the very low base point when he started out. He is not a great businessman at all \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in no way. Let me back up and say, everyone I know says he is an incredibly nice guy. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got to count for something. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think he is a great businessman and even if he were a great businessman, that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean he would be a great steward of the US economy. The two have nothing to do with each other. Imagine Trump is elected president and he starts enforcing some of the policies he has mentioned. Would the economy improve, stay the same or get worse? It would get much worse. In terms, it would be a disaster. Trade is very important. The US economy is roughly 15% trade dependent \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very roughly 15%. The question of the day: would his gains in fossil fuel deregulation offset the losses in trade? I doubt it. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very, very important that he get educated about the benefits of free trade. What does his popularity with working-class Americans mean? What do the regular folks feel about the economy? I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the regular folks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c of course, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know that many regular folks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the regular folks know much about the economy or about how trade works. If the regular folks think that China came along in the middle of the night and stole all their jobs, then nothing could be further from the truth. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just nonsense. I think Trump is popular because he says: I am going to go to China and get those jobs back. But he is not going to be able to do that. And any attempt to try would be a disaster.

Perhaps not even this year, some believe.</strong> Christopher Vecchio, currency analyst at DailyFX, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The May US labor market was the exact type of jobs report that could that could upend Federal Reserve policymakers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hopes of raising rates in June. Remember in January when the Federal Open Market Committee was suggesting it was still going to raise rates four times this year? That was an odd notion then, and it outright laughable now.</p> <p>Before Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labor market report, the Fed funds futures contract was implying around a 22% chance of a rate hike in June. Today, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pricing just 4%.</p> <p>Markets have quickly scaled back expectations of any further tightening this year, with the only rate hike projected to come in December (58.5% chance). Still, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unconvincing, considering that the Fed has never raised rates unless the Fed funds futures contract has implied at least a 60% chance of hiking rates in the front month. Markets themselves aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fully convinced that another hike is coming this year.</p> <p>This doubt about further policy normalisation by the Fed in 2016 is well-founded. We continually express our disbelief that the Fed (or the ECB for that matter) would announce a significant change to policy without concurrently releasing new staff projections and letting Fed Chair Janet Yellen hold a press conference to try and soothe markets.</p> <p>In an effort to become more transparent, central banks have become more predictable. Skipping ahead past June, September is the next time the Fed would have a staff projections update and press conference, but it seems highly unlikely that any policy tightening will be done on the doorstep of what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already a vicious US Presidential election.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57558b48e4b0d1779f1e1805\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-06T14:42:04.925Z\">3.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is likely to hint at further rate rises later this year at her speech today, despite last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor US jobs numbers, says Reuters. But an increase this month looks off the table:</p> <blockquote> <p>Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen will likely keep the door open to an interest rate hike within the next few months when she speaks on Monday, while striking a balanced tone about recently disappointing jobs growth and mixed signals in the U.S. economy.</p> <p>Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech to the World Affairs Council of Philadelphia at 12:30 p.m. ET (1630 GMT) will address the economy and monetary policy, and is the last public comment by U.S. central bankers before their June 14-15 meeting. </p> <p>The chances of a rate hike at that meeting were all but killed by a report showing the U.S. economy added only 38,000 jobs in May, muting recently upbeat data on consumer spending and overall growth. A sensitive British vote on European Union membership set for later this month is another reason for the Fed to wait.</p> <p>Economists now see July or September as more likely timing for a quarter-point policy tightening, after the central bank lifted off from near-zero rates in December.</p> </blockquote> <p>The full story is <strong><a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-yellen-idUSKCN0YS142?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=Social\">here.</a></strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-575580a0e4b0d1779f1e17bd\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-06T13:56:31.824Z\">2.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street rises at open</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US markets have joined in the general positive mood for equities, ahead of the speech later from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen.</p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up around 100 points or 0.5% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq both opened in positive territory.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57557bf8e4b0be576f9d9bae\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-06T13:35:20.002Z\">2.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More signs of Leave gaining ground, from spread betting firm IG:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/minefornothing/status/739812080195272705\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">IG SAYS MORE MONEY NOW BEING TRADED ON AN &quot;OUT&quot; VOTE IN UK&#39;S EU REFERENDUM VS &quot;IN&quot; VOTE <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash\">#Brexit</a></p>&mdash; MineForNothing (@minefornothing) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/minefornothing/status/739812080195272705\">June 6, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57557a93e4b052682026580a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-06T13:31:48.922Z\">2.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>It will be a long night for City traders on 23 June, the day of the EU referendum.</strong></p> <p>According to Bloomberg a number of banks, including RBS, JP Morgan, Lloyds Banking Group and Morgan Stanley plan to keep traders in place overnight to monitor market movements as the results unfold.</p> <p>The full story is <strong><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-06/jpmorgan-rbs-said-to-staff-trading-floors-overnight-for-brexit\">here</a></strong>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57557689e4b0be576f9d9b8f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-06T13:14:21.185Z\">2.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Brexit risk justifies US rate patience - Fed's Lockhart</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>For hints at the timing of further US rate rises, all eyes are on a speech later from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen.</p> <p>But ahead of that Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart has urged patience following <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jun/03/markets-await-services-data-for-clues-on-uk-economy-business-live\">Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing US jobs numbers,</a></strong> telling Bloomberg the economy is on track for only moderate growth and Brexit is a risk for the economy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Livesquawk/status/739805047421337600\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Lockhart: Jobs Number, Brexit Justify Patience<br>- On Track For Moderate US Growth</p>&mdash; Livesquawk (@Livesquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Livesquawk/status/739805047421337600\">June 6, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bsurveillance/status/739804898578051072\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AtlantaFed\">@AtlantaFed</a> President Lockhart: Jobs report, Brexit, justify patience.

                "bodyText":"Sterling is little changed after Fed chair Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments that US rates could gradually rise without specifying when that might happen, with investors more preoccupied with the Brexit polls showing the Leave camp in the ascendency. The pound is currently down nearly a cent at $1.4451, while against the euro, the UK currency has weakened slightly again, down 0.49% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.2708. Meanwhile the dollar has lost some of its earlier gains against the yen, now up just 0.4% in the wake of Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. In her comments at Harvard at the end of May, Yellen talked about it being appropriate to raise US interest rates \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in the coming months\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Now she has repeated that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153further gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to be appropriate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but the timescale appears to have gone. Yellen concludes: To summarize, I have explained why I expect the U.S. economy will continue to improve and why I expect that further gradual increases in the federal funds rate will probably be appropriate to best promote the FOMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goals of maximum employment and price stability. I have also laid out the considerable and unavoidable uncertainties that apply to both this outlook for the economy and to the appropriate path of the federal funds rate. My colleagues and I will make our policy decisions based on what incoming information implies for the economic outlook and the risks to that outlook. What is certain is that monetary policy is not on a preset course, and that the Committee will respond to new data and reassess risks so as to best achieve our goals. She pointed to a number of uncertainties for the global economy, including US domestic demand, the outlook for economies elsewhere and the prospect of Brexit: One development that could shift investor sentiment is the upcoming referendum in the United Kingdom. A U.K. vote to exit the European Union could have significant economic repercussions. Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech is available here, with a live link here. On the poor US jobs figures on Friday, she said: Although this recent labor market report was, on balance, concerning, let me emphasize that one should never attach too much significance to any single monthly report. Other timely indicators from the labor market have been more positive. For example, the number of people filing new claims for unemployment insurance--which can be a good early indicator of changes in labor market conditions--remains quite low, and the public\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perceptions of the health of the labor market, as reported in various consumer surveys, remain positive. That said, the monthly labor market report is an important economic indicator, and so we will need to watch labor market developments carefully. Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen still expects further gradual increases in interest rates, although she said monetary policy would depend on the outlook for the economy: If incoming data are consistent with labor market conditions strengthening and inflation making progress toward our 2 percent objective, as I expect, further gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to be appropriate and most conducive to meeting and maintaining those objectives. However, I will emphasize that monetary policy is not on a preset course and significant shifts in the outlook for the economy would necessitate corresponding shifts in the appropriate path of policy. Janet Yellen is up shortly, speaking to the World Affairs Council of Philadelphia. Despite fears about the consequences of the referendum on whether the UK should leave the EU, equities are holding their nerve, lifted by a strong performance from commodity companies. The FTSE 100, filled as it is with mining businesses, has outperformed other markets as the recent dollar weakness helped support metal prices. The UK index seemed unfazed by volatility in sterling as a number of new polls showed the Leave campaign in the ascendency. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 63.77 points or 1.03% at 6273.40 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax added 0.18% at 10,121.08 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac edged up 0.04% to 4423.38 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB was 0.74% better at 17,625.00 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 0.25% higher at 8823.5 But in Greece, the Athens market slipped 1.47% to 639.11 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 117 points or 0.67%. Commodity companies are supporting stock markets, not least because of the recent weakness in the dollar following Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor US jobs numbers. Oil has also moved sharply higher, with Brent crude now up 1.9% at $50.58 a barrel after output in Nigeria was hit by militant attacks on oil infrastructure. Meanwhile there was a 1m barrel drop last week in inventories at Cushing, the delivery point for US crude, according to information group Genscape. The pound is still lower after the raft of EU referendum polls showing the Leave camp in the ascendency, but the currency has come off its worst levels. Sterling is currently down around a cent against the dollar at $1.4467 having hit $1.4381 earlier. The move is complicated by the US currency being affected by the uncertainty over when (or if) the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this year. Investors are hoping for some clarification from Fed chair Janet Yellen shortly. Meanwhile against the euro, the pound is currently down 0.34% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.2725 having reached \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.2661 earlier. The chance of a June rate hike in the US is much lower now after the poor jobs numbers last week, according to St Louis Fed president James Bullard, but July is still a possibility. In comments to the Wall Street Journal he also said Brexit was not a significant risk for the Fed. Over in Greece, and another deadline apparently looms: So when might the Fed hike rates? Perhaps not even this year, some believe. Christopher Vecchio, currency analyst at DailyFX, said: The May US labor market was the exact type of jobs report that could that could upend Federal Reserve policymakers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hopes of raising rates in June. Remember in January when the Federal Open Market Committee was suggesting it was still going to raise rates four times this year? That was an odd notion then, and it outright laughable now. Before Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labor market report, the Fed funds futures contract was implying around a 22% chance of a rate hike in June. Today, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pricing just 4%. Markets have quickly scaled back expectations of any further tightening this year, with the only rate hike projected to come in December (58.5% chance). Still, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unconvincing, considering that the Fed has never raised rates unless the Fed funds futures contract has implied at least a 60% chance of hiking rates in the front month. Markets themselves aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fully convinced that another hike is coming this year. This doubt about further policy normalisation by the Fed in 2016 is well-founded. We continually express our disbelief that the Fed (or the ECB for that matter) would announce a significant change to policy without concurrently releasing new staff projections and letting Fed Chair Janet Yellen hold a press conference to try and soothe markets. In an effort to become more transparent, central banks have become more predictable. Skipping ahead past June, September is the next time the Fed would have a staff projections update and press conference, but it seems highly unlikely that any policy tightening will be done on the doorstep of what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already a vicious US Presidential election. Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is likely to hint at further rate rises later this year at her speech today, despite last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor US jobs numbers, says Reuters. But an increase this month looks off the table: Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen will likely keep the door open to an interest rate hike within the next few months when she speaks on Monday, while striking a balanced tone about recently disappointing jobs growth and mixed signals in the U.S. economy. Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech to the World Affairs Council of Philadelphia at 12:30 p.m. ET (1630 GMT) will address the economy and monetary policy, and is the last public comment by U.S. central bankers before their June 14-15 meeting. The chances of a rate hike at that meeting were all but killed by a report showing the U.S. economy added only 38,000 jobs in May, muting recently upbeat data on consumer spending and overall growth. A sensitive British vote on European Union membership set for later this month is another reason for the Fed to wait. Economists now see July or September as more likely timing for a quarter-point policy tightening, after the central bank lifted off from near-zero rates in December. The full story is here. US markets have joined in the general positive mood for equities, ahead of the speech later from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up around 100 points or 0.5% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq both opened in positive territory. More signs of Leave gaining ground, from spread betting firm IG: It will be a long night for City traders on 23 June, the day of the EU referendum. According to Bloomberg a number of banks, including RBS, JP Morgan, Lloyds Banking Group and Morgan Stanley plan to keep traders in place overnight to monitor market movements as the results unfold. The full story is here. For hints at the timing of further US rate rises, all eyes are on a speech later from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen. But ahead of that Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart has urged patience following Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing US jobs numbers, telling Bloomberg the economy is on track for only moderate growth and Brexit is a risk for the economy. The pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s volatility in recent days shows that City traders have been rapidly revising their expectations on this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum. Ulrich Leuchtmann at Commerzbank sums things up (via the FT) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The market has become too comfortable with its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthings will work out all right\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 approach. [It] would be far less prepared for a Brexit outcome than for a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBremain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. That is the reason why these polls receive far more attention and move the market much more than those polls that still see a lead for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBremain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why the cost of insuring against wild swings in the pound over the next month is at its highest levels since the financial crisis: The Telegraph have pulled together a few interesting charts on the Brexit issue (click on the tweet to scroll through them). Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency firm World First, reckons the pound could fall sharply in the next couple of weeks. He says the pressure on sterling has intensified, now that several polls are showing the Leave side in the lead. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sterling and Brexit remain odds; falling together like Icarus on a hot Monday in London. With 3 weeks to go I do not think it is incorrect to say that it is anyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to win; Leave have the momentum and opinion polls are frankly a mess; the differential between online and telephone polling has broken down. Given the level of campaigning, which has been abysmal, it is no surprise that polling is so confused; the electorate is confused and I think polls are showing more of an off-the-cuff-which-way-the-wind-is-blowing-at-this-particular-moment voting intention, not longer held beliefs. In this atmosphere momentum is key; the Remain camp has to get agitated.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It seems to be however that the economy is not what agitates British voters anymore and once someone makes immigration their top voting priority there is little than can shift that, regardless of how much of a monetary hit may be forthcoming.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Although the pound is down, shares in London have actually risen to a one-week high today. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares has jumped by 60 points, or around 1%, to 6268 points. The rally is led by mining stocks, who are benefitting from rising commodity prices today. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the US dollar has fallen against most currencies (but not the pound, obviously), following the disappointing American jobs figures on Friday. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Remain campaign event: University of Kent professor Matthew Goodwin has crunched the latest polling: The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPurdah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 period began on Friday 27 May, meaning the government cannot use the civil service to push the Remain side\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s message. Breaking: ICM have just issued a poll showing that the Leave campaign hold a five-point leave over Remain, at 48% to 43%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s their regular online poll, which took place after Sky News held two debates last week - one with David Cameron, and one with Leave campaigner Michael Gove. ICM says that the polls appear to have moved: After a fairly tumultuous week in which both Prime Minister and Michael Gove set out their stalls on TV, ICM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weekly tracker and indeed at least two other polls published in the last 24 hours, suggest a move to Leave might have occurred. Our poll today has Leave on 48% (+1), Remain on 43% (-1) with Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Knows still on 9%. This equates to a 53% vs 47% lead for Leave. Our poll somewhat reinforces a Yougov poll this morning which found a 4-point move to Leave, and polls from TNS and Opinium which also gave cause for concern for the Remain camp. All these polls were conducted online, however, and outside of ICM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unexpected leap toward Leave in our phone poll last week, no other evidence has been forthcoming from phone polls that Remain are falling back. If new phone polls do emerge with such an outcome, however, we could be more confident that \u00e2\u20ac\u201c irrespective of where the actual standings are on a poll-by-poll basis \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Leave have pushed on. Turnout levels appear to be surging. Caution is always advised when it comes to polls estimating actual turnout, as polls nearly always overstate it, but the 10/10 certainty figure has nudged up to 71% now, suggesting that the public are now more engaged with the referendum than at any previous point. Buzzfeed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alberto Nardelli explains that this equates to a six-point margin (once don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t knows are removed): The pound had been recovering a little, but this poll has sent sterling reeling back towards its three-week lows. That means it has shed one and a half cents against the US dollar, to $1.4381. David Cameron has been speaking at the Britain Stronger in Europe event. The prime minister had pointed to the economic uncertainty of Brexit, claiming that leaving the EU would \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcput a bomb under our economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Cameron predicted an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153immediate shock effect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from a Leave vote: Almost everyone now agrees, from the Governor of the Bank of England to the IMF, the OECD to the Treasury, 9 in 10 economists to, yes, even some Leave campaigners, there would be an economic shock if we left Europe. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s be clear what that means: The pound falling; prices rising; house prices collapsing; mortgage rates increasing; businesses going bust; and unemployment going up. In other words: a recession. And he also argues that British trade would suffer badly, during years of uncertainty as politicians tried to negotiate an exit from the EU. Think of the impact on BMW, for example. 80 per cent of Minis are exported. Think of the wider impact: fewer businesses, fewer jobs, a smaller economy and less money for our schools and hospitals. Add those things together \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the shock impact, the uncertainty impact, the trade impact \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and you put a bomb under our economy. And the worst thing is we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have lit the fuse ourselves. He was speaking alongside Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Harriet Harman, Lib Dem leader Tim Farron and Green leader Natalie Bennett. Our EU Referendum Live blog has full details: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff means the pound has shed 2% of its value in the last fortnight. Darren Ruane, head of fixed interest at Investec Wealth &amp; Investment, says sterling is suffering the brunt of Brexit uncertainty. Although bookmakers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 odds continue to show a victory for the Remain campaign, any signs that the vote\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s result is closer than previously predicted is likely to affect the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency by the greatest amount relative to other asset classes. Currencies are often good barometers of international investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 confidence in the economic outlook for a country.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The YouGov report also finds that the public don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t trust certain politicians over the EU referendum. David Cameron has particularly poor trust ratings, it appears, with 19% of those polled trusting the PM, and 72% not trusting him. Alexandra Russell-Oliver, analyst at currency firm Caxton FX, reckons this is a factor: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Many Leave campaigners have cited distrust for the Prime Minister as a main reason for backing Brexit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The YouGov results are online here. YouGov has also found that a majority of people back the Leave campaign, even if Brexit hit them in the pocket. Its new poll asked people to imagine that they were \u00c2\u00a3100 per year worse off after a Brexit; 44% of people said they would vote to leave, while 42% would vote to remain. A month ago, this question showed a small majority for Remain. The latest car registration figures suggest that EU uncertainty may be hitting consumer confidence. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) just reported that sales to private customers fell by 3.0% year-on-year in May. Total sales rose by 2.5%, though, thanks to higher demand for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fleet buyers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (such as car rental firms). SMMT CEO Mike Hawes says the market appears to be cooling in the face of the EU referendum. Whether this is the result of some buyers holding off until the current uncertainty is resolved or a sign of a more stable market for new cars remains to be seen.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd YouGov have just confirmed that their latest poll shows a move towards Brexit: Labour MP Stephen Kinnock fears that the political infighting between Conservative politicians is distracting from the serious questions around Brexit. Speaking on Bloomberg TV a moment ago, Kinnock warns there could be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153constitutional crisis\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if the Leave campaign wins, as we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what relationship Britain would seek with the EU. We need a better discussion about what a post-Brexit UK would look like.... What trading arrangements we would have, the relationship with the single market. the two million British people living outside the UK. Kinnock adds that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153leaving the single market would wreck the UK economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and that the steel industry in his Welsh constituency (home of the Port Talbot steel works) would be finished. [Kinnock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s father Neil, incidentally, is a former European Commissioner] But former chancellor Lord Lawson is arguing that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153baloney\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to argue that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade would suffer badly if it left the single market. Most of the world is outside the single market, and most of the world is doing better than the countries in the single market. According to the BBC, some Remain campaigner are considering using their Commons majority to keep Britain inside the EU single market if there is a vote for Brexit. The pound has fallen against every other major currency this morning, following the string of opinion polls showing the Leave side leading the referendum battle. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Garfield Reynolds writes that sterling suffered a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very ugly start\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the week: With less than three weeks to the June 23 referendum, investors have been disconcerted as the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcLeave\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 campaign gains traction. The currency dropped as much as 1.1% to $1.4353 on Monday and was down against all 16 major peers, while one-month volatility surged to 21.34 percent, a level last seen in February 2009. And this chart shows how the pound fell against the US dollar (white line), while sterling volatility spiked (as explained earlier). This chart highlights how the pound has weakened against the euro in the last couple of weeks, hitting a three week low today (the blue line): James Appleyard of risk management group Maplethorpe also expects a lot more sterling volatility: Our rivals at the Daily Telegraph have also helped to send the pound sliding today, analysts say. A survey of almost 19,000 Telegraph subscribers found that 69% are intending to vote for a Brexit at the June 23 referendum. The poll also found that Leave campaigner Boris Johnson is their favoured candidate to succeed David Cameron as prime minister. FXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed says this report has hurt sterling: This was the most shocking survey released so far, and with only 18 days until the referendum the GBP is extremely sensitive to opinion polls. YouGov and TNS online polls didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help either as both revealed that the leave campaign has picked up momentum and now leads over remain voters. Given the Telegraph\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s traditional audience, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perhaps not such a surprise \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but it may have surprised global investors who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a tight grip on UK media habits.... Sterling is likely to experience wild swings in over the next few weeks, in the run-up to the referendum. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at foreign exchange company OANDA, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The polls are likely to make people rather uneasy and we can see that quite clearly today in the pound. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With both sides likely to step up their game over the next couple of weeks, I imagine we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see a lot more volatility in the pound and the closer the polls get, or if \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcVote Leave\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 continues to push ahead, the pound may find itself back towards April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lows before too long.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (via Reuters) The pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early morning slide came as the Remain campaign prepares to accuse the Leave side of trying to con voters about the consequences of Brexit. My colleague Claire Phipps explains: David Cameron might not want to face fellow Conservatives in debates over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future but today he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll issue a statement with politicians usually found on the opposite side of the Commons, teaming up with Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Harriet Harman, Lib Dem leader Tim Farron and Green party leader Natalie Bennett to label the Brexit campaign a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153con-trick\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Together they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll accuse Leave campaigners \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including the prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own party chums Michael Gove and Boris Johnson \u00e2\u20ac\u201c of producing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153contradictory statements\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic future outside the EU, saying the Brexiteers have put forward 23 different positions on the alternative to the single market. Full coverage in our EU Referendum liveblog: And Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade unions are warning that workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rights could be swiftly eroded after a Brexit vote. Our frontpage story explains: In a joint intervention, the general secretaries of Unite, Unison, the GMB and Usdaw were among 10 trade union leaders warning that the Conservatives would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153negotiate away our rights\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if the UK decides to leave. They argued leaving the EU would pose a great threat to maternity and paternity pay and leave, the right to paid leave for holidays and equal treatment for full, part-time and agency workers. Shares in UK housebuilders are under pressure this morning, matching the slide in sterling. Berkeley Group, Persimmon, Barratt Development and Taylor Wimpey are the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 this morning. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Caroline Hyde blames Brexit fears: Some economists believe that the Bank of England could be forced to raise interest rates if Britain votes to leave the EU, to fight a plunge in the pound. That would obviously drive up mortgage costs. Traders are scrambling to protect themselves against the pound plunging after this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum. The cost of insuring against sterling volatility has hit its highest level since the wild days following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. That shows that investors are expecting sterling to move sharply after the result of the EU vote is known. FastFT have the details: One-month implied sterling volatility, or the price of insuring against swings in the pound against the dollar, has jumped to 21.9, the highest since February 2009. It hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t topped 15 in six years. Sue Trinh, head of Asian foreign-exchange strategy at Royal Bank of Canada in Hong Kong, says the EU referendum could easily roil global markets. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcLeave\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 vote would expose a host of uncertainties. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It would be more negative for the euro and the EU since the issue will drag on for other members.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s via Bloomberg: The pound is sliding this morning after a string of opinion polls gave the Brexit campaign a lead in the 23 June EU referendum. Sterling tumbled in early trading, shedding more than 1.5 cents against the US dollar. It has hit a three-week low of $1.4355, down 1.1%. It is also losing ground against other developed currencies. Against the euro, the pound is down 1 eurocent at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.2661. Traders are reacting to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Observer/Opinium poll, which gave the Brexit campaign a three percentage point lead. As my colleague Daniel Boffey reported: The leave campaign has picked up momentum and taken a three-point lead over remain in the latest Observer/Opinium poll on the EU referendum. The Brexiters now stand on 43%, while 40% say they support the campaign to keep the UK in the union. The poll suggests the remain camp has lost four percentage points in the last two weeks, during which Boris Johnson and Michael Gove have relentlessly campaigned on the theme of immigration. And aYouGov poll for ITV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Good Morning Britain has put Leave in front on 45% and Remain on 41%, according to overnight reports. Many analysts have predicted that the pound would tumble if Britain voted to leave the EU, possibly as low as $1.20 against the US dollar. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets confirms that the City is reacting to signs that the Brexit campaign is gaining momentum. The pound looks set to start the week on the back foot as the opinion polls continue to point to an increasingly close contest in the UK referendum as speculation increases about further gains in the polls for the leave camp. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a new bout of jitteriness in the City today, after last Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US employment report missed expectations by a mile. The news that just 38,000 new jobs were created in America last month has sparked fresh worries about the global economy. So there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of interest in a speech from Janet Yellen, head of the US Federal Reserve, later today (5.30pm BST). Could she hint that a June rate rise is less likely? Analysts at RBC predict that Yellen could move the markets: The chance of a July hike dropped from 65% on Friday morning to 32% by Friday afternoon,which seems reasonable, but Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech today could push that back above 50% or closer to zero, so either way, the chance for a US dollar move seems high. Investors are also worrying about Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum, on June 23rd, with the latest polling suggesting the vote is tight. At 9am, we find out how many new cars were sold in the UK in May. A poor number could show that Brexit worries are hitting consumer confidence. In the eurozone.... We get a new healthcheck on Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, with new factory order and construction data this morning. Worryingly, factory orders have fallen by 2% month-on-month. And Italy will also be in focus, after the anti-austerity Five Star Movement took a large lead in the first round of voting for the mayor of Rome.",

The target is looking increasingly out of reach, but the broader ambition remains.<br></p> <p>You might therefore expect that Osborne would jump on these positive trade numbers, as a sign that his Long-Term Economic Plan is Working. But so far nothing.</p> <p>The Treasury says it is a matter for the Business department. But that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t explain the chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s silence on Wednesday, when official figures took everyone by surprise showing that industrial production grew at the fastest rate in almost four years in April.</p> <p>Larry Elliott, the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economics editor, has a theory about why Osborne remains tight-lipped. [Quick clue: EU referendum.]</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2016/jun/08/why-upbeat-uk-manufacturing-figures-have-silenced-osborne-increase-production-eu\">In Larry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s words:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> In normal times, George Osborne would have been all over the good news from the manufacturing sector like a rash. The figures from UK industry were better \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a lot better \u00e2\u20ac\u201c than the City had been expecting and showed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/08/british-industrial-production-grows-fastest-pace-four-years-manufacturing\">fastest month-on-month increase in almost four years</a>.<br></p> <p>So where was the instant statement from the chancellor praising the strength of the economy and the success of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy? Sherlock Holmes would have had the answer. Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unusual reticence was a classic case of the dog that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bark.</p> <p>Put simply, good economic news doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really suit the chancellor at the present juncture. His narrative is that the risk of Britain leaving the European Union has left the economy trembling on the edge of the precipice and for that story to stick he needs signs that consumers and businesses are taking fright at the risk of Brexit.</p> <p>Unfortunately for Osborne, the recent data is not at all helpful.

On a brighter note, 4K televisions, computers and tablets sold well in the first quarter; washing machines and gardening equipment didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. You can read the full story here. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown, has a take on the drop in 10-year UK bond yields to a record low. While all eyes have been on the EU referendum campaign, gilt yields have been slipping, fast. The US Federal Reserve is backing away from interest rate rises following wavering employment data, and in Europe the central bank is pumping billions of euros into the bond market every month in the form of quantitative easing, both of which have served to drive yields down. The low yield on government bonds paints a pretty pessimistic picture of the global economy, and suggests we are set for an extended period of low or negative inflation, and weak economic performance. The question though is whether one can really trust an indicator which has been so heavily distorted by central bank stimulus measures. Back at the Brussels Economic Forum, European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici and Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos have both identified Brexit as a potential crisis facing Europe. Moscovici: A year ago we were talking about Grexit, now we are talking about positive integration. There are several crises around... Brexit, hopefully it will be remain but we await that... The jobless claims will be a relief to those investors concerned by last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shockingly weak payroll numbers. The non-farm payrolls showed just 38,000 jobs were added in the US in in May, compared with expectations of a 164,000 increase. It was the slowest rate of growth since September 2010. There were 264,000 jobless claims in the US last week, slightly down on the 268,000 a week earlier. It was a bigger-than-expected fall, with economists forecasting 27o,000 claims. It was also lower than the four-week average of 269,500. US markets are expected to open lower, as bond markets rally: Investors are selling shares and buying bonds, considered to be less risky assets at times of heightened uncertainty. Benchmark 10-year German bund yields have hit record lows, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX is the biggest faller among the major European equity markets. Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rather gloomy comments earlier - when he appeared frustrated at the lack of progress on structural reforms by eurozone countries - is also weighing on investor sentiment. FTSE 100: -0.9% at 6,247 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -1.3% at 10,084 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -0.9% at 4,408 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.2% at 8,810 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -0.7% at 17,777 Pierre Moscovici, European Commissioner for economic and financial affairs, is speaking at the Brussels Economic Forum. He says that while he understands structural reforms have negative connotations in some countries and can be politically difficult to push through, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we need to stand firm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The way to tackle long-term unemployment and reduce social exclusion is through structural reforms, he says. Output growth will increasingly depend on our ability to improve productivity growth and investment. The key to this is investment in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153human capital\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says, partly through education and training. I want reform to mean progress. Rolls-Royce is one of the FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest fallers, down 3.4% at 590.5p. The chief executive of the aircraft engine maker has apparently written to staff warning them that the company is falling behind on deliveries. Warren East urged his colleagues to work hard to ensure profit targets for this year are met, the FT reports. He wrote: [The] business remains in reasonable shape with opportunities and issues broadly balanced. Delivery issues mean there is a lot to do in the second half and hence a higher risk. East acknowledged times were tough for staff at Rolls-Royce, which issued issued a string of profit warnings and cut jobs. He told staff: Right now I do know that in many parts of the organisation that discomfort is very real indeed \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 For many at the moment \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctransformation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is simply unpleasant. I appreciate that this is a difficult environment, difficult enough just to do the job, without people like me preaching about \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpace\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. If we really want to be the Rolls-Royce of our industry we must push through overdue changes we all know we have to make. Catching up on some corporate news, Amazon begins fresh food deliveries in parts of London today. Taking on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supermarkets, Amazon Fresh will offer more than 130,000 groceries to homes in north and east London, including thousands of fresh produce, dairy and bakery items that the company has not previously sold in the UK. The service is available to Amazon Prime customers, who pay a subscription in return for fast delivery of goods. Ajay Kavan, vice-president of Amazon Fresh, said the key to the success of the service would be a combination of low prices, vast selection and fast delivery. The Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sarah Butler has the full story here. Low-income households are likely to shoulder a disproportionate share of the costs of Brexit if the UK votes to leave the EU in this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum, a respected thinktank has warned. Under a worst-case scenario some low-income households could receive as much as \u00c2\u00a35,542 per year less in tax credits and benefit payments in 2020, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. NIESR concludes that Brexit would knock government tax receipts and so force changes to tax and spending policies, assuming the government sticks to tough goals under George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal charter to get the public finances into surplus. Angus Armstrong, one of the report authors, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our analysis combines the consensus of macroeconomic forecasts with the spirit of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal charter. Based on these assumptions, our results show that a disproportionately large share of the costs of Brexit is likely to fall on low-income households.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Full story here.) We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got more reaction to those better-than-expected UK trade figures. Not everyone is convinced that trade will make a positive contribution to GDP in the second quarter. David Kern, British Chambers of Commerce: While the fall in the trade deficit is welcome, it still remains unacceptably large and is likely to be a drag on UK growth in Q2. April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures also highlight the need for the government to do more to support exporters, including improved access to finance for companies looking to break into new fast-growing economies. Martin Beck, EY ITEM Club: While export volumes were up 4.3% in the three months to April compared with the previous three months, import volumes were up by 4.6% over the same period. So as things stand net trade is likely to exert a drag on GDP growth in Q2, unless April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apparent export strength is sustained. The chances of this happening would appear to be relatively low. Global growth remains pretty subdued and sterling has regained a good chunk of its losses from earlier in the year, so the backdrop for exporters remains very challenging. George Soros, the billionaire investor who famously helped to force the pound out of the exchange rate mechanism on Black Wednesday in 1992, has been speaking about Brexit. He told the Wall Street Journal that a combination of Brexit, problems in Greece, and the migration crisis, could result in the a collapse of the European Union: If Britain leaves, it could unleash a general exodus, and the disintegration of the European Union will become practically unavoidable. Soros added however that the recent strength in the pound was a sign that momentum was behind the remain camp in the referendum debate. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m confident that as we get closer to the Brexit vote, the remain camp is getting stronger. Markets are not always right, but in this case I agree with them. Turning to other events, there has been more reaction to Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock sessions on BHS, where MP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quizzed key members of the BHS team about the collapse of the high street retailer. Among other things, the former owner of BHS, Dominic Chappell, was accused of threatening to kill the retailer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, Darren Topp. When asked by BBC Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today programme whether he was surprised by the testimony, Oliver Parry, head of corporate governance at the Institute of Directors got it spot on: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Absolutely. Who needs Agatha Christie when you have Mr Chappell and the BHS management team yesterday.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Exports grew more than imports in April, triggering a surprise fall in the trade in goods deficit. The news should be a boost to George Osborne, who has long argued that the UK economy would do better to be more reliant on manufacturing and exports, and less reliant on debt-fuelled spending. Back in 2012, the chancellor boldly set a target of doubling UK exports to \u00c2\u00a31 trillion . The target is looking increasingly out of reach, but the broader ambition remains. You might therefore expect that Osborne would jump on these positive trade numbers, as a sign that his Long-Term Economic Plan is Working. But so far nothing. The Treasury says it is a matter for the Business department. But that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t explain the chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s silence on Wednesday, when official figures took everyone by surprise showing that industrial production grew at the fastest rate in almost four years in April. Larry Elliott, the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economics editor, has a theory about why Osborne remains tight-lipped. [Quick clue: EU referendum.] In Larry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s words: In normal times, George Osborne would have been all over the good news from the manufacturing sector like a rash. The figures from UK industry were better \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a lot better \u00e2\u20ac\u201c than the City had been expecting and showed the fastest month-on-month increase in almost four years. So where was the instant statement from the chancellor praising the strength of the economy and the success of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy? Sherlock Holmes would have had the answer. Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unusual reticence was a classic case of the dog that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bark. Put simply, good economic news doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really suit the chancellor at the present juncture. His narrative is that the risk of Britain leaving the European Union has left the economy trembling on the edge of the precipice and for that story to stick he needs signs that consumers and businesses are taking fright at the risk of Brexit. Unfortunately for Osborne, the recent data is not at all helpful. Better weather brought consumers out in their droves in May, according to the British Retail Consortium. Now the Office for National Statistics has reported that industrial production was up by 2% between March and April at a time when the markets had expected output to be flat. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, says the figures suggest trade could make a positive contribution to gross domestic product in the second quarter, after being a drag for a prolonged period. April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data suggests that net trade could actually make a positive contribution to UK GDP growth in the second quarter, having been a significant drag in the first quarter of 2016 and through the second half of 2015. It lifts hopes that UK exporters will increasingly be helped by the overall marked weakening of the pound over the coming months. UK exporters will also be hoping that eurozone activity can hold up after an improved 0.6% quarter-on-quarter GDP expansion in the first quarter. However, the global growth outlook is still pretty uncertain, with the UK referendum on EU membership reinforcing this. More on those trade figures, which were better than expected and showed a surprise fall in the deficit. Goods exports volumes increased by 11.2% - the biggest monthly rise since records began in 1998. At \u00c2\u00a326.1bn, the total value of goods exported in April was not far off the record high set in June 2013. Exports of British-made goods to the EU rose by \u00c2\u00a3900m in April, while exports of goods to countries outside the EU increased by \u00c2\u00a31.3bn to a record \u00c2\u00a314bn. Andrew Sentance, former policymaker at the Bank of England, considered the annual numbers: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit with the rest of the world fell more than expected in April following a record jump in goods exports. The deficit fell to \u00c2\u00a310.5bn from a downwardly revised \u00c2\u00a310.6bn in March according to the figures from the Office for National Statistics. The drop in the deficit was driven by a \u00c2\u00a32.2bn increase in exports, to \u00c2\u00a326.1bn. Imports also increased, but by a lesser \u00c2\u00a32bn to \u00c2\u00a336.6bn. Benchmark 10-year gilt yields have fallen to record lows, part of a global bonds rally as investors dump shares. Government borrowing costs fell as yields dropped to 1.224%, the lowest on record and down three basis points on the day. German bond yields also fell to near record lows, with the 10-year bund yield down 1.3 basis points at 0.043%. All major markets are down in early trading: Connor Campbell, analyst at Spreadex, has this take: Despite Brent Crude hitting an 8-month high the European indices got off to a sluggish start this Thursday morning. The FTSE once again fell away from 6300 as the European session began, the index dragged down by chunky losses for the likes of Vodafone, Johnson Matthey and Berkeley Group Holdings. Matters weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helped by last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chinese inflation figure, which unexpectedly fell to a 3 month low of 2.0%, something that has arguably muted the impact of Brent Crude\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest rise on the commodity sector. Draghi is talking about employment trends in the eurozone and warns unfavourable demographic trends will create challenges. Employment growth [is likely] to decelerate in the not-too-distant future because of the fall in the working age population. Even migration is unlikely to fully offset this natural population decline. He says there is room for productivity improvement in all countries, and that the challenge is first to raise productivity in firms and then get capital to those firms so that can grow. That would boost the eurozone economy, and jobs, the central bank says. Draghi finishes will a warning that eurozone leaders must press ahead with structural reforms \u00e2\u20ac\u0153without undue delay\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, or risk lasting economic damage. The cost of delaying reforms, he says, is too high, because it creates damaging uncertainty and holds back investment. There are many political reasons to delay structural reforms, but very few economic ones. And the cost of delay is too high. Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, has taken to the stage at the Brussels Economic Forum. The man tasked with setting monetary policy for the eurozone is laying out some of the measures the ECB has taken over recent years. He says bank balance sheets are not yet fully repaired. He reiterates that governments must do their bit to boost the eurozone economy. The ECB can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do it alone. Fiscal policies should work with and not against monetary policy. Draghi says doubts over the future of the euro need to be addressed because they are holding back progress in the region. Firms may understandably choose to defer or abandon investment plans. This has been clear in the past when the future of the euro area has been called into question. It can also effect the saving rate of firms and households, leading to higher precautionary [spending behaviour]. There is a critical need for clarity on the institutional make up of the euro area. Many proposals have been put forward to overcome the [shortcomings] of the euro area. Brent crude oil prices have been steadily rising since the beginning of the year... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Oil prices are climbing higher this morning, following larger than expected drawdowns in the US and disruptions to supply in Nigeria, where militant attacks have driven production in the country to a 20-year low. Brent crude is currently trading at $52.70 a barrel, up 0.4%. It is the highest since early October. CMC Markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Michael Hewson says there is no sign that the upswing in oil prices is going to end any time soon: While oil inventories still remain at elevated levels continued supply disruptions in Nigeria, have sent output to a 20 year low and this is helping underpin prices. The third successive weekly draw in a row has also helped sustain the uptrend for oil prices which has been in place now for nearly five months. With the US dollar also on the weak side there appears to be little in the way to stop the upward momentum behind the move higher in the oil price. Also coming up today... We have UK trade data for April at 9.30. Economists are predicting the trade in goods deficit to be unchanged at \u00c2\u00a311.2bn. Mario Draghi is speaking at the Brussels Economic Forum and is due to take the stage shortly. The National Institute for Economic and Social Research will give its verdict on what a UK exit from the European Union would mean for low income households in Britain. In the US, we have the weekly jobless claims data, which will provide the latest snapshot of the labour market following shockingly weak payroll numbers last week. (p.s. If you missed the dramatic events on Wednesday involving death threats and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fingers in the till\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at the highest level of collapsed retailer BHS, catch up here.)",

Returning to like-for-like sales growth for the first time in six quarters, Argos fared better than Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, which reported an 0.8% slide in the last three months after cutting back on promotions and said the market remained tough. The independent retail analyst Nick Bubb said that as Rogers was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very much seen as the architect of the deal to bid for Argos\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the City would respect the move.",

Certainly, some of the recent data have been disappointing. US non-farm payrolls for May were the weakest since 2010 and the ISM non-manufacturing PMI fell to its lowest level since early 2014... </p> <p>However, in our view these worries about the global economy look over-stated. Most importantly, we suspect that abrupt slowdown in US payrolls growth is not the start of a new recession... </p> <p>The upshot is that a downturn in prospects for global growth cannot explain the slump in global yields. Instead, falling yields probably reflect the reduced expectations for US interest rate hikes. As we think the Fed will resume its tightening cycle before the end of this year, and fears of Brexit should fade whatever the outcome of the referendum, we anticipate that bond yields will rebound. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-06-10T15:04:46.528Z\">at 4.04pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-575ad198e4b064f52e5f9d11\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-10T14:43:00.438Z\">3.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The pound hit a six week low of $1.4315, down 1% on the day, before recovering slightly to $1.4332 as Brexit worries persist.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-575acab3e4b00f7e4b1779b0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-10T14:15:57.668Z\">3.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The US consumer confidence figures come ahead of next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve meeting but are unlikely to prompt a rate rise, says James Knightly at ING Bank:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[The confidence report] gives us some confidence in the view that last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s payrolls disappointment is not the start of a new trend seeing as confidence remains close to cycle highs, suggesting no distress about the state of the jobs market. Moreover, with the consumer expectations component looking healthy at 83.2, it suggests consumer spending should perform well in the coming months. With job openings at cycle highs, businesses are still recruiting so we would expect a decent rebound in the June jobs report.</p> <p>However, the Fed will probably want to see at least two decent jobs figures before pulling the trigger on higher rates.

The recent data magnified the growing gap between the most favorable assessments of Current Economic Conditions since July 2005, and renewed downward drift of the Expectations Index, which fell by a rather modest 8.6% from the January 2015 peak.</p> <p>The strength recorded in early June was in personal finances, and the weaknesses were in expectations for continued growth in the national economy.</p> <p>Consumers rated their current financial situation at the best levels since the 2007 cyclical peak largely due to wage gains. Prospects for gains in inflation-adjusted incomes in the year ahead were also the most favorable since the 2007 peak, enabled by record low inflation expectations.</p> <p>On the negative side of the ledger, consumers do not think the economy is as strong as it was last year nor do they anticipate the economy will enjoy the same financial health in the year ahead as they anticipated a year ago. A sustained reduction in the pace of job creation could prompt consumers to hold down spending to increase their precautionary savings. Overall, the data still indicate that real consumer expenditures can be expected to rise by 2.5% in 2016 and 2.7% in 2017. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b64401965a0e0baacf13b3fcf356da321bee01f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b64401965a0e0baacf13b3fcf356da321bee01f/0_0_1080_679/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Consumer sentiment\" width=\"1000\" height=\"629\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Consumer sentiment</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: University of Michigan</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-575ac779e4b00f7e4b1779a4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-10T14:01:58.975Z\">3.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US consumer confidence slips</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In the US, consumer confidence slipped back in the preliminary June reading, but not as much as expected.</p> <p>The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index fell from 94.7 in May to 94.3, but this was better than the forecast figure of 94.</p> <p>The current conditions index of 111.7, up from 109.9, was the highest since July 2005.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-06-10T14:03:22.471Z\">at 3.03pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-575ac557e4b01a5ff948b675\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-10T13:51:51.749Z\">2.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>With stock markets under pressure amid a cocktail of concerns - including Brexit, falling oil prices, next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve meeting on US interest rates - gold is one of the havens being sought by investors.</strong></p> <p>At the moment the metal is up around $5 an ounce at $1274.

                "bodyText":"The number of US oil rigs rose for the second week in a row after the recent rise in the crude price to above $50, according to the regular Baker Hughes report. The weekly count showed a total rise of 6 rigs to 414, as the increase in oil prices to an 11 month high encouraged drillers back to the wells. The rise was split between three oil rigs and three gas. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day and the week. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back next week. Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi has said it would be a disaster for Britain if it voted to leave the EU, and would also hurt Europe and cause short term market instability. [To be fair short term market instability is already with us] According to Reuters, Renzi said at a conference in Genoa in northern Italy that Brexit would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a dreadful mistake for both Britain and Europe.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Moving from fears of the UK leaving Europe to the England football team leaving the Euros, Zoe Wood has been looking at the winners and losers from the feast of football which begins this evening. Read her report here: It was a bad end to the week as investors took fright, with Brexit fears dominating the markets but a fall in oil prices and nervousness ahead of next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US Federal Reserve meeting adding to the uncertainty. Bond yields fell sharply and gold rose as investors took a safety first approach. In the UK, leading shares suffered their sharpest one day percentage fall since 11 February, while European markets also recorded major losses. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Markets have come full circle this week, with the gains seen in the early part of the week giving way to substantial losses towards the end. It is particularly notable that whilst European indices have seen substantial losses, the US markets are have managed to claw back some early losses, highlighting proximity of the link between todays selling and the fear of a Brexit. Banks came under particular pressure on concerns about the impact of negative bond yields while commodity companies suffered as metal and oil prices fell. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 116.13 points or 1.86% at 6115.76 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 2.52% to 9834.62 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 2.24% lower at 4306.72 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 3.62% to 17,120.16 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 3.18% down at 8490.5 In Greece, the Athens market lost 4.18% to 618.67 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 0.43% or 78 points. And Brent crude has slid 2.18% to $50.82 a barrel. Worries about the global economy could be one factor pushing bond yields lower but it may not be the real story, says Andrew Kenningham of Capital Economics: One possible explanation for the latest decline in global bond yields is that concerns about global growth have surfaced again. Certainly, some of the recent data have been disappointing. US non-farm payrolls for May were the weakest since 2010 and the ISM non-manufacturing PMI fell to its lowest level since early 2014... However, in our view these worries about the global economy look over-stated. Most importantly, we suspect that abrupt slowdown in US payrolls growth is not the start of a new recession... The upshot is that a downturn in prospects for global growth cannot explain the slump in global yields. Instead, falling yields probably reflect the reduced expectations for US interest rate hikes. As we think the Fed will resume its tightening cycle before the end of this year, and fears of Brexit should fade whatever the outcome of the referendum, we anticipate that bond yields will rebound. The pound hit a six week low of $1.4315, down 1% on the day, before recovering slightly to $1.4332 as Brexit worries persist. The US consumer confidence figures come ahead of next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve meeting but are unlikely to prompt a rate rise, says James Knightly at ING Bank: [The confidence report] gives us some confidence in the view that last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s payrolls disappointment is not the start of a new trend seeing as confidence remains close to cycle highs, suggesting no distress about the state of the jobs market. Moreover, with the consumer expectations component looking healthy at 83.2, it suggests consumer spending should perform well in the coming months. With job openings at cycle highs, businesses are still recruiting so we would expect a decent rebound in the June jobs report. However, the Fed will probably want to see at least two decent jobs figures before pulling the trigger on higher rates. This means we continue to favour the September Federal Open Market Committee meeting for the next rate rise. The consumer confidence survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist Richard Curtin said: Consumers were a bit less optimistic in early June due to increased concerns about future economic prospects. The recent data magnified the growing gap between the most favorable assessments of Current Economic Conditions since July 2005, and renewed downward drift of the Expectations Index, which fell by a rather modest 8.6% from the January 2015 peak. The strength recorded in early June was in personal finances, and the weaknesses were in expectations for continued growth in the national economy. Consumers rated their current financial situation at the best levels since the 2007 cyclical peak largely due to wage gains. Prospects for gains in inflation-adjusted incomes in the year ahead were also the most favorable since the 2007 peak, enabled by record low inflation expectations. On the negative side of the ledger, consumers do not think the economy is as strong as it was last year nor do they anticipate the economy will enjoy the same financial health in the year ahead as they anticipated a year ago. A sustained reduction in the pace of job creation could prompt consumers to hold down spending to increase their precautionary savings. Overall, the data still indicate that real consumer expenditures can be expected to rise by 2.5% in 2016 and 2.7% in 2017. In the US, consumer confidence slipped back in the preliminary June reading, but not as much as expected. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index fell from 94.7 in May to 94.3, but this was better than the forecast figure of 94. The current conditions index of 111.7, up from 109.9, was the highest since July 2005. With stock markets under pressure amid a cocktail of concerns - including Brexit, falling oil prices, next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve meeting on US interest rates - gold is one of the havens being sought by investors. At the moment the metal is up around $5 an ounce at $1274. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how it has been tracking the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit debate: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the state of bond yields, many in negative territory: Wall Street has opened lower: Dow Jones: -0.5% at 17,896 S&amp;P 500: -0.6% at 2,104 Nasdaq: -0.8% at 4,917 Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg, has written a note on the likelihood of a domino effect across Europe, should Britain vote to leave the EU on 23 June. He describes the possibility of a domino effect as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the main risk to watch for global markets and the global economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. However, Schmieding and his colleagues at Berenberg suggest the likelihood is low, and place the likelihood of Brexit at just 30%. Italy would be the country to watch, Schmieding concludes: First, Italy matters because of its size (the fourth-largest in the EU) and its debt (133% of GDP). Second, since the demise of Silvio Berlusconi, Italy lacks a strong centre-right that could take over from Matteo Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s centre-left. Third, if Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government were to fall, unlikely but not impossible if he loses the referendum on constitutional reform this October, parties with more than 50% support in current opinion polls may campaign in hypothetical early elections with a promise to hold a referendum on euro membership. That could rattle markets. But Renzi remains in the pole position. That Italy could be governed by an anti-euro coalition still looks unlikely. US markets are expected to open lower: Earlier Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank cut interest rates for the first time in nearly a year, citing an imminent economic recovery and more stable inflation. After reducing its main lending rate by 50 basis points to 10.5%, Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina said there was unlikely to be any direct influence on the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy in the event of the UK voting to leave the EU, according to Reuters. But there could be indirect risks through reaction in the currency markets, she told a news conference. If things stay as they are the FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall - now 1.86% - will be the biggest daily decline in percentage terms since the middle of February. With US futures suggesting a 95 point fall on the Dow Jones Industrial Average when Wall Street opens, the chances of a big recovery are not huge. The FTSE 100 is now down 114 points or 1.8% at 6,118. Spreadex\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Connor Campbell gives this update on European markets: Things got far, far worse in Europe, an alarming drop pushing the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s indices to a series of 2 and a half week lows. With Brent Crude dipping below $51.50 per barrel, and the commodity sector rapidly losing the gains seen at the start of the week, the FTSE plunged over 100 points this Friday. Finding a clear, concrete reason for this violent investor reaction is difficult; rather it seems that the commodity reversal, alongside a sharp decline from the financial sector, has joined the pre-referendum jitters to produce a bearish weight the markets are unable to handle. He says the Brexit jitters are now spreading beyond the FTSE to other European markets. The eurozone indices bested the FTSE in the poor performance stakes this morning, the DAX and CAC dropping a whopping 2.1% and 1.8% respectively. Like the UK index that leaves both at their worst price since May 24th, fears of a Brexit taking hold of the eurozone indices in a way that hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t previously been seen. Rewinding to slightly earlier in the day, the OECD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s secretary general Angel Gurria gave an impassioned speech when asked about Brexit by a journalist. Speaking in Paris at the launch of the organisation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic survey of the EU and eurozone, he said the British voters were being purposely misled by members of the leave camp, some of whom were motivated by their own political motivations... The message is not permeating easily because there is a lot of emotion and frankly there is a lot of very misleading messaging that is going on. I give you one example. It is often mentioned by the people who are promoting Brexit that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthere is stifling regulation of the UK economy and we will now be able to deregulate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. That is absolutely false. The UK is one of the least regulated, most flexible, open economies ... so much so that if they were on their own the improvement on regulation would be relatively modest. So you would not gain very much there. People do not have the elements to know whether that is true or not. He said that all the key institutions and groups - the London School of Economics, the CBI, the OECD, the IMF, the WTO, the trade unions - had provided evidence of the likely impact of Brexit. But the leave campaign had not. The people promoting Brexit are speaking emotionally and they fail to provide any evidence to the contrary. For Gurria, Brexit is personal as well as professional. This is an intergenerational decision that has to be taken. I say that with the authority of being the father of a British citizen, married to a British citizen, and with two British children. I would like them to have a better future. And I would like them to have a European future. And not in an isolated society, an isolated economy. Gurria said there were too many voices, leaving the voting public confused. It is a cacophony of voices and in many cases the voices of those who are promoting their own political [ambitions] even if it is at the expense of future generations. It is our duty and obligation to continue with the message, mostly to the British people. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the British people who would suffer this drop in wellbeing and revenue. The Europeans are going to recover pretty fast, but the UK is going to take a much greater hit. Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble is not the only one warning Brexit could prompt other countries to leave the EU. Billionaire George Soros warned on Thursday it could lead to a collapse of the EU, and ratings agency Fitch said last week: If the UK were to thrive outside of the EU, it might encourage other countries to follow suit. No wonder investors are feeling anxious. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all terrible from Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble though, he would take us back, eventually: At some point, the British will realise they have taken the wrong decision. And then we will accept them back one day, if that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what they want. Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble has also warned Brexit could lead to other countries leaving the EU, Reuters is reporting. You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rule it out. How would the Netherlands, which has traditionally been very closely allied with Britain, react, for example? If need be, Europe would work without Britain. It would be a miracle if Britain quitting did not have any economic disadvantages [for the UK]. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister added that in the event of Brexit, a call for more integration among remaining EU members would not be the appropriate response. Even in the event that only a small majority of the British voters reject a withdrawal, we would have to see it as a wake-up call and a warning not to continue with business as usual. Either way, we have to take a serious look at reducing bureaucracy in Europe. Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s combative and influential finance minister has waded into the Brexit debate. In a characteristically frank interview with German magazine Der Spiegel (to be published over the weekend), Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble says the door to the single market would be slammed in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s face should it vote to leave the EU on 23 June. The Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Philip Oltermann reports from Berlin: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble, has slammed the door on Britain retaining access to the single market if it votes to the leave the European Union. In an interview in a Brexit-themed issue of German weekly Der Spiegel, the influential veteran politician ruled out the possibility of the UK following a Swiss or Norwegian model where it could enjoy the benefits of the single market without being an EU member. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble told Der Spiegel. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It would require the country to abide by the rules of a club from which it currently wants to withdraw. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the majority in Britain opts for Brexit, that would be a decision against the single market. In is in. Out is out. One has to respect the sovereignty of the British people.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Reuters is reporting that Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble has also warned Brexit could lead to referendums in other EU countries, therefore destabilising the whole region. Shares in all FTSE 100 companies are lower. The top performers are down... The bottom performers are down... Equity losses are gathering pace. Major European markets are down more than 1%. The FTSE 100 is down 1.5% or 96 points at 6,136. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -1.7% at 9,921 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -1.2% at 4,352 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -2.1% at 17,396 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -1.6% at 8,632 The OECD says the European economy is slowly improving, but new challenges are emerging, including the prospect of Brexit. Gurria turns to the risk of Brexit: It would hurt British growth, FDI inflows, trade. GDP could be 3% lower than if you did not have Brexit, if you go for remain. He says the biggest negative impact will be on Britain. The EU will suffer less, because it is a big unit, able to withstand Brexit. Gurria repeats the OECD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that UK workers would lose the equivalent of a month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wages every year outside the EU. We are strongly saying remain. This is best for the UK, the EU and the world. The last thing we need is uncertainty, we have enough of that already. The OECD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s secretary general, Angel Gurria, says tensions in European financial markets have receded. Why? Gurria lists the reasons. The key has been better European policies. New rules. Monetary policy from the ECB has obviously been supportive. It looks like we are moving to a better fiscal position without having to do much heavy lifting. The building blocks to banking union are underway. But, Gurria says, unemployment is still high, and investment has been weak. We are still below pre-crisis levels, he says. UK, Germany and the US are the only three countries where this is not the case. The OECD press conference on Europe is starting. Watch live here. The European Union must drop barriers to immigration to boost growth, according to the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development, in clear opposition to arguments put forward by the leave camp in the EU referendum that the UK would prosper despite restrictions on migrant workers. The Paris-based thinktank, which is funded by the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest nations, said the EU needed to encourage workers to move to where they can find a job by forcing countries to recognise professional qualifications and allow workers to transfer their pensions. In its latest survey of the EU and the eurozone, the OECD said obstacles to labour mobility remained one of the three significant barriers to growth, alongside a failure to break the banking sector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monopoly on lending to businesses and Brussels\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 inability to tackle restrictions that remain in the single market. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Barriers to intra-EU labour mobility, including recognition of professional qualifications and supplementary pension portability, remain significant and need to be reduced. Labour market requirements for non-EU migrants should be further standardised,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the OECD said. It also said the inflow of refugees was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a major and pressing challenge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that must be met collectively by the EU countries. (Read the full story here.) Asian markets closing prices: Construction output jumped 2.5% in April, beating expectations of a 1.7% rise. It was the largest monthly increase since January 2014. It followed a 3.6% drop in March according to the Office for National Statistics data. New building work was up 2.9%, while repair and maintenance increase by 1.9%. Despite the better-than-expected number, construction output was still lower in April than it was in the same month last year, by 3.7%. But again, this wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as bad as the 4.8% annual drop forecast by economists. Not everyone thinks piling into bonds at any cost is a good idea. Janus Capital\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bill Gross is one of them. The bond market sage thinks there is a disaster brewing. Specifically, he took to Twitter to describe the negative yields on $10trn of sovereign debt as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a supernova that will explode one day\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Benchmark 10-year German bund yields have hit a fresh record low, as investors rush to the relative safety of bonds versus equities. The low was 0.0021%, meaning it is getting cheaper and cheaper for the German government to borrow money. If bund yields venture into negative, investors will be paying the government to buy its debt... The flight from equities continues this morning, with European markets down in early trading. As part of the same story, German bund yields have hit fresh record lows this morning , edging closer to negative territory (more on this soon). Oil prices are lower, with Brent Crude down 0.8% at $51.53 a barrel. Connor Campbell, analyst at Spreadex, has this take: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second half of the week slump continued to gather pace this Friday, the session starting with another sharp slide. With nothing on offer the FTSE had little choice but to focus on Brent Crude\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retreat (the black stuff back down to $51.50 per barrel) and the increasing uncertainty surrounding the EU referendum at the end of the month (the pound dropping another 0.4% against the dollar). The eurozone indices have seen an even more dramatic drop this week. The DAX, which had briefly pushed beyond 10,300 on Tuesday, plunged below 10000 as the morning got underway, while the CAC is now nearing 4,350, a price not seen since May 24th. German annual inflation has been confirmed at zero in May, unchanged from earlier estimates according to the Federal Statistics Office. (This is the harmonised rate, to compare with other European countries.) Also coming up today... We have UK construction output data for April at 9.30. Economists are forecasting a 1.7% increase over the month, following a 3.6% drop in March. Industrial production data and trade data earlier in the week were both better than expected, so it will be interesting to see whether construction had a decent April, and what that might mean for growth in the second quarter overall. At 10am (UK time) the OECD is launching its economic survey of the EU and the eurozone. A press conference hosted by secretary general Angel Gurr\u00c3\u00ada will be available to watch here and we will be bringing you all the key points. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Gold is in focus, nearing a three-week high and on track for a second weekly rise as investors seek save have assets in an uncertain world. The precious metal has been rising since last Friday, when US payrolls data came in shockingly weak, with just 38,000 jobs added compared with the 164,000 forecast by economists. It is part of a fresh wave of jitters among investors, who have plenty of uncertainty to contend with. On Thursday this week, Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, warned of the risk of lasting damage to the eurozone economy if leaders did not urgently introduce structural reforms. And as Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum on EU membership draws ever closer, the outcome of the 23 June poll is too close to call. Brexit, and all the uncertainty that comes with it, is a real prospect. Investors are piling out of equities, with Asian markets falling on Friday following losses on Wall Street and European markets on Thursday. Bonds as well as gold and silver are appealing to investors seeking less risky assets. Gilt yields on German and UK 10-year bonds fell to record lows yesterday, meaning investors had to pay more to hold government debt in those countries. As Michael Hewson comments, German bunds were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153within touching distance of negative territory\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He adds: A move into negative territory for German bunds in the coming days would mean that investors would be paying to lend money to the German government all the way out to ten years, in the same way they currently are for Japan now. Who would have thought that even possible even a year ago, investors paying governments to own their debt? Spot gold was trading at $1,267 an ounce, while bullion touched its highest since May 18 at $1,271.31.",

The persistent polls likely to leak out in the run up to the referendum should leave the pound in a constant state of flux, while the FTSE may well see itself return to that 5900, 4 month low pretty quickly on Monday. However, while the potential post-Brexit reaction is clear, it will be interesting to see how much momentum the markets can gain if Britain opts to remain in the EU, an eventuality seemingly backed by the behaviour of Spreadex\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clients.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5763ffbce4b0b4b233940b29\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-17T14:14:38.113Z\">3.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The result of the UK referendum could spark a spate of central bank intervention in the currency markets, including the Bank of England and potentially the Bank of Japan which has been worried about the strength of the yen anyway.</strong></p> <p>But a Brexit is less of a risk than Grexit - if Greece left the eurozone - according to Alan Ruskin. strategist at Deutsche Bank. He said in a note to clients:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The most likely scenario for the Bank of Japan to intervene and sell yen in the currency market, is if US dollar/Japanese yen threatened or breached Y100 following the UK referendum. Presumably, the Yen would also be registering even larger gains versus European currencies in such circumstances. In that situation, the Bank of Japan would likely intervene \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunder the cover\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of the UK referendum vote, by making a strong case to the US and G20, that i) Japan is being placed under unique duress from a dramatic tightening in financial conditions allied to the stronger yen; and, ii) that the exchange rate is reflective of volatile international events, and not domestic conditions.</p> </blockquote> <p>As for the Bank of England, any intervention was likely to be co-ordinated with the European Central Bank and the US Federal Reserve:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Were sterling trading to become particularly unruly following the UK referendum (say Cable through 1.30 and continuing to drop) the Bank of England is unlikely to sit idly by. Were the Bank of Englan to intervene to support the pound, it would make sense to also have the ECB and Federal Reserve intervene on the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s behalf, as a signal of global solidarity.</p> <p>Only if events in the foreign exchange market were reflective of a global systemic event that might trigger a significant tightening in financial conditions in the the US, would the Fed intervene on its own book.</p> <p>Such a global systemic spillover is not expected.

                "bodyText":"After another torrid week, European markets ended on a high note. Investors were in calmer mood as the prospect of Brexit appeared to fade a little, with the mood helped by the suspension of the campaigning by both sides for a while. Banks and housebuilders, which had fallen sharply in recent days on concerns about the effect of the UK leaving the UK, were among the biggest risers. But Wall Street was weaker, with Apple down on worries about its sales in China. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 added 1.19% or 70.61 points to 6021.09 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.85% to 9631.36 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 0.98% at 4193.83 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB jumped 3.49% to 16,923.29 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 1.98% higher at 8362.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 5.4% to 586.55 after an agreement to release the latest tranche of bailout cash But on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 81 points or 0.46%. Meanwhile sterling rose from Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lows of $1.4010, and is currently sitting at $1.4318. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back next week for what promises to be a crucial few days. Europe has to find a new way to build trust between member states and the people, European Central Bank president Mario Draghi has said. In a speech in Munich in honour of former German finance minister Theodor Waigel, he said: Today we face a choice \u00e2\u20ac\u201c between leaving things as they are and moving forward. And this is not a choice without costs. We have seen that the price of inaction is high. We have seen how it leaves the economy vulnerable to instability. We have seen how the perceived impotence of public authorities in meeting the needs of their people feeds into frustration and rejection. And we have seen how that risks undermining trust in and support for our institutions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and even the European Union itself... We have to find.. a way that builds on existing institutions to better ensure that the common needs of the people are met. The needs that we share in common, and that can be more safely delivered in common, must be identified and explained more clearly. They include economic interests, such as the benefits provided by a large and fully integrated financial area. They include defence, and more generally security against internal and external threats, the capacity to address global migration challenges and the protection of intellectual property \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all of which the European Union helps deliver, in ways that individual governments may not necessarily be able to do. And they include environmental protection and the fight against climate change. It is the demonstration of why, and how, those interests can be better protected in common that will gradually complement compliance and convergence as the basis for trust and the cement of the Union. European markets are holding onto their gains as we head into the close, but Wall Street has fallen back. Recent Federal Reserve comments showing concern about the state of the global economy have not helped, nor has a drop in Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price on worries about iPhone sales in China. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: For once we are seeing market jitters emerge from the US markets today, as relatively solid session for the FTSE has been overshadowed by a sharp deterioration in US equities today. The fears surrounding a Brexit have abated somewhat today, with a break from the polls allowing for a more positive end to a very mixed up week for UK equities. Crucially, the incessant rise in crude prices today has provided enough emphasis to keep the main UK benchmark afloat. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ultra-dovish comments from the traditionally hawkish St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard mark a significant shift in emphasis at the FOMC, with an indication we could only yet see one hike in the next 18 months. While there is no doubt that Fed confidence will have been knocked by this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s payrolls shocker, the accompaniment of a growth slowdown means that Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dream of a summer hike may turn into a dream of a 2017 hike. The uncertainty over the result of the UK referendum has seen investors pull out $1.1bn from UK equity funds in the past week, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. This is the fastest pace for 13 months and the second largest outflow over the past decade, after the last general election. Donald Tusk, head of the European Council, has shared his meeting schedule for next week. Wonder what they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find to talk about at 10.30 on Friday 24th? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the calm before next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probable storm in the markets, according to Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex. With European shares heading higher after the suspension of Brexit campaigning, Campbell said: Doing its best to dampen the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rebound was the Dow Jones, the US index opening 20 to 40 points lower after the bell. There wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily much to cause that decline bar a relatively weak pair of housing starts and building permits readings. Nevertheless the Dow sporadically dipped below 17700, perhaps playing catch up with the sharper declines seen across the week in Europe. Talking of Europe, while the Eurozone indices lost some of their lustre (the DAX now up by a reduced 0.7%) the FTSE held on its growth this afternoon, the UK index increasing by 1.1%. The pound, meanwhile, saw an even more surprising rise, with cable at points grazing $1.43 for the first time since the start of the week. Given their behaviour in the past few days the markets could be in for a real rough ride next week. The persistent polls likely to leak out in the run up to the referendum should leave the pound in a constant state of flux, while the FTSE may well see itself return to that 5900, 4 month low pretty quickly on Monday. However, while the potential post-Brexit reaction is clear, it will be interesting to see how much momentum the markets can gain if Britain opts to remain in the EU, an eventuality seemingly backed by the behaviour of Spreadex\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clients. The result of the UK referendum could spark a spate of central bank intervention in the currency markets, including the Bank of England and potentially the Bank of Japan which has been worried about the strength of the yen anyway. But a Brexit is less of a risk than Grexit - if Greece left the eurozone - according to Alan Ruskin. strategist at Deutsche Bank. He said in a note to clients: The most likely scenario for the Bank of Japan to intervene and sell yen in the currency market, is if US dollar/Japanese yen threatened or breached Y100 following the UK referendum. Presumably, the Yen would also be registering even larger gains versus European currencies in such circumstances. In that situation, the Bank of Japan would likely intervene \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunder the cover\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of the UK referendum vote, by making a strong case to the US and G20, that i) Japan is being placed under unique duress from a dramatic tightening in financial conditions allied to the stronger yen; and, ii) that the exchange rate is reflective of volatile international events, and not domestic conditions. As for the Bank of England, any intervention was likely to be co-ordinated with the European Central Bank and the US Federal Reserve: Were sterling trading to become particularly unruly following the UK referendum (say Cable through 1.30 and continuing to drop) the Bank of England is unlikely to sit idly by. Were the Bank of Englan to intervene to support the pound, it would make sense to also have the ECB and Federal Reserve intervene on the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s behalf, as a signal of global solidarity. Only if events in the foreign exchange market were reflective of a global systemic event that might trigger a significant tightening in financial conditions in the the US, would the Fed intervene on its own book. Such a global systemic spillover is not expected. The precedent of a potential Grexit was far more threatening for financial markets than the UK referendum, if only because monetary unions promote huge financial flows premised on a fixed exchange rate/price, and there are large winners and losers when they unravel. Unraveling trade agreements, do not have the same immediate risk management implications that lead to self reinforcing financial dislocations. At the moment Cable - the sterling dollar rate - is at $1.4295. More on the comments from German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble on Brexit. Reuters reports: Sch\u00c3\u00a4ulbe said on Friday that Europe was trying to prepare for any possible outcome of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum on whether to stay in the European Union. Speaking after a meeting of EU finance ministers in Luxembourg, Schaeuble also said Europe was well prepared to respond to current Brexit-related anxiety in financial market. His comments came after Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Thursday Britain would lose privileged access to the single European market if it leaves the European Union, in her strongest remarks yet on next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum. Wall Street is down in early trading. Dow Jones: -0.1% at 17,716 S&amp;P 500: -0.1% at 2,076 Nasdaq: -0.3% at 4,832 According to Reuters, the German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble says Germany is trying to prepare for all eventualities following the UK referendum on EU membership. He added: We think we are well prepared to respond to the current anxiety in financial markets. US housing starts dipped in May according to the Commerce Department. Privately-owned housing starts fell 0.3% to 1.164m from a downwardly revised 1.167m in April. Building permits rose however by 0.7% to 1.138m, suggesting the housing sector would continue to be a boost to the US economy. On both measures it was better than economists expected. Also this on BHS: The parliamentary committees investigating the demise of high street retailer BHS have published some more written evidence as part of the inquiry. Among the documents is a letter from Mike Ashley, the entrepreneur and founder of Sports Direct. In it, he outlines his version of events relating to his communication with former BHS owner Dominic Chappell and others over a possible rescue of the business. He suggests that Sports Direct looked twice at a potential rescue of BHS shortly before its collapse. Ashley claims that a proposed deal would have saved the vast majority of jobs and BHS stores: Following the announcement on 25 April 2016 that BHS was now in administration, Sports Direct contacted Duff &amp; Phelps with a view to putting together a second rescue package. A subsequent meeting took place at the offices of Arcadia on 27 April 2016. I attended this meeting in person along with my acquisition team. The other attendees included, amongst others, Sir Philip and Phil Duffy of Duff &amp; Phelps. Our proposal would have potentially saved the vast majority of the jobs and stores at BHS and we felt that this should be taken into account when making a decision as to whether or not our bid was accepted. Our understanding when we left the meeting was that we had an agreed deal, which was to be executed on Friday 13 May 2016. Following the meeting an SPA (Sale &amp; Purchase Agreement) was sent out by DLA on behalf of Duff &amp; Phelps, which was duly returned within 48 hours. However, as you know, the deal did not happen. Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics, says a British vote to leave the EU would force the European Central Bank to act. European equity markets would be very likely to drop further and peripheral bond yields could rise further, raising the threat of a re-ignition of the [eurozone] debt crisis. Meanwhile, an appreciation of the euro against a declining pound would exacerbate any negative effect on exports to the UK. Against this background, the European Central Bank will come under strong pressure to provide further policy support... the Governing Council would surely err on the side of caution and take more action. A further acceleration in its monthly asset purchases would be likely and another cut in interest rates possible. The ECB may even engage, with other central banks, in FX intervention to limit disruption in the currency markets. Speaking of CNBC, it also has an interview with US Federal Reserve board member James Bullard, who said there should only be one rate hike before 2018. CNBC reports: St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard, in a significant shift in his outlook for the U.S. economy, now says low growth and a very low fed funds rate of just 63 basis points will likely remain in place through 2018. Bullard, reversing earlier forecasts that looked for growth to pick up and rates to rise, now says 2 percent growth is the most likely forecast and that rates will remain low. Bullard also sees unemployment at 4.7 percent and trimmed-mean PCE inflation of 2 percent during this window. As a result, he says the Fed funds rates should remain at 63 basis points during the remainder of his forecast. The current target rate is 25 to 50 basis points. As a reminder, after the Fed raised rates in December there was talk of three or four further rises this year. Earlier this week the Fed held rates and made cautious comments about the risks to the global economy, not least the prospect of Brexit. More from IMF managing director Christine Lagarde. Speaking on CNBC she said there were significant benefits from the UK being in the European Union, and that Brexit was a concern not just for the UK but for the world. Brexit would hurt the UK more than the EU according to Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi (Reuters is quoting the Tass news agency in Russia). Of course it would be a problem but it would be a small problem for Europe and a much larger problem for Britain. He made the comments on the sidelines of the St Petersburg International Economic Forum. This follows his comments earlier in the month that a vote to leave the UK would be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disaster\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for Britain. Brent crude oil is inching closer towards the $50 a barrel mark - currently up 2% at $48.12. Mihir Kapadia, chief executive of Sun Global Investments, has a view: Crude oil prices have risen today for the first time in a week, with global markets enjoying a respite from worries about the upcoming EU referendum. The anticlimactic return back below $50 per barrel for prices recently has taken the wind out of some traders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sails, after a light at the end of the tunnel in the form of $53 a barrel last week was met with a 5-day slide. The impressive recovery in oil prices from early February led to some guarded optimism that we may see oil back closer to the highs of 2014, but the ubiquitous uncertainty in global markets since then makes prediction more difficult than usual. For now, oil is back on the rise. The problem for the markets is: we have no idea how long that will last. US cosmetics company Revlon has agreed to buy Elizabeth Arden in an $870m (\u00c2\u00a3611m) deal, which will bring together Revlon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hair colour products with its rival\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anti-ageing creams and celebrity fragrances. The move will create a cosmetics giant with annual sales of $3bn. It comes less than six months after Revlon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main shareholder and chairman, the billionaire Ron Perelman, considered putting the company up for sale. The New York-based firm has been struggling under its heavy borrowings and the deal will help it refinance the debt. Elizabeth Arden is known for its luxury skincare products, especially anti-ageing ranges, such as Prevage, Ceramide and SuperStart. Its fragrances include those licensed from celebrities including Britney Spears, Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift. However, the popularity of celebrity fragrances has waned, with sales falling, while Elizabeth Arden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s namesake brand has been performing better. Revlon was founded in 1932 by Charles Revson, his brother Joseph and a chemist, Charles Lachman, who contributed the L in the Revlon name. In the midst of the Great Depression, they started with a single product, a nail polish \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the first opaque nail enamel (at the time the only shades available were pale and transparent). Called Cherries in the Snow, it was inspired by the scarlet-lipped, cigarette-smoking Hollywood actresses of their day and is still selling today. Revlon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other nail polishes had names such as Fatal Apple and Kissing Pink. Lipstick became the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next big item in 1940 and it launched an advertising campaign touting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153matching lips and fingertips\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Jasper Lawler, analysts at CMC Markets, has this take on the markets: Fear-based trades sent markets to extreme levels in a short space of time and they have snapped back. Gold soaring to two-month highs typified the level of market anxiety. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp reversal has typified the sentiment reversal. The course-reversal across markets has seen everything that was doing badly, do the best and everything that was doing poorly, outperform. That means banks, particularly debt-laden peripheral European and Brexit-exposed UK banks are ruling the roost. Homebuilders are also amongst top-risers. US stocks look set to open basically unchanged following a day that saw the biggest daily gain after a loss of over 100 points for the Dow Jones Industrial Average since February. German bond yields are back in positive territory, reflecting a tick-up in risk appetite on Friday. The yield on benchmark 10-year bund yields is 0.005% after turning negative for the first time ever earlier in the week amid heightened investor caution. The pound is rising against the dollar and the euro this morning. Sterling is up 0.4% against the dollar at $1.4254 and up 0.2% against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.2672. UK investor sentiment has picked up following the suspension of the EU referendum campaign. Full story on Christine Lagarde\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech: Lagarde\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full speech is available here. She says the UK has benefited from additional jobs and income gains generated from increased trade with the EU as a result of its membership. This is not trade that would have happened anyway, or trade that has simply been diverted away from other parts of the world. The formation of the EU and the single market has been instrumental in generating more trade than would otherwise have been the case. And with more trade has come more investment, as the U.K. has become integrated into European supply chains\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsuch as in the aerospace industry, and in factories producing cars for the whole European market. Increased trade has also raised productivity and incomes by increasing the scope for economies of scale in production and efficient specialisation. Lagarde is also making a broader argument for unity in Europe. Pro Europeans must speak out against the tide of negativity surrounding the European project, she says: Right now, too many Europeans are worried about their cultural identity, their security, their jobs, incomes, and living standards. And too many of them are led to believe that things would be better if only Europe returned to closed borders and economic nationalism. This is a serious challenge for the European project. It is high time to confront this negative vision with a new perspective for those citizens who feel left behind. Those who believe that only a united Europe can be prosperous and dynamic need to step forward and speak up. Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, has urged the UK to stay in the EU. Giving an impassioned speech in Vienna, Lagarde said that while the EU was not perfect, Britain had been more successful as a result of its membership. Membership in the EU has made the UK a richer economy, but it has also made it a more diverse, more exciting, and more creative country. As in all countries, there are people who are struggling in this new environment, but for the majority of citizens, this has been a great success story. It has been said that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it takes great courage to see the world in all its tainted glory, and still to love it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd So I wish bon courage to our fellow Europeans from the United Kingdom! Some garden centre news now, as we approach the weekend... Tesco has sold Dobbies, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second largest garden centre chain, for \u00c2\u00a3217m. Dobbies has 35 garden centres across Scotland, England and Northern Ireland, and was bought by Tesco for \u00c2\u00a3150m in 2007. The supermarket chain has sold the company to a group of investors led by Midlothian Capital Partners and Hattington Capital. It is the latest in a string of a disposals by Tesco, as it attempts to focus its UK retail business on its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153core strengths\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Read our full story here. Connor Campbell, analyst at Spreadex, says the Greek deal is helping to lift investor spirits this morning. Once again the markets have bounced away from their lows, a solid US session and confirmation of a fresh Greek bailout seemingly lifting investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 spirits. Jumping by 1% the FTSE enjoyed the recovery from its commodity and finance stocks this Friday, with Brent Crude now back approaching $48 per barrel. The eurozone saw a similar (dead cat?) bounce this morning, the DAX and CAC rising 1.3% and 1.4% respectively. Unlike the FTSE, however, the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s indices arguably had something to celebrate, with European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici revealing that yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurogroup meeting had seen the finance ministers sign off on Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7.5bn tranche of funding just in time for the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hefty July loan repayments. Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, is in Vienna and will be giving a speech on European unity at 10am UK time. We will bring you the highlights. The bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s are leading the charge on the FTSE this morning. Lloyds Banking Group is the top riser, up 5.5% at 65p. Biggest risers: Biggest fallers: Markets appear to be taking a breather from Brexit fears today following the suspension of the referendum campaign. The campaign was suspended on Thursday following the death of Jo Cox, the Labour MP for Batley and Spen. The International Monetary Fund will publish its latest report on the UK at midnight. The Washington-based fund said on Thursday it was delaying publication by 24 hours \u00e2\u20ac\u0153out of respect for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tragic event in the UK.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Oil prices are climbing this morning, as the fears pervading markets over recent days appear to ease. Brent crude oil is up 1.6% at $47.96 a barrel. The FTSE 100 is back above the 6,000 mark, driven higher by the banks. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up 74 points. All major European markets are trading strongly this morning: FTSE 100: +1.2% at 6,024 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +1.1% at 9,658 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +1.1% at 4,198 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: +2.3% at 16,723 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: +1.9% at 8,352 European markets have opened higher, following Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains on Thursday. The FTSE 100 is hovering close to the 6,000 mark, up 0.8% or 48 points at 5,998. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Good news for Greece, as its eurozone creditors have agreed to release a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7.5bn (\u00c2\u00a36bn) tranche of funding urgently needed by Athens. Pierre Moscovici, European Commissioner for economic and financial affairs, said the agreement was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a welcome breath of oxygen for the Greek economy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after ministers from the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 19 countries agreed to unlock funds. Minsters gave the green light at a meeting in Luxembourg after agreeing Greece had made sufficient progress on reforms, but the technical details of releasing the funds will be dealt with by senior officials today. The money is expected to arrive in Athens next week, allowing the government to meet two debt repayments to the European Central Bank next month. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was clearly relieved and said the funding would allow Greece to move into a new, more positive phase: A cycle is ending for the country. The country is entering a stable macroeconomic, fiscal and investment environment.",

Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>George Soros is correct to say that a Brexit could lead to a catastrophic day for the pound but preparing for a re-run of Black Wednesday is not easy.</p> <p>Very few of those working on trading desks in 1992 are still in the City so there is something of the unknown about what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coming. Even the dark days of Lehmans are a distant memory for most traders. If Britain votes out, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fair to say we will not have seen a day in the markets quite like it.</p> <p>The worry is that a collapse in sterling today could be much more devastating than it was a quarter of a century ago.</p> <p>If the markets go completely crazy we could see an emergency Bank Holiday declared, or even a Sunday trading session to limit panic and losses.</p> <p>Financial markets are much more interconnected than they were in the early 90s, although the processes and trading systems have come a long way. </p> <p>Speed and access to market information is much faster today than it was back in 1992 and Brexit is a known quantity in the sense that we know when it will happen if it does. Crashing out of ERM took everyone by surprise. </p> <p>Central banks are ready to step in with extra liquidity should markets be thrown into chaos and the Bank of England has currency swap lines in place if required. </p> <p>But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interesting that the Bank of England says uptake of its most recent extra liquidity auction was lower than expected, which either suggests that UK banks do not anticipate Brexit happening or they have plenty of liquidity to play with. Confidence is high for Remain but markets may be underestimating the chances of Brexit.</p> <p>Equities are more complex. A slump in sterling could be net positive for FTSE 100 companies as up to 80% of earnings come from abroad. In fact the DAX and CAC may be a lot more exposed than the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue chip index.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57695469e4b0f51f19e1b6b9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-21T14:52:45.034Z\">3.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Yellen had said at previous testimonies that the Fed was looking into whether negative rates would be legal.

Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois Mitterrand\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lurch toward socialism in France, Ronald Reagan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s excessive tax cuts in the U.S., and Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s encouragement of bubbles were all egregious errors, but all were reversed, albeit not before substantial damage had been done. Divorce can be reversed by remarriage if regretted. There is no reversing Brexit if it proves unwise. Indeed, given the E.U.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very strong incentive to discourage further dissolution, it is far from clear that there would even be concerted efforts to minimize its cost.</p> <p>Second, markets are likely to suffer extraordinary volatility in the wake of Brexit. A Black Friday could follow referendum Thursday. It is likely that foreign investors in British stocks would lose 15 percent off the bat, adding together market declines and currency losses. This is a judgement supported by <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/05f69210-3684-11e6-a780-b48ed7b6126f.html#axzz4C8AzRdOS\">the gyrations in markets</a> induced by relatively small fluctuations in the perceived chance of Brexit and by the very high prices commanded by out of the money options. The truth is that even with all the regulatory changes that have been put in place, we do not know for sure how the financial system will respond. A return of systemic risk as large losses lead to cascading liquidations cannot be ruled out. At a time when central banks have far less ammunition than they did in 2008, the consequences could be grave.</p> <p>Third, Brexit will undermine confidence and increase uncertainty. No one knows what the new structure will be or how soon it will emerge. Quite likely Brexit would lead to changes not only in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relationship with Europe but also within Europe itself. While businesses wait to see what happens, they will hold off on new investment. Some will decide that it is much safer to base European operations outside the U.K.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LHSummers/status/745221782999703552\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Markets are likely to suffer extraordinary volatility in the wake of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash\">#Brexit</a>.

                "bodyText":"After a shaky start it looked like markets would fail to build on Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong gains. But shares moved into positive territory by the close as Wall Street edged higher and polls indicated the Remain camp was slightly ahead. But investors were still uneasy ahead of Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 0.36% or 22.55 points at 6226.55 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.54% to 10,015.54 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.61% better at 4367.24 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB added 0.45% to 17,431.17 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.23% at 8667.3 In Greece, the Athens market was 3.71% better at 608.29 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now 29 points or 0.16% higher. Sterling hit a five and a half month high before falling back, trading down 0.12% at $1.4659. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Janet Yellen has now finished her testimony. Another warning there may be liquidity problems on Friday following the referendum result: European markets closed higher, but Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, expects further volatility ahead of the EU vote: The prospects of a Brexit appears to be on a knife edge just two days before the UK goes to the polls. The IG Survation poll shows a clear narrowing between \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcremain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (45%) and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcleave\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (44%) campaigns, with the result likely to be dictated by the factors such as turnout and the action of the so far undecided (11%) voters. Yesterday may have seen a sharp relief rally in GBPUSD as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcleave\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 swung back into the lead, yet the increasingly \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctoo close to call\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 nature of this referendum should provide a highly unpredictable and volatile week in the markets. While there is only a marginal lead for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcremain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 when polls are concerned, the IG Binary (currently 72% remain) shows that the money is clearly backing a decision to remain in the EU. Back with US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony to Congress. Asked further about Brexit Yellen says: It could launch a period of uncertainty [with] negative economic consequences for the UK spilling over into Europe. The market reaction could result in a risk off sentiment that we would see impact on the financial markets. We might see a flight to safety which might push up the dollar and other safe haven currencies. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to overblow the likely impacts but we will watch it carefully. Could Brexit push the US into recession? I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that is the most likely case, but we just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what will happen. Fund manager Hargreaves Lansdown is the latest firm to say it will extend opening hours and has tripled its number of dealing staff to deal with the aftermath of the EU referendum vote. Could we see an emergency bank holiday in the event of Brexit? Or even a Sunday trading session. Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, said: George Soros is correct to say that a Brexit could lead to a catastrophic day for the pound but preparing for a re-run of Black Wednesday is not easy. Very few of those working on trading desks in 1992 are still in the City so there is something of the unknown about what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coming. Even the dark days of Lehmans are a distant memory for most traders. If Britain votes out, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fair to say we will not have seen a day in the markets quite like it. The worry is that a collapse in sterling today could be much more devastating than it was a quarter of a century ago. If the markets go completely crazy we could see an emergency Bank Holiday declared, or even a Sunday trading session to limit panic and losses. Financial markets are much more interconnected than they were in the early 90s, although the processes and trading systems have come a long way. Speed and access to market information is much faster today than it was back in 1992 and Brexit is a known quantity in the sense that we know when it will happen if it does. Crashing out of ERM took everyone by surprise. Central banks are ready to step in with extra liquidity should markets be thrown into chaos and the Bank of England has currency swap lines in place if required. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interesting that the Bank of England says uptake of its most recent extra liquidity auction was lower than expected, which either suggests that UK banks do not anticipate Brexit happening or they have plenty of liquidity to play with. Confidence is high for Remain but markets may be underestimating the chances of Brexit. Equities are more complex. A slump in sterling could be net positive for FTSE 100 companies as up to 80% of earnings come from abroad. In fact the DAX and CAC may be a lot more exposed than the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue chip index. Yellen had said at previous testimonies that the Fed was looking into whether negative rates would be legal. Asked for an update she says: We have the legal basis to pursue negative rates but it is not something we are considering or looking at. Back with Yellen and the Fed chair says a UK exit from the European Union could bring a period of uncertainty and financial volatility and affect the US outlook. She said the banks had put in place enhancements to liquidity [in the case of Brexit]. In another sign of mounting concern over Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote, global law firm Dechert has set up a new hotline for clients who need expert advice about Brexit. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be staffing it with lawyers, who can explain the legal implications if Britain votes to leave the EU. Miriam Gonzalez, co-chair of the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s International Trade and Government Regulation practice, says a Leave victory would create \u00e2\u20ac\u0153enormous legal uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Clients will need to react to questions from employees, shareholders and investors, as well as assess which areas of their businesses would be most at risk. At Dechert we realise that speed will be of essence in the days following the referendum to avoid such legal uncertainly impacting negatively on our clients and that is why we are creating the tools to allow clients to have access to the expertise they will need. Draghi is quizzed further on Brexit and what problems he foresees. He says: I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to speculate on the outcome or the consequences. We monitor all economic, political and legal developments so we can assess and manage the ensuing risks. Mostly, to be able to stabilise markets, provide liquidity. We have existing swap lines with other central banks. The agreements are there, we want to make sure they are useable, active and adequate. The event will have short and long term effects. It is hard to say what sort of action we would take in each contingency. Back with Draghi on Brexit: Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen has again warned of the risk of the UK voting to leave the European Union. In her testimony to Congress she said: In the current environment of sluggish growth, low inflation, and already very accommodative monetary policy in many advanced economies, investor perceptions of and appetite for risk can change abruptly. One development that could shift investor sentiment is the upcoming referendum in the United Kingdom. A U.K. vote to exit the European Union could have significant economic repercussions. She also expressed concerns about the domestic US market and the outlook for China: The latest readings on the labor market and the weak pace of investment illustrate one downside risk--that domestic demand might falter. In addition, although I am optimistic about the longer-run prospects for the U.S. economy, we cannot rule out the possibility expressed by some prominent economists that the slow productivity growth seen in rece Although concerns about slowing growth in China and falling commodity prices appear to have eased from earlier this year, China continues to face considerable challenges as it rebalances its economy toward domestic demand and consumption and away from export-led growth. So that means the Fed is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153closely monitoring global economic and financial developments\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and taking a cautious approach to raising interest rates: The FOMC continues to anticipate that economic conditions will improve further and that the economy will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate. In addition, the Committee expects that the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below the levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run because headwinds--which include restraint on U.S. economic activity from economic and financial developments abroad, subdued household formation, and meager productivity growth--mean that the interest rate needed to keep the economy operating near its potential is low by historical standards. George Soros has warned of the dangers of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Black Friday\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for sterling in the event of a Brexit vote, and now Ladbrokes is offering odds of 3/1 on that happening. It will pay out if the pound falls by more than 15% against the dollar in the 24 hour window between midnight on the 23rd and 24th in the event of Brexit. Ladbrokes said: Remain gained more ground over leave during trading on Tuesday, with the latest Brexit barometer reading showing a 78% chance of a remain outcome, up from 74%, or 2/9 in betting terms, ahead of leave at 10/3. Alex Donohue of Ladbrokes said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the event of Brexit we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not ruling out Black Friday at all. Britain has to vote to leave first however, and our barometer continues to tick round in favour of remain hour by hour.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yellen is delivering the Semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress, and is likely to repeat the caution expressed by the Fed last week. The bank was concerned about weakness in the global economy, poor recent jobs figures and of course, the risks posed by the outcome of the UK referendum. The caution contrasted sharply with a number of hawkish comments made by Fed members in the run up to the disappointing non-farm payroll numbers. Analysts have gone from predicting three or four US rate rises this year to perhaps one at most. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a brief moment of levity in Brussels, as Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mobile phone goes off as he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s answering a question on the eurozone economy. Ahead of the latest testimony from US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, Wall Street has opened in positive territory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 26 points or 0.14% while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.13% and Nasdaq 0.25%. What does Mario Draghi mean when he says the European Central Bank is ready for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all contingencies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd following Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote? Well, the ECB is likely to unleash every weapon at its disposal to prevent a market crash, and prevent the financial system seizing up. And that will include massive injections of liquidity into the euro system, in partnership with the Bank of England. Last week, ECB board member Ewald Nowotny cited the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcswap lines\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 which central banks have, to share their respective currencies at times of crisis. Nowotny said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If needed, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s secured that neither English nor European banks will have liquidity shortages\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. ECB ready to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccushion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 markets with liquidity after Brexit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Nowotny That would protect banks from having to sell their assets at bargain basement prices, to get their hands on cash. But it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t prevent a general repricing of assets, such as the pound and UK stocks and shares. Central banks could also act together to prevent a sterling crisis, potentially propping up the pound to prevent it weakening too much against the US dollar, the euro and the yen. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a video clip of David Cameron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lunchtime skit at Downing Street: Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank, has told the European Parliament that he is ready to take action if Britain votes to leave the EU. Draghi singled out the risks posed by Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote, while testifying to MEPs on the Economic and Monetary Affairs committee. He says that the recovery of the euro area economy \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gained momentum at the start of the year\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but added: At the same time, uncertainty remains high and downside risks are still significant due to the continued fragile state of the global economy and geopolitical developments. We will closely monitor the evolution of the outlook for price stability. We stand ready to act by using all the instruments available within our mandate, if necessary, to achieve our objective. In particular, the ECB is ready for all contingencies following the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum. Draghi also reminded MEPs that further stimulus is coming soon, and urged them to help deepen the single market and reform their economies. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full statement: The session is being streamed live here. Time for a quick catch-up. The pound has clambered to its highest level against the US dollar since early January today, as international investors continue to expect a Remain campaign victory in Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum. Sterling hit $1.4781 this morning, its highest level since David Cameron called Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote. But it dipped back after a poll showed the Leave campaign close behind Remain, at 44% versus 45%. After a weak start, the London stock market has crawled back into positive territory. The FTSE 100 is up 2 points, lagging the rest of Europe today. UK banks have only taken \u00c2\u00a3370m from the Bank of England in a special liquidity auction. One banker has told us that the City is less worried about the referendum. But Brexit fears have also been blamed for pushing Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public borrowing over target in last two months: Three top figures in economics and finance have all warned again leaving the EU. George Soros said it would trigger a sterling crash Nouriel Roubini predicted a recession, Larry Summers warned it could cause a market crash on Friday. But other City experts have warned that investors could be complacent; given the opinion polls are so close. Our main EU referendum liveblog is here (including speculation that the referendum could trigger a general election). The pound has dropped back after David Cameron made a solemn plea to the country to vote Remain. Speaking (unexpectedly) outside Number 10, the PM said the economy will be stronger if we stay, and weaker if we leave. He also cited national security, warning that it will be harder to keep the country safe outside the EU. At one point, Cameron declared that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brits don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd; and that the EU will carry on making vital decisions without the UK after a leave vote. And he also made a direct appeal to older voters, saying Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote was vital for their children, grandchildren and future generations. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear if this was a scheduled move by the PM, or an off-the-cuff decision. But the pound has now lost its early gains, and is hovering around $1.4688, where it started the day. The FTSE 100 is down 8 points too. But traders are also reacting to the latest Survation poll, which showed Remain just one percentage point ahead of Leave. Our Politics Liveblog will have full reaction and analysis to Cameron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech. Hello... David Cameron is speaking outside Downing Street right now. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s explaining why Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote is so crucial economically, and for national security. Our politics liveblog is covering it.... A new survey from Survation has shown that the Remain campaign has 45% support, with Leave very close behind on 44%. Larry Summers, the former US Treasury secretary, has joined the ranks of international experts warning against Brexit. In a new blog post, Summers predicted wild market gyrations on Friday if the Leave campaign in, and long-term economic damage. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: First, unlike almost all other economic policy choices, Brexit is irreversible. Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois Mitterrand\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lurch toward socialism in France, Ronald Reagan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s excessive tax cuts in the U.S., and Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s encouragement of bubbles were all egregious errors, but all were reversed, albeit not before substantial damage had been done. Divorce can be reversed by remarriage if regretted. There is no reversing Brexit if it proves unwise. Indeed, given the E.U.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very strong incentive to discourage further dissolution, it is far from clear that there would even be concerted efforts to minimize its cost. Second, markets are likely to suffer extraordinary volatility in the wake of Brexit. A Black Friday could follow referendum Thursday. It is likely that foreign investors in British stocks would lose 15 percent off the bat, adding together market declines and currency losses. This is a judgement supported by the gyrations in markets induced by relatively small fluctuations in the perceived chance of Brexit and by the very high prices commanded by out of the money options. The truth is that even with all the regulatory changes that have been put in place, we do not know for sure how the financial system will respond. A return of systemic risk as large losses lead to cascading liquidations cannot be ruled out. At a time when central banks have far less ammunition than they did in 2008, the consequences could be grave. Third, Brexit will undermine confidence and increase uncertainty. No one knows what the new structure will be or how soon it will emerge. Quite likely Brexit would lead to changes not only in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relationship with Europe but also within Europe itself. While businesses wait to see what happens, they will hold off on new investment. Some will decide that it is much safer to base European operations outside the U.K. The small rally in the pound today shows that Brexit fears are easing today, says Bill O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Neill, head of the UK Investment Office at UBS Wealth Management. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Markets are now assuming a remain outcome, with sterling edging up slightly against the dollar this morning following the significant gains of yesterday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Polls released overnight suggest a swing back to show a mixed picture, but there is a sense that the momentum favouring leave has been halted. Additionally, betting odds are now also pointing to that outcome. It is worth bearing in mind that the odds have consistently been in favour of remain, despite the narrowing seen last week. The US stock market is expected to open calmly in 90 minutes time. The main indices predicted to rise by around 0.4%, as investors wait to hear from Janet Yellen, Fed chair, when she starts testifying to the Senate banking committee at 3pm BST (10am local time). JP Morgan have done us a big favour by working out when the key EU referendum results will come. Using data from the University of Bristol, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve identified the most pro-Remain and pro-Brexit areas of the country. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also estimated the voting split in each area, based on a national dead-heat. That could help us work out who is actually winning as the results come in (as pro-Remain areas are likely to report first). Veteran US investor Wilbur Ross has revealed that the looming EU referendum has deterred him from buying assets in Europe. Speaking on CNBC, Ross also accused George Soros of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exaggerating\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, in The Guardian today. Ross isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced that the pound would suffer a worse fall than on Black Wednesday if the public vote to leave the EU. Ross also reckons house prices would fall very sharply after a Brexit vote. He also revealed that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s planning to raise money for Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tilt at the White House... Here are the Reuters snaps: Wilbur Ross on CNBC - Home prices would plummet in the event of a British exit Wilbur Ross on CNBC - George Soros \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exaggerating\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with his take on Brexit effect on pound Wilbur Ross on CNBC - Intends to work hard to raise funds for Trump Boom! The pound has hit its highest level since the start of the year, in a fresh signal that Brexit fears are easing. Sterling has jumped by almost 0.5% against the US dollar to $1.4781, a level last seen on 4 January - before the whole dratted EU referendum campaign began. The pound is also up around 0.2% against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.3017, its highest level in June. The rally comes as the Bank of England reveals that UK financial institutions took just \u00c2\u00a3370m in a special liquidity auction today. That auction was set up to flood the City with liquidity, if needed, by allowing banks to get ready cash off the BoE in return for handing over assets [here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an explainer] \u00c2\u00a3370m is the smallest take-up for any such auction since January 2015. Such a small take-up suggests that banks are not worried about panic gripping the financial world on Friday morning, when the referendum result is known. Alternatively, they may feel they have enough liquid assets to sell if needed. City traders need to set their alarm clocks extra early on Friday morning. Assuming they go to bed at all. Fixed income and derivatives platform Tradeweb has announced it will open for business from 4am on Friday morning, as referendum results will be coming in through the night. In a note released to clients late on Monday, reported by Reuters, Tradeweb says it will help traders execute electronic orders outside usual trading hours. Shares in London are recovering from their early losses, on the back of a decent set of financial results from Whitbread (which owns Costa Coffee and Premier Inn). Investors are also digesting the news that David Beckham has backed the Remain campaign (an interesting way of marking the looming 18th anniversary of his freekick against Columbia in the 1998 World Cup) Chris Beauchamp, Senior Market Analyst at IG, says investors are taking a breather after Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big gains. After a barnstorming day yesterday markets are, unsurprisingly, much quieter, although the lion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share of the stock market gains seen yesterday remain intact. Perhaps investors are exhibiting signs of fatigue with the ongoing Brexit debate, with fresh polls and the commitment of a certain Mr D Beckham to the Remain campaign providing little spark. However, sterling remains in demand against both the euro and the dollar, an indication that markets remain confident about the outcome. Away from Brexit, Whitbread has soared to the top of the FTSE, as a return to solid growth for Costa Coffee assuages fears that the hospitality firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth engine is sputtering. Those disappointing UK public finance figures mean Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actually borrowed \u00c2\u00a3200m more this year than in 2015-16. Ross Campbell, public sector director at accountancy group ICAEW, blames the EU referendum for creating uncertainty - and distracting chancellor George Osborne. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The impending EU referendum vote has contributed to an uncertainty that has resulted in a sluggish UK economy, therefore it was imperative that the Chancellor put public sector finances at the top of his priority list for May 2016. An increase of \u00c2\u00a30.2 billion in public sector net borrowing in the current financial year-to-date, when compared with the same period in 2015, illustrates that he has done quite the opposite and has taken his eye off the economic ball.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whatever the result on Friday morning, whether we remain in or leave the European Union, it is vital that Government devises a comprehensive and rigorous strategy to kick-start a faltering economic recovery. Back to the referendum....and chancellor George Osborne has seized on the latest warnings from economists: Here come the latest UK public finances..... ... and they show that Britain borrowed \u00c2\u00a39.14bn in May, to cover the gap between tax receipts and government spending. May is never a good month for the public finances, and this is actually the smallest deficit for a May since 2007 (which tells you something about how bad the situation has been since). But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than expected, and it pushes up the total national debt to \u00c2\u00a31.6069 trillion, or 83.7% of GDP. And in another blow, April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borrowing figures have also been revised higher, to \u00c2\u00a38.2bn from an initial forecast of \u00c2\u00a37.2bn. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too early to say whether the UK is on track for its deficit targets this financial year (which runs from April 2016 to March 2017): Newsflash from Germany: The German constitutional court has rejected attempts to block the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bond-buying rescue plan, the Outright Monetary Transactions scheme. That is important, because OMT is a key part of the rescue plan for the eurozone. It allows the ECB to buy unlimited quantities of eurozone government bonds, if they suffer a spike in borrowing costs. This would, in theory, avoid a repeat of the 2011-2012 eurozone debt crisis, when countries such as Greece, Portugal and Ireland were locked out of the markets. Although it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s never been used, OMT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very existence helped to calm the crisis in the eurozone (as speculators were reluctant to risk being crushed by the ECB). Campaigners had asked Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s constitutional court to block it, claiming it violated rules banning central banks from funding national governments. Back in 2014, the German judges referred the issue to the European Court of Justice, which approved OMT with some minor caveats. That decision has now been rubber-stamped, which will reassure the markets.. Some City experts are concerned that investors may be too complacent about Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum. Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, warns that the markets could be overreacting to a few polls putting Remain in the lead. Investors are rolling the dice on Britain choosing to remain part of the EU but there is still plenty of opportunity to get burned. The polls are close and there is still every chance of a Brexit, despite the swing towards the In camp over the last few days. Traders betting the farm on a sterling rally happening on Friday should remember just how wrong polls were at the last General Election and just how far the pound could drop if Britain votes out. While the polls are close, the odds paint a different picture. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve lengthened the odds of a Leave vote on our Brexit market, with a roughly 75% probability that Remain will triumph. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s far from over \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there is still huge uncertainty for the markets and the City over the coming days as support for the Leave is holding up and could rally further. Duncan Weldon, head of research at the Resolution Foundation, agrees: This chart underlines how strongly the markets reacted yesterday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with shares rallying around the globe. Bank of America has warned its customers that it could be tricky to trade on Friday. It fears that the huge interest in the EU referendum will make it harder to get accurate, fast quotes and execute orders as fast as usual. Other trading companies have given similar warnings recently, including City firm Charles Stanley. Investors are digesting two new opinion polls this morning, which give conflicting views on the referendum race. An ORB poll for the Telegraph puts remain back in front for the first time in almost a month on 53% to leave\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 46%, among those certain to vote. But a Times/YouGov poll sees leave retain a lead of two points over remain, 51% to 49%. Ana Thaker, market economist at PhillipCapital UK, reckons the pound could be lively today: The currency continues to reflect market sentiment ahead of the vote and as new polling information is released, we could see further volatility in the currency over today. Sterling has touched a new seven-week high this morning, extending yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery. The pound hit $1.4740 against the US dollar, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best level since the start of May. Yesterday it surged by around three cents, in its strongest rally in almost eight years. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is falling in early trading, as traders get another dose of Brexit jitters. The FTSE 100 index had shed 40 points in the first few minutes, a drop of 0.6%, to 6165 points. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a reason to panic - given the Footsie surged by 180-odd points on Monday. But it does show that investors are still anxious about Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in the light of these fresh warnings from Nouriel Roubini and George Soros. Mining companies are leading the fallers, showing concerns about global economic growth. UK housebuilders such as Berkeley, Barratt and Persimmon are also dropping back. They would probably suffer from Brexit, if it meant higher interest rates and fewer EU workers looking for property. Nouriel Roubini, one of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most famously pessimistic economists, has urged the UK not to quit the EU. Roubini won the nickname \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Dr Doom\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for his dark predictions in the run-up to the financial crisis, and was proved right when the 2007 credit crunch struck, leading to the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. And in a flurry of tweets, he predicted that Britain could plunge into recession if it decided to leave the EU - especially given its record trade deficit, and government borrowing needs. Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Faisal Islam reckons this gives Roubini extra credibility, compared to the more \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcestablishment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 voices such as the IMF and the OECD. Roubini is certainly not a dusty old economist. Back in 2013, he was ordered to remove a hot tub from the roof of his New York penthouse. Roubini told one reporter he would cram up to 10 young models into the tub, adding (immodestly) that: They love my beautiful mind. I am ugly, but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re attracted to the brains. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a rock star among geeks, wonks and nerds. Apparently the hot tub returned to action in 2015 - with Roubini hosting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153special meditation sessions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201d plus a dip in the tub \u00e2\u20ac\u201d during New York Fashion Week. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unclear whether last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit tweets were sent from the tub...... The warning comes hours after George Soros, the veteran financial speculator-turned-philanthropist, predicted that the pound would plunge if Britain voted for Brexit. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With two days to go, Britain is still locked in its referendum bubble. And investors around the globe are pressing their noses against the glass, wondering whether the UK will take the historic step to leave the European Union. Yesterday, shares and sterling both rallied strongly after polls suggested a swing towards the Remain campaign. But this morning, traders are more nervous. The pound has come under pressure overnight in Asia, and the London stock market is expected to dip a little when trading begins. CMC Markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Michael Hewson reckons it could be a choppy day: Financial markets appear to be taking the view that the race may well already be run, which given the twists and turns seen already in this campaign may well be extremely far sighted, or dangerously premature. With more polls due out later today we can expect to see further volatility unfold in the event of a move either way. As we look ahead to another choppy day European markets look set to pause for breath today, opening mixed after the FTSE100 enjoyed its best one day gain since August last year, surging over 3% yesterday. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot on the agenda today too to keep us occupied and maybe distract from the referendum battle, including appearances by two top central bankers. The German constitutional court is ruling on the legality of one of the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key measures to fight the financial crisis, its OMT (outright monetary transactions) programme. OMT allows the ECB to buy up bonds issued by eurozone countries who struggled to borrow in the markets. The ruling could come at 9am BST. At 9.30am, we get the latest UK public finances. Economists believe it will show that Britain borrowed around \u00c2\u00a37.5bn to balance the books in May. Then at 10am, the ZEW index of German investor confidence is released. It may show Brexit fears hitting the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy. At 2pm, ECB chief Mario Draghi will testify to the European Parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic and monetary affair committee, in Brussels. And at 3pm, Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen testifies to the Senate banking panel, in Washington DC. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main action through the day....",

It said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The surprise vote in the UK to quit the EU has seen sharp falls in world financial markets. These reactions are out of line with any likely impact on the UK economy from the vote; markets are instead pricing in a high risk of a broader financial crisis engulfing the rest of the EU. This risk looks exaggerated to us.</p> <p> Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp drops in global stock markets and periphery bonds are hard to square with the likely long-term impact on the UK \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at worst a few percent of GDP in the long run in an economy that is only 3.5% of world output. Initial market reactions were of similar magnitude to the immediate aftermath of the Lehman Brothers failure in 2008. </p> <p>It appears markets are pricing in a moderate risk that the UK vote is a systemic event that leads to a political chain reaction in the rest of the EU that collapses the single currency area and/or leads to debt restructuring in the Eurozone \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcperipherals\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a re-run of the 2011-12 crisis. </p> <p>The possibility of such a chain reaction has probably gained credence in recent weeks with polls suggesting discontent with the EU in countries such as the Netherlands and Italy. In Italy, as well as a large debt stock there is also the issue of high bad debts at banks as a systemic risk factor. </p> <p>We think these market concerns are overdone. We do not see a high chance of a systemic crisis in the EU involving other countries exiting the EU quickly or a sovereign debt restructuring \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially as the ECB has the capacity to step in to prevent a runaway rise in peripheral bond spreads, as it did in 2012. We also think the EU could take steps to avoid break-up spreading including by concessions to member states on the migration issue.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-576d532ee4b0f43038109b2a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-24T15:35:19.821Z\">4.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Is this good or bad news?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Eurovision/status/746309612173991936\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">British referendum outcome doesn&#39;t impact <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Eurovision\">@Eurovision</a> presence of the UK. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbceurovision\">@BBCEurovision</a>, be welcome next year! \u011f\u0178\u2021\u00ac\u011f\u0178\u2021\u00a7<a href=\"https://t.co/W3azrJzBNq\">https://t.co/W3azrJzBNq</a></p>&mdash; Eurovision (@Eurovision) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Eurovision/status/746309612173991936\">June 24, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-576d514ae4b0f43038109b23\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-24T15:28:38.355Z\">4.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>IMF managing director Christine Lagarde has made some more comments about the Brexit vote, calling for clarity over the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negotiations on the terms on which it will leave the European Union.</p> <p>Speaking at an IMF lecture with China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central banker, she said she hoped for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as smooth as transition as possible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, according to Reuters.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-576d4ba3e4b0be24d34f5f20\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-24T15:04:59.796Z\">4.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As European markets head into the close of trading, the FTSE 100 remains well off its worst levels although housebuilders, banks and airlines continue to nurse heavy losses.

A decent strand of buyers swept in when the UK index hit its earlier lows, helping to lift it back above 6200 despite a continued battering for its Barclays/RBS/Lloyds banking trio. The liquidity support promised by the Bank of England (and subsequently the ECB and Federal Reserve) appears to have been the main catalyst for the turnaround, especially given the fact that the afternoon was still littered with worrying news (namely the likelihood of a second independence referendum in Scotland).</p> <p>While the FTSE rose phoenix-like from the ashes of its earlier decline, the Eurozone indices weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite as lucky. The 5-6% drops by the DAX and CAC, while signalling a rebound from their respective morning nadirs, still are far worse than those seen in the UK and US (the Dow is down just over 2%), suggesting investors may not only be worried by the Brexit, but by the weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Spanish election.</p> <p>Even worse than the Eurozone was the pound. Sterling is still hovering around 31 year lows, at $1.37 against the dollar (dipping from $1.39 following Nicola Sturgeon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suggestion of a 2<sup>nd</sup> Scottish referendum) and $1.24 against the euro.

In terms of direct trade relationships, the U.K. accounts for only around 12.4% of Irish goods and 20% of Irish service exports, well below 50% levels observed when both countries joined the European Community in 1973.</p> <p>However, the sectors that serve the U.K. market are, on average, more labor intensive and any negative shocks could damage the mending Irish labor market. Other negative economic risks associated with a Brexit could include the weakening of the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial service sector, with which Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial service sector is closely linked, and the potential ripple effect stemming from lower demand from the rest of the EU.</p> <p>Furthermore, many aspects of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relationship with the EU, and therefore the U.K.-Irish relationship, would be unclear, increasing uncertainties related to trade and investment between the two countries.</p> <p>We do not believe the potential relocation of some U.K. businesses to Ireland would fully offset the overall negative impact of Brexit in the short to medium term.</p> <p>Nevertheless, we expect the Irish economy to stay resilient enough to withstand the negative impact of the Brexit. In our view, the pace of fiscal consolidation and reduction in general government debt may slow down somewhat, but the ratings will remain supported by Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong institutions, predictable policy making, and improving external balance sheet.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-576d3d7de4b030d83eb4a3da\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-24T14:06:44.102Z\">3.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The FTSE 100 is indeed now well off its worst levels, helped by the fact that a number of major companies have their earnings in dollars and should benefit from the plunge in the pound.</p> <p>The index is now off 1.9% at 6218 and is actually up 3.3% on the week, helped by the gains in the early part of the week when investors convinced themselves that the Remain side would win the referendum. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-576d3973e4b0be24d34f5ece\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-24T13:45:43.860Z\">2.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Could it happen.....?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PaulJKavanagh1/status/746337245070770177\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">FTSE 100 down just 2.5% from down 9%....and its about 25/1 to close up on the day.

Crude oil is priced in dollars, and once that figure is converted into today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lower sterling rate, the price must inevitably rise.</p> <p>Before the referendum, the crude price was $50 a barrel, and petrol was retailing at 112p a litre for unleaded. This morning the price of crude has moved little - it is up to $51, but the fall in sterling means that once translated into pounds, the price is likely to head towards 120p. It may make sense to fill up this morning. Note that fuel duty is 57.95p a litre for both petrol and diesel, and remains the biggest component of the price we pay. Motorists also pay 20% VAT on fuel.</p> <h2><strong>Mortgages</strong></h2> <p>All eyes will be on official Bank of England movements, with governor Mark Carney expected to speak after David Cameron sometime after 6am.</p> <p>A hike in interest rates to defend the pound will hit millions of households on tracker-style mortgages. For example, around 700,000 people are on Nationwide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2.5% standard variable rate. If base rate goes up by 0.5%, it will take the cost of a \u00c2\u00a3100,000 mortgage to \u00c2\u00a3474 from \u00c2\u00a3449.</p> <p>But it is just as possible that interest rates could fall to provide liquidity and restore order to markets. A cut to zero from 0.5% would see repayments fall to \u00c2\u00a3436 a month.</p> <p>Each half-point change in rates adds or subtracts around \u00c2\u00a325 a month to most people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s repayment mortgages. People with interest-only mortgages see steeper changes - around \u00c2\u00a342 extra a month for every 0.5% rate rise.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-576cbf22e4b0be24d34f5c39\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-24T05:07:36.947Z\">6.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The pound has slumped by over 6% against the euro, to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.22, in a wave of selling.

                "bodyText":"It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost 24 hours since it first became clear that David Cameron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum had not gone as the PM had planned. That realisation has triggered one of the most dramatic, volatile and downright scary trading sessions in the last decade. New estimates tonight say Brexit has wiped out over two trillion dollars of value, worldwide: So, as City traders hit the pillow (or in some cases the gin bottle), we should also wrap up. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very brisk summary of the state of play. The British pound has suffered its biggest one-day selloff in recent history, as the shock news the the UK is heading out of the European Union sparked panic in the markets. Sterling suffered a jaw-dropping plunge in the early hours of Friday in London, from $1.50 against the US dollar to just $1.33. It closed at $1.368, after a day to forget for many FX traders. The London stock market suffered steep losses at the open, but recovered to finish down 199 points or minus 3.1%. Bank stocks suffered badly, while some housebuilders shed a quarter of their value amid forecasts of a UK recession. The morning stopped being dramatic, and was upgraded to historic, at 8.15am London time when the prime minister resigned, And that left central bankers (once again) to pick up the pieces. The Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve have all promised to flood market with new liquidity, if needed, to prevent the Brexit shock turning into a new financial crisis. But that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough to stop France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC sliding by 8%, or Wall Street suffering its biggest one-day fall in 10 months. Asia had already tumbled while results from across the UK had flooded in, with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei index experiencing its biggest fall since the Fukushima disaster of 2011. And then Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fired a warning shot at Britain, cutting its rating outlook to negative due to the economic problems caused by Brexit. Britain also faces a political crisis tonight, of course, plus pressure from Europe to actually start the exit process.. Saturday is going to be another dramatic day in the UK. Ditto Sunday. And then the markets reopen on Monday morning.... So until then, a very good night! The record 8%-ish slump in the pound on Friday has raised fears that UK inflation could spike (as imports will cost more). That would be bad news for poorer citizens, says the IPPR thinktank tonight. Using Treasury modelling of currency shocks, IPPR finds that a 2.3 percent increase in CPI will increase costs for the poorest households by 3.3 per cent, compared to a 1.6 per cent increase for the richest 10 percent of families. This chart shows how those with less money suffer more from rising living costs: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 15 short (?!) hours since London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets opened, in a massive wave of selling that briefly wiped 550 points off the FTSE 100. Our Jill Treanor and Simon Goodley were watching events unfold in the City, while we stared open-mouthed at our Reuters terminals in the news room. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s their report on the action: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour of a truly wild day... On the dealing room of the financial trading firm IG, clients were calling in a state of near panic. One, who had a profitable position on Barclays shares when the market closed on Wednesday night, was now not only in the red but facing the indignity of being asked to deposit more cash into his account. Another told his dealer it was the end of the world. By 7am Chris Beauchamp, IG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief market analyst, was worrying about the effect on markets if the prime minister, David Cameron, did not hold on to his job until the afternoon. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sterling now will depend on the shape of the UK government at about 4pm and if Cameron is still there,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If he says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going it will be sold off again. The best thing he can do is hold the line here. We also have Spanish elections this weekend. To lose one government would be unfortunate. To lose two would be careless.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bild says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision is a Black day for Europe: Bild had made a last-ditch attempt to sway UK voters, promising to reserve sun loungers for Brits, and even recognise Geoff Hurst\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcon-the-line\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 goal at the 1966 World Cup. To no avail. (anyway, it was definitely a goal, the Russian linesman said so) Merci, guys, I think we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need it..... Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also warns that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade with the rest of the world is probably going to suffer. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another reason for downgrading the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outlook to negative tonight. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s says: Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expects a negative impact on the economy unless the UK government manages to negotiate a trade deal that largely replicates its current access to the Single Market. However, at the moment there is substantial uncertainty over the type of trade agreement that could be achieved. Breaking news: Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, the credit rating agency, has just lowered the outlook on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating to negative from stable. It says that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic growth will be weaker, following the EU referendum vote. It also warns the the public finances will be weaker than previously forecast, meaning it will be harder to cut the deficit. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s says that the Brexit vote will herald a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153prolonged period of uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the UK, with negative implications for growth in the medium terms. And it also warns that the effectiveness of economic policymaking could be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsomewhat diminished\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by the decision. A negative outlook means there is a greater danger of a country being downgraded. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s three years since Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cut Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AAA rating. It currently has the UK on AA+, the second highest rating. This morning Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, the only firm that Britain still on triple-A, warned that it is likely to downgrade Britain. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dominic Rushe and Sam Thielman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report on Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff: DING DING. The closing bell has rung on Wall Street, leaving shares deep in the red. The Dow Jones index has slumped by 608 points, or nearly 3.4%, at 17,402. Almost every share lost ground, with financial stocks worst hit. The S&amp;P 500, the broadest index of US stocks, tumbled by 76 points or 3.6% to 2,037 points. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its biggest one-day fall in 10 months, since global markets were hit by fears ove the Chinese economy in August 2015. The Nasdaq has been thumped hard too: A wild day in the markets is nearly over.... America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former top central banker, Alan Greenspan, suggests the City could lose its preeminent place in the world economy: Trading in the British pound hit unprecented levels today, according to the FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Gregory Meyer: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re biased, I guess... but this is a great front page. More to come tonight, of course.... The Institute for International Finance have sent some nice charts, showing the slump in world markets today.... ...and showing how the British pound (GBP) is the worst performing currency today. The IIf says: The unexpected Brexit win by a solid margin (51.9% to 48.1%) has cascaded across international financial markets. The GBP has taken an unprecedented one-day hit, taking it down to levels against the dollar last seen in the mid-1980s. Other risk assets, including the euro, EM currencies, global equities (although less for the US), and most commodities (except for gold) have also fallen sharply amid elevated volatility. Financial markets need to get used to a lot more volatility, following Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to leave the EU. Peter Kenny, senior market analyst for Wall Street firm Global Markets Advisory Group, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This bleeds through the EU narrative in terms of its unity and its popularity,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kenny said the unease in the markets would likely keep the Fed from raising rates in the short term, and in the long term the consequences would be far-reaching. Right now, Kenny said, the IMF and other international banks have to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153play defense\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as they tries to calm down markets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Kenny pointed to the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conference call last week in which it played down the chance of market downturns across multiple regions. But the fact is that those markets will be uneasy for a long time to come. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[That volatility] is something the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to have to transition from thinking of as a variable to something it thinks of as a constant.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd No surprise what our friends at the Financial Times have splashed on, for tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s edition: There are some anxious faces on Wall Street today, as shares are hit by the Brexit shock: The economic turmoil which the UK referendum could trigger could make it very hard for the US central bank to raise interest rates this year. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s John Praveen, chief investment strategist of Prudential International Investments: Wall Street foreign exchange analyst Marc Chandler believes the pound will keep sliding in the weeks ahead: Barack Obama, president of the United States, has declared that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcspecial relationship\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 will survive the EU referendum result. He also argued that the Brexit vote is part of a broader picture, of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcongoing changes and challenges\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 raised by globalisation. Reuters has the story: U.S. President Barack Obama said on Friday that he had spoken with British Prime Minister David Cameron about Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to leave the European Union and that he was confident the United Kingdom was committed to an orderly transition. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relationship with the EU will change, one thing that will not change is special relationship that exists between our two nations,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Obama said in a speech at a global entrepreneurs conference at Stanford University. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That will endure. The EU will remain one of our indispensable partners.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd During the referendum campaign, President Obama warned that Britain will be at the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcback of the queue\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for a US trade deal, if it quit Europe. Voters didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t heed that warning, so now we must wait to see how negotiations play out. The Paris-based OECD economic thinktank had warned, repeatedly, against voting for Brexit - predicting that families would be hit in the pocket. But now the deed is done, it wants to help Britain through the difficult times ahead: OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurr\u00c3\u00ada says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote on the United Kingdom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s membership of the European Union has major consequences for the UK itself, the EU and the international community. While it is on the public record that this was not the OECD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recommended course of action, the focus must now shift to dealing with the outcome of this democratic process. The OECD will spare no efforts in supporting the Government of the United Kingdom to make the transition as smooth as possible and advance the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic and social agenda. The OECD also wants to support the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153European project\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as it faces the biggest crisis in its history: We will also help the European Union and the international community best address the consequences of such a decision and chart the way forward. The OECD believes that openness, integration and diversity will make our economies and societies stronger and fairer. Thus, we will continue to support the European project while further reflecting on how to strengthen well-being and inclusiveness, both within our countries and globally.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Stock markets across the Americas are deep in the red, from New York to Sao Paulo. The Dow Jones hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t managed to rally, and is down almost 600 points, or 3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is deeper, down 4%, with only three stocks rising. And the Dow, and the S&amp;P 500, are now negative for 2016. Sterling is still being buffeted in late trading in America, trading at a seven-year low. The pound is currently bobbing around $1.368 against the US dollar, a loss of 12 cents or 8% today. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its weakest level since the 2008-09 financial crisis. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a small recovery on the $1.33 we ploughed early this morning, when markets were first reeling from the Brexit news. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest one-day fall ever, and the third biggest slump for any currency in the last 40 years (as we covered at 2pm BST). This graph, from Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Eric Burroughs, shows the unprecedented scale of the selloff. Important point: Although the Footrsie \u00e2\u20ac\u0153only\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd fell by 4%, that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recognise the 8% tumble in the value of the pound. One reason shares rallied from their lowest point is that US investors were able to snap up stakes in top UK firms at bargain prices, due to the rallying dollar. Shares in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housebuilders slumped by more than a quarter today, as investors anticipated that the UK economy could be dragged into recession. Taylor Wimpey, Persimmon, and Barratt - three big UK building firms - were the worst-performing major companies in London Banking stocks, which also track Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic prospects - and fears of another financial crisis - also suffered heavy losses. Here are the biggest fallers on the blue-chip FTSE 100 inded, which helped to drag ti down by 199 points or 3.15% today. Some shares rallied though. Gold miner Randgold, and silver maker Fresnillo, both rallied - matching the jump in precious metals prices. And companies who trade with international markets, such as smartphone chip maker ARM and pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca, also rose Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown:, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a roller coaster day on the markets, containing shock, fear and opportunism. The Footsie started the day in full retreat, but subsequently recovered as investors sniffed a chance to pick up some cheap stocks. A significant number of FTSE 100 stocks ended the day in positive territory, predominantly those companies with lots of overseas earnings, which stand to benefit from a weaker pound. In the wake of the Brexit vote, European Council president Donald Tusk has sent a letter to council members ahead of meetings next week. And it will make uncomfortable reading for UK prime minister David Cameron. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: I have no doubt that due to the negative outcome of the UK referendum we will mostly need to devote our European Council to a discussion on its political consequences. It is my intention to ensure that we have sufficient space to debate both with Prime Minister Cameron, and then separately with the 27 Heads of State or Government. And after discussing the agenda for the rest of the meeting, Tusk writes: We will then move to dinner, where Prime Minister Cameron will explain the situation in the UK after the referendum, followed by a first exchange of views. This will mark the end of our meeting on Tuesday. And the following day, no invitation for Cameron: On Wednesday the 27 Heads of State or Government will meet informally to discuss the political and practical implications of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBrexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. First of all, we will discuss the so called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdivorce process\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as described in Art. 50 of the Treaty. And secondly, we will start a discussion on the future of the European Union with 27 Member States. With the uncertain future following the UK vote to leave the European Union, and an 8% fall in sterling against the dollar, investors sold off shares, with banks, housebuilders and airlines hard hit, but gold and silver miners in demand. Markets came off some of their worst levels, however, as central banks from the Bank of England to the Fed queued up to reassure that they would provide any liquidity that was needed. And the FTSE 100 outperformed European peers, with exporters in particular helped by the fall in the pound. In fact the UK index, down 3.15% on the day, is actually up 1.95% on the week, benefitting from its earlier gains when it appeared the Remain camp would win the day. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 3.15% or 199.41 points at 6138.69, but off its low of 5788.74 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 6.82% to 9557.16 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 8.04% lower at 4106.73 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB, as previously mentioned, fell 12.48% to 15,723.81 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 12.35% at 7787.7 In Greece, the Athens market lost 13.42% to 534.78 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 508 points or 2.82%, its worst daily performance (so far) since January. Among the falls in European markets, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB has slumped by 12.48%, its biggest one day decline since its records began in 1998. Fears that EU members like Italy may hold their own vote was part of the reason, along with a hefty fall in banking shares on renewed concerns about their balance sheets if Brexit leads to another economic downturn. The Brexit vote is not a Lehmans moment, according to Oxford Economics. It said: The surprise vote in the UK to quit the EU has seen sharp falls in world financial markets. These reactions are out of line with any likely impact on the UK economy from the vote; markets are instead pricing in a high risk of a broader financial crisis engulfing the rest of the EU. This risk looks exaggerated to us. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp drops in global stock markets and periphery bonds are hard to square with the likely long-term impact on the UK \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at worst a few percent of GDP in the long run in an economy that is only 3.5% of world output. Initial market reactions were of similar magnitude to the immediate aftermath of the Lehman Brothers failure in 2008. It appears markets are pricing in a moderate risk that the UK vote is a systemic event that leads to a political chain reaction in the rest of the EU that collapses the single currency area and/or leads to debt restructuring in the Eurozone \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcperipherals\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a re-run of the 2011-12 crisis. The possibility of such a chain reaction has probably gained credence in recent weeks with polls suggesting discontent with the EU in countries such as the Netherlands and Italy. In Italy, as well as a large debt stock there is also the issue of high bad debts at banks as a systemic risk factor. We think these market concerns are overdone. We do not see a high chance of a systemic crisis in the EU involving other countries exiting the EU quickly or a sovereign debt restructuring \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially as the ECB has the capacity to step in to prevent a runaway rise in peripheral bond spreads, as it did in 2012. We also think the EU could take steps to avoid break-up spreading including by concessions to member states on the migration issue. Is this good or bad news? IMF managing director Christine Lagarde has made some more comments about the Brexit vote, calling for clarity over the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negotiations on the terms on which it will leave the European Union. Speaking at an IMF lecture with China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central banker, she said she hoped for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as smooth as transition as possible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, according to Reuters. As European markets head into the close of trading, the FTSE 100 remains well off its worst levels although housebuilders, banks and airlines continue to nurse heavy losses. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG,said: The FTSE 100 has staged a remarkable recovery; from an open of cataclysmic proportions, the index has rallied by over 300 points. Of course the damage to individual shares has been immense, but even in some of the most heavily beaten-down names a recovery has taken place. Investors are, in theory, supposed to relish the chance to buy up their favourite shares at knock-down prices, and they got such a chance today. Only time will tell if this has been a spectacular buying opportunity, or the first act in a new and volatile bear market. Other markets have been hit hard too, with the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major indices taking it particularly badly. If it comes down to it, many of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest firms will look compelling if sterling remains weak, while a falling dollar, thanks to yet another dramatic reassessment of the outlook for Fed policy, could boost commodity prices and provide another tailwind for UK stocks. However, we have likely not seen the end of the rush to safe havens, as the UK and its erstwhile EU partners begin their prep for a long period of negotiation. US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has now commented on the Brexit vote, and cites the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153special relationship\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd between the two countries. She said: We respect the choice the people of the United Kingdom have made. Our first task has to be to make sure that the economic uncertainty created by these events does not hurt working families here in America. We also have to make clear America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steadfast commitment to the special relationship with Britain and the transatlantic alliance with Europe. More from Dominic Rossi, global chief investment officer at Fidelity International. In a conference call, he said he was asked by a client this morning how Brexit compared with the ERM debacle of 1992. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is without doubt a far more important event in that Brexit signifies a structural break in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic and political models models, which we very much had in place since the second world war. It really does break the post-war settlement in many ways. The break in the political model is going to be more profound than the break in the economic model.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Scotland is likely to hold a referendum within two years and he saw a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153high prospect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that it will break from the UK after 300 years, while the Good Friday agreement in Northern Ireland is also at risk. Rossi predicted a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mild recession\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by Christmas\u00e2\u20ac\u201c not as bad as during the financial crisis of 2009 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but one that would last until 2017. He reckons UK growth will start slowing over the summer and that the economy will fall into recession \u00e2\u20ac\u201c defined as two or more consecutive quarters of contraction \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in the autumn. Turning to markets, Rossi think the $1.40 level against the dollar that sterling has held over 30 years could switch from being a floor to a ceiling. The pound dropped to $1.38 after the vote to leave. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sterling will work its way towards the low $1.30s in the near future over the next few weeks and months.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Against the euro, he thinks that sterling \u00e2\u20ac\u201c currently at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.24 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c will fall through \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.20. He explained that the FTSE 100 index could actually rally if sterling continues to fall towards $1.30, as many constituents are non-sterling companies which report their revenues mainly in dollars. [Something we are already seeing] \u00e2\u20ac\u0153European stocks are reflecting some economic impact from Brexit but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think eurozone will enter a recession \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the UK will have the privilege of that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexit was a black swan event and there is a potential flock of black swans flying over Europe with the political calendar,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said \u00e2\u20ac\u201c referring to upcoming elections in Spain on Sunday and Germany and France next year. Turning to UK interest rates, Rossi does not expect rate cuts any time soon. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t surprised that Mark Carney didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cut rates today. It is going to be very difficult for him to do so with sterling weak.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd [as this pushes up inflation] \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He will want to be confident that sterling has bottomed before he does so because there will be a one-time inflationary impact. That might not be until third or fourth quarter.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What is really important is that those Brexit forces don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t themselves fragment.. If that were all to splinter then I think the currency markets would take a very dim view. We really do need now political leadership. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I would not be surprised at all if the first thing that the new prime minister does is call a general election.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back with the US, and the Securities and Exchange Commission issued this statement after Wall Street opened: The U.S. equity markets opened normally for trading this morning. We are continuing to closely monitor the markets and have been in regular communication with financial institutions, exchanges, and market utilities, as well as our financial regulatory counterparts. The FTSE 100 is off its worst levels following the promise from central banks to provide liquidity when necessary, says Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex: There isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much to explain the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rather remarkable recovery. A decent strand of buyers swept in when the UK index hit its earlier lows, helping to lift it back above 6200 despite a continued battering for its Barclays/RBS/Lloyds banking trio. The liquidity support promised by the Bank of England (and subsequently the ECB and Federal Reserve) appears to have been the main catalyst for the turnaround, especially given the fact that the afternoon was still littered with worrying news (namely the likelihood of a second independence referendum in Scotland). While the FTSE rose phoenix-like from the ashes of its earlier decline, the Eurozone indices weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite as lucky. The 5-6% drops by the DAX and CAC, while signalling a rebound from their respective morning nadirs, still are far worse than those seen in the UK and US (the Dow is down just over 2%), suggesting investors may not only be worried by the Brexit, but by the weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Spanish election. Even worse than the Eurozone was the pound. Sterling is still hovering around 31 year lows, at $1.37 against the dollar (dipping from $1.39 following Nicola Sturgeon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suggestion of a 2nd Scottish referendum) and $1.24 against the euro. It is understandable that the pound has been the instrument that has struggled the most to reduce its losses, though it does have the prospect of a wave of central bank rank cuts to potentially look forward to. By mid afternoon, trading volumes for the FTSE 100 reached \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20.5bn, around twice the recent daily average, according to equity exchange Bats Europe. Its full statistics show: More reaction to the Brexit vote from across the Atlantic, this time from Treasury secretary Jacob Lew, and another statement designed to reassure: The people of the United Kingdom have spoken and we respect their decision. We will work closely with both London and Brussels and our international partners to ensure continued economic stability, security, and prosperity in Europe and beyond. We continue to monitor developments in financial markets. I have been in regular contact in recent weeks with my counterparts and financial market participants in the UK, EU and globally and we are continuing to consult closely. The UK and other policymakers have the tools necessary to support financial stability, which is key to economic growth. The vote for Brexit will not immediately affect the Republic of Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating, said ratings agency S&amp;P: S&amp;P Global Ratings said today that the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote to leave the European Union does not immediately affect the sovereign credit rating on the Republic of Ireland (A+/Stable/A-1). We believe that the effect of an exit of the U.K. from the European Union (Brexit) on the Irish economy would likely be negative, at least in the short to medium term, but of uncertain magnitude and mixed across sectors. In terms of direct trade relationships, the U.K. accounts for only around 12.4% of Irish goods and 20% of Irish service exports, well below 50% levels observed when both countries joined the European Community in 1973. However, the sectors that serve the U.K. market are, on average, more labor intensive and any negative shocks could damage the mending Irish labor market. Other negative economic risks associated with a Brexit could include the weakening of the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial service sector, with which Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial service sector is closely linked, and the potential ripple effect stemming from lower demand from the rest of the EU. Furthermore, many aspects of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relationship with the EU, and therefore the U.K.-Irish relationship, would be unclear, increasing uncertainties related to trade and investment between the two countries. We do not believe the potential relocation of some U.K. businesses to Ireland would fully offset the overall negative impact of Brexit in the short to medium term. Nevertheless, we expect the Irish economy to stay resilient enough to withstand the negative impact of the Brexit. In our view, the pace of fiscal consolidation and reduction in general government debt may slow down somewhat, but the ratings will remain supported by Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong institutions, predictable policy making, and improving external balance sheet. The FTSE 100 is indeed now well off its worst levels, helped by the fact that a number of major companies have their earnings in dollars and should benefit from the plunge in the pound. The index is now off 1.9% at 6218 and is actually up 3.3% on the week, helped by the gains in the early part of the week when investors convinced themselves that the Remain side would win the referendum. Could it happen.....? Wall Street is joining the global selloff, as the shockwaves from Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote reach the other side of the Atlantic. The Dow Jones industrial average has tumbled by 505 points in the first few minutes, a plunge of 2.8%. That looks like it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest intraday fall since January. That takes the Dow down to 17,503, in a wave of panicky selling as US traders digest the shock news from the UK. They have to absorb the fact that Britain has voted to leave the EU, the resignation of prime minister David Cameron, the slump in the pound to a 31-year low, and very deep losses across Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market. Not forgetting the promises of emergency liquidity, if needed, from the Bank of England, the ECB and the Federal Reserve. Tech stocks are being hit hard, sending the Nasdaq index down almost 4%: At least one currency dealer in the City has profited from the Leave vote. ACE-FX, which has branches in Canary Wharf and London Bridge has spent the day telling customers that it sold all its currency yesterday and has nothing left in its vaults. Only customers who pre-ordered currency were allowed to complete transactions.Lines of disappointed people, mainly tourists keen to buy cheaper pounds, were turned away. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US president Obama on Brexit: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full G7 statement referred to by George Osborne earlier: We, G7 Ministers and Governors, respect the intention expressed today by the people of the United Kingdom to exit from the European Union. We are monitoring market developments following the outcome of the referendum on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s membership of the EU. We affirm our assessment that the UK economy and financial sector remain resilient and are confident that the UK authorities are well-positioned to address the consequences of the referendum outcome. We recognize that excessive volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates can have adverse implications for economic and financial stability. G7 central banks have taken steps to ensure adequate liquidity and to support the functioning of markets. We stand ready to use the established liquidity instruments to that end. We will continue to consult closely on market movements and financial stability, and cooperate as appropriate. We remain united and continue to maintain our solidarity as G7. Private investors are seeing the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s falls as a buying opportunity according to investment manager Hargreaves Lansdown. Som 80% of the trades through its share dealing service this morning were purchases, compared to around 60% on an average day. Laith Khalaf, Hargreaves Lansdon senior analyst said: Private investors are clearly seeing today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market fall as a buying opportunity, and are out in force bargain-hunting. The most popular stocks are also those which have seen their prices hit hardest this morning, namely the banks and house builders. We know that private investors have been sitting on the sidelines until after the referendum, and early indications are there may be some buying activity now the market has dropped. The US Federal Reserve is the latest central bank after the Bank of England and European Central Bank to try and reassure it is ready to act. In a statement it said: The Federal Reserve is carefully monitoring developments in global financial markets, in cooperation with other central banks, following the results of the U.K. referendum on membership in the European Union. The Federal Reserve is prepared to provide dollar liquidity through its existing swap lines with central banks, as necessary, to address pressures in global funding markets, which could have adverse implications for the U.S. economy. It is not so long ago that the US central bank was expected to raise interest rates again after its hike in December. That is now unlikely to happen in the immediate future. Indeed, could there even be a cut? Morgan Stanley is denying that it is moving 2,000 staff out of the City, as the BBC is reporting. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The BBC story is totally false\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a Morgan Stanley spokesman said . The BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ben Thompson is reporting that US investment bank Morgan Stanley has begun the process of moving some staff out of the City, to Ireland and Germany. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking into it now. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s certainly plausible; last week, Morgan Stanley said it could relocate 1,000 workers out of the UK if the Leave campaign won yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum. Nice chart from the FT, showing how today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sterling plunge is the third-worst currency selloff in the last 40 years. It is only beaten by the shock decision to lift Switzerland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency peg 18 months ago, and the turmoil caused to Japan by the 1973 oil crisis. US markets are set to open soon and at the moment it looks bad. Dow Jones Industrial futures - an indication of which way the market will go - are down 2.64% or 468 points. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not as bad as the drops we saw during the financial crisis - which were often twice that or more - but there are other signs of worry. Oil is down, Brent crude is off 4.9% at $48.45, suggesting worries about a global slowdown. And gold - favourite investment of worried investors - is up 5.2% at $1,328. The chancellor has also pledged to do all he can to implement the public\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision. In practice, though, David Cameron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation casts a huge shadow over Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own career, after six years as Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance chief. Breaking: The head of the International Monetary Fund has urged Britain and Europe to co-operate, following last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seismic referendum result. Christine Lagarde, managing director of the IMF, also backed the decision by the central banks of Britain and the eurozone to promise massive liquidity injections, if needed (as covered this morning) She says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We take note of the decision by the people of the United Kingdom. We urge the authorities in the U.K. and Europe to work collaboratively to ensure a smooth transition to a new economic relationship between the U.K. and the EU, including by clarifying the procedures and broad objectives that will guide the process. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We strongly support commitments of the Bank of England and the ECB to supply liquidity to the banking system and curtail excess financial volatility. We will continue to monitor developments closely and stand ready to support our members as needed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd World finance ministers and central bank chiefs have been briefed on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to leave the European Union. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chancellor of the exchequer (at the time of writing, anyway) who says: UK holiday firm Thomas Cook has halted web sales of foreign currencies, after being swamped with demand for euros from anxious Brits. The company has also imposed a \u00c2\u00a31,000 limit on currency sales at its shops, due to unprecedented demand after a record-breaking fall for the pound overnight. A spokeswoman told Reuters that:. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have temporarily suspended our travel money website following unprecedented customer demand for foreign currency overnight and this morning. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The demand for the euro has been building and we have had to just restrict it for now. We have enough currency to fulfil our standing orders but we have had to restrict new orders.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Earlier this week, there were queues outside FX dealers in London as people tried to protect themselves against a sterling crash. They now look quite prescient, given the pound has slumped from $1.50 to $1.37 in the last 14 hours. Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has confirmed it is reviewing the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top-rated AAA credit rating, which means they are considering cutting it. The rating agency fears that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth performance, external funding, and the public balance sheet are all going to suffer. And it warns that it could easily cut the rating by at least one notch, due to the economic problems Brexit will cause. S&amp;P says: A vote to leave would, in our view, deter investment in the economy, decrease official demand for sterling reserves, and put the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial services sector at a competitive disadvantage compared with other global financial centres. As mentioned earlier, S&amp;P is the only one of the Big Three agencies to have kept a AAA rating on UK government debt. Stephanie Flanders, chief market strategist for Europe at JP Morgan Asset Management, said that while the vote to leave was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153seismic change for the UK\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it was unlikely to prove a threat to the world economy. She told a conference call this lunchtime that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think Brexit puts the global recovery at risk.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However there were wider political consequences, she said, pointing to elections in France and Germany next year and in Spain on Sunday. She singled out France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s far-right leader, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Marine Le Pen will feel strengthened by this.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This is true.... Flanders estimated that it would reduce UK economic growth by 1.5% between now and 2017, and there could even be a quarter of contraction by the end of the year. She said that while the government was likely to loosen fiscal policy in the short term to counter weaker economic growth, there could be more austerity in store in future years to balance the books. Turning to the housing market, she said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The assumption that this is not going to be good for the London property market as a whole is a safe bet.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Finance ministers and central bank chiefs from the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top advanced economies are have held a conference call to discuss Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to German finance ministry spokesman Martin J\u00c3\u00a4ger, who told reporters: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A teleconference of the G7 ministers and central bank governors is underway at this minute. At the end of this teleconference, there may be a statement.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain is almost certain to fall into recession, even if central banks act to prevent market mayhem. So argue Jan Straatman and Salman Ahmed of Lombard Odier Investment Managers, who write: Focusing on the Bank of England, the central bank is in a very tricky situation. The sharp macro imbalances facing the UK economy - the twin deficits - will continue to play out in the form of sustained pressure on sterling. Indeed, to protect the currency and the country from a balance of payment crisis, we think a sustained QE programme is unlikely to be the correct policy response. A recession is a near certainty and we expect inflation to rise sharply on the back of the weaker currency. They also predict further wild swings in the markets, following the prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation this morning which has left Boris Johnson as the front-runner to replace him. Sterling is at the centre of the storm, with a nearly 10% hit against the US dollar since Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close. Not surprisingly, traditional safe havens such as government bonds in advanced economies, the Japanese yen and gold are rallying as investors take flight to safety. In terms of pure politics, the turmoil for the UK and the European Union has just started. David Cameron announced his resignation but we expect the coming weeks and the upcoming Conservative leadership election to be tumultuous for markets and sterling. Over in Australia, people are discovering that they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exchange money into, or out of, British pounds. Commonwealth Bank, Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest bank, has told customers that sterling transfers aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t currently available, while it assesses the aftermath of the Brexit poll. And some National Bank of Australia customers are finding problems transferring money into sterling, or US dollars. European bank shares have been roundly routed this morning, as investors predict weaker growth and new economic uncertainty: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum has hit commodity prices, sending the oil price sliding and could also hurt efforts to rescue South Wales\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 steel industry. Brent crude, sourced from the North Sea, has tumbled by 5% today to $48.38 per barrel. That reflects fears that Brexit will weaken the global economy. Sebastien Marlier, senior commodities editor at the Economist Intelligence Unit, believes oil will continue to weaken: Uncertainty about the UK, EU and global economy will initially translate into weaker commodity prices. The recent upward trend in oil prices will reverse, with the price of crude falling quickly back below US$40/barrel on weaker sentiment. Most commodities will follow suit. Gold will be an outlier, however, and will continue its upward trend amid investor flight to safety. Significantly for the UK, there is also a risk that the coming period of volatility could undermine negotiations to save Tata\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Port Talbot steelworks. After the initial shock of Brexit wears off, fundamentals should gradually reassert their influence over the oil and commodities markets, with prices rising again as demand and supply come closer to balance. However, Brexit will lead to slightly slower European and global economic growth in the medium term. This will translate into a more gradual increase in oil demand and, in turn, the oil price. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new mayor is already taking steps to be closely involved in the Brexit talks: Over at City stockbroker Panmure Gordon, which also saw a return to 1980s-style vocal trading earlier today, the mood has calmed a tad. The most audible voice now belongs to a television presenter, rather than traders yelling buy and sell orders to each other (as during the dramatic market open at 8am) Now the reality of Brexit is sinking in, brokers here are finding that American clients see an investment opportunity and many of them have been buying London-listed shares. Their dollars go a bit further than they did. However, that is not to be confused with US investors thinking that the UK has made a sensible choice. Nick Hiley, head of sales at Panmure Gordon, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153UK investors often make the error of thinking our assets are priced in sterling. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not. [The rest of the world views them as being] priced in dollars. In dollars the market is off much more. The damage is considerable.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Right now, the FTSE 100 is down 300 points or 4.8%, a loss of \u00c2\u00a377bn. But the market is also worth 8% less than yesterday, due to the slump in the pound. The pound has dropped by two cents in the last few minutes, after Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, floated the prospect of a second independence referendum. Sturgeon is holding a press conference right now. She says that another referendum is now very likely, and that Scotland shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be taken out of the EU against its will. This has knocked the pound back to $1.367, from $1.39 at 11am BST. The US stock market is expected to fall by over 2.5% when New York traders gets their teeth into Brexit, in three hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. House prices are a popular conversation point at British dinner parties, school gates and cafes at the best of times. So this morning, many people are wondering what the EU referendum means for the property market. And the early verdict is that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to dampen demand, and push prices down. Jan Crosby, head of housing at KPMG UK, predicts at least six months of uncertainty -- and longer in London. He expects prices to take a 5% hit, but more in the capital. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As we enter a new phase of uncertainty following the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote to leave the EU, it is very likely people will put big decisions on hold, and one of the biggest decisions people ever make is a house purchase. This means we can expect short term transaction volumes to decrease and to stay deflated for some time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c perhaps until next spring. While we may not notice much of a change over summer, given the traditional hiatus in the housing market, the usual pick up in autumn may not materialise. Richard Donnell, insight director at property consultancy Hometrack, also expects demand for new houses to slide: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The immediate impact is likely to be a fall in housing turnover and a rapid deceleration in house price growth as buyers adopt a wait and see the short-term impact on financial markets and the economy at large. David Cameron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation means Britain is now gripped by a political crisis, as well as an economic one. Dominic Rossi, global CIO of Equities at Fidelity International, believes the political shock will be more serious. But he also believes Britain will fall back into recession, at a time of growing risk worldwide. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153From an economic point of view, we can expect lower growth in the UK and across Europe, and that is now being discounted in equity markets. We also expect a mild recession in the UK over the course of this year and into next year. However, what matters more is that political risk premia will now rise around the world and this implies lower valuations. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s result will set off a domino effect of political risk. Whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the US election later this year or the French election next year, investors are going to be far more cautious. Jonathan Hill, the British European Commissioner, could become an early casualty of the referendum. Hill is currently responsibly for financial stability, financial services and capital markets union. But not for much longer, if some MEPs get their way. The Brexit vote is already causing problems for some holidaymakers in Greece, according to this tweet from the island of Kos. Hot on the heels of the Bank of England, the European Central Bank has promised to provide extra liquidity to protect the financial world. In a brief statement, the ECB said it was closely monitoring financial markets and is in close contact with other central banks. It says: The ECB stands ready to provide additional liquidity, if needed, in euro and foreign currencies. The ECB has prepared for this contingency in close contact with the banks that it supervises and considers that the euro area banking system is resilient in terms of capital and liquidity. The ECB will continue to fulfil its responsibilities to ensure price stability and financial stability in the euro area. There were rumours last week that central banks could launch co-ordinated action to calm the markets after a Brexit victory. Central banks are expected to use \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcswap lines\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to share currency with each other so that, for example, a British bank isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t short of euros. Not every City boss is weeping about the referendum result. Howard Shore, executive chairman of stockbroking firm Shore Capital Group, argues that the British people made the right decision. We now have a fantastic opportunity to deregulate the economy and better compete on a global stage in the 21st century. Shore also argues that Europe shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t punish the UK for its decision: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The closeness of the result should encourage EU leaders to think pragmatically, arriving at a solution where Britain is out of the political union, but retains the ties that are of mutual benefit; and creates a two speed Europe for those wanting to stay out of the Eurozone and its inevitable move towards closer political union. As has been said many times, the Germans have no appetite to exclude us from the single market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c only yesterday its industry chief, Markus Kerber, noted the foolishness of imposing trade barriers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Despite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff the FTSE 100 is basically flat for the week (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently down 300 points, or 4.8%) Over at another City trading firm, XTB, there is scepticism that the optimism of many clients is going to end well. David Cheetham, the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market analyst, says that clients are trying to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pick a bottom\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - a City term for buying shares at their cheapest point. But he fears that the selloff will intensify. He tells Simon Goodley that: We are going to have a long period of uncertainty which is not conducive to strong financial markets. I feel we will retest lows\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The pound is the worst-performing asset today: Fitch Ratings, the Paris based agency, says that decision to leave the EU is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153credit negative for most sectors in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, due to weaker medium-term growth and investment prospects and uncertainty about future trade arrangements. Alex White, regional director for Europe at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said he was still digesting the implications of the vote, but had these initial thoughts: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty disastrous. You tend to get a little bit of an overreaction [in markets] and then a small correction but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not going back to anything like the status quo for a long time. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I expect you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbuyers remorse\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 very quickly. People will feel this. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see it in their pension statements.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd White added that the statements from the Prime Minister and from Mark Carney struck the right tone. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Both of them did a pretty good job. Cameron made the best of a bad situation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rating agency Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has issued a report on Brexit, warning that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic and financial performance will suffer from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a prolonged period of policy uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It warns that investment flows into Britain will be his by the heightened uncertainty; which means lower growth. That will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153credit negative for the UK sovereign and other UK debt issuers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s adds - in other words, the UK could be downgraded. IG has a trading desk that deals solely with European clients. Do they think the UK has gone mad? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Pretty much, yes,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd one trader tells me. IAG, the parent company of British Airways, has become the first FTSE 100 company to warn today that the EU referendum will hit its earnings. It has issued a short statement to the City, saying it no longer expects to hit its profit forecasts for 2016. International Consolidated Airlines Group, S.A. (IAG) believes that the vote to leave the European Union will not have a long term material impact on its business. In the short term, however, in the run up to the UK referendum during June, IAG experienced a weaker than expected trading environment. Following the outcome of the referendum, and given current market volatility, while IAG continues to expect a significant increase in operating profit this year, it no longer expects to generate an absolute operating profit increase similar to 2015. IAG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are now down 20%, making it one of the worst-performing members of the FTSE 100. Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement underlines that all the contingency plans that were drawn up ahead of the vote are having to be rolled out. The governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempt at reassurance, the soothing statements from the high street banks and the decisions by banks to try to do more voice trading rather than relying on computers are all part of that strategy. Lloyds Banking Group have also tried to sound reassuring, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are no changes in the products or services offered to customers, either in the UK or overseas. Customers can continue to use our banking and insurance services as they did before. Customer deposits in the UK continue to be protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme; and the Prudential Regulation Authority and Financial Conduct Authority remain our primary regulators. Malcolm Barr, economist at JP Morgan, has predicted Scotland would seek another independence referendum before the UK completes its EU exit, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely that Scotland will vote to leave.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Speaking to investors, Barr added that Northern Ireland was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153going to be troublesome to manage\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with Sinn Fein already talking about a referendum (although that is unlikely to happen). In the EU, the vote to leave \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is going to energise populist parties\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but JP Morgan does not anticipate referenda on EU membership elsewhere. European finance ministers are meeting today and there could be an emergency EU summer this weekend or early next week. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The initial signs are not particularly conciliatory... Out is out and there won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be any special favours for the UK.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Barr added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153An emergency budget is possible but certainly won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any of the character that Mr Osborne described.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd His colleague Allan Monks believes the Bank of England will cut interest rates by 50 basis points [to zero] by the August meeting, with a 25bps cut in July \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a distinct possibility\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He said the Bank would weigh up the potential inflation shock resulting from the sharp drop in sterling against the damage to economic growth. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There will be an inflation move up close to 3% by the end of next year on the basis of what sterling has done this morning, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enough to stop them from easing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Monks noted that the UK would retain access to the single market for the time being, but uncertainty will rise further, so \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we expect that to create further delays in firms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 investment and hiring decisions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He is predicting that UK growth will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153slow to a crawl\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in coming quarters, with growth likely to be 1% lower over the coming year, while Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate is likely to rise by half a percentage point to 5.5% next year. Paul Meggyesi, currency strategist at JP Morgan, said the pound had further to fall. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not convinced we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already seen the lows in sterling.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The sterling-dollar rate could go below $1.30 over the next week or so, he said. After 90 minutes of noisy drama, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s noticeably quieter now at Cantor Fitzgerald. The lull before the US market open? Bank shares, though, are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153still getting hammered\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all about waiting for the US investors to wake up.. Property firms are the biggest fallers, though, which suggests investors are expecting a housing downturn. We might never find out who saw them, but there is plenty of speculation in the City that hedge funds commissioned exit polls yesterday that got things even more wrong than the opinion polls and the betting markets. One trader says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sterling was so strong last night that it suggests that somebody had very strong data that the vote was going to be Remain. Some hedge fund has probably paid about half a million for it and the data was absolutely terrible.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Every cloud, and all that. While Carney was speaking, IG traders were yelling across desks to check if they can make trades. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I want to sell 22,000 [shares]\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd screams one. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yeah, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll trade that,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd replies a colleague. And some clients think today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff is a buying opportunity. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost all been buying,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says one trader. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Clients think things have been oversold. There is very little selling.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The stock market has now clawed back half of its losses, following Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to provide \u00c2\u00a3250bn of funds to calm the situation. The FTSE 100 is now down 274 points, or 4.3%, at 6065 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still a very large fall, that wipes out around \u00c2\u00a370bn. Mark Carney concluded his statement by underlining how the Bank of England is prepared to act. The governor said: A few months ago, the Bank judged that the risks around the referendum were the most significant, near-term domestic risks to financial stability. To mitigate them, the Bank of England has put in place extensive contingency plans.These begin with ensuring that the core of our financial system is well-capitalised, liquid and strong. This resilience is backed up by the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liquidity facilities in sterling and foreign currencies.All these resources will support orderly market functioning in the face of any short-term volatility. The Bank will continue to consult and cooperate with all relevant domestic and international authorities to ensure that the UK financial system can absorb any stresses and can concentrate on serving the real economy. And he finished by telling the public that the future is in their hands.... That economy will adjust to new trading relationships that will be put in place over time.It is these public and private decisions that will determine the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term economic prospects. The best contribution of the Bank of England to this process is to continue to pursue relentlessly our responsibilities for monetary and financial stability. These are unchanged. We have taken all the necessary steps to prepare for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s events.In the future we will not hesitate to take any additional measures required to meet our responsibilities as the United Kingdom moves forward. Bank of England governor Mark Carney is giving a statement now. He says there will inevitably be a period of uncertainty following the decision to leave the European Union. But there will be no immediate change to our relationship with the EU. It will take some times for the UK to establish new relationships with the rest of the world. So some market and economic volatility can be expected, but we are well prepared for this, says Carney. He says he has been in close contact with chancellor George Osborne through the night, and this morning. UK banks are more resilient than before the 2008 crisis, Carney says, and are forced to carry 10 times as much capital. The Bank of England will not hesitate to take additional measures as required to address any market volatility, says the governor And Carney says the BOE will make \u00c2\u00a3250bn of additional funds available through its normal market operations to stability markets, as needed. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pledge to pump huge liquidity into the banking system, if necessary, to prevent the wheels of the City grinding to a half. Striking a reassuring tone, Carney says the Bank will consider what additional measures may be needed over the next few weeks [so he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not announcing any emergency measures right now]. And governor Carney concludes by repeating that the BoE \u00e2\u20ac\u0153will not hesitate to take any further measures, as required.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And with that, he heads back into the Bank. European stock markets are deeply in the red: Massive amounts of shares are changing hands in the City. Almost 463.9m trades flowed through the London stock market in the first 30 minutes, the sort of volume you might see by after lunchtime on a normalish day. Predictions of massive losses across Europe are proving accurate. The French CAC is the worst casualty, tumbling by 8.5% in early trading in Paris. And Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX is close behind, down 8%. Prime minister David Cameron has announced that he will resign as prime minister, following the referendum. He expects a new leader to be in place before the Conservative Party conference, this autumn. Speaking outside Downing Street, Cameron says: He says he is very proud of what he has done as prime minister. He says he has always thought you have to confront big decisions, not duck them. He formed a coalition, delivered a referendum in Scotland and gave the public a referendum on Europe. He fought the referendum with head and heart. The referendum was not about him, he says. But the British people have decided to follow another path. So they need a new prime minister. Cameron says he will resign as prime minister. He will do what he can to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153steady the ship\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He says he is not announcing a timetable today, but a new prime minister should be in place by the start of the Conservative conference. He says he thinks the new prime minister should decide when to trigger the article 50 renegotiation process. So he will not trigger it himself. Our main EU referendum liveblog has full details and reaction: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Take another blood pressure pill,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says one Cantor Fitzgerald trader, as the volume of shares traded in London rises fast. Stocks are again going into auctions because of the rapid movements in the share prices. No one appears to have time to stop to listen to Cameron, whose voice can be heard across the dealing room. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Barclays down 28%!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd yells one IG trader. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s buzzing here. IG increased the margin clients had to deposit in their accounts in the weeks running up to the vote. Clients will therefore be able to fund losses of around 10% before being asked for more funds. That means if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re long of the FTSE you are (just) OK. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re long of the banks, credit card details please. Shares in Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland have both fallen by 25%. At Cantor Fitzgerald, there are shouts that David Cameron is rumoured to be about to resign and lots of calling out of share prices as they start to open. Trading floors are usually a lot quieter than most people think (more than 95% of trades here are online) but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s different today. IG traders shouting across the floor, like it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1986 or something. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Quite a hubbub for us,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdsays one. Very old school. As the market opens, traders are expecting huge volumes in most shares, but some sectors look more vulnerable than others. One trader says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Anything to do with buy to let property is a short\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This is the biggest plunge for the blue-chip Footsie index since the 2008 financial crisis. But shares are coming back a little bit -- the FTSE 100 is now \u00e2\u20ac\u0153only\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd down 400 points, or 6.4%. These are the top fallers on the FTSE 100 right now, as wild selling sweeps the City trading floors More than \u00c2\u00a3120bn has been wiped off the FTSE 100 at the start of trading. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an absolute rout! The FTSE 100 has shed 527 points, or over 8%, in a massive selloff.... Some shares have lost a third of their value. Housebuilders Taylor Wimpey and Persimmon have plunged by 40% And some shares have still not opened.... There are some big moves already. Supermarket chain Morrisons is down 9%, Royal Mail (floated a few years ago) are down almost 7%. Mining group BHP Billiton has lost 6%. But half the FTSE 100 hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually opened, as market makers struggle to match buy and sell orders. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets are open, and shares are tumbling. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to take several minutes before we know the full damage.... The mood on the Cantor Fitzgerald floor is that continental European stocks could get hit harder than those in the UK. Also echoing the feeling that the market was caught wrong way, expecting a Remain vote and for the pound not to weaken.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdGet your tin hats on,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says one trader, minutes before the market opens. The general view on the IG trading floor is that the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement says nothing (The Bank may take that as a compliment). Traders are looking forward to hearing what other central banks say - plus a view from the boss. As one puts it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What do [Mario] Draghi and [Angela] Merkel say?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The chief executive of Barclays, Jes Staley, has issued a statement on the referendum result: This is a significant decision and there will be many questions asked in the coming days and weeks about what happens next. The answers are complex but our position is not: we will not break our stride in delivering the Barclays of the future. We have stood in service of our customers and clients for over 325 years. We have been here for them through equally profound changes before. And no matter what has been laid before us, we have been here to help them achieve their ambitions. That does not change today. And through the uncertainty of the months ahead, be in no doubt that we are ready to do whatever it takes to uphold that promise. The strategy we announced on 1 March, 2016 was not conditional on the UK remaining in the EU. We are a transatlantic consumer, corporate and investment bank, anchored in the UK and the US. That remains the core of our strength and the Barclays of the future. Back at Cantor Fitzgerald in the City, traders are bracing for the selloff in half an hour: All eyes are on the German Dax, as well as the FTSE 100, with both being called down almost 10%. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sterling is steady at $1.36\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says one trader. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Who ever thought it would be $1.48 and $1.36 on the same day,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd his colleague observes, amid scores of screens showing the state of play in the markets. John McDonnell MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow chancellor, has commented on the market mayhem: People will be waking up this morning to turmoil in the markets and the pound crashing, and fearing the emergency budget the Chancellor threatened to hike their taxes and cut public services. The Government must now take steps to stabilise the economy, and to protect jobs, pensions and wages. Labour will not allow any instability to be paid for by the working people of this country? European stock markets could suffer even deeper falls than London, when trading begins in 40 minutes. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX is currently expected to plunge by around 1,000 points at the open, a fall of around 10%. Bank shares are likely to suffer dramatic losses. David Cameron is due to give a statement at 8am, just as the markets open (so that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be fun). Chris Beachamp, chief market analyst at IG, says the PM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next move is crucial. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sterling now will depend on the shape of the UK government at about 4pm and if Cameron is still there. If he says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going it will be sold off again. The best thing he can do is hold the line here. We also have Spanish elections this weekend. To lose one government would be unfortunate. To lose two would be careless.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd At the Canary Wharf dealing floor at Cantor Fitzgerald they are preparing for the stock market to open at 8am. One trader tells me he is expecting there to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extended auctions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when the stock market opens. (These occur when share prices move more than 5%). Newsflash: A statement from the Bank of England: The Bank of England is monitoring developments closely. It has undertaken extensive contingency planning and is working closely with HM Treasury, other domestic authorities and overseas central banks. The Bank of England will take all necessary steps to meet its responsibilities for monetary and financial stability. Listening to traders talking to clients, it becomes very clear what a shock the result is to many in the City. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just overheard a conversation with one IG client who had a profitable position on the shares of one major high street bank. Well, it was profitable when the market closed last night. The conversation now involved various scenarios of the shares crashing - plus talk of the client providing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more margin\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ie, put some more cash into your account sunshine. Tesco has suspended its currency service for holidaymakers amid the market turmoil. Visitors to its holiday money site are greeted with a screen saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are sorry... the online ordering service is currently not available.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Holidaymakers who queued outside exchange bureaux yesterday to buy their euros ahead of going abroad this summer will be counting their blessings (as explained earlier). If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just tuning in, you need to know that: The British pound has been absolutely hammered by the news that Britain has voted to leave the EU. Sterling has suffered its biggest ever drop, and is currently hovering around $1.36, down 8.5%. European stock markets are going to plunge in an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares is expected to fall by over 500 points, which would wipe around 8% off Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest companies. Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets have already slumped, with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei plunging by 8%. The London Stock Exchange has told Reuters that they plan to open at 8am, as usual. On Monday, chancellor George Osborne refused to rule out suspending trading if the Leave campaign won the referendum. Shares in two major banks, HSBC and Standard Chartered, have both tumbled by almost 10% in Hong Kong (where they are dual listed). That gives you an idea of what to expect in London at 8am.... Britain is likely to lose its final triple-A credit rating, following the referendum vote. S&amp;P, which is the only Big Three agency to maintain Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AAA rating, has indicated that a downgrade is now inevitable. Moritz Kraemer, chief ratings officer for S&amp;P, told the Financial Times that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We think that a AAA-rating is untenable under the circumstances.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Fitch both downgraded the UK in early 2013. The City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading floors will be a sea of red today, and a sea of discarded pizza boxes too: Gold, the traditional safe haven in times of market turmoil, has soared in value overnight. Bullion has jumped by 22% in sterling terms in a dramatic indication of worldwide panic over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU. At 10pm last night gold was trading at $1,256.50 an ounce, but it started to accelerate swiftly as early results from the referendum began to feed through. This morning it is trading at $1,336. 66, a jump of 6.3% in dollar terms, but much more in sterling terms once the fall in the pound is taken into account. Adrian Ash, head of research at BullionVault.com said the surge in the gold price was the fastest move against the pound in history. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The surging gold price clearly shows the panic sweeping financial markets. Gold jumped 22% against the Pound overnight, its fastest ever move, leaping to new 3-year highs above \u00c2\u00a31000 per ounce. This scene will be playing out across the City, and Canary Wharf, as analysts and investors ponder how to react to events. The referendum result is emblazoned on electronic screens in Canary Wharf, for the benefit of any traders who slept through the drama of the last few hours. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market rout is going to create money-making (and losing) opportunities. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People might see this as an opportunity. Maybe the FTSE will be seen as a buy to some. Others will say let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s go with the flow. Things tend to get worse, rather than better, at first. It is going to be a day of crazy volumes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also Gallows humour in the City. One client to IG trader: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Well, that proves Trump can win, doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As if we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have enough to worry about.... The Remain side warned during the campaign that Brexit could push Britain into recession. Piers Hillier, chief investment officer at Royal London Asset Management, believes this will now happen: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOn the back of this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s result we expect the UK will fall into a recession. Unfortunately I see unstable market conditions lasting for between three and five years whilst new trade agreements are drawn up.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIt is our view that the UK Government will be left with no choice but to stimulate the economy through fiscal and monetary means, flooding the system with liquidity if necessary.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 The City and markets are often viewed as if they are prophets who can make money out of predicting what is coming next, but it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look as though too many anticipated Brexit. One IG trader has just told me his clients were buying sterling right up to midnight. That changed when we got the news from Sunderland, before 1am. High street banks have been in touch with their regulator at the Bank of England through the night. One senior retail banker tells me: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Everybody is braced for a roller coaster day\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The BoE is expected to ensure that liquidity isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a problem.The banks have had a year to plan for the referendum, and have contingency plans in place. Holidays Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overnight collapse to little more than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.20 against the euro means it is now worth nearly 15% less than the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.42 rate enjoyed by holidaymakers last summer. In terms of spending, that means a family who last year got through \u00c2\u00a3500 while on holiday will this year need to find \u00c2\u00a375 more. As for freedom to travel, Britons will in all probability be able to enjoy visa-free travel to EU countries for the foreseeable future. Petrol Get ready for the cost of petrol to rise in the next few days. Crude oil is priced in dollars, and once that figure is converted into today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lower sterling rate, the price must inevitably rise. Before the referendum, the crude price was $50 a barrel, and petrol was retailing at 112p a litre for unleaded. This morning the price of crude has moved little - it is up to $51, but the fall in sterling means that once translated into pounds, the price is likely to head towards 120p. It may make sense to fill up this morning. Note that fuel duty is 57.95p a litre for both petrol and diesel, and remains the biggest component of the price we pay. Motorists also pay 20% VAT on fuel. Mortgages All eyes will be on official Bank of England movements, with governor Mark Carney expected to speak after David Cameron sometime after 6am. A hike in interest rates to defend the pound will hit millions of households on tracker-style mortgages. For example, around 700,000 people are on Nationwide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2.5% standard variable rate. If base rate goes up by 0.5%, it will take the cost of a \u00c2\u00a3100,000 mortgage to \u00c2\u00a3474 from \u00c2\u00a3449. But it is just as possible that interest rates could fall to provide liquidity and restore order to markets. A cut to zero from 0.5% would see repayments fall to \u00c2\u00a3436 a month. Each half-point change in rates adds or subtracts around \u00c2\u00a325 a month to most people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s repayment mortgages. People with interest-only mortgages see steeper changes - around \u00c2\u00a342 extra a month for every 0.5% rate rise. The pound has slumped by over 6% against the euro, to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.22, in a wave of selling. It was worth \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.30 yesterday. That means one euro is worth 81.5p, up from 76p on Thursday. Trevor Charsley at AFEX, a foreign exchange firm, says: What we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing now is the market reacting with complete shock and bewilderment as the results unfold. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest news story about the unfolding panic in world financial markets. Global bank HSBC has predicted that the pound will fall to $1.20 by the end of the year. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a real sense of shock on the IG trading floor this morning. A trader here tells me: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A lot of people are long equities [they have been betting on shares rising] which is fairly natural. There is going to be a lot of pain here.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd IG is calling the FTSE 100 to open down by around 7%. There has also been a flight to safety, with gold up 5%. Bitcoin is soaring too. And Boris Johnson is now even money on Betfair to be next PM. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is going to suffer a huge selloff when trading begins in two hours time. The futures market is indicating that the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares will plunge by over 554 points, or nearly 9%. That would wipe almost \u00c2\u00a3150bn off the Footsie, which contains many of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest companies - and major international firms too. European stock markets are also expected to suffer massive losses too, and Wall Street will surely follow suit when New York wakes up. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expecting to hear from Bank of England governor Mark Carney this morning, once prime minister David Cameron has responded to the referendum result. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, Taro Aso has said he is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very concerned about the world economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after Japan and other Asian markets suffered a day of turmoil in reaction to the Brexit vote. Aso declined to say if financial authorities would intervene in currency markets after the dollar and pound plummeted against the yen, and the Nikkei 225 benchmark index shed more than 7% by early afternoon local time. Trading in Nikkei futures was briefly halted as global equity markets plunged on rising fears that Britain would leave the EU. Asian stock markets have already been routed, as traders watched events unfold in Britain with mounting panic. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei has slumped by 7.6%, or around 1,200 points, in the biggest one-day rout since March 2011 (when the Fukushima earthquake struck). Other markets are also deep in the red. Nick Robinson, co-founder of World First, has seen a few currency moves in his time, And he reckons the slump in the pound is huge. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a major economic event and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the world has woken up to what the potential consequences might be\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He acknowledges no one really knows those consequences but points to the possible impact on Europe and global confidence. Separately I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m hearing that across the City there has been 30 times the average daily volume in dollar/sterling - and that is before London properly wakes up The sun is rising over the City and the dealing floor is filling up at World First, where dealers are scrutinising screens and trying to come to terms with Brexit. It is getting louder too. Sterling is at $1.3460 - \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the minds of one of the dealers here, despite the fact it has plummeted from $1.50 since the polls closed. It all about getting ready for clients who want to trade. There is also some humour: even the Zimbabwean dollar is up against the pound. Another trader remarks he wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t born the last time the pound - at 31 year lows - traded at these levels. A huge wave of selling has driven the pound down to its lowest level since 1985. Sterling has slumped by 15 cents, or more than 10%, to $1.33 against the US dollar. An astonishing slump. The crash began in the early hours of this morning, once referendum results showed that Leave were winning more votes than the City had expected. This is the biggest one-day plunge ever. It even dwarfs the sterling crash on Black Wednesday in 1992, when Britain left the ERM. Good morning. Financial markets around the globe are plunging after the British people rocked Europe by voting to leave the European Union. After a night of wild drama, the Out campaign appears to have secured a decisive victory in the EU referendum. With most areas declared, Leave have around 52% of the vote, sending Britain into political uncertainty and the EU into its biggest crisis ever. The pound has already plunged to a 30-year low. And London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is expected to tumble very, very sharply at 8am when trading begins. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the financial action, on what could be one of the most dramatic days in the City in decades.",

Lower immigration, and a fall in investment from overseas, will also hurt the economy, as could a weaker pound.</p> <p>Fitch adds that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future trade relationship with the EU is crucial:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Statements by UK and EU leaders will provide some guidance on the UK government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy objectives, the likelihood of achieving them and the timeframe for negotiation. However, Prime Minister David Cameron has indicated that negotiations with the EU will not begin in earnest until 4Q16, and the final position may well not be known for several years.</p> </blockquote> <p>And Fitch also fears that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit will be higher than previously expected, as weaker economic growth means lower tax revenues.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This implies that the general government debt ratio will continue rising over the forecast horizon, reaching 91% of GDP in 2017, compared with the debt ratio stabilising previously.</p> </blockquote> <p>And then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the political crisis raging in Westminster; Fitch says this is also bad for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit worthiness:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The outcome of the referendum has precipitated political upheaval, including the announced resignation of the Prime Minister, contributing to heightened uncertainty over government economic policies and diminished scope for policy implementation at the current conjuncture. </p> </blockquote> <p>And there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more.....</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Furthermore, the fact that a majority of voters in Scotland opted for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcRemain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 makes a second referendum on Scottish independence more probable in the short to medium term. The Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has indicated that a second referendum on Scottish independence is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153highly likely\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. A vote for independence would be negative for the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rating, as it would lead to a rise in the ratio of government debt/GDP, increase the size of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s external balance sheet and potentially generate uncertainty in the banking system, for example in the event of uncertainty over Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency arrangement.</p> </blockquote> <p>There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more here (if you can face it):</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FitchRatings/status/747521332078739457\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Fitch Downgrades the United Kingdom to &#39;AA&#39;; Outlook Negative <a href=\"https://t.co/mJBLc8agMj\">https://t.co/mJBLc8agMj</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/1B6J0hxhPs\">pic.twitter.com/1B6J0hxhPs</a></p>&mdash; Fitch Ratings (@FitchRatings) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FitchRatings/status/747521332078739457\">June 27, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5771876fe4b0be24d34f6805\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-27T20:08:09.280Z\">9.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FITCH DOWNGRADES UK</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating has just suffered a double blow, with the news that Fitch has also downgraded it to AA.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/dsmitheconomics/status/747521280832905217\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Now Fitch has downgraded the UK to AA too.

                "bodyText":"OK, time to wrap up for tonight. A quick reminder of the key points. Britain has lost its final gold-plated AAA rating, following Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to downgrade the country by two notches, to AA. S&amp;P warned that the Brexit vote will lead to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153less predictable, stable, and effective policy framework in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and hurt growth. Fitch, another major credit rating, has also downgraded Britain to AA tonight, from AA+. The moves came after another day of losses on the stock markets. The FTSE 100 index lost another 156 points, while medium-sized companies on the FTSE 250 fell by 6%. Banking shares suffered most, amid fears of a UK recession, with Royal Bank of Scotland plunging by 25% at one point. The pound hit a new 31-year low against the US dollar, despite chancellor George Osborne trying to calm the market panic over the EU referendum vote. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow with more live coverage of the market reaction to the ongoing Brexit crisis. Goodnight! Surely we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve suffered enough... Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Guardian front page focuses on the race to replace David Cameron as prime minister: Some more front pages to digest before the morning: The gloom gripping the City won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been helped by tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unmitigated shambles in the football: Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight sums it up: The credit rating of the UK economy may have been downgraded by 2 notches by Standard &amp; poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s this evening; the football team deserves to be cut to junk status. (PS: Well done Iceland) From New York, my colleague Sam Thielman reports on another bad day on Wall Street: US stock markets were rocked again on Monday by the aftershocks of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum decision to quit the European Union. Since the results became known on Thursday, the major US markets have suffered their biggest two-day fall in 10 months. Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dips came as the pound collapsed to its lowest point since 1985 and the UK lost its triple-A credit rating. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the day down 260 points, or 1.5%, the S&amp;P 500 dropped 1.8%, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq ended the day 2.5% down as the sell-off sparked by the Brexit vote in the UK continued to reverberate through the American market.... This is worth repeating... Fitch says it has downgraded Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating from AA+ to AA because the decision to leave the EU will have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a negative impact on the UK economy, public finances and political continuity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The rating agency warns that Britain faces an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153abrupt slowdown in short-term GDP growth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as businesses defer investment while tehy wonder how the Brexit vote will affect them. The agency says: Fitch has revised down its forecast for real GDP growth to 1.6% in 2016 (from 1.9%), 0.9% in 2017 and 0.9% in 2018 (both from 2.0% respectively), leaving the level of real GDP a cumulative 2.3% lower in 2018 than in its prior \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcRemain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 base case. Fitch also fears that medium-term growth will also likely be weaker, as Britain will find it harder to export to the EU. Lower immigration, and a fall in investment from overseas, will also hurt the economy, as could a weaker pound. Fitch adds that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future trade relationship with the EU is crucial: Statements by UK and EU leaders will provide some guidance on the UK government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy objectives, the likelihood of achieving them and the timeframe for negotiation. However, Prime Minister David Cameron has indicated that negotiations with the EU will not begin in earnest until 4Q16, and the final position may well not be known for several years. And Fitch also fears that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit will be higher than previously expected, as weaker economic growth means lower tax revenues. This implies that the general government debt ratio will continue rising over the forecast horizon, reaching 91% of GDP in 2017, compared with the debt ratio stabilising previously. And then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the political crisis raging in Westminster; Fitch says this is also bad for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit worthiness: The outcome of the referendum has precipitated political upheaval, including the announced resignation of the Prime Minister, contributing to heightened uncertainty over government economic policies and diminished scope for policy implementation at the current conjuncture. And there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more..... Furthermore, the fact that a majority of voters in Scotland opted for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcRemain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 makes a second referendum on Scottish independence more probable in the short to medium term. The Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has indicated that a second referendum on Scottish independence is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153highly likely\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. A vote for independence would be negative for the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rating, as it would lead to a rise in the ratio of government debt/GDP, increase the size of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s external balance sheet and potentially generate uncertainty in the banking system, for example in the event of uncertainty over Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency arrangement. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more here (if you can face it): Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating has just suffered a double blow, with the news that Fitch has also downgraded it to AA. More details to follow.... Take a deep breath, folks. Another day of market turmoil is over. Wall Street has closed, with the Dow Jones industrial average shedding 260 points, or 1.5%. Credit card firm American Express was the biggest faller on the Dow, down around 3.9%. Reuters reports that Wall Street has suffered its biggest two-day fall in 10 months, since the worries about China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowing economy. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit crisis is going to dominate tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s papers. The Financial Times\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 front page has just landed, focusing on the heavy losses on the stock markets and the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drop to a 31-year low. The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economics editor, Chris Giles, says S&amp;P\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downgrade is a cause for serious concern: Shares are still falling in New York, with 30 minutes trading today. Financial stocks are among the big fallers, as in Europe today. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a really dramatic day in the financial world; here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our updated news story: The scale of S&amp;P\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downgrade tonight is unprecedented, says Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Jamie McGeever, showing the full impact of Brexit. Back in 2012, the LabourList website gathered together George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s various warnings about the need to keep the AAA rating. For example, in 2009, he declared: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have argued it with my opponents in difficult economic times, when I warned them last autumn that the cupboard was bare and the discretionary borrowing had to stop \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and now Britain faces the humiliating possibility of losing its international credit rating. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full list: Some things George Osborne has said about the AAA credit rating All good clean fun. But in the chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defense, he did warn the public not to vote for Brexit.... S&amp;P held back the downgrade until the London stock market had closed, so the City hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t had chance to react yet. But over in New York, shares are falling deeper into the red on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average has now shed 306 points, a fall of 1.75% today, on top of the 611 points shed during Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tumble. Former Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown fears that Britain will eventually have to pay more to borrow, due to S&amp;P\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downgrade: A lower credit rating would only affect the cost of new debt, of course, not the existing borrowing. Britain lost her top-notch credit rating almost exactly 12 hours after chancellor George Osborne claimed that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy was in decent shape to face the uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote. Here are the key reasons why S&amp;P took this historic move: In the nationwide referendum on the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s membership of the European Union (EU), the majority of the electorate voted to leave the EU. In our opinion, this outcome is a seminal event, and will lead to a less predictable, stable, and effective policy framework in the U.K. We have reassessed our view of the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s institutional assessment and now no longer consider it a strength in our assessment of the rating The downgrade also reflects the risks of a marked deterioration of external financing conditions in light of the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extremely elevated level of gross external financing requirements The vote for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Scotland and Northern Ireland also creates wider constitutional issues for the country as a whole. Consequently, we are lowering our long-term sovereign credit ratings on the U.K. by two notches to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAAA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The negative outlook reflects the risk to economic prospects, fiscal and external performance, and the role of sterling as a reserve currency, as well as risks to the constitutional and economic integrity of the U.K. if there is another referendum on Scottish independence. Corporate governance expert Lucy Marcus points out that some UK companies could now face higher borrowing costs, following S&amp;P\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because a company can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a higher credit rating than its own country [because sovereign states, and their central banks, are the lenders of last resort, in times of crisis] S&amp;P\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two-notch downgrade comes hot on the heels of Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, which downgraded the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outlook to negative on Friday night. Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Luke Baker points out that the agencies are moving with unusual speed: Losing the Triple-A credit rating might not have any immediate impact on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to borrow. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because worried investors have been keen to buy UK government bonds since the Brexit crisis erupted, driving borrowing costs down to record lows. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a humiliating moment for the government, which put \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrepairing the public finances\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 at the heart of its strategy (not always successfully). Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Fitch both downgraded the UK in 2013. S&amp;P maintained the AAA through the eurozone debt crisis, but has now lost the faith. S&amp;P is also concerned that the future of the United Kingdom itself is at risk. It says that the majority votes to remain within the EU from Scotland and Northern Ireland create \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wider constitutional issues for the country as a whole.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd S&amp;P really hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t held back -- this is a TWO-NOTCH downgrade, from AAA to AA, completely bypassing the AA+ rating. NEWSFLASH: Britain has just lost its last triple-A credit rating. Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has downgraded the UK to AA, with a negative outlook, following the EU referendum decision. S&amp;P blames the Brexit vote, saying it has weakened the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153predictability, stability and effectiveness\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of policymaking in the UK. It also believes that growth will be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsignificantly lower\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 between 2016 and 2019, with growth averaging just 1.1% per year. S&amp;P says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In our opinion, this outcome is a seminal event, and will lead to a less predictable, stable, and effective policy framework in the U.K. We have reassessed our view of the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s institutional assessment and now no longer consider it a strength in our assessment of the rating.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd S&amp;P also warns that foreign firms are less likely to invest in the UK, while sterling could also lose its role as a global reserve currency. Reaction to follow...... George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is well-positioned to ride out the crisis has been roundly dismissed by a former chief economist of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. The FT has the details: John Llewellyn, founder of Llewellyn consulting and a former chief economist of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, said the UK was heading into recession at a time when its economy was not fixed and the BoE appeared to be the only functioning authority. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are more worried \u00e2\u20ac\u201d for the UK, though importantly not for the world \u00e2\u20ac\u201d than we were in 2008 or any other post-World War Two crisis,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The scale of all this will start to unfold in coming weeks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Llewellyn is also worried about Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctwin deficit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 problem (the annual borrowing requirement, and the gap between imports and exports). Click on this tweet for more.... The FTSE 250 index, made up of 250 UK firms not big enough for the Footsie 100, has been through a torrid two days: The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc250 is seen as a better gauge of the domestic UK economy. So this is Not Good.... Speaking of Hargreaves Lansdown..... Banks and house builders have suffered particularly badly from the post-referendum selloff. Financial services group Hargreaves Lansdown says: Around \u00c2\u00a340 billion has been wiped off the value of banking stocks in the last two days, with over \u00c2\u00a38 billion wiped off house builders, representing around 18% and 37% of their total market capitalisation respectively. The effect of calming words from UK chancellor George Osborne early on Monday morning did not last very long, with investors bailing out of shares once again in the wake of the shock vote for the UK to leave the European Union, and the subsequent political chaos at the top of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two main parties. The FTSE 100 has now lost nearly \u00c2\u00a3100bn in the two trading days since the result of the vote, falling another 2.55% on Monday, while the more domestically focused FTSE 250 slumped nearly 7% during the day and hit its lowest level since 2014. The 250 is down 14% in two trading days. The pound has also been pummelled, falling to new 31 year lows against the dollar and dropping more than 2.4% against the euro. Airline shares fell after a warning from easyJet, banks were sliding across Europe on worries about the effect on their balance sheets of the possible economic fallout from Brexit, with the European banking index down 7.6%, while UK housebuilders were also undermined by the vote. But with investors seeking havens, gold and silver were in demand, with precious metal miners Randgold Resources and Fresnillo leading the risers in the FTSE 100. Dollar earning UK-listed companies such as AstraZeneca and Diageo also bucked the falling trend. The yield on UK ten year gilts fell below 1% for the first time, another sign of investors seeking secure homes for their cash. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: The pound and UK stocks have taken a hammering for a second consecutive trading day today, as investor sentiment continues to wane on the largely unknown consequences of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit result. As the pound continues to suffer, investors are fast seeking havens, yet with the Swiss (who intervened on Friday) and Japanese (who likely will in July) central banks likely to devalue, the US dollar index has surged to a three month high. What we really need is some form of decisive action, as financial markets seek reassurance that things will be OK. What we look likely to get is two months of political infighting, followed by another 20 months of uncertainty as the new leader somehow attempts to secure a deal which appeals to the many facets of the leave campaign. This will all take time and in the meanwhile, investors and businesses are left to ponder what the potential impact will be of this monumental decision. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 156.49 points or 2.55% to 5982.20 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 3.02% to 9268.66 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 1.86% at 4030.28 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 3.94% to 15,103.58 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 1.83% lower at 7645.5 In Greece, the Athens market lost 2.89% to 519.33 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 273 points or 1.58%. Ryan Sweet, director of real-time economics at Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Analytics, has been talking about the effect of Brexit on the US economy, writes Dominic Rushe: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit has created a significant amount of uncertainty and has unsettled financial markets. The three major channels are financial markets, confidence and trade. Financial markets pose the most significant and immediate threat to the US economy. US equities are likely going to have a rough few days.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expects the Brexit news to shave 0.1 of a percentage point off US GDP growth over the course of the next year but it shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have an appreciable impact on jobs or the unemployment rate. Over the long-term Sweet said a Brexit shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be significant drag on the US economy. We knew Friday was a turbulent day in the markets, and here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some data from Hargreaves Lansdown to back it up. The investment group said visits to its website on Friday surged to 636,061, up 50% on the previous highest daily record. It said investors spent the equivalent of 17 and a half year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s normal activity on its website in one day. And the majority of the deal were buys (possibly not looking so good today but hey, long term). The FTSE 100 has finished 156.49 points or 2.55% lower at 5982.20. However this is only the lowest level since 16 June, given the market bounce ahead of the referendum when everyone believed the Remain camp would win the day. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a useful little guide to some possible Brexit effects, courtesy of Open Europe: Another stab at where markets and sterling may go from here, from Morgan Stanley. In a weekend note (ie before today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s falls) it said: Our foreign exchange strategists believe that the pound will ultimately fall to \u00c2\u00a21.25-1.30. Our equity strategists believe that European and UK stocks may need to correct a further 7-10% over the next several months. While these adjustments may seem harsh in light of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s moves, we think they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re consistent with the uncertainty this vote has created. \u00c2\u00a21.25-1.30 for the pound would only begin to make the currency look cheap on a trade-weighted basis. A further 7-10% fall in UK and European stocks would simply bring forward multiples down to the long-run average. Both seem reasonable in light of increased uncertainty. The FTSE 250 may be slumping faster than the top 100 index, but this is not the full picture. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: The FTSE250 has borne the brunt of the sell-off in the UK market, dropping below its February lows, due to its heavier exposure to the UK economy, having fallen over 2,000 points in the last two days. In order to give some perspective though over a five year time frame the picture does look somewhat different, with the FTSE100 only up 6% in that period, while the FTSE250 is still up over 30%, well above levels seen in back in 2011 when it was trading around the 10,500 level. Elsewhere the banks are under pressure, and not just in the UK where Royal Bank of Scotland is currently down 15% and Barclays 17% lower. Hewson again: Deutsche Bank has once again hit new record lows while Italian banks have also remained under pressure, with Unicredit, Monti Dei Paschi and Popolare all down heavily at new all-time lows, as concerns about the huge amount of non-performing loans prompt new concerns about their solvency. Reports that the Italian government is weighing up measures that could add up to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac40bn into Italian lenders haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been enough to support the share prices, probably down to the fact that these banks have non-performing loans in excess of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac300bn. Spanish banks have also slid back despite initially opening higher after the weekend election saw Mariano Rajoy once again fall short of an overall majority, though his party did increase the number of seats from the vote in December. Cameron says the clear vote for Brexit must be respected. The Bank of England and Treasury will not hesitate to take further measures to stabilise financial markets if required, he says. David Cameron, who announced his decision to quit as UK prime minister in the wake of the referendum vote, is making a statement in the Commons on the vote. Follow it in our politics live blog from here. Over in the US, the latest service sector survey has come in weaker than expected. The provisional Markit service sector PMI for June was steady at 51.3 compared to May, but lower than the 52 level expected by analysts. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the difference between the FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses and its losses in dollar terms: Despite the turbulence in the markets since the referendum result, the City fears there could be more to come until the current situation is resolved. Russell Clifton, managing director of sales trading at broker Panmure Gordon said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is a perfect storm of uncertainty. Speaking to dealing desks, most of them are skewed to the sell side.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Not only is there the Brexit fallout, leaving the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two major parties in the midst of a leadership crisis, there is also the US election looming later in the year and the advent of summer, when trading volumes are thinner and market movements potentially more volatile as a result. Clifton also pointed out that since the financial crisis, banks propriety desks - big players in the market - have been far more cautious, with the result that buyers are fewer and liquidity in the market is less than it was. So far the FTSE 100 - down 2.3% at the moment after Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening fall - is outperforming the mid-cap FTSE 250 which has dropped 6.6%. The leading index is receiving some support from dollar earners and the fact it is a more global based index, whereas the FTSE 250 is predominantly domestic UK companies. Meanwhile Panmure Gordon chief economist Simon French suggested: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you want a clue where the market may go, in 2008 [financial crisis] there were six or seven days with more than 7% movements in dollar terms.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Alternatively sterling, which has been pummelled along with stock markets, could benefit from recovering its position as a currency haven. Despite talk of UK interest rate cuts adding to the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide, French does not believe Mark Carney will cut borrowing costs further: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see the advantage in a rate cut since it will put more downward pressure on the pound.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Another Brexit profit warning, this time from recruitment group InterQuest. It said: In light of the uncertainty in the run up to the EU referendum, the company has experienced variable trading with clients delaying hiring decisions. The result of the referendum is now expected to prolong this period of uncertainty and, whilst it is too early to predict the longer term impact, the company expects trading conditions in the wider recruitment sector to remain challenging for at least the remainder of the current financial year. The company is somewhat protected from wider recruitment trends due to its focus on hard to find niche candidates in rapidly growing sectors in the new digital economy, but as a result of the wider market conditions, the company now expects that group net fee income and EBIT for the current financial year will be materially below market expectations. Its shares have slumped 28% to 78p. Time for a quick recap. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial markets are being buffeted by fresh fears following Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to vote to leave the EU last Thursday. The pound has been driven down to a new 31-year low, hitting $1.3152 against the US dollar for the first time since 1985. The selloff was relentless, despite finance minister George Osborne telling the media at 7am London time that the UK economy could ride out the current storm. The London stock market has also been driven down by worries about the UK economy, and the relentless political infighting at Westminster. The FTSE 100 is currently down 119 points at 6019, which means it has lost over \u00c2\u00a380bn since the start of trading on Friday. The FTSE 250 index, which contains smaller companies, has shed 6% as investors raced to ditch stocks again. Bank shares are being hit very hard, with one fund manager saying there is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccapitulation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the financial sector. Royal Bank of Scotland fell 25% at one stage, meaning taxpayers had lost \u00c2\u00a38m on their stake. Barclays is down 15%. Some smaller banks, such as Virgin Money, have lost a quarter of their value today. Housebuilders and estate agents have been hit hard, too, after Foxtons issued a profit warning. Some building firms have lost 40% of their value since the referendum. While shares slumped, the prices of safe-haven government debt have hit record highs. That has driven down the interest rate on UK 10-year gilts to below 1% for the first time ever. City economists are gloomy today, with some forecasting a UK recession due to the uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote. Policymakers are scrambling to react to the unfolding drama in the markets. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has pulled out of a conference in Portugal, a move swiftly copied by US central bank chief Janet Yellen. Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s predecessor, Lord Mervyn King, has heavily criticised the UK government for its tactics during the referendum. He told the BBC that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you say to someone \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcyou\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re an idiot if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree with me\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not likely to bring them in your direction, Chancellor George Osborne has ditched one of his pre-referendum threats, to hold an emergency punishment budget. Osborne tried to sound reassuring this morning, saying: I said we had to fix the roof so that we were prepared for whatever the future held. Thank goodness we did. As a result, our economy is about as strong as it could be to confront the challenge our country now faces.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, the markets don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem terribly calm today.... The Dow is still falling.... Over in New York, the US stock market is falling at the start of trading. The Dow Jones index dropped by 148 points, or 0.85%, at the open, with Brexit still on everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mind. That follows big losses on Friday, when the Dow shed almost 600 points: Readers may have spent the weekend glued to the political crisis in Westminster, watching Euro 2016, or braving bouts of bad weather (we had hailstones in Oxford) to go shopping or tend the garden. But City economists didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have time for fun. They were locked away, slashing their UK growth forecasts, following the Brexit vote. Emily Cadman of the FT has helpfully rounded up the details: Phillip Shaw, chief UK economist at Investec, said he believed the economy would enter \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a period of near stagnation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding that a recession was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153realistic possibility\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Citi, which has yet to formally change its forecasts, warned that downgrades were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153likely\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Goldman Sachs is now expecting annual growth of just 0.2 per cent in 2017, down from 2 per cent before the referendum. George Buckley, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank, said he expected Brexit to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153focus minds\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate setting committee on the long-term impact of slower growth \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and a possible recession \u00e2\u20ac\u201d rather than a short-term rise in inflation. More here: City economists slash UK growth forecasts Larry Hatheway, chief economist at Swiss fund manager GAM, says investors are worrying that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy could soon start shrinking. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Against the backdrop of an already slowing UK economy, Brexit anxiety could precipitate a large enough reduction in consumer and business spending to tip the UK economy into recession.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to vote to Leave the European Union has forced investors to tear up some long-held beliefs. That includes the idea that major advanced European economies are safer than developing markets. Julian Mayo, Co-CIO of Charlemagne Capital, a fund manager, says the investors can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153with a straight face that emerging market assets are riskier. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The historical position that political risk is significantly higher in emerging markets (EM) than developed markets (DM) is comprehensively and possibly irreversibly blown out of the water, with implications for the relative pricing of assets. Even if we manage a reasonable renegotiation with angry Europeans, the vote gives massive encouragement for disaffected groups both in the EU and beyond, including separatist movements. Whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sturgeon, Le Pen, divisions in Spain and Italy, renewed stress within the Eurozone or the increasing possibility of a Trump win, pricing of risk across DM should surely rise. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Treasury secretary Jack Lew has urged investors to remain calm following the Brexit vote. In a CNBC interview, Lew said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there is an orderliness in the market reaction\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum. He argued that banks are in a better position to handle the fallout than in 2008 (when many had to be bailed out), but warned that there will be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153long period of change\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd now, as new headwinds hit the global economy. Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is suffering a major selloff today. The Dublin bourse has shed 7.7% today, making it the worst-performing eurozone market. Mervyn King, who steered the Bank of England through the last financial crisis, has criticised the government for trying to scare the public during the election campaign. He was speaking to the BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Laura Kuenssberg: The FTSE 100 index has now shed 130 points today, on top of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 199 point losses. That means the index has lost \u00c2\u00a385bn since the referendum result, in a blow to small investors and pension funds. Investors are hammering the pound and the stock market because they have no real idea what the next plot twist in the astounding Brexit drama might be. Joshua Mahoney of spread-betting firm IG explains: For all of the statements of intent on both sides pre-referendum, it seems that much of it holds little basis in reality. First Farage admitted that the \u00c2\u00a3350 million weekly NHS funding claim was a mistake and now Osborne has stepped back from his pledge to impose an immediate emergency budget. The name of the game now is stability and for that reason Osborne is crucial despite his previous support for the remain camp. Amid all the calls for Corbyn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head and the clamour for the new PM role, financial markets are trying to ascertain what this will truly mean for the UK, the European Union and global stability. Many traders have concluded that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing industry is heading into a downturn, sending shares in builders and estate agents slumping (not helped by Foxton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit warning today) Ouch. The pound just hit $1.316, a new post-1985 low. Chris Saint, senior currency analyst at Hargeaves Lansdown, has warned that the pound could suffer large losses in the weeks ahead: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sea of red for sterling again this morning as investor sentiment continues to sour after the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote to leave the EU. The pound has slipped below \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.20 against the euro this morning for the first time in more than two years. It has also fallen to fresh lows under $1.32 against the US dollar \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the lowest level since 1985. Exchange rates will inevitably remain very volatile in the coming days and weeks as currency markets digest the far-reaching implications of the referendum result. Further significant losses for sterling aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t out of the question, especially if incoming data confirms the UK economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowdown and lifts the likelihood of further Bank of England stimulus to support growth. This tweet from the FT shows how smaller UK companies have been hit extra-hard by Brexit. The purple line shows the FTSE 250 index, which has dropped more sharply than the FTSE 100 (which includes multinational companies who will benefit from the weak pound). Shares are hitting fresh lows after another wild morning in the markets. The FTSE 100 index of major blue-chip companies is now down 100 points, a loss of 1.6%. That follows a 199-point tumble on Friday. Easyjet has lost a fifth of its value, followed by Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays (both down over 15%), and building firms such as Taylor Wimpey, Persimmon and Barratt. And there are bigger losses among smaller UK companies. The FTSE 250 index, of medium-sized firms, has slid by 5% today. Small \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcchallenger\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 banks are being absolutely hammered, due to fears that the UK could be dragged into recession. Shawbrook, Onesavings and Virgin Money are all down over 20%. Royal Bank of Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are worth watching closely amid all the market turmoil, as the taxpayer still holds a big stake. Our City editor, Jill Treanor, explains: At their current level of 170p, the share are back at levels they last traded at during February 2009, when the banking crisis was in full swing. The break even price for the taxpayer is 502p, and the only stake sold by the government in August 2015 was at 330p. With any hopes of a further sell off of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stakes off the cards, analyst at Deutsche Bank said RBS was the most afffected by Brexit of all the big UK banks. The analysts point out that the sale of the 300-odd branches to be branded Williams &amp; Glyn - demanded by the EU at the time of the bailout - will be further delayed. And regulators are unlikely to sanction any distribution to shareholders. Bloomberg are reporting that Janet Yellen, head of the US Federal Reserve, is no longer appearing at a conference in Portugal this week. Yellen had been due to appear at the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sintra forum, alongside Mark Carney, Bank of England governor. Carney pulled out over the weekend, to focus on events in London. It may not be the biggest issue to come out of a Brexit, but some in the market are pondering how Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote will affect Sports Direct, the embattled sports goods retailer that operates a controversial warehouse in Derbyshire that is largely staffed by immigrant labour from eastern Europe. The most pressing issue for the company, seems to be the price of sterling, so today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help. The group issued a statement on Friday stating that the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153likely to impact purchases for which the company is currently not hedged for the FY17 period and beyond\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In plain English, that means it buys much of its stock from Asia and that is now going to cost it a lot more. This morning, the investment bank Goldman Sachs has downgraded the retailer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares to a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sell\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, reasoning: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We expect the combination of a demanding European apparel demand environment (notably in the UK post the EU referendum), gross margin pressure (currency driven) and elevated opex growth due to a one-off wage bill increase to drive a lower EPS base in FY17 and FY18 (FY16- 18E EPS 36.05p/30.78p/32.45p), despite the European football event this summer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. So that means investors being told to sell the sports chain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares by Goldman Sachs, which is an adviser to, er, Sports Direct. Brits should brace for higher inflation, unless the pound gets its breath back and recovers. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tumble in the pound, and the plunge in UK borrowing costs, indicate that investors expect interest rates to be cut to record lows. City analyst Louise Cooper says: The move in sterling cannot be purely viewed as a negative dire message - \u00e2\u20ac\u0153loss of faith in UK blah blah\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but also a realisation that interest rates will be cut by the Bank of England. Rate cuts tend to drive currencies lower. It is particularly dramatic as at the end of last year, Sterling was pricing in a rate increase. The pound has hit a two-year low against the euro, at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.2017. BOOM! The pound just hit a new 31-year low against the US dollar, as Brexit fears continue to grip the financial markets. Sterling slumped over 4 cents to $1.3220, a level last seen in 1985, beating last Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s low. George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to calm the markets are not preventing investors from piling out the pound. Investors are nervous because they have no idea when the UK might formally begin the process of exiting the European Union. Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, explains: The Prime Minister has stated that he intends to leave the task of triggering Article 50 to his successor and we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect him to go back on that at the European Council summit this week. That leaves sterling with no more visible means of support than it had on Friday. Historic times..... RBS and Barclays weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only major companies to be BRIEFLY suspended this morning: Important point. There are reports that trading in shares in Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland have been suspended due to the market panic. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not strictly correct. Both shares were temporary suspended, after triggering automatic pauses due to high volatility. But right now, RBS and Barclays shares are still changing hands -- down 14% and 10% respectively. The pound is continuing to lose ground..... After two hours of trading, the FTSE 100 index is down 71 points, or 1.1%, at 6067 points. Although that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chunky fall, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still higher than during the wild selloff on Friday morning. If trading ended now, it would be a one-week low. Sterling is weakening.... now down 3.5 cents, or 2.5%, at $1.3331 this morning. European banking shares are being pummelled hard by Brexit worries. The overall European banks index has shed 5.7% this morning, with Royal Bank of Scotland plunging by 15% and Barclays down 10%. Laura Foll, fund manager at Hendersons Global Investors, told Sky News that: There are a huge variety of worries, which is why we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing a bit of capitulation in financials. If the economy slows, interest rates will come down, which means further pressure on bank profit margins, she explains. And if the economy enters recession, banks could start to take losses on their loans. Signs of angst in the markets... The Osborn relief may be fading fast.... the FTSE 100 index is now down 80 points at 6060, its lowest point of the day. In another historic development, the interest rate on UK 10-year bonds has fallen to just 1%, for the first time ever. That means that worried investors are piling into \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsafe haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 government debt, in case the Brexit crisis worsens further. [The interest rate, or yield, on government bonds fall when prices rise] Cheap borrowing costs are usually a good thing; in this case, though, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign of how anxious the financial market are. My colleague Katie Allen says that the chancellor covered the right ground this morning, by insisting that the UK economy could survive the Brexit storm. However, the relief may not last for long.... In a classic British understatement, the chancellor opined: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It will not be plain sailing in the days ahead.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He also rowed back on the emergency budget he had threatened in the event of a leave vote. Now Osborne is saying the Treasury response to Brexit will not come until the autumn when the fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, has had a chance to assess the economy and a new prime minister is in place. In short, Osborne ticked a lot of boxes. So far the pound has steadied and theFTSE 100 is not down as sharply as it might have been. But the UK is facing a political crisis and an unprecedented process of untangling from the EU. The chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s soothing words are unlikely to provide anything but a short-term tonic to nervous households, businesses and investors. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to reassure the financial world today: It begins... George Osborne has sought to reassure financial markets by insisting Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is in a strong position to adjust to life outside the European Union. Breaking his silence in a statement at the Treasury, the chancellor said he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153did not resile\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from the dire predictions made during the referendum campaign that Brexit could plunge Britain into recession and cost hundreds of thousands of jobs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is inevitable, after Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote, that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is going to have to adjust to the new situation we find ourselves in,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. But in a phrase reminiscent of Gordon Brown\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s language in the early days of the 2008 crisis, he repeatedly insisted that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fundamentals\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the British economy were strong. Click here for more Sterling is also losing ground against the euro this morning, in another blow to UK holidaymakers. The pound has dropped 1.2%, or one and a half eurocents, to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.212. Back on referendum day, it was worth \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.30. City firms are scrambling to slash their forecasts for the pound, following the referendum result. Goldman Sachs now expects sterling to still be around $1.32 in three month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time, not $1.47 as previously expected. Bank of America Merrill Lynch now expects the pound to be worth just $1.30 at the end of 2016, compared to $1.59 before. Ana Thaker, market economist at PhillipCapital UK, thinks the chancellor has helped to stop a sterling rout - for the moment, anyway. She writes: Notably, the currency remained steady following George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech this morning that reassured markets that the Treasury had engaged with global central banks and financial institutions to arrange contingency plans. Moves in Sterling remains subject to any guidance from the government as to what the next stages may be with strong downside risk. Big fallers on the FTSE 250 this morning include many significant UK companies, such as challenger bank Virgin Money (-9%), recruitment firm Hays (-9%), engineering firm Balfour Beatty (-8%), online supermarket group Ocado (-7.9%) and building group Redrow (-7.7%). Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ed Conway agrees that the markets are calmed than feared. However, the FTSE 250 index \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which contains smaller UK firms \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is down 2% this morning. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a video clip of George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech, for those who missed it 90 minutes ago George Osborne has managed to reassure the City by joining those arguing for a delay before starting the formal process of leaving the EU. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explains: It seems that George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appearance this morning, his first since before the referendum results were announced, has somewhat calmed investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 fears, the Chancellor joining many of his Tory colleagues in claiming there is no rush to trigger the dreaded Article 50 despite increasing pressure from Europe. European stock markets are also calmer this morning, after George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appearance: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s never nice to see a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price tumble. But some people might make an exception for Foxtons, the notoriously aggressive London estate agent. Its shares have plunged by 20% this morning, after warning that Brexit uncertainty will hurt its profits. Foxtons floated on the stock market at 230p per share. They are now worth just 109p. Budget airline easyJet is leading the fallers on the stock market this morning, down 8% after its profit warning. But mining companies are rallying, along with UK companies who earn most of their money abroad (such as consumer goods group Unilever and pharmaceuticals firm Shire). Here are the main risers and fallers: The pound has recovered some of its early losses following Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement, but is still down against the US dollar. It is now trading around $1.345, a fall of 1.7% this morning - from $1.339 before the chancellor spoke. Shares in London are falling at the start of trading. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a smaller selloff than feared last night. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index has lost 40 points in first few minutes of trading, a fall of 0.6%. Housebuilders and banks are leading the fallers. Building firm Berkeley group has lost 8%, while Royal Bank of Scotland is down almost 6%. That takes the Footsie down to 6100 points. Overnight, the futures market had predicted that the FTSE 100 would fall by 2.8%. So perhaps George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appearance this morning has calmed the situation a little. British airline easyJet has also warned that profits will miss expectations. It blamed strike action by French air traffic controllers, runway and congestion issues at Gatwick airport and severe weather, as well as Brexit uncertainty. London estate agent Foxtons has issued a profits warning, after counting the cost of the Brexit vote. The company has warned the City that the uncertainty it was already suffering, due to the EU referendum, will continue for at least the next six months. Foxtons had been hoping that the market would pick up in the second half of this year. But Nic Budden, Foxton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO, has now told shareholders that conditions won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t improve for a while. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whilst we had a strong start to the year, we said in our Q1 update that we expected the first half to be challenging ahead of the EU referendum. Since then recent sales volumes have been slow as uncertainty and higher stamp duty has led many buyers and sellers to sit on their hands. The result of the referendum has increased uncertainty and is likely to mean that these trends continue for at least the remainder of the year. Tweet of the morning.... Aengus Collins of the Economist Intelligence Unit wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reassured by the chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments: City economist Sam Tombs disputes Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that the UK economy is in good shape to handle Brexit: Duncan Weldon of the Resolution Foundation says that Osborne is relying on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank to fight the crisis. Chancellor George Osborne is speaking now, outlining the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response to the Brexit crisis. He warns that it is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153inevitable that the UK economy will have to adjust\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but claims that the economy is as strong as it could be to face the challenges ahead. My colleague Heather Stewart is watching at the Treasury. Osborne says he favours delaying triggering Article 50 -- to start the process of leaving the EU \u00e2\u20ac\u201c until it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear what the terms would be. That might alarm EU leaders, who want Britain to exit the building sharpish. But it might calm the City, as it gives some breathing space for the political crisis raging in Britain to calm down. And he also indicates that there will NOT be an emergency \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpunishment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 budget to tackle the consequences of Brexit. Instead, action will be taken in the autumn (when a new prime minister will have been chosen). That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a u-turn from Osborne, who had threatened tax rises if Brits defied the government and voted to leave the EU. Q: Will there be a recession, chancellor, as you warned before the referendum? Osborne ducks the question, saying only that there will be an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcadjustment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122..... Our politics liveblog has full details: Sterling has begun the week with a serious bout of Monday morning blues. Heavy selling in Asia has pushed the pound down by almost three cents, or 2%, against the US dollar, to $1.3394 this morning. And there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no relief from City traders, who have now returned to their desks. The pound is now only 1.5 cents away a new 31-year low. Remember, it was trading around $1.45 in the run-up to the referendum. Kit Juckes, foreign affairs expert at Societe Generale, explains why the pound is so weak: With recriminations, two main parties in turmoil and nothing but questions and uncertainty as far as the eye can see. I see no reason to buy the dip. Investors are expecting shares in London to fall sharply at the start of trading, at 8am BST. IG, the spread-betting firm, is predicting that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main stock markets will fall by around 2%: Good morning. After three of the most dramatic days of British political drama in living memory, the financial world is bracing for more turmoil this week. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to vote to leave the EU has left investors in a state of shock, and likely to send shares sliding across Europe again. Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp selloff, which wiped $2trillion off global markets, looks like the start of months of upheaval. Both UK major political parties are in a state of crisis \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with the Conservatives looking for a new prime minister, and some senior opposition Labour party members trying to force leader Jeremy Corbyn out. http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/corbyn-to-hold-crisis-talks-as-labour-mps-try-to-force-him-out So with uncertainty everywhere we look, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little reason for traders to pile into the pound either. So sterling could well head back towards 31-year lows this morning. Overnight, Chinese premier Li Keqiang has warned that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote to leave the European Union has increased uncertainly in the global economy. In London, chancellor George Osborne is about to deliver an emergency statement outlining the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response to the referendum vote. Mark Carney, Bank of England governor, has been due to attend an event in Portugal today. But that trip is off, with Carney staying in London - presumably to co-ordinate the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response to the crisis. The prospect of a new financial crisis is already alarming policymakers around the globe. Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF, has pointed out that markets were wrongfooted by the Brexit vote. But she also argues that the Bank of England et al have done the right thing: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But there was no panic and the central bankers did the job that they were prepared to do just in case, which was to put a lot of liquidity on the markets.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top finance official, Jack Lew, is due to give his take on the crisis later today. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the financial action through the day.....",

Resolution planning for US global systemically important banks was constructive for their Brexit contingency planning because of the requirement to rationalize and understand their global legal entity structure and activities.<br></p> <p>Restructuring operations will depend on license status in various jurisdictions, as well as establishing operational scale, potentially reallocating capital and relocating where trades and clients are booked. Relocation of staff is likely to follow; for example, ahead of the referendum, JP Morgan had announced that as many as 4,000 of its UK roles could be shifted out of the country.<br></p> <p>Management will have to decide where to focus its European operations, depending on language requirements, staff expertise and incentives offered by these countries.

It is unlikely to have any immediate implications for Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereign rating in the near term, but a medium-term rating impact would be possible if the economic dislocation of Brexit were to prove severe.</p> <p>Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is highly exposed to Brexit. According to the Central Statistics Office (CSO), the UK accounted for 12.6% of Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total goods exports in January-April 2016, and 24% of total goods imports. The UK also accounted for 20% of total services exports in 2014. Total goods and services exports to the UK are equivalent to around 17% of GDP. There could be significant sector-specific fall out. For example, the UK accounts for 49% of Irish agricultural exports.</p> <p>A UK slowdown, sterling depreciation and potential future trade barriers between Ireland and the UK would weigh on Irish exports, economic growth and employment; although the full impact will only become clear as EU-UK negotiations develop. We think the most important near-term impact will be through reduced domestic confidence.</p> <p>In the medium term, Ireland could gain from a shift of some foreign direct investment from the UK to the EU or from international businesses relocating from the UK, but this is highly uncertain.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Fitch also warns that political tensions between the Republic and Northern Ireland could rise (on Saturday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/26/northern-ireland-republic-peace-brexit-border\">Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Martin McGuinness, deputy first minister for Northern Ireland, called for a poll on reunification</a>)</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Brexit would represent a symbolic moving apart of the UK and Ireland that could weaken confidence in the peace process in Northern Ireland and potentially impair cross-border relations and trade.</p> <p>Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minority government, which was formed in May after February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inconclusive election, has outlined its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcContingency Framework\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that will guide its policy response. This identifies priorities including UK-EU negotiations, UK-Irish relations, trade and investment, and Northern Ireland. It remains to be seen how effective this will be, and some domestic political uncertainty persists given the relatively loose agreement between Fine Gael and Fianna Fail.</p> <p>Lower economic growth would reduce the tax intake, reducing the medium-term fiscal space that the government identified in its recent Summer Economic Statement. Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commitment to fiscal consolidation during and after its EU-IMF programme leads us to think an increase in fiscal risks would be met with a policy response to continue meeting fiscal targets and limiting the impact on public debt dynamics.</p> <p>Our upgrade of Ireland to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcA-\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in February reflected the marked fall in government debt to 93.8% of GDP in 2015 from 120% in 2013 driven by strong and broad-based growth and fiscal consolidation. While negative, Brexit is unlikely to undermine the progress that Ireland has made in these areas. Fitch expects debt/GDP to fall in the medium term, helped in part by lower nominal interest rates.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-06-28T11:47:46.929Z\">at 12.47pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57724ccee4b0be24d34f6b2b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-28T10:30:28.832Z\">11.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Pound up, but analysts cautious</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The pound is clinging onto its early gains this morning, as stability returns to the City.</strong></p> <p>Sterling is still up around 1.1 cents today, at $1.3334 against the US dollar.</p> <p>That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still close to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 31-year low, and a long way from the pre-referendum levels:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/lucy_meakin/status/747732503440592897\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Woohoo!

                "bodyText":"The volatility suffered by stock markets in recent days is unlikely to ease in the near future. The day saw a rebound following the sharp declines which came in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote, but the City is reluctant to bet too strongly on where markets go from here. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: It would be premature to call the bottom of the market, prices are still adjusting to the post-Brexit world, and it would be foolhardy to rule out further price swings. The bounce in the Footsie does show there are buyers out there who are swooping in when prices fall sufficiently, but markets neither go up, or down, in a straight line, and things may yet have to get worse before they get better. Valuations on the UK stock market look in the middle of their historical range, which suggests it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reasonable time to put money in the market if you are a long term investor. But given the current volatility, you need to be willing to stomach further price falls, if you are dipping a toe in. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 2.64% or 158.19 points at 6140.39 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax added 1.93% to 9447.28 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 2.61% higher at 4088.85 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB rose 3.3% to 15601.62 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 2.48% at 7835.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 3.72% to 538.65 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 148 points or 0.87%. As for the pound, it is now up 0.9% at $1.3342 after climbing as high as $1.3418. Against the euro it is 0.68% higher at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.2075. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close up for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. ECB president Mario Draghi has said Brexit could reduce European GDP by up to 0.5 percentage points, according to a document seen by Bloomberg. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full Reuters report on the meeting between business leaders and government minister Sajid Javid: Britain appears a long way from developing a clear plan on the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future trading relationship with the European Union, the head of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said on Tuesday after a meeting with government. CBI Director-General Carolyn Fairbairn said some firms were putting investment on hold after Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote to leave the EU last week, and that they needed a clearer sense of what the government intended to do. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s incredibly early days. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think anybody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coming out of these meetings feeling great, but they are coming out with a sense of resolve,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she told reporters. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a long way off having a plan and leadership and that is still where we will be continuing to make (the point) that this is what businesses need,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she added. Fairbairn said businesses expressed very high levels of real and genuine concern to business minister Sajid Javid, who had called the meeting, and that the government also needed to address the fears of EU migrants employed in Britain. At the meeting between business leaders and the government, there were high levels of real concern following the Brexit vote according to the CBI. Reuters reports the CBI saying that the government needed to develop a plan on the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading relationship with the EU very quickly. Businesses also wanted the government to get on with major infrastructure projects which are already underway. There were also concerns about rising prices, housing, and the insecurity being felt by migrant workers in the UK. The CBI director general said a number of firms had put investment on hold, said Reuters, and said the meeting did not feel great but there was a sense of resolve. After two days of panic leading shares have regained a little of the lost ground. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Today has seen a welcome reprieve from the incessant fear and risk aversion that has dominated financial markets since Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unexpected referendum result. The question on everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lips is whether we have seen an end to the selling, with many seeing current prices as an opportunity to buy their favourite firms at a temporary discount. [But] this selloff is unlikely to be over and perhaps the only thing that will truly raise risk appetite for good will be a faint glimmer of hope that we could see a second referendum. Despite the binary nature of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum result, far from providing a definitive answer to the markets, we now find ourselves in the eye of a political and economic storm. We have moved from a position of security and stability, to one where we do not even know who will lead the two main political parties in a year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. David Cameron may have said that there is no way to go back on the referendum result, but Jeremy Hunt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suggestion that he would hold a second referendum reminds us that crucially the decision is no longer Cameron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to make. UK business secretary Sajid Javid says maintaining single market access will be his number one priority in negotiations with the EU. He says British access to the single market may not take the same form as other non-EU countries. He says the UK economy remains strong and over the past few days investors have reaffirmed their commitment to the UK. Javid also said that a package of support for a potential buyer of the Port Talbot steel works was still available. US banks with significant UK operations are likely to act sooner rather than later to shift their operations, according to ratings agency Fitch. It said: The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to leave the European Union will be disruptive for US global banks with significant operations in the UK and will weigh on their profitability in the short to medium term, Fitch Ratings says. However, the impact is likely to be moderate as we believe they will be able to operate through other EU legal entities. US global banks are likely to start strategically implementing parts of their contingency plans rather than wait for trade and service arrangements to be agreed. Resolution planning for US global systemically important banks was constructive for their Brexit contingency planning because of the requirement to rationalize and understand their global legal entity structure and activities. Restructuring operations will depend on license status in various jurisdictions, as well as establishing operational scale, potentially reallocating capital and relocating where trades and clients are booked. Relocation of staff is likely to follow; for example, ahead of the referendum, JP Morgan had announced that as many as 4,000 of its UK roles could be shifted out of the country. Management will have to decide where to focus its European operations, depending on language requirements, staff expertise and incentives offered by these countries. Flexible labor laws will be important for US firms, so this may favor countries like Ireland and the Netherlands, rather than Germany and France. After cutting the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating from AAA to AA, Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has said it had no plans to downgrade any other EU country in the wake of the Brexit vote. But it said it would decide whether any UK bank ratings should be cut in the coming weeks. Reuters reports: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This does not lead to mechanical changes (in bank ratings),\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd S&amp;P banking sector analyst Giles Edwards said on a webcast. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But equally this (Brexit scenario) was not our base case... where we see a need to change ratings we will do so in the coming weeks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd On other EU sovereign ratings, S&amp;P\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global sovereign chief Moritz Kraemer said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have no intention of downgrading any other EU sovereign.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd S&amp;P chopped the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating by two notches to AA and kept it on a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnegative outlook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on Monday in the wake of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote to leave the European Union. It was the first time it had ever made such a deep cut to a top-rated sovereign. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a link to video of Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras arriving earlier at the European Council, warning the Brexit vote was a wake up call for Europe: More Brexit fallout. Siemens is putting new wind power investment plans in the UK on hold due to uncertainty caused by last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote, the Germany energy company has told the Guardian. Arthur Neslen reports: A \u00c2\u00a3310m manufacturing hub in Hull that employs 1,000 people will not be affected by the decision, and should still begin producing blades and assembling turbines next year. But Siemens, one of the few firms to openly back a Remain vote, will not be making new investments until the future of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relationship with Europe becomes clearer. Juergen Maier, the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK CEO, said that an existing blueprint to export offshore wind turbine machinery from the Hull hub was now up in the air. Sign up to our EU referendum morning briefing Read more He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Those plans were only beginning to happen and I expect that they will stall until we can work out exactly what the [new government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] plan is, how we can participate in EU research programmes, and until all the issues around tariffs and trade have been sorted out.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The full report is here: After higher than forecast US GDP figures, comes a better than expected consumer confidence number. According to the conference board, the consumer confidence index came in at 98 in June, compared to 92.4 in the previous month and an expected 93.3. (This was before the outcome of the UK referendum of course.) But there was a weaker manufacturing survey from the Richmond Federal Reserve: Earlier UK chancellor George Osborne suggested taxes would have to go up to address the economic damage caused by Brexit. So what taxes would they be? VAT could be one, according to tax specialists at Eversheds. The law firms partner Ben Jones said: If tax rises are required, ironically VAT (the only real European tax and a prerequisite for EU membership) could be the tax most likely to increase. VAT is a huge source of tax revenue and relatively easy to increase, both practically and politically. Indeed, during the financial crisis of 2008 and after, VAT was increased from 17.5% to 20% as part of measures to tackle the fiscal deficit. Increases to income taxes, national insurance contributions or business taxes would most likely be far more publically unpopular and politically undesirable. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Greek prime minister on the lesson from Brexit as he arrives at the European Council: Back with the European parliament: In tandem with other global markets, which have recovered a small part of the hefty declines seen in the wake of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote, the US has moved higher in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average - down almost 900 points since the referendum outcome - has gained 144 points or 0.8% as bargain hunters dip their toes into the market. The S&amp;P 500 has opened up 0.7% and Nasdaq 1.1%. Representatives of several industries are due to meet business minister Sajid Javid MP this afternoon for a summit on the potential impact of the Brexit vote on UK firms, writes Rob Davies. Food and Drink Federation director general Ian Wright will warn Javid that the industry faces a huge staffing shortfall if EU citizens are blocked from working in the UK. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK food industry has almost 100,000 workers from the rest of the EU. We have an emerging gap of up to a further 130,000 workers as our ageing staff retire over the next decade,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said in a prepared statement. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While we as an industry continue to take many steps to develop home-grown talent through ambitious graduate and apprenticeship programmes, EU workers also provide a highly valued solution to our skills gap. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK food industry benefits from bringing in skilled labour from the EU and we urgently need assurances from UK Government that EU nationals working in the UK will be granted leave to remain. UK Government must now develop a new migration policy that ensures food and drink manufacturers have continued access to the workers we will need to address a looming skills gap and the drive for future innovation to support our UK competitive advantage.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a video of Richard Branson discussing his Brexit concerns on Good Morning Britain: Lloyds Banking Group is the latest to try and reassure on the consequences of Brexit, following rival Royal Bank of Scotland earlier. Lloyds chief executive Antonio Horta Osorio has written to staff telling them the bank had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153robust plans in place for either outcome\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, according to Reuters. He said its strategy would remain unchanged and its low risk lending approach and historic brands put it in a position of strength to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153weather turbulence in our sector and the wider market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound is accelerating higher. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now gained almost two cents to $1.341, a jump of 1.5% today. Shares in London are also pushing higher, as the City recovers some poise following two days of Brexit panic. The FTSE 100 index is now up 175 points, or almost 3%, at 6157. That means it has clawed back ALL of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. Investors are piling back into financial stocks, perhaps reassured that banks only took \u00c2\u00a33bn in liquidity from the Bank of England this morning Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: The main change from yesterday to today seems to be the performance of the banks. Accepting around \u00c2\u00a33 billion in a Bank of England liquidity auction this morning, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking sector is looking a bit rosier after having the colour completely drain from its face at the start of the week. Barclay, Lloyds and RBS are the key stocks here; the trio suffered the most in the aftermath of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit announcement, diving up to 30% in the last 2 days of trading. Today, however, they have risen anywhere between 4% and 6%; a long way off from recapturing all of their losses, but a start nevertheless. But given the political turmoil in the UK, and the uncertainty over when (or indeed ever?) Britain will trigger Article 50, there may be more volatility ahead.... Newsflash from America: The US economy grew faster than expected in the first three months of this year, in some much-needed good news. US GDP grew at an annual rate of 1.1%, a little faster than expected, and means a quarterly rate of almost 0.3%, It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from a previous forecast of just 0.8% annualised growth (or 0.2% quarter on quarter). Over in Brussels, European leaders are gathering for a summit dominated by Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit bombshell. Prime minister David Cameron just arrived, telling reporters outside that he is seeking the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153closest possible relationship\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd between the UK and the EU. He also insists that the leaving process must be constructive; European countries are still our friends, our neighbours and our allies. Cameron was followed into the EU headquarters by Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, who had a scathing verdict on the UK: Our Politics liveblog will be tracking the action in Brussels: After two days of heavy falls, Wall Street is expected to rally today. Trading begins in 90 minutes. Ireland isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only European country which would suffer from Brexit. Fitch says that: The most exposed countries are Ireland, Malta, Belgium, the Netherlands, Cyprus and Luxembourg, all of whose exports of goods and services to the UK are at least 8% of GDP. And if Britain does well outside the EU, other member states could follow, Fitch adds... Brexit will create a precedent for a country leaving the EU and we believe it increases political risk in several ways. It could boost anti-EU or other populist political parties, and make EU leaders more reluctant to implement unpopular policies that would have long-term economic benefits. Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, Michael Noonan, says he hopes that the Republic can avoid being hurt by Brexit..... Rating agency Fitch has issued a warning that the Republic of Ireland could be downgraded because of the economic cost of Britain leaving the EU. It warns that Ireland is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchighly exposed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to the UK economy, given the strong trade links, so any Brexit slowdown could have a serious impact. However, the Irish credit rating is probably safe in the short term, at least. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full statement: The UK vote to leave the European Union is negative for Ireland, raising risks to growth and creating uncertainty around future relations with Northern Ireland, Fitch Ratings says. It is unlikely to have any immediate implications for Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereign rating in the near term, but a medium-term rating impact would be possible if the economic dislocation of Brexit were to prove severe. Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is highly exposed to Brexit. According to the Central Statistics Office (CSO), the UK accounted for 12.6% of Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total goods exports in January-April 2016, and 24% of total goods imports. The UK also accounted for 20% of total services exports in 2014. Total goods and services exports to the UK are equivalent to around 17% of GDP. There could be significant sector-specific fall out. For example, the UK accounts for 49% of Irish agricultural exports. A UK slowdown, sterling depreciation and potential future trade barriers between Ireland and the UK would weigh on Irish exports, economic growth and employment; although the full impact will only become clear as EU-UK negotiations develop. We think the most important near-term impact will be through reduced domestic confidence. In the medium term, Ireland could gain from a shift of some foreign direct investment from the UK to the EU or from international businesses relocating from the UK, but this is highly uncertain. Fitch also warns that political tensions between the Republic and Northern Ireland could rise (on Saturday, Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Martin McGuinness, deputy first minister for Northern Ireland, called for a poll on reunification) Brexit would represent a symbolic moving apart of the UK and Ireland that could weaken confidence in the peace process in Northern Ireland and potentially impair cross-border relations and trade. Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minority government, which was formed in May after February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inconclusive election, has outlined its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcContingency Framework\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that will guide its policy response. This identifies priorities including UK-EU negotiations, UK-Irish relations, trade and investment, and Northern Ireland. It remains to be seen how effective this will be, and some domestic political uncertainty persists given the relatively loose agreement between Fine Gael and Fianna Fail. Lower economic growth would reduce the tax intake, reducing the medium-term fiscal space that the government identified in its recent Summer Economic Statement. Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commitment to fiscal consolidation during and after its EU-IMF programme leads us to think an increase in fiscal risks would be met with a policy response to continue meeting fiscal targets and limiting the impact on public debt dynamics. Our upgrade of Ireland to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcA-\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in February reflected the marked fall in government debt to 93.8% of GDP in 2015 from 120% in 2013 driven by strong and broad-based growth and fiscal consolidation. While negative, Brexit is unlikely to undermine the progress that Ireland has made in these areas. Fitch expects debt/GDP to fall in the medium term, helped in part by lower nominal interest rates. The pound is clinging onto its early gains this morning, as stability returns to the City. Sterling is still up around 1.1 cents today, at $1.3334 against the US dollar. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still close to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 31-year low, and a long way from the pre-referendum levels: Caxton FX analyst Nicholas Laser-Ebisch warns that sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t over: Today will see the very first EU summit where leaders of all of the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 28 member states will meet in Brussels for a first exchange about the British referendum and the consequences involved. We can expect the pound to remain under pressure for the time being as markets come to terms with the result of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum vote. Stephen King, HSBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, also sees the pound falling: Newsflash: UK banks have taken \u00c2\u00a33bn of liquidity from the Bank of England in a special auction. That money is meant to help them handle the repercussions of the Brexit vote last week. This is the third such auction - last week, banks only took \u00c2\u00a3370m, and the previous week they took \u00c2\u00a32.4bn. If there were massive stresses in the City now, presumably banks would have asked for rather more money. The BoE says that it received bids for over \u00c2\u00a36bn, but banks were offering relatively low-quality assets as collateral, so many bids were turned down. Virgin tycoon Sir Richard Branson has warned that Chinese business partners are already pulling investment from the UK after the EU referendum. Speaking to The Guardian, he warned that last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s historic vote will cost \u00e2\u20ac\u0153thousands of jobs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Branson told my colleague Rob Davies that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I met with a group of Chinese businessmen yesterday morning who have invested heavily in England and who are now going to stop investing and withdraw investments they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already made.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m afraid that based on misinformation, people voted for Brexit, which is basically voting for a way of shooting themselves in the foot. The last 2 days has been absolute pandemonium worldwide in the markets, the pound crashing, the stock markets crashing, and we are heading rapidly towards a recession again. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just too sad, so so sad. Branson also laid into the Leave campaign for misleading voters during the referendum campaign, saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153thousands and thousands\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of workers will pay the price. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Businesspeople do not want politicians to completely and utterly wreck the hard work they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done for years and years and that is effectively what happened. Thousands and thousands of jobs will be lost as a result of this. Thousands of jobs that would have been created will be lost and the knock-on effect will be so dire. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The sad thing is I really think Brexiters were misled and did not realise. People said it was scaremongering. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t scaremongering and the last 48 hours have proved that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As mentioned at 8.50am, Branson is pushing for a second referendum vote. Branson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Virgin Money challenger bank has been badly hit by the referendum result, with shares tumbling by 40% since Friday morning. The boss of Royal Bank of Scotland has written to staff, warning that the EU referendum decision has created \u00e2\u20ac\u0153short, medium and longterm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd economic uncertainties, according to Reuters. New Zealand-born Ross McEwan told staff that RBS was well-prepared, and also urged them to support diversity in the workplace: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As someone born outside the UK, I see one of this country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest strengths as its openness to the rest of the world, and the people of it. As a major employer and backer of the economy we have a duty to ensure that we reflect that.. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The diversity of those who make up this bank at every level is key to our success. In uncertain times I want to ensure that everyone understands that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shares in RBS have risen by 3% this morning, but are still down by roughly a quarter since the referendum polls closed. At 180p, they are far from the 502p level where the taxpayer would sell its 72% stake without making a loss. George Osborne has also ruled himself out of becoming the next prime minister. There has been speculation that he could back Leave campaigner Boris Johnson, perhaps in return for becoming foreign secretary. Home secretary Theresa May is also seen as a frontrunner, though. Chancellor George Osborne has predicted more market turbulence, as Britain faces up to life outside the European Union. Speaking on Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today programme this morning, he said: We are in a prolonged period of economic adjustment \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it will not be as economically rosy as life inside the EU. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very clear that the country is going to be poorer as a result of what is happening to the economy. Osborne also warned that Britain faces higher taxes, and lower spending, to address the economic damage caused by the Brexit vote. Our Politics Liveblog has full details: Two major British companies, engine maker Rolls-Royce and the insurer Legal &amp; General, have tried to shareholders that the UK referendum result won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sink their operations. Rolls-Royce told the City this morning that its outlook is unchanged, while L&amp;G argues that the long-term trends in insurance are unchanged.... Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial newspaper, Handelsblatt, is predicting a surge of banking jobs into Frankfurt from the City. Online grocer Ocado has warned that the recent slump in sterling is likely to sent supermarket prices soaring. Chief executive Tim Steiner said the weaker pound may lead to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153inflationary pressure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but also told shareholders that he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe Brexit will cause a sudden crash in the UK retail market. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, predicts that inflation will hit 3% next year, over the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because it will cost more to import goods from abroad. Kit Juckes, currency expert at French bank Societe Generale, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed by the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s small rally this morning (to $1.335 from $1.32 last night) He is still worried about the political vacuum in Britain: Markets are bouncing, and can bounce further but the clouds on the horizon are dark, and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re real. Sterling can bounce to $1.35 for example- but the UK has no Government and no plan for the future. Billionaire businessman Sir Richard Branson has called for a second EU referendum this morning. Speaking on ITV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Good Morning Britain, he also revealed that his Virgin Money operation has abandoned a deal, since Britain voted for Brexit.... Is a second referendum possible? Well, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not unprecedented in European politics. And this morning, government minister Jeremy Hunt suggested that the next Prime Minister must be allowed to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153negotiate a deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with Brussels and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153put it to the British people\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by either calling a general election or having another referendum. However, Brexit supporters are unlikely to welcome the idea of a rerun... One rally doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean the Brexit crisis is over, remember.... It may seem curious that shares in London are rising, hours after Britain lost its AAA credit rating. But Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, reckons S&amp;P\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downgrade may actually be encouraging investors back into the market. It still seems as if we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a long way from the dust settling, but the FTSE-100 is starting Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session with a triple digit bounce. Yes we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen three ratings downgrades for the UK overnight, but taking a glass-half-full perspective, this also means that just a little of the uncertainty is starting to ebb away. Some stocks have taken a while to clear the auction, but this is a case of bargain hunters clamouring to get in. And there could be bargains on the table, if you think Brexit won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cause economic mayhem. Take housebuilder Persimmon, for example. Its shares are up 7% at \u00c2\u00a314.07. Last Thursday, they cost \u00c2\u00a321 each.... The French and German stock markets are also up by around 2% this morning, matching the recovery in London. European stock markets are rallying at the start of trading, after two days of big falls. In London, the FTSE 100 has jumped by 125 points, or around 2%, to 6,109 - recovering some of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. Every share has risen, led by builders \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who endured the brunt of the Brexit backlash. Mike van Dulken and Augustin Eden at Accendo Markets reckon that the markets may be calming down, pointing to the small recovery in the pound overnight. Sterling is strengthening for the first time since Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprise referendum result on hopes policymakers are working to limit the economic fallout Over in Asia, governments are considering whether to launch new stimulus packages to protect their firms from the consequences of Brexit. From Toyko, Justin McCurry explains: Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy minister, Nobuteru Ishihara, said on Tuesday that stimulus measures were likely to include assistance for small businesses. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are concerns about lessening the impact of the British referendum on Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s small and medium-sized companies,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ishihara said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Taking steps to provide liquidity to small firms could be a big factor in economic stimulus steps that we compile.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Brexit shock has left UK companies worried about losing sales from overseas clients. Our North of England editor, Helen Pidd, flags up that one small business is already seeing demand dry up: After two days of intense pummelling, the British pound is clambering off the mat this morning. Sterling has gained almost one cent against the US dollar so far today, to $1.3303. Yesterday it hit a 30-year low of $1.3118, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a small recovery (given the pound was worth $1.45 last week). Global stock markets have suffered their biggest two-day rout ever, thanks to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock decision to vote to leave the EU. Yesterday, $930bn was wiped off the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets, in a fresh bout of selling. That followed the rout on Friday, which destroyed $2.03 trillion of value. Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, explains that American investors are increasingly worried about the crisis, and its impact on their economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Friday was seen as a U.K. \u00e2\u20ac\u201c E.U. problem, with the U.S suffering some damage on the side lines \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global declines paint a more involved U.S. participation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The bottom-line is we may still be in the knee-jerk reaction phase, but continued deterioration can feed on itself.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd S&amp;P\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Global Broad Market index, known as the BMI, has fallen almost 6.9% since Thursday night, its biggest loss in cash terms ever. The scale of the loses shows how unprepared investors were for the Leave campaign\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprise victory in the early hours of Friday morning. In Britain, the FTSE 100 has fallen by over 5% over the last two days, with bank shares sliding to their lowest levels since the 2008 financial crisis. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s S&amp;P 500 index, the broadest stock index, has lost 5.37% -- in its worst two-day decline since last August. Good morning. Like the average England football fan this morning, the financial markets are in a gloomy and dejected mood. The shock of seeing the UK vote to leave the European Union last week continues to reverberate around the global economy, with economists fearing that global growth will take a hit. Last night, Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Fitch both downgraded Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating to AA, two notches below the top AAA rating, warning that growth will be significantly weaker than previously expected. That only adds to worries about the UK economy, which have sent shares in banks and building companies reeling since Friday morning. After two days of heavy falls, European stock markets are expected to claw back some losses this morning. The FTSE 100 is predicted to rise by around 1%. But investors should be cautious in the current climate; there is just too much uncertainty around The Bank of England is doing its bit to stem the crisis. Later today it will offer UK banks the chance to stock up on liquidity to help them through the Brexit crisis, in a special liquidity auction. That will show how worried the City is about financial conditions. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be a busy day in politics too, with David Cameron slinking off to Brussels to face fellow leaders for the first time since his referendum gamble backfired - taking his career with it. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll leave behind a cabinet full of scheming ministers, wondering who might become the next prime minister. But the opposition Labour party is doing its best to match the Tories in the shambles stakes, with scores of MPs trying to dislodge their leader. Jeremy Corbyn is gripping his seat tightly, though, and promising to go nowhere. Our Politics Liveblog will have all the action in Westminster and Brussels:",
