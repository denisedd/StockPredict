Looking beneath the headline though, the headline was lifted solely by a large pick-up in the supplier deliveries index. Aside from that, most other components remained roughly where they were last time around... Overall though, the index remains only tentatively within growth territory (ie above 50), but crucially, this is a much better position than where it was around the turn of the year.</p> <p>For the Federal Open Market Committee though, the ISM numbers are not essential in timing the next rate hike. Attention is now heavily centred on Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour report. In advance of this, some emphasis is likely to be put on the employment components of this, and to a greater extent the non-manufacturing ISM, although we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d note that neither are tightly correlated with non-farm payrolls. In any case, the employment component of the manufacturing ISM remained flat this time around.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"801e355c676e667c5f3d90323a93db6ebaf6bbb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/801e355c676e667c5f3d90323a93db6ebaf6bbb4/0_0_488_461/488.jpg\" alt=\"US jobs comparisons\" width=\"488\" height=\"461\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US jobs comparisons</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Macrobond, ING</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>We think that the risk of an above consensus non-farm payrolls (NFP) reading (currently at 160,000) is higher than a sub-consensus one. Although we tend to agree that job creation may be slowing as the economy reaches a point close to full employment, we feel that the month-on-month volatility in the headline NFP means that something at or above what we consider to be the underlying trend (around 185,000) is reasonably likely. Never-the-less, we feel that this element of the labour report is not critical to the FOMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thinking at present. The Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tick-box\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd has effectively already been ticked (and arguably has for several months) and the key now lies with the activity data, which has improved slightly after a weak first quarter.

                "bodyText":"Downbeat manufacturing data from around the globe, warnings from the OECD about the outlook and the repercussions of Brexit, and continuing concerns about a US rate rise have combined to get the new month off to an uninspiring start for investors. European markets have closed lower across the board but have come off their worst levels after a slight recovery in the oil price on hopes of an output agreement at Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Opec meeting. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 38.86 points or 0.62% at 6191.93 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 0.57% to 10,204.44 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.67% lower at 4475.39 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 1.19% to 17,810.85 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 1.3% at 8916.9 In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.29% to 645.10 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has recovered much of its earlier fall and is currently down just 16 points or 0.09%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow for, among other things, the latest European Central Bank meeting. After the individual PMIs, the global index shows manufacturing stagnating: David Hensley at JP Morgan, which compiled the global index along with Marki, said: The May PMI data suggest that the global manufacturing sector remains in a low gear. Indices for output, new orders and the headline PMI were all at, or barely above, the stagnation mark. The move up in the finished goods inventory index suggests manufacturers are still working to realign stocks with demand. Of course, there are always conflicting reports ahead of any meeting of oil producers: Oil prices have recovered from earlier losses following a Reuters report that Opec ministers meeting in Vienna on Thursday are likely to consider a new ceiling on output. After falling as low as $48.65 a barrel, Brent crude is now up 0.12% at $49.95. But: But the ISM manufactuing numbers are not essential for the Federal Reserve in its interest rate deliberations, said James Smith at ING Bank: The ISM Manufacturing index surprised on the upside, ticking up from 50.8 to 51.3, rather than down to 50.3 as had been expected following a raft of weak regional surveys. Looking beneath the headline though, the headline was lifted solely by a large pick-up in the supplier deliveries index. Aside from that, most other components remained roughly where they were last time around... Overall though, the index remains only tentatively within growth territory (ie above 50), but crucially, this is a much better position than where it was around the turn of the year. For the Federal Open Market Committee though, the ISM numbers are not essential in timing the next rate hike. Attention is now heavily centred on Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour report. In advance of this, some emphasis is likely to be put on the employment components of this, and to a greater extent the non-manufacturing ISM, although we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d note that neither are tightly correlated with non-farm payrolls. In any case, the employment component of the manufacturing ISM remained flat this time around. We think that the risk of an above consensus non-farm payrolls (NFP) reading (currently at 160,000) is higher than a sub-consensus one. Although we tend to agree that job creation may be slowing as the economy reaches a point close to full employment, we feel that the month-on-month volatility in the headline NFP means that something at or above what we consider to be the underlying trend (around 185,000) is reasonably likely. Never-the-less, we feel that this element of the labour report is not critical to the FOMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thinking at present. The Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tick-box\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd has effectively already been ticked (and arguably has for several months) and the key now lies with the activity data, which has improved slightly after a weak first quarter. Thus, we feel that the answer to the June/July/September debate now lies with chair Yellen (who speaks next week) and we currently think that July is the most likely timing for the next hike. Both sets of US manufacturing figures may have come in better than expected but still show signs of weakness, said Connor Campbell at Spreadex: Both the Markit and ISM PMIs surpassed expectations (at 50.7 and 51.3 respectively), though the performance from the former still points to a slowdown month-on-month while the latter is hardly a world-beating number, being lower than the Eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own stagnant growth. It is hard to tell whether the Dow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negative start to the session stemmed from a) the general malaise that engulfed Europe this morning, b) the better than forecast PMIs giving a bit of extra heft to the Fed hawks or c) the fact that the manufacturing figures are still worryingly weak. Regardless the Dow Jones plunged 90 points after the open before settling at a 60-ish point loss, leaving the index at its lowest price in around a week. And there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more for the US Federal Reserve to consider ahead of this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, when a rate rise has still not been ruled out. US construction spending fell 1.8% in April, the largest monthly decline since January 2011. March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure was revised up from a 0.5% rise to a 1.5% increase. Analysts had been expecting the April figure to show a rise of 0.6%. This piece of negative data in what has been a mixed batch of reports recently could see economists cutting their second quarter GDP forecasts. However there is a more positive sign from the ISM manufacturing survey. The manufacturing activity index came in at 51.3 in May, well ahead of expectations of a figure of 51.3, and ahead of April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 50.8. But the new orders index dipped from 55.8 in April to 55.7, while the employment index was flat at 49.2 after expectations of a rise to 49.7. The manufacturing PMI provides another sign of a slowing US economy, says Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. He said: The survey data indicate that factory output fell in May at its fastest rate since 2009, suggesting that manufacturing is acting as a severe drag on the economy in the second quarter. Payroll numbers are under pressure as factories worry about slower order book growth, in part linked to falling export demand but also as a result of growing uncertainty surrounding the presidential election. For those looking for a rebound in the economy after the lacklustre start to the year, the deteriorating trend in manufacturing is not going to provide any comfort. US manufacturing growth slowed slightly in May from the previous month, according to the latest Markit index. The final manufacturing PMI came in at 50.7, better than the preliminary estimate of 50.5, but down on the 50.8 recorded in April. Markit said this was the lowest level since September 2009. As forecast, US markets have started the trading day in negative territory. Falling oil prices and weak Chinese and European manufacturing data have combined to unsettle investors, who are already nervous at the prospect of another US interest rate rise. There is also caution ahead of Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European Central Bank meeting, and the US non-farm payroll numbers a day later. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 120 points or 0.7% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdq both opened around 0.4% lower. The FTSE 100 has fallen 1.1% or 69 points, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is down 0.8% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac nearly 1%. More US data is due shortly, with the Markit manufacturing PMI followed by the ISM manufacturing survey. Wall Street is expected to follow Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead, and selloff when trading begins shortly. Over in Greece it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been an eventful day in parliament where MPs have voted overwhelmingly to rescind a law that would have allowed them to have holdings in offshore companies. In a roll call vote deputies dropped a law that many - ironically - had failed to see when endorsing a 7,500-page multi-bill of creditor-mandated reforms ten days ago. The clause, revealed by a Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proto Thema newspaper, had caused prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 leftist led coalition extraordinary embarrassment. Tsipras was voted into power saying his Syriza party would abolish measures deemed to promote tax evasion. In a double whammy for the government, uproar over the clause has coincided with a tsunami of indirect taxes on luxury goods that comes into force today. Brazilians have woken up to the news that they face an even deeper recession than expected. In today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic outlook, the OECD has predicted that Brazil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP will shrink by 4.3% in 2016, as joblessness spikes. Back in February the OECD expected a 4.0% contraction this year, before the recent impeachment of Dilma Roussef gripped the country. The OECD says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The deep recession is set to continue in 2016 and in 2017 against the backdrop of high political uncertainty and ongoing corruption revelations that are undermining consumer and business confidence, leading to a continuous contraction in domestic demand. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As the economy shrinks, unemployment is set to rise further.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd With inflation also worryingly high, and its Petrobras oil giant mired in its money-laundering scandal, the outlook for Brazil does looks very challenging. Attendees at the OECD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Forum in Paris haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lost their enthusiasm for free trade: In other news....the London Stock Exchange Group has just revealed that more than a thousands jobs could be lost through its merger with Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Deutsche B\u00c3\u00b6rse. In a prospectus to investors, the LSEG explains that 1,250 positions will be eliminated across the combined group once the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20bn deal is approved (assuming nothing derails it). Most of the jobs will lost through \u00e2\u20ac\u0153technology enabled efficiencies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, or by restructuring various back-office and HQ operations. However, it is sugaring the pill by predicting that 200 new roles could be created as a result of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153proposed growth initiatives\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Here are the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 today: Building supply chain Wolseley is leading the selloff after it reported slowing revenue growth in the UK and Europe -- another sign that the world economy is weakening. And housebuilders Taylor Wimpey and Barratt Development are out of favour, after Nationwide building society reported that house price growth has slowed. European stock markets are heading deeper into the red, as the OECD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit warning continue to haunt investors. The FTSE 100 is now down 67 points, of over 1%, at 6163. Banks and mining stocks are among the fallers, reflecting worries about global economic growth. The weak factory figures from China overnight also hurting confidence, as is the news that eurozone factory growth has hit a three-month low. Mike van Dulken, Head of Research at Accendo Markets, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Equities are nursing losses this morning as yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breakdowns from comfortable consolidation/uptrends yesterday gather pace. This comes after a revival of geopolitical risk (Brexit poll) and a raft of mixed data from across the globe (run of poor US manufacturing; China and Eurozone PMIs failing to inspire; UK Consumers delaying borrowing). Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Larry Elliott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news story about the OECD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest warning about Brexit, and its new economic forecasts. Brexit uncertainty has also hurt some UK factories, according to a new survey. One in three manufacturers polled by Markit said June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum has had a detrimental, or very detrimental, effect on their business, while half reported no impact. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a silver lining, though, almost one percent said Brexit uncertainty had been strongly beneficial. Maybe they manufacture campaign posters, or possibly ear plugs.... Markit also found that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sector basically stagnated last month. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK factory PMI came in at 50.1, just over the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbreak-even\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 point between expansion and contraction. The prime minister has also tweeted about the OECD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report: Cameron D. failed to mention that the economy has already suffered from Brexit fears, according to the OECD (see earlier entry) The opposition Labour party have swiftly seized on the news that the OECD has slashed its UK growth forecasts, from 2.1% to 1.7% this year. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s OECD report once again shows the absolute failure of the Chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic policy. Not only has productivity slumped, but the OECD also highlight the risk of further bubbles in the housing market whilst housebuilding continues at too low a level. Further proof that George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery is built on sand. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With the OECD forecasting a dramatic shock to the whole economy from a Tory Brexit, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t risk failed Tory economic policy any more. We need a serious commitment from this government to invest in infrastructure and housing, backed up by a real industrial strategy to place the economy on a sound foundation and build the high-tech, high-wage economy of the future.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd If the OECD are right, then George Osborne could struggle to hit its economic targets. Back in March, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility predicted the UK would grow by 2% this year. Lower growth will probably translate to weaker tax receipts, making it harder to cut the deficit. Pro-Brexit campaigners often argue that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impossible to say exactly how the UK economy would perform outside of the EU. After all, the government can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get its annual forecasts right, so how can we accurately project growth over a longer horizon? The OECD acknowledges this, with three different scenarios for Brexit. However, they all show that the economy would suffer: The pound has just weakened to a two-week low against the US dollar, at $1.4439, after another opinion poll hit the wires: You can see the full report from the OECD here. Amid the flurry of figures from the OECD, this one stands out. After Brexit, UK GDP would be 3% lower by 2020, while the European Union\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy would be 1% smaller, according to the Paris-based thinktank. The Financial Times have created a handy graph to show the likely impact if the Leave side are victorious on June 23. The OECD is adamant that this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum has already hurt the British economy. In its report on the UK (online here), it says: Growth has slowed, and is projected to be 1\u00c2\u00be per cent in 2016. Uncertainty about the outcome of the end-June 2016 referendum, which could lead to an exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Brexit), has undermined growth. This projection assumes that the United Kingdom remains in the European Union, in which case growth is projected to pick up in the second half of 2016 and then stabilise in 2017..... However: The outcome of the referendum is a major risk for the economy. A vote for Brexit would heighten uncertainty, raise the cost of finance and hamper investment. The OECD also points out the Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit is running at record highs: It adds that productivity has been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exceptionally weak since 2007, and reviving it is essential to sustain growth and living standards.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Another chart showing how the OECD fears the impact of Britain leaving the EU: This chart highlights how pessimistic the OECD is about growth in advanced economies: Brexit fears are also driving up the cost of insuring against a plunge in the value of the pound. Sterling volatility has jumped to the highest level in more than seven years after a Guardian poll showed the Brexit camp is in the lead ahead of this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum. One-month implied sterling volatility - the price of insuring against swings in the pound against the dollar - rose to 19.6% from 17% a day earlier, as Brexit fears mounted. It was the highest level since the depths of the financial crisis February 2009, a month before the Bank of England made the unprecedented moved of cutting interest rates to an all-time low of 0.5%. Sterling volatility is considered a sign of market anxiety, and Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surge followed a Guardian poll that showed voters are 52%-48% split in favour of leaving the European Union. Will Straw, executive director of the Britain Stronger In Europe campaign, says voters should take the OECD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit warning seriously: The OECD is presenting its new Economic Outlook report in Paris right now: The youngest and oldest in society will suffer most if the world economy does not pick up pace, fears the OECD. Catherine Mann explains that governments will find it harder and harder to meet \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fundamental promises\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, such as jobs opportunity and pensions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take action to boost productivity and potential growth, both younger and older generations will be worse off. The consequences of policy inaction will be low career prospects for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s youth, who have suffered so much already from the crisis, and lower retirement income for future pensioners.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The OECD is urging governments across the globe to boost their spending, to spur growth. Their chief economist Catherine Mann says there is an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153urgent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd need to use fiscal firepower to boost demand. She warns: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The longer the global economy remains in the low-growth trap, the more difficult it will be to break the negative feedback loops.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In a gloomy update, the OECD has also lowered its growth forecast for the 34 countries who make up its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcclub\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to 1.8% this year and 2.1% in 2017. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down from 2.2% and 2.3% six months ago. It has cut its US growth forecast to 1.8% this year, instead of the 2% it forecast in February. It also forecasts another year of recession in Russia. However, it has raised its forecast for eurozone growth this year to 1.6%, from 1.4%. Breaking: The OECD has slashed its forecast for UK growth this year to just 1.7%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down from an estimate of 2.1% three months ago, and much weaker than the 2.3% growth recorded in 2015. And the Paris-based body is also warning that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure from the European Union would have a serious impact on the global economy. Indeed, it claims that Brexit is as big a threat to the global economy as a hard landing in China. From Paris, our economics editor Larry Elliott reports: Catherine Mann, chief economist at the OECD said the uncertainty caused by the referendum came at a time when the global economy was caught in a low-growth trap. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Spillovers could be significant to other countries\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Mann said as she predicted that the world economy would grow by 3% in 2016 and by 3.3% in 2017 - forecasts that have remained unchanged since its last health check three months ago. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have done a lot of work on what a hard landing in China would mean. It is in the same ball park as Brexit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More to follow.... Breaking: Growth across Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing base has slowed to its slowest rate since February, leaving factories in near-stagnation. The eurozone factory PMI, produced by data firm Markit, has dropped to 51.5 for May, down from 51.7 in April, closer to the 50-point mark that shows no growth at all. Markit reports that the French and Greek factory sectors shrank last month, while growth slowed in Spain, Italy and Ireland. Worryingly, firms across the eurozone reported that new order growth slowed last month, forcing them to slash prices (again) to stimulate demand. New export order growth hit a 16-month low, and job creation slowed too. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, fears that the eurozone recovery is faltering: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Manufacturing in the euro area remained stuck in a state of near-stagnation in May, failing to break out of the slow growth phase that has plagued producers since February. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The disappointing performance of manufacturing adds to suspicions that the pace of eurozone economic growth in the second quarter has cooled after a surprisingly brisk start to the year based on the latest estimate of GDP. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153New orders grew at the slowest rate for over a year as demand showed signs of waning both within the euro area and further afield. Not surprisingly, companies remain reluctant to build capacity and take on extra workers, lacking signs of any imminent upturn in demand. Switzerland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has grown much less strongly than expected, reinforcing the OECD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns about growth. The Swiss economy grew 0.1 per cent in the first three months of 2016, missing expectations of 0.3% expansion. Switzerland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial services and hotel and catering industry contracted, while the manufacturing, construction and the healthcare sectors grew. New factory data from Ireland suggest that its economy may have been hit as Brexit uncertainty drifts over the Irish Sea. The Irish manufacturing PMI fell to 51.5 in May from 52.6 in April. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the weakest reading in 27 months, suggesting that factory growth slowed last month. Irish firms reported that new export orders fell, while output and new business grew at a slower rate. Investec, which compiles the PMI, argues that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upcoming EU referendum is partly to blame. Philip O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Sullivan, chief economist at Investec Ireland, says: We expect that at least some of the weakness relates to that event [the EU vote] and other international uncertainties. With momentum appearing to be building behind the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcRemain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 campaign, sterling has recently begun to strengthen against the single currency, which augurs well for the near-term outlook for many Irish exporters. However, a poll published by the Guardian on Tuesday showed a pick-up in support for the Leave campaign, which sent the pound sliding against the euro. That makes it harder for eurozone manufacturers to sell goods into the UK market, which is the destination for roughly one-seventh of Irish merchandise exports. Angel Gurria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fears over the global economy may have hurt sentiment in the City. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has fallen by 40 points, or 0.6%, to a one-week low of 6,195 points. The other main European indices are also in the red. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx explains why investors are jittery this month: China set the tone this Wednesday, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s continually limp manufacturing PMIs (the government-released figure remained at 50.1 while the Caixin reading slumped to a 3 month low of 49.2) an unwanted reminder of the global weaknesses circling the market like vultures. Along that theme the OECD also chimed in with a worldwide warning this morning, Angel Gurria stating that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcconditions are very difficult\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to sluggish global growth. So not exactly the best backdrop to begin the month against, especially with June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investor-concerning Fed meeting and UK EU referendum rapidly approaching. Angel Gurr\u00c3\u00ada adds that the OECD is also concerned that Britain could vote to leave the EU in this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum. It is a threat to the global economy, he tells Bloomberg TV, but particularly to the people of the UK. The OECD has calculated that Brexit is effectively a tax, of between \u00c2\u00a32,000 and \u00c2\u00a35,000 per year. A month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay, for which you get nothing in return, he argues. Angel Gurr\u00c3\u00ada also warns that more must be done to fight inequality, calling it the defining issue of our time. The global economy is struggling, due to weak trade and problems in emerging markets. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the head of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Angel Gurr\u00c3\u00ada, Secretary-General of the OECD, gave the warning hours before the OECD is due to release its new economic outlook. He told Bloomberg TV that global economic conditions are very difficult. And that means that the world economy faces \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a rather mediocre, a rather dismal outlook.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Gurr\u00c3\u00ada pinned the blame on problems with the engines of growth, which are dangerously misfiring. He explained: Trade is growing at 2% to 3%, it should be growing at 7%. Only five times in the last 50 years has trade been growing below the rate of growth of the GDP of the world. On those 5 occasions, there been a very serious deceleration, even a recession. I\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdm not saying there will be a recession this time. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m just saying conditions are very difficult. Gurr\u00c3\u00ada says that the world economy is only expected to grow by 3% in 2016 - matching 2015\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s less-than-stellar performance. He also predicted that there will only be a small improvement in 2017. Three months ago, the OECD expected 3.3% growth in 2017; so Gurr\u00c3\u00ada may be hinting at a fresh downgrade today. The OECD issues its new forecasts at 9.30am UK time (10.30am in Paris). Our economics editor Larry Elliott is in Paris for the OECD forum, so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have more details through the day.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a new month, which means we get a new healthcheck on the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory sectors. PMIs reports from Asia, Europe and America will show whether manufacturing output rose or fell in May, and thus highlight whether fears of an economic slowdown are justified. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already heard from China. The official Chinese May manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Index (PMI) has come in at 50.1, only fractionally above stagnation. That suggests its factory sector is stabilising, but not delivering much growth. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll hear from eurozone countries, including German and France, between 8am and 9am BST. Other highlights include the UK at 9.30am, followed by the US at 3pm. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets predicts that French factories struggled in May. In Europe, while France has continued to underachieve in its manufacturing sector, with the recent fuel blockades unlikely to help matters in the coming weeks, a reading of 48.3 is expected here, we have seen the latest German, Spain and Italian numbers hold above the 50 levels quite comfortably, though they have been slowing on a month on month basis. Spain and Italy are expected to show readings of 52.6, 53.5, both down on April, while German activity has started to improve with a reading of 52.5 expected, up from 51.8. Also coming up today... The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is holding a forum in Paris. Economists will also be digesting new growth figures from Australia, which beat expectations: And in the City, cars-to-bikes group Halfords and building supplies group Wolseley are reporting financial results, while building society Nationwide is publishing monthly house price data. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events though the day....",

ING economist James Smith said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Although ADP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s estimate of employment remained below 200,000 in May, we would caution against relying on it too heavily as a guide for tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour report.</p> <p>In advance of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hotly-anticipated labour report, ADP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s estimate of May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private payrolls came in (rather magically) exactly on consensus at 173,000. This figure may not have been adjusted for the Verizon strike, which the Bureau of Labor Statistics has already said will remove approximately 35,000 workers from May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overall employment and this in principal, supports the view that non-farm payrolls (NFP) will come in below 200,000 again tomorrow.</p> <p>However, we would note that, whilst ADP use information from their client\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s payrolls, this is only one (possibly relatively small) part of the overall forecasting model that they employ. It is also a function of last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official payrolls data (ie an autoregressive model) and a business conditions index (which is composed of activity data such as industrial production and GDP). As a result, we would caution against relying too heavily on this estimate of NFP, as the information specifically contained about May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market performance may be fairly limited.</p> <p>Despite the strike-related distortion, we feel that Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consensus figure is a little low.</p> <p>Although it is possible that job creation is slowing as the economy reaches something close to full employment, the high month-on-month volatility (arising from several factors, not least statistical/seasonal adjustment gyrations) in NFP means that the risk of a higher reading than last month (160,000) is arguably greater than the risk of a lower one. We look for something at or above what we consider to be the current underlying trend (roughly 180,000-185,000).</p> <p>That said, we feel that the key to the next Federal Reserve Open Market Committee rate hike does not lie within the labour report. As recent speeches/statements have shown, the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market check-box is effectively already \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ticked\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and thus the timing of the next move depends more on how FOMC members perceive the recovery in activity data to have been since a weak first quarter.</p> <p>In that regard, the final (and probably definitive) green or red light to a June hike will come from Chair Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech on Monday. On balance, although many of the FOMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conditions for a hike have arguably been largely met, we feel that they are more likely to wait until the third quarter (most likely July), when the UK referendum event risk has passed.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b49c17f27b5c8181cf439c7a722d4b22bd5277f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b49c17f27b5c8181cf439c7a722d4b22bd5277f/295_0_2911_1747/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Federal Reserve.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Federal Reserve.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-06-02T15:04:04.803Z\">at 4.04pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-575045e8e4b00d22af5dfb03\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-02T14:49:54.264Z\">3.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a busy couple of hours, what with the European Central Bank and the collapse of BHS.

While the estimated 2016 growth of 3.1 per cent is higher than that of 2015, it has been revised down slightly since our December meeting.</p> <p>World oil demand this year remains healthy, with growth of over 1.2 million barrels per day. The majority of this will come from non-OECD countries, but OECD countries are also expected to see some growth in every quarter this year.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Al Sada also pointed out that non-OPEC members are cutting their production, in response to the tumble in the oil price last year: </strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>From the supply perspective, in the first half of this year, we have seen a further downward revision to the 2016 outlook for non-OPEC supply. We now anticipate a contraction of 740,000 barrels per day this year. This is more than 2 million barrels per day lower than the growth of 2015.</p> <p>This trend stems mainly from reduced cashflows, investment cutbacks and the deferral or cancellation of projects.</p> </blockquote> <p>Al Sada says this suggests that the oil market is balancing (as Saudi minister Khalid al-Falih also said). <strong>But he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also concerned that stocks levels are still high - and hints that production targets should be considered.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The five-year average for OECD commercial stocks is currently at a surplus of around 360 million barrels. It is important that we take note of this figure on a downward trend.</p> <p>A more stable and balanced market will be beneficial to all.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full statement:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/press_room/3486.htm\">Opening address to the 169th Meeting of the OPEC Conference</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Livesquawk/status/738294307648602112\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Opening address to the 169th Meeting of the OPEC Conference <a href=\"https://t.co/g0ZysLNIkg\">https://t.co/g0ZysLNIkg</a></p>&mdash; Livesquawk (@Livesquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Livesquawk/status/738294307648602112\">June 2, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-06-02T09:35:16.738Z\">at 10.35am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-574ff58ee4b03b568f2bf76e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-02T09:03:13.990Z\">10.03am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Alex Schindelar, </strong>news<strong> </strong>editor at <strong>Energy Intelligence Group, </strong>reckons few OPEC ministers will push for production curbs in Vienna.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Alex_Schindelar/status/738293752377266177\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Nothing too illuminating out of the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Opec?src=hash\">#Opec</a> &quot;gang bang&quot; except most ministers do not seem to have much problem with doing nothing.</p>&mdash; Alex Schindelar (@Alex_Schindelar) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Alex_Schindelar/status/738293752377266177\">June 2, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-574ff486e4b03b568f2bf764\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-02T08:59:28.922Z\">9.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Energy analyst <strong>Joe McMonigle</strong> is tweeting from the Opec meeting.

                "bodyText":"There were no fireworks from Vienna, with the European Central Bank keeping rates on hold and revising its inflation and growth figures only slightly higher, while Opec failed to agree on an output ceiling on oil. So investors remained cautious ahead of the US non-farm payroll numbers due on Friday. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 dipped 6.32 points or 0.1% to 6185.61 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax edged up 0.03% to 10,208.00 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.21% at 4466.00 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.24% to 17,767.30 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.46% at 8957.9 In Greece, the Athens market lost 0.92% to 639.19 as the ECB said it had not yet decided on a waiver which would allow it to buy the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bonds On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently virtually unchanged, down just 2.8 points or 0.02%. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our report on the Opec meeting stalemate: Lingering hopes that Saudi Arabia and Iran could put aside their regional power struggle and reach a deal on oil production levels to help stabilise the volatile crude markets have been dashed. A ministerial meeting of the Opec oil-producing cartel broke up in Vienna without agreement on Thursday, with Tehran refusing to support a plan by Riyadh and others to freeze their crude output. The political logjam means the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fragile five\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Opec members such as Nigeria, Venezuela, and Libya whose economies are almost completely dependent on petroleum revenues, will remain under pressure. The UK North Sea industry could see more layoffs and spending cuts but a lower oil price \u00e2\u20ac\u201c currently just below $50 per barrel compared with the $100 level hit in the years prior to 2014 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is good for British motorists, manufacturers and homeowners. Opec put a brave face on its inaction, pointing out that the cost of crude had risen by 80% since its last summit in December. It said it had achieved the main purpose of the meeting, choosing a new secretary general, in Nigeria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mohammed Barkindo. The full story is here: Back with Greece and the European Central Bank, and the prospect of reintroducing a waiver allowing the Bank to buy the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bonds: There was talk of country quotas following the Opec meeting but..... Back with oil, and after a surprise build up of stocks reported on Wednesday by the American Petroleum Institute, there was a fall in inventories according to the latest weekly Energy Information Administration. EIA figures showed US crude stocks fell by 1.37m barrels, and despite being lower than the forecast 2.5m barrel draw, the news has given some support to oil prices which were hit by the earlier lack of agreement by Opec. Brent crude, having fallen as low as $48.84 a barrel is now down 0.6% at $49.40. Earlier of course there were also some US jobs figures, ahead of the non-farm payroll numbers on Friday. The ADP private sector payroll number came in exactly in line with forecasts, but ING Bank warns not to read too much into that as far as the non-farms are concerned. ING economist James Smith said: Although ADP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s estimate of employment remained below 200,000 in May, we would caution against relying on it too heavily as a guide for tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour report. In advance of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hotly-anticipated labour report, ADP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s estimate of May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private payrolls came in (rather magically) exactly on consensus at 173,000. This figure may not have been adjusted for the Verizon strike, which the Bureau of Labor Statistics has already said will remove approximately 35,000 workers from May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overall employment and this in principal, supports the view that non-farm payrolls (NFP) will come in below 200,000 again tomorrow. However, we would note that, whilst ADP use information from their client\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s payrolls, this is only one (possibly relatively small) part of the overall forecasting model that they employ. It is also a function of last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official payrolls data (ie an autoregressive model) and a business conditions index (which is composed of activity data such as industrial production and GDP). As a result, we would caution against relying too heavily on this estimate of NFP, as the information specifically contained about May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market performance may be fairly limited. Despite the strike-related distortion, we feel that Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consensus figure is a little low. Although it is possible that job creation is slowing as the economy reaches something close to full employment, the high month-on-month volatility (arising from several factors, not least statistical/seasonal adjustment gyrations) in NFP means that the risk of a higher reading than last month (160,000) is arguably greater than the risk of a lower one. We look for something at or above what we consider to be the current underlying trend (roughly 180,000-185,000). That said, we feel that the key to the next Federal Reserve Open Market Committee rate hike does not lie within the labour report. As recent speeches/statements have shown, the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market check-box is effectively already \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ticked\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and thus the timing of the next move depends more on how FOMC members perceive the recovery in activity data to have been since a weak first quarter. In that regard, the final (and probably definitive) green or red light to a June hike will come from Chair Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech on Monday. On balance, although many of the FOMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conditions for a hike have arguably been largely met, we feel that they are more likely to wait until the third quarter (most likely July), when the UK referendum event risk has passed. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a busy couple of hours, what with the European Central Bank and the collapse of BHS. And of course Opec. On the outcome of the oil producers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 meeting, chief market analyst at FXTM Jameel Ahmad said: There was never a chance that Opec would cut production today, meaning there are no real surprises from the outcome of this meeting resulting in OPEC failing to reach an output deal. While the oil markets are finding themselves under pressure and encountering selling momentum as a result of the announcement, it is important to point out that the oil markets have been meeting sellers around $50 now for the past fortnight and this is currently seen as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153top\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the commodity. To put it quite simply, there was very little need for Opec to change their strategy today and it is important to point out that the price of oil has rebounded substantially since the milestone lows below $30 at the beginning of 2016. There are also reports that major institutions such as Opec and the IEA are expecting a dramatic decline in global inventories over the second half of 2016, which would be very supportive and positive to the chances of a further comeback in the price of oil for the remainder of the year. Ranko Berich, Head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe, agrees that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ECB press conference wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a hummdinger: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Very little was added to the mix during today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference apart from a start date for corporate bond purchases*. The bottom line is that the outlook for inflation remains grim, but the ECB is not likely to act until it has no other choice, due to vague hopes of energy prices propping up inflation in the near future. * - that start date is June 8th Elsewhere in Vienna, the news that oil producers have not agreed on a ceiling on output ( not exactly a big surprise) has sent crude prices lower. But Opec members are putting a brave face on it, and Saudi Arabia has said it is open to a policy change at the end of the year. And as expected the group did elect Nigeria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mohammed Barkindo as the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s secretary general. The sad collapse of BHS this afternoon mean there will be even more pressure on its former owner, Sir Phillip Green, when he testifies to parliament later this month. MPs will surely ask Green about the dividends paid to his family during the good times, and the deficit in the BHS pension fund. Dominic Chapell, who bought BHS for a pound, is also going to face some stern questions. Jon Copestake, chief retail &amp; consumer goods analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, explains: Many employees facing the loss of livelihood will no doubt be paying close attention to the scheduled appearances of Dominic Chapell and Sir Philip Green before the work and pensions committee over the next two weeks. The question of how company executives were able to extract so much money from the retailer during its 16 year drift into liquidation will no doubt be high on the agenda, especially since the failure of a retail brand like BHS has been something that any visitor to its half empty stores in recent years might have made an educated guess at. BHS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure comes just two days after Austin Reed went under, Copestake adds: For those looking for a silver lining respite will be scant. BHS and Austin Reed had a combined high street presence of over 280 stores, with closures likely to make a tangible impression on some high streets. As with all fire sales, the best assets will no doubt be picked up cheaply and resurrected by more successful retailers, which will make some dent in the job losses, but many will not as the British High Street continues to undergo a painful correction to accommodate changing shopper habits. That wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the most dramatic press conference in the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history, so what did we learn? Mario Draghi has joined the ranks of global policymakers warning against Brexit. The ECB president singled out this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum as a clear \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdownside risk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to growth. Draghi also acknowledged that Brexit is a possibility. He argued that Britain and the EU are both better together: The ECB has a view that the UK should remain in the European Union, because the European Union would benefit from its presence. And we believe the UK would benefit from being in the European Union too. But also revealed that the ECB is planning for all eventualities, without giving details of its emergency plan. The eurozone economy is still weak. The ECB revised up its forecast for Eurozone growth this year, from 1.4% to 1.6%, but revised down its 2018 forecast. Draghi said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Inflation rates are likely to remain very low or negative in the next few months before picking up in the second half of 2016 ... Supported by our monetary policy measures and the expected economic recovery inflation rates should recover further in 2017 and 2018.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But the ECB has barely tweaked its inflation forecasts -only raising 2016\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecast from 0.1% to 0.2%. Insignificant, really. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no help for Greece, yet. The Athens stock market has dipped, after Draghi said the ECB wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready to start accepting Greek bonds as collateral. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reminder that Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout woes aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t over. Draghi says the ECB can do more. His statement began with the traditional pledge to keep doing whatever is needed to maintain price stability. He also hinted that the QE bond-buying scheme could be extended beyond March 2017, if needed. Bad news in the UK retail sector. Attempts to find a buyer for BHS, the department store, have failed. The administrators who have been running the company for the last month have just called in liquidators. Around 11,000 jobs are now at serious risk, and redundancies could start today. My colleague Graham Ruddick has the details: And finally.... Q: What structural reforms does the ECB most want to see implemented by eurozone governments? Draghi won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be lured into telling European leaders what to do. National governments know what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most important on their own patch, he smiles. But he does highlight the important of labour market reforms - a major issue in his home country, Italy. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the end of the ECB press conference. Q: Given Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s persistently weak inflation rate, should the ECB alter its target (currently 2%) to something more achievable? Dreadful idea, Draghi insists. That would seriously undermine the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credibility, raising the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrisk premium\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on eurozone assets, driving real interest rates higher, and ultimately making it harder to ensure price stability. So he opposes raising, or lowering the inflation goal. Tom Fairless of the Wall Street Journal then puts Draghi on the spot, asking: Q: Would the ECB would really halt its QE programme next March, given it expects inflation to be just 1.6% in 2018? Draghi says the ECB would not hesitate to act, if needed, to drive inflation up. We can adjust the program in a way that could meet the desired size. We are willing and ready to do so. Back at the ECB meeting, Draghi is asked about speculation that the decision to abolish the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac500 note is part of a secret plot to get rid of cash. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s simply not true, the ECB president insists. We are printing more \u00e2\u201a\u00ac200 notes, to make up for the end of the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac500 one. More drama in Vienna! The Opec meeting of oil ministers has broken up, without a deal on production caps. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a great surprise, given Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opposition to the supply curbs which some countries, including Saudi, had apparently been pushing for. But it has knocked the oil price down by around 1%. Another question: Is Mario Draghi worried about the impact on savers from record low interest rates? Draghi agrees that this is a concern in several countries, not just Germany (where savers are particularly irked). But he insists that loose monetary policy is essential now, to help the eurozone economy back to health. He adds: For interest rates to be higher tomorrow, they must be low today. The markets aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happy that the ECB hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t welcomed Greek bonds back to the fold today: Mario Draghi then declares that the European Central Bank believes Britain should stay in the European Union. Asked about the June 23 referendum (which he called a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdownside risk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122) Draghi tells the press conference in Vienna that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The ECB is ready for any outcome.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He argues that a victory for the Remain campaign would be in the best interests of Britain, and Europe. Draghi says: Of course... the UK and Europe and the eurozone are mutually beneficial. The ECB has a view that the UK should remain in the European Union, because the European Union would benefit from its presence. And we believe the UK would benefit from being in the European Union too. He concludes: The ECB is ready for all contingencies. Q: Why has the ECB not reinstated the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwaiver\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on Greek bonds, allowing them to be used for its programmes? Draghi says the governing council discussed the issue, and acknowledges the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsignificant progress\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 which Greece has made recently with its lenders. However, he points out that Athens still has a few \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcprior actions\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to take, before it fully satisfies its creditors. Once the prior actions are implemented in Greece, the Governing Council will discuss the reinstatement of the waiver, Draghi promises. Onto questions... Q: Why are the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts not more optimistic, given the stimulus measures it has taken? Draghi says the ECB needs to see the impact of the measures it drew up in March. But he insists that its policies have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153made a lot of difference\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and been very effective. Mario Draghi ends his statement with his traditional call for eurozone governments to implement structural reforms. He singles out the EC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Juncker Plan\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, saying this spending plan needs to be boosted. The ECB has only made small adjustments to its inflation forecasts, dashing hopes that price inflation could get close to the 2% target by the end of 2018. Mario Draghi then warns that the risks to the global economy are to the downside. And he cites this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s British referendum as one downside risk, along with other geopolitical risks. Draghi also warns that eurozone inflation is likely to remain very low, or negative, for some time. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently minus 0.1%. Draghi says the ECB has revised its growth forecast for 2016 to +1.6%, from +1.4% before. However, it has left its forecasts for the next two years unchanged. Mario Draghi starts his press conference by confirming that the governing council left borrowing costs at record lows. They will stay at their current levels, or lower, for an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcextended period\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. And he confirms that the ECB will continue to run its QE bond-buying scheme until March 2017, or until inflation is returning back to target. Draghi also explains that the ECB will start buying debt issued by companies on 8 June, as part of the stimulus programme announced back in March. He says the economic recovery is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgradually\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 proceeding, but warns that vigilance is needed to prevent low inflation becoming entrenched. So the governing council will use \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcall instruments\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 at its disposal to achieve its objectives. Draghi is early! You can watch the press conference here. Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, is about to hold a press conference in Vienna, after leaving interest rates at record lows. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what investors and commentators will be watching for: Is Draghi more optimistic about the economy? The eurozone growth figures for the first quarter of 2016 were better than expected, and inflation is close to turning positive again. The ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new economic forecasts. Economists will have created new projections for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting; could they show inflation rising faster than expected? Is it about to help Greece? Athens is hoping that ECB could reinstall the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwaiver\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on Greek bonds, which would allow them to be used as collateral for its liquidity operations soon. A tiny gobbet of US economic news, while we wait for the ECB press conference. US private sector companies created 173,000 new jobs in May, which (remarkably) is exactly what Wall Street had expected. Yes, economists got a forecast right. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from 166k last month (which has been revised up from 155k). It suggests tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US Non-Farm Payroll (the main measure of the jobs market) won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a shock. Breaking: The European Central Bank has left eurozone interest rates unchanged at their current record lows. So... The headline interest rate remains at 0.00% The deposit rate (on bank deposits left at the ECB) stays at -0.4% The marginal lending facility (paid by banks to borrow from the ECB) stays at +0.25% The ECB also reveals that it will start buying corporate bonds on June 8, under its latest stimulus plan. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get more details after Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference, which starts in 45 minutes. Here comes the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy decision...... Reporting from OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting is more dangerous than I thought. Footage has just emerged of a cameraman in Vienna clattering into a glass door, while trying to film Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bijan Namdar Zangeneh. Update: The intrepid cameraman was Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rae Hurring, who we hope isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t damaged. Bond trading giant Pimco has now issued its new Global Outlook report. It warns that the world economy is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Stable But Not Secure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and sees growing dangers as monetary policy reaches its limits. Pimco cites some familiar themes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c persistently low inflation, high debt levels, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowing economy and the problems in the eurozone. And it fears those problems could get steadily worse... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key points: In the absence of structural reforms, we are approaching the limits of central bank policy. Increasingly experimental policy is creating greater uncertainty and stretching valuations. Unsustainable debt levels mean that long-term risks of capital impairment or inflation are rising. Political uncertainty is increasing. Greater regulation and related reduced transactional liquidity are enhancing local market volatility. More here. European stock markets have crept up this morning, as investors watch for developments in Vienna. The FTSE 100 is up 27 points, or almost half a percent. That ends a two-day losing streak, and means the index is almost flat for 2016 again. Nick Fletcher\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market report has full details of what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up and down: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the situation across Europe: Back in the UK, investment management firm Pimco has predicted that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a decent chance Britain will vote to leave the EU later this month. Reuters has the details: PIMCO managing director Mike Amey put the likelihood of Britain voting to stay in the EU at about 60 percent. Bookmakers price the chance of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Remain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd vote higher, at about 80 percent, while opinion polls suggest the two sides are evenly split. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pretty significant chance that we leave,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Amey told reporters. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It would be a significant event for the UK, but it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a globally systemic event. It wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t derail the global economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t chime with the OECD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view; yesterday, the Paris-based group argued that Brexit would be as serious as China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy suffering a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard-lining\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Sebastien Marlier, senior commodities editor at the Economist Intelligence Unit, agrees that little is expected from today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s OPEC meeting: It comes so soon after the failed Doha meeting, as OPEC countries seem increasingly divided and as supply disruptions have already done much to lift prices. But despite that, there are three key issues to watch: The new Saudi energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, for any clues on changes in Saudi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil policy. On that front we expect broad continuity. Although he may attempt to strike a conciliatory tone, Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focus on market share and on sustaining high output is unlikely to change given the return to the market of its regional competitor, Iran, and the planned Aramco IPO in 2017. Tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which have been the main culprits of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153freeze\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd fiasco. Ongoing disagreements suggest that an agreement on production quotas is unlikely just yet. The fragile five (Nigeria, Venezuela, Libya, Algeria, Iraq) for clues about their desperate financial situation and production prospects. Mystery of missing shoe solved!! It belonged to Leslie Hayward, the managing editor of @EnergyFuse. She parted company with a rather fetching pump in the mass scrum to get into the OPEC meeting room. We recommend hefty walking boots on these occasions -- great for slowing down one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rivals.... This chart shows how the Brent crude oil price has risen steadily since January, when it hit just $28 per barrel. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting comes two months after Opec failed to get any deal on production cuts at an emergency meeting in Doha. The oil price has actually risen by over 10% since then, as production cuts by non-Opec members have eliminated the supply glut. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why its hard to see a deal to curb production today. With oil at $50 per barrel, ministers must be tempted to sit tight and hope prices rise on their own. Also, getting Iran to accept production curbs is clearly a non-starter. Tehran is still celebrating the end of international sanctions on oil production, so is obviously reluctant to reimpose them itself. Journalists in Vienna are being offered a hearty array of biscuits and crisps to keep them on the go: No more word on the missing shoe, though.... The Financial Times reckons Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is changing its strategy, after telling reporters that Opec should \u00e2\u20ac\u0153steward the market\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd [see earlier post]. Their correspondents Anjli Raval and David Sheppard write: Khalid Al Falih, speaking at the Opec secretariat prior to the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s twice-yearly meeting, said the group should \u00e2\u20ac\u0153encourage the rebalancing to take place\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and said the kingdom wanted to avoid any oil shocks, dampening fears Saudi Arabia is preparing to raise production significantly. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whatever action we take will be taking into consideration that the market is doing quite well by itself, so we will be very gentle in our approach,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Mr Al Falih. Saudi Arabia is expected to propose reinstating the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s production ceiling, which was removed entirely at the December gathering of ministers. The OPEC meeting began with a warning that the global economy remains weak. Dr. Mohammed Bin Saleh Al-Sada, Qatar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Minister of Energy and Industry, told delegates that: With regard to global economic growth, the story remains somewhat patchy. While the estimated 2016 growth of 3.1 per cent is higher than that of 2015, it has been revised down slightly since our December meeting. World oil demand this year remains healthy, with growth of over 1.2 million barrels per day. The majority of this will come from non-OECD countries, but OECD countries are also expected to see some growth in every quarter this year. Al Sada also pointed out that non-OPEC members are cutting their production, in response to the tumble in the oil price last year: From the supply perspective, in the first half of this year, we have seen a further downward revision to the 2016 outlook for non-OPEC supply. We now anticipate a contraction of 740,000 barrels per day this year. This is more than 2 million barrels per day lower than the growth of 2015. This trend stems mainly from reduced cashflows, investment cutbacks and the deferral or cancellation of projects. Al Sada says this suggests that the oil market is balancing (as Saudi minister Khalid al-Falih also said). But he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also concerned that stocks levels are still high - and hints that production targets should be considered. The five-year average for OECD commercial stocks is currently at a surplus of around 360 million barrels. It is important that we take note of this figure on a downward trend. A more stable and balanced market will be beneficial to all. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full statement: Opening address to the 169th Meeting of the OPEC Conference Alex Schindelar, news editor at Energy Intelligence Group, reckons few OPEC ministers will push for production curbs in Vienna. Energy analyst Joe McMonigle is tweeting from the Opec meeting. He doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see any signs of a production cap today: OPEC have now cleared the room of journalists, after allowing them to poke dictaphones under ministerial noses in the hope of a juicy quote. At least one reporter is hobbling around.... The United Arab Emirates has put its finger on OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fundamental problem.... Algeria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s representative has suggested that Opec might agree quotas for each country, rather than a flat cap. Angola\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil minister told reporters that there is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a possibility\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of setting an oil output ceiling today. Jose Botelho de Vasconcelos added that the prospect of $60 per barrel oil is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not bad\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but $80/barrel \u00e2\u20ac\u0153would be better\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Better for Opec, but not for consumers and oil importers, of course. The OPEC meeting is underway! And there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flurry of action in Vienna as energy correspondents try to grab a word with energy ministers. Saudi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new oil minister, Khalid al-Falih, says the market is rebalancing, and the oil price will respond to that. He argues that the market is not currently over-supplied, but there are inventories that need to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153absorbed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. OPEC should help that rebalancing process to continue, to help create long-term stability, he adds. The oil price has just broken through the $50 mark, as the OPEC meeting gets underway. Brent crude is up 0.8% at $50.12 per barrel, a one-week high. However, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because investors are expecting a production cap to be agreed today, given Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opposition.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some good news for the ECB to savour over their morning coffee -- Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment total has hit a six-year low. The jobless total dropped by almost 120,000 in May, the biggest monthly fall in almost two years. That takes the number of people out of work to below four million. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a relief for Madrid, but it still leaves Spain with the second worst unemployment rate (after Greece) at around 20%. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tight security in Austria today as OPEC oil ministers arrive: Fortunately, the two meetings won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t clash too badly. CET is one hour ahead of BST. The ECB will announce its decision on interest rates at 1.45pm local time (12.45pm UK), and then hold a press conference from 2.30-3.30pm (or 1.30-2.30pm UK time) Iran has slapped down the idea that OPEC could agree production limits at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. The Iranian minister, Bijan Zanganeh, said a cap wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t benefit Iran - or other cartel members either. Zanganeh told reporters in Vienna that: One of our main ideas is to have country quotas, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think we can reach an agreement on this subject at this meeting. The OPEC oil ministers will have to take one decision in Vienna today - electing a new secretary general. Our energy editor, Terry Macalister, explains: Mohammed Barkindo, a former boss of Nigeria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national oil company, is in pole position to be installed as front man for the oil cartel, whose lack of internal unity leaves it unable to take decisive action. But otherwise, little firm action is expected, as the oil price has recently risen back to $50 per barrel. The laissez-faire consensus more likely to prevail was outlined by Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazrouei, the energy minister for the United Arab Emirates, who said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Supply and demand are working and this is the element of this (Opec) policy. From the beginning of the year until now, the market has been correcting itself upward. This is the year of correction.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Vienna is often dubbed the cultural capital of Europe, thanks to the influence of Strauss, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert et al. But today it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the financial news capital of Europe too. The European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governing council has decamped from Frankfurt to Austria, for its latest monetary policy meeting. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be setting interest rates, discussing the effectiveness of its latest stimulus package, and then holding a press conference. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not expecting any big announcements, as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only three months since the ECB dramatically slashed rates and announced a series of new measures. Instead, investors want to hear whether those measures are working. The ECB will also issue fresh economic forecasts, which will show if it sees inflation (currently -0.1%) returning to the 2% target. ECB chief Mario Draghi will also field questions about Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt crisis, the banking sector, and perhaps even Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum. 12.45pm BST: ECB interest rate decision 1.30pm BST: ECB press conference Cheap oil has dragged Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate into negative territory. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appropriate that OPEC is also meeting in Vienna for its twice-yearly meeting. This is a chance for the cartel to discuss how to set production levels to their best advantage. Back in the 1970s, OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s members had huge power over the oil sector, so its meetings were Big Events. To be honest, OPEC isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the force it once was \u00e2\u20ac\u201c previous attempts to cap production to drive the oil price have failed, and oil analysts don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect many fireworks today Having said that....there was some chatter last night that OPEC could set some sort of output ceiling, so you never know.... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good news for Austria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tourism sector, anyway. Also coming up..... We find out how many private sector jobs were created in America last month, when the monthly ADP jobs report is released. That will set the tone for tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Non-Farm Payroll After two days of falls, European stock markets are expected to dip this morning as investors watch events in Vienna. And the Bank of England will be unveiling the final design of its first ever plastic note this afternoon. The new \u00c2\u00a35 note will be proudly produced at Blenheim Palace - birthplace of Sir Winston Churchill, who appears on the back of it.",

                "bodyText":"Leading shares are heading higher amid a flurry of service sector data and ahead of the US non farm payroll numbers. Commodity companies are among the leading risers as oil holds firm around $50 a barrel despite Opec deciding not to implement output cuts. BP is 8p better at 361.1p, as it agreed to pay $175m to settle claims by US investors relating to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, removing the last major legal threat from the disaster. Royal Dutch Shell B shares have risen 30.5p to \u00c2\u00a316.96, while among the mining shares Glencore is up 2.45p at 131p and BHP Billiton is 12.7p better at 818.3p.

David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spread Co, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Over the last month it became apparent that the US Federal Reserve was unhappy that the market refused to price in the prospect of a summer rate hike. Consequently, over the past few weeks we saw a confusion of Fed Heads come out to declare that their conditions for monetary tightening were being met. Some were claiming that two, three or even four rate hikes were possible in 2016 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a ludicrous proposition given the few windows available due to the US Presidential Election, let alone the uncertain outlook for the US and global economies.</p> <p>This constant barrage of hawkishness pressed the markets to sharply cut the odds on a summer rate hike. This led to a rally in the dollar together with a nasty and protracted sell-off in precious metals. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all been reversed now thanks to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s payroll release.</p> <p>On Monday evening (17:30BST) Yellen is scheduled to speak about the economic outlook and monetary policy. It will be very interesting to hear what she has to say in the light of the jobs data. We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blame the Fed for weak data. But we can take them to task for their relentless effort to tell the market it was pricing financial assets incorrectly. The US Federal Reserve exerts too much influence over the markets these days and many investors will now believe that the Fed has taken them for a ride. Yellen is going to find it very difficult to winch back credibility for the central bank now. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f174ac4bd4175616f772f2a16f195c55932052c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f174ac4bd4175616f772f2a16f195c55932052c/0_0_3500_2334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yellen hinting at summer rate rises last week at Harvard.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yellen hinting at summer rate rises last week at Harvard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Snyder/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57519acae4b045bc9189e486\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-03T14:59:22.116Z\">3.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/may/27/markets-us-growth-figures-janet-yellen-putin-greece-live\">A week ago</a></strong> Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen was at Harvard suggesting a summer interest rate rise could on the cards.

Not only was May a particularly weak month, the worst in almost six years, but revisions dragged previous months lower. The unemployment rate declined to 4.7% but that is because of a fall in the labour force participation rate: not what we want to see happening. Overall, the job market has added an average of 116,000 jobs/month over the past three months, a substantial slowdown from the 229,000/month averaged in 2015.</p> <p>What is the reason? The Verizon strike certainly weighed on the May numbers, so we can expect a bounce back in June. And as the US approaches full employment, the rate of job creation was always going to slow. This does not seem to be indicative of a broader economic slowdown: in April consumer spending rose by 1%, the largest monthly increase since 2009. </p> <p>The labour market slowdown will make the Federal Reserve reconsider its next move.

Senior economist Alasdair Cavalla said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[The report] does support our assessment that now is still too early for another rise. The main factor slowing down growth in the US is exports, which is precisely where the impact of tightening will fall most heavily in the form of a stronger dollar. Fed officials have explicitly highlighted a potential Brexit as another downside risk likely to stay its hand in June. This comes on top of a still fragile global economic environment. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news suggests there may be more to worry about than thought. A good year economically is thought to favour incumbent governments; the risk of a protectionist and isolationist administration by the end of the year is hardly going to give firms the reassurance they need to hire and invest. In the absence of any meaningful inflationary threat, raising interest rates in such an environment would be incomprehensible.</p> </blockquote> <p>And:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ReutersJamie/status/738719922319183872\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">May 27: Yellen says rate hikes in coming months &quot;appropriate&quot;<br><br>June 3: 38k May payrolls<br><br>June 6: Yellen to repeat &quot;appropriate&quot;?

                "bodyText":"The poor US jobs figures only add to the concerns about the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, which may still be too weak for a rate rise. That is the view expressed by Federal Reserve governor Lael Brainard in a speech in Washington. She said the non-farm payroll numbers suggested that the US labour market had slowed, and added that any rate rise should also wait until it was clearer that China and Europe are doing better, and the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum on EU membership was out of the way. She said: Recognising the data we have on hand for the second quarter is quite mixed and still limited, and there is important near-term uncertainty, there would appear to be an advantage to waiting until developments provide greater confidence. Prudent risk-management would suggest the risks from waiting until the totality of the data provides greater confidence in a rebound in domestic activity, and there is greater certainty regarding the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd vote, seem lower than the risks associated with moving ahead of these developments. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back next week. US energy companies added 9 oil rigs last week, bringing the total rig count up to 325 according to the latest Baker Hughes report. This is only the second time this year the rig count has gone up, and then it was only one rig in the middle of March. It comes as oil hit $50 a barrel despite this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Opec meeting failing to agree an output ceiling. The number of gas rigs fell however, making a total increase of four rigs: The disappointing non-farm payroll numbers gave a shock to investors who were expecting a calm end to the week, sending stock markets sharply lower, hitting the dollar and prompting a spate of bond buying. There was a two way pull between those who saw the job figures as positive, in that they would prevent the US Federal Reserve from raising interest rates this month, and those who worried about the signs of a weak US economy. By the close of trade in Europe, the former had regained some ground and markets recovered from their worst levels. Indeed UK shares, supported by rises in commodity companies as oil held fairly steady during the day, managed to end up in positive territory. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 24.02 points or 0.39% at 6209.63 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.03% to 10,103.26 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.99% at 4421.78 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 1.53% to 17,495.09 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 1.74% lower at 8801.6 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.48% to 648.63 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down just 39 points or 0.23%. Back with the US jobs: Friday rating agency update: S&amp;P said: We expect the new minority government in Ireland to keep pursuing open and proactive economic policies and continue fiscal consolidation. Thanks to rapid nominal GDP growth, we expect net general government debt to decline to below 80% of GDP in 2017. We are therefore affirming our \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcA+/A-1\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sovereign credit ratings on Ireland. The stable outlook balances our view of upside potential for the ratings if Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal position continues to improve against risks associated with external factors such as a potential Brexit, or weaker global demand. Bond prices rose and yields fell as investors looked for havens after the shock US jobs numbers. In the UK, 30 year yields fell to 2.084% after the US data, the lowest level since February 2015. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10 year Bund yield fell to 0.073%, its lowest this year. The poor jobs numbers following various hawkish comments from US Federal Reserve members make chair Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech on Monday evening a potentially tricky affair. David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spread Co, said: Over the last month it became apparent that the US Federal Reserve was unhappy that the market refused to price in the prospect of a summer rate hike. Consequently, over the past few weeks we saw a confusion of Fed Heads come out to declare that their conditions for monetary tightening were being met. Some were claiming that two, three or even four rate hikes were possible in 2016 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a ludicrous proposition given the few windows available due to the US Presidential Election, let alone the uncertain outlook for the US and global economies. This constant barrage of hawkishness pressed the markets to sharply cut the odds on a summer rate hike. This led to a rally in the dollar together with a nasty and protracted sell-off in precious metals. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all been reversed now thanks to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s payroll release. On Monday evening (17:30BST) Yellen is scheduled to speak about the economic outlook and monetary policy. It will be very interesting to hear what she has to say in the light of the jobs data. We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blame the Fed for weak data. But we can take them to task for their relentless effort to tell the market it was pricing financial assets incorrectly. The US Federal Reserve exerts too much influence over the markets these days and many investors will now believe that the Fed has taken them for a ride. Yellen is going to find it very difficult to winch back credibility for the central bank now. A week ago Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen was at Harvard suggesting a summer interest rate rise could on the cards. Now, after the poor jobs figures, maybe not: The disappointing US services sector data which followed quickly on from the poor jobs numbers provides another reason for the Federal Reserve to leave rates unchanged this month, says James Smith at ING Bank: After May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm payrolls plummeted, the ISM Non-manufacturing came crashing back down to 52.9 from 55.7, much lower than expected. Aside from supplier deliveries, the other main components that contribute to the headline recorded fairly sizable falls (employment and business activity), particularly new orders, where the size of the month-on-month drop was the largest since November 2008. This is especially concerning, given that in theory it sets the precedent for (or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153leads\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) future business activity. Although the ISM surveys are perhaps not the most central part of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee reaction function, the magnitude of the fall means that it will probably feature in the debate over near-term policy. Indeed, given that the US recession story has faded away over recent weeks, it is possible that the combination of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak non-farm payrolls figure and the drop in the ISM Non-manufacturing prompts the debate to resurface to some degree over coming weeks. Either way, it is another reason for the FOMC to leave rates unchanged in June, with focus now on Chair Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech on Monday to see how the latest data will affect policy in coming months. Still, US factory orders were more or less in line with expectations: More signs of weakness in the US economy, this time from two surveys of the service sector. First the ISM non-manufacturing PMI fell from 55.7 in April to 52.9, well below the consensus forecast of 55.5. The new orders index at 54.2, down from 59.9, was the lowest since February 2014. And the final reading of the Markit services PMI for May came in at 51.3, down from 52.8 in April. The index is marginally higher that the first estimate of 51.2 for May. Meanwhile the Markit composite index - manufacturing and services - fell from 52.4 in April to 50.9. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chart showing the jobs numbers: And unemployment rate Joey Lake, US analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said: The jobs report was bad, bad, bad: there is no positive spin to it. Not only was May a particularly weak month, the worst in almost six years, but revisions dragged previous months lower. The unemployment rate declined to 4.7% but that is because of a fall in the labour force participation rate: not what we want to see happening. Overall, the job market has added an average of 116,000 jobs/month over the past three months, a substantial slowdown from the 229,000/month averaged in 2015. What is the reason? The Verizon strike certainly weighed on the May numbers, so we can expect a bounce back in June. And as the US approaches full employment, the rate of job creation was always going to slow. This does not seem to be indicative of a broader economic slowdown: in April consumer spending rose by 1%, the largest monthly increase since 2009. The labour market slowdown will make the Federal Reserve reconsider its next move. It reduces the chance of a June rate increase and makes it more likely the Fed will wait until July, after the Brexit vote, which will also reduce the political risk from abroad. More reaction to the disappointing jobs figures. CEBR added its voice to those suggesting a US rate rise in June was now off the table. Senior economist Alasdair Cavalla said: [The report] does support our assessment that now is still too early for another rise. The main factor slowing down growth in the US is exports, which is precisely where the impact of tightening will fall most heavily in the form of a stronger dollar. Fed officials have explicitly highlighted a potential Brexit as another downside risk likely to stay its hand in June. This comes on top of a still fragile global economic environment. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news suggests there may be more to worry about than thought. A good year economically is thought to favour incumbent governments; the risk of a protectionist and isolationist administration by the end of the year is hardly going to give firms the reassurance they need to hire and invest. In the absence of any meaningful inflationary threat, raising interest rates in such an environment would be incomprehensible. And: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a possible explanation for the shock figures: The weaker than expected US jobs numbers have also sent European markets lower. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is now down 0.8% while France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac is 0.78% lower. The FTSE 100 is just managing to stay in positive territory, up 4.5 points. The dollar has fallen to a two week low on the basis that the figures make a June rate rise unlikely now, despite the previous hints to the contrary from various Fed members. The dollar index dropped by more than 1% while the euro rose 1.3% and sterling hit a three day high of 1.4544. Wall Street is down in early trading following those horrible payrolls numbers - the worst in almost six years. Dow Jones: -0.3% at 17,780 S&amp;P 500: -0.2% at 2,101 Nasdaq: -0.3% at 4,958 Investors will be weighing up whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plain bad news (weak employment market) or good bad news (US rate hike delayed because of weak employment market). The biggest increase in jobs was in the healthcare sector, with 46,000 jobs added in May, while employment in professional and business services was up by 10,000. Mining, manufacturing and construction were among the sectors where jobs fell. Economists said a US rate hike in June - previously considered a strong possibility - was now unlikely because of the unexpectedly weak payrolls. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics: The 38,000 increase in non-farm payrolls in May, which is still only 73,000 if we adjust for the 35,000 striking Verizon workers, means that a June rate hike from the Fed is now very unlikely. In addition, the gains in the preceding two months were revised down by a cumulative 59,000. A July hike is still possible, but it would require clear evidence of a rebound in June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s payroll figures (and a UK vote to remain in the European Union). That sound you hear is Fed Chair Janet Yellen furiously re-writing her speech that she is scheduled to give on Monday. James Smith, economist at ING: Over recent weeks, the blocks appeared to have been gradually falling into place for another rate hike from the Fed, but the latest labour report has potentially put a large spanner in the works. In our opinion, this may well put the final nail in the coffin for a June hike, with confirmation of this potentially coming from Chair Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech on Monday. Donald Trump has given his verdict on the shockingly weak payrolls numbers: May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US jobs numbers were always going to be affected by a strike among Verizon workers, but they do not account for such a huge drop in payrolls (to 38k). As Jana Kasperkevic from the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s New York office explains: A strike by 40,000 Verizon workers impacted the numbers, the labor department said, and without the strike the number of jobs added would have been 72,000, which is still less than a half of expect job growth. Looking at the detail of the US jobs numbers, wage growth was in line with expectations at 0.2% in May. The unemployment rate eased to 4.7% from 5% in April, although the drop was partly explained by people who stopped looking for work and were therefore no longer classed as unemployed. From the US Labor Department report: In May, 1.7m persons were marginally attached to the labor force, little changed from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) These individuals were not in the labor force, wanted and were available for work, and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months. They were not counted as unemployed because they had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. Among the marginally attached, there were 538,000 discouraged workers in May, essentially unchanged from a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) Discouraged workers are persons not currently looking for work because they believe no jobs are available for them. Manufacturing payrolls fell by 10,000 after rising by a (downwardly revised) 2,000 a month earlier. US futures dropped after the shock payrolls figures. On the one hand, it makes the prospect of a rate rise at the FOMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s June meeting less likely. But on the other, it suggests the labour market in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy is weaker than assumed. Here is the full story from our US team. This is a huge miss on US jobs, as companies dramatically slowed their hiring in May. Payrolls rose by just 38,000 in May, the slowest rate of growth since September 2010. This should get the member\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate-setting FOMC scratching their heads... Breaking: US non-farm payrolls have come in way below expectations. There were 38,000 jobs added in May, compared with expectations of a 164,000 increase. April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s number has been revised down too - to 123,000 from an earlier estimate of 160,000. More soon.... Earlier, there were some disappointing eurozone retail sales figures. Instead of the expected 0.3% month on month rise in April, sales were flat due to falls in Germany and Belgium in the wake of the Brussels terror attacks. This follows a 0.6% fall in the overall eurozone figure in March. The year on year rise in April was 1.4%, below forecasts of a 1.9% increase. The figures could point to slower GDP growth in the second quarter, analysts believe. The rise in the FTSE 100 today means after a volatile few months, the index is more or less back where it began the year. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, has this take on the markets: Having started the day strong a far better than expected services PMI (at 53.5 against the 52.5 forecast) ensured the FTSE continued to grow this Friday, the UK index rising by nearly 1%. While not quite as enthusiastic as the FTSE, the Eurozone indices nevertheless pushed forth with a near half a percent rise this Friday despite a fairly dismal morning for data. Unsurprisingly the Dow Jones couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite join in with Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rebound this Friday morning, the index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s futures resolute in their flatness ahead of this afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs report. With June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fed meeting less than a fortnight away today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm number is arguably the most important since last December. An update on how the other major markets in Europe are doing: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +0.6% at 10,266 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +0.5% at 4,487 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.03% at 8,955 The FTSE 100 is up 1% or 62 points at 6,248. It is the biggest riser among the major European indices. Investors are no doubt relieved that the UK services PMI did not deliver a nasty shock, but markets are also being boosted by the resilience of oil prices. Brent crude is hovering just above $50 a barrel despite the stalemate at Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Opec meeting in Vienna. In a couple of hours we will have May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-farm payroll report from the US, which always has the potential to move markets. Economists polled by Reuters are expecting payrolls to jump by 164,000, following a 160,000 rise in April. CMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michael Hewson: European markets have got off to a positive start ahead of this afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s keenly awaited US jobs data. Investors could do with some good news this week given that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen declines every day this week for the FTSE 100, despite the fact that the oil price looks on course for its fourth successive week of gains, with Brent prices looking to gain a foothold above $50 a barrel. It is expected that the US economy will have added 160k new jobs in May, while the unemployment rate is expected to drop to 4.9%. If the jobs number drops sharply to 130k or anywhere near that - quite possible given the Verizon strikes and the slowdown in manufacturing hiring - then any prospect of a move in rates in June, already seen as fairly low could well diminish further. Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JP Morgan, is the latest business leader to issue a dire warning on the potential consequences of Brexit. Addressing the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staff in Bournemouth, alongside the chancellor and remain campaigner George Osborne, Dimon said: I think it would be a terrible deal for the British economy and jobs. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if it means 1,000 jobs [would go at JP Morgan], 2,000 jobs, it could be as many as 4,000 jobs. And they would be jobs all around the UK. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want you to worry about it but when you vote you should be thinking about something like this. Charles Evans, president of the Chicago Federal Reserve has been speaking in London about the possible timing of US interest rate hikes. He said there was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reasonable case\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for delaying rate rises until core inflation reaches the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target. On current forecasts, that wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be until 2018. However, Evans said that as things stood, it was likely the Fed would vote for two rate hikes before the end of 2016, taking borrowing costs to a range between 0.75% and 1%. Speaking at the Global Interdependence Center in London, he said: Frankly, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m really of two minds at the moment, and I expect to take this quandary with me into the next FOMC meeting. On the one hand, under the committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current approach to renormalizing policy, I think it may be appropriate to have two 25 basis point moves between now and the end of the year. I see the value in making small and gradual adjustments to the fed funds rate as the data improve and confirm my positive baseline outlook for the US. And this is my base-case view of appropriate policy. On the other hand, if I think outside of the baseline, I also think that a reasonable case can be made for holding off increasing the funds rate until core inflation actually gets to 2% on a sustainable basis. In other UK news, Sir Philip Green has received more criticism over BHS - the high street retail chain he sold for \u00c2\u00a31 last year that has now collapsed with the loss of 11,000 jobs. Simon Walker, the head of the Institute of Directors accused Green of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lamentable failure of behaviour\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that risked \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deeply damaging\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the British business world as a whole. He told BBC radio 4: Sir Philip Green is a very high-profile business leader. He is the person who is on the front page with Kate Moss on his arm and who has a \u00c2\u00a3100m superyacht and so on. When someone like this ends up behaving like this, people think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how business is, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not. The majority of business leaders are people who are more likely to have mortgaged their homes to keep their company going than to own this kind of lavish thing. Read our full story here. Green will face questions by MPs on 15 June over his role in the demise of BHS. Here is the breakdown of how UK services companies felt their businesses were being affected by the looming possibility of Brexit... Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, Chris Williamson, was not overly cheered by the better-than-expected services PMI number for the UK. He says that taking into account all the data for the second quarter so far, growth is on course to halve between April and June, following 0.4% growth in the first quarter. The PMI surveys show that the pace of economic growth remained subdued in May, as Brexit worries exacerbated existing headwinds. The data so far indicate that the second quarter is likely to see the economy grow by just 0.2%. Growth has collapsed in manufacturing and construction, leaving the economy dependent on the service sector to sustain the upturn, though even here the pace of expansion has remained frustratingly weak so far this year. The detail of the PMI survey showed that UK services sector companies took on workers at the slowest rate in more than three years. The better-than-expected UK services PMI should come as a relief to investors. A weaker number for May would have started to build a more worrying picture of how the UK economy is performing in the second quarter. The big fear is that if Britain votes to leave the EU when it goes to the polls on 23 June, the UK will slide back into recession at a time when the economy is not fully healed following the last crisis. In May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PMI, Markit asked UK services companies an additional question: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Please state the extent to which the issue of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s potential exit from the EU is currently affecting your business.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Of those taking part in the survey, 28% said a potential Brexit was having a detrimental impact on business, while 9% said it was having a strongly detrimental impact. On the flip side, 51% said it was having no significant effect. Breaking: The UK services sector grew at a faster rate than expected in May. The headline index on the Markit/CIPS PMI increased to 53.5 from 52.3 in April. Economists were expecting a smaller rise to 52.5. Anything above 50 indicates expansion. So Italy let the side down on an otherwise positive set of services PMIs for the eurozone. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said combined with the manufacturing surveys published earlier in the week, the latest PMIs suggested the eurozone economy was moving along at a sluggish pace. He suggested the growth of 0.5% achieved in the first quarter would not be sustained into the second: The final PMI numbers for May have come in slightly ahead of the earlier flash readings, but still point a eurozone economy which seems unable to move out of low gear. The survey data are signalling a GDP rise of 0.3% in the second quarter, suggesting the growth spurt seen at the start of the year will prove frustratingly short-lived. The eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services sector expanded at the fastest rate in three months in May, boosted by growth in Germany, France, Spain and Ireland. The headline index measuring activity on the Markit PMI survey edged up to 53.3 last month from 53.1 in April. Employment in the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services industry increased for a nineteenth month, with jobs created at the fastest rate in Germany and Ireland. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services sector fared less well than its neighbours in the single currency bloc, with the headline index pointing to a contraction in activity in May. All major indices are higher this morning after Wall Street closed up last night. Investors are holding their nerve so far. There were no nasty shocks on Thursday from the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting of the governing council in Vienna, where all policy measures were left on hold. Activity in Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services sector grew at an accelerated pace in May according to the Markit PMI survey. The headline index increased to 55.4 from 55.1 in April. It was better than the 53.5 forecast by economists, and will no doubt be a source of relief for investors following weaker manufacturing numbers earlier in the week. Andrew Harker, senior economist at Markit and author of the PMI report, said: Following on from Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing Spain manufacturing PMI numbers, the latest services data are something of a relief, with growth in activity and new business ticking up slightly. The figures provide hope that the sector will be able to successfully weather headwinds such as a weak global environment and domestic political instability and remain in growth territory in the near-term at least. Brent crude oil has edged higher this morning, up 0.3% at $50.2 a barrel. It appears that a stalemate at Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting in Vienna on Thursday - where Tehran refused to support a plan by Riyadh and others to freeze their crude output - has been partially offset by the latest US stockpiles data. US crude stockpiles fell 1.4m barrels last week, reducing supplies for a second week according to the figures from the Energy Information Administration. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all eyes on the service sector this morning as the PMI reports for May are published for the UK and the eurozone. In the UK, the Markit/CIPS report will be closely watched by investors looking for clues on how the wider economy is doing in the second quarter. Economists are predicting the monthly survey will paint a stable picture of the the sector, which accounts for more than three quarters of the UK economy. The headline index is predicted to rise to edge up to 52.5 in May from 52.3 in April, where anything above 50 signals an expansion in activity. If the number comes in below that, investor nerves - already shot in the run up to the EU referendum - are likely to rise. As Michael Hewson chief market analyst at CMC Markets, puts it: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get further colour on whether the UK economy has hit a partially self-inflicted slump brought about by all the hysteria surrounding the upcoming referendum vote. A poor number here could well raise concerns about a potential negative quarter for the UK economy, in the process increasing speculation about a possible rate cut by the Bank of England. What was that about a possible DIY recession? Also coming up..... We will get the eurozone services PMIs, and this afternoon the closely watched non-farm payrolls report will be published in the US. Will the jobs report make the Fed more likely or less likely to raise US interest rates in the near future? We will bring you all the reaction.",

                "bodyText":"Ben Stein, writer, economist, actor and Republican, has seen a lot of elections but none like this. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It has been an extremely strange year,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says the 71-year-old who got his start as a speechwriter for Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. Stein has never voted for a Democrat, but he is appalled by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anti-free trade rhetoric that he says could lead to a trade war. Hillary Clinton probably has a better grasp of things, Stein thinks. Bernie Sanders, on the other hand, is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153willfully ignorant\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have seen a lot of elections and I have never seen anything like this. It seems to me it is a testament to the complete collapse of education that people can have such preposterous policies as an end to free trade and think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to help America. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just startling that: a) the candidates know so little and; b) that the voters have not been better informed about this. The American education system is in a state of freefall collapse so that certainly explains a lot,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. What do you think the economy would look like two years into the presidency of all three remaining presidential candidates? All the candidates are against free trade \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a disastrous mistake. Free trade is one of the main sources of economic growth. Any interference with free trade in the long run produces negative results for the country that imposes the restrictions. One of the great breakthroughs in all of human history has been free trade. When I hear Mr Trump or Mrs Clinton or Mr Sanders talk about how they are going to stop free trade and in some way block America from being part of the world trading system, it makes my blood run cold. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a terrible, terrible prospect. Second, it is very clear, extremely clear, that additional regulation on the economy at this point would be a burden on growth and whichever candidate imposes the most regulation is going to get the least growth. I give credit to Mr Trump, who says he is going to reduce regulation. If Mr Sanders were president, it would be an absolute, total catastrophe. He would regulate the American economy to death. Mrs Clinton, I think, would do a fine job. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry about her in terms of regulation at all. Except that her taxes on the fossil fuel industry are unwarranted and unwise. In terms of tax policy, all of them say they are going to cut taxes on the poor, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fake because the American poor already pay no taxes. Approximately 50% of American wage earners don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay any tax already, so that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fake. In terms of raising tax on the rich, frankly, I think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good idea. The rich in this country are really, really rich. And they can pay more tax. Whether that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be enough to substantially affect the deficit is very, very questionable. I applaud Mr Sanders for wanting to seriously raise rates on the rich. That is something that should happen. If he did it, there would be a lot of yelling and screaming but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the deficit would be affected very much. Mrs Clinton, I think, has a more balanced approach. I think probably a good approach. Mr Trump says he can both reduce taxes and reduce the deficit. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s complete nonsense. What do you think of Trump as a businessman? He is not a great businessman. He inherited a great deal of money. He did some successful real estate deals. Hardly anyone could miss doing successful real estate deals in New York considering the incredible boom that has taken place and the very low base point when he started out. He is not a great businessman at all \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in no way. Let me back up and say, everyone I know says he is an incredibly nice guy. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got to count for something.

The two have nothing to do with each other. Imagine Trump is elected president and he starts enforcing some of the policies he has mentioned. Would the economy improve, stay the same or get worse? It would get much worse. In terms, it would be a disaster. Trade is very important. The US economy is roughly 15% trade dependent \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very roughly 15%. The question of the day: would his gains in fossil fuel deregulation offset the losses in trade? I doubt it. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very, very important that he get educated about the benefits of free trade. What does his popularity with working-class Americans mean? What do the regular folks feel about the economy? I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the regular folks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c of course, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know that many regular folks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the regular folks know much about the economy or about how trade works.

                "body":"<p>Britain is trapped in its own little Brexit bubble. For the next two and a half weeks, the country will be obsessed with the result of the referendum on 23 June. Nothing that is going on in the rest of the world will get much of a look-in.</p> <p>But beyond these shores, things <em>are</em> happening. The authorities in China are desperately trying to shore up growth. Eurozone finance ministers have all but guaranteed that, sooner or later, the Greek crisis will flare up again. Most pressingly, the US economy looks to be heading for serious trouble.</p> <p>Make no mistake, the <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm\" title=\"\">jobs report issued in Washington on Friday</a> was a shocker. Wall Street had been expecting the non-farm payroll \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the benchmark for the strength of the US labour market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to increase by 164,000. The actual figure was 38,000, the smallest monthly increase since September 2010. True, the total was slightly distorted because 35,000 striking workers at Verizon were counted as jobless because they were not being paid. But that still would have meant an NFP increase of just 73,000.</p> <p>The weak jobs report comes at a particularly sensitive time because America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank, the Federal Reserve, has been softening the markets up for an increase in interest rates, either this month or next. Any such move is now out of the question. US borrowing costs will not be going up again until the autumn at the earliest.</p> <p>This is all rather chastening for the Fed. When it raised interest rates in December for the first time since the Great Recession, the central bank signalled that there would be four more increases during the course of 2016.</p> <p>Financial markets subsequently went into freefall during the early weeks of the year, forcing the Fed into a crash rethink. In March, it indicated that the number of 2016 rate increases had been halved from four to two \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but the guidance was promptly ignored by traders, who based their decisions on the assumption that there would be no further tightening of policy by the Fed until 2017.</p> <p>With its reputation at stake, the Fed has gone out of its way since March to convince the markets that it was serious about two rate rises in 2016. Really, really it was. Janet Yellen, the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chair, told Wall Street that it might be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153confused\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about the way the central bank was going about its business.</p> <p>Yet if anyone is confused it is Yellen, not the markets, which have rightly calculated that the Fed is all talk and should be judged by what it does and not by what it says.</p> <p>Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the position. <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-idUSKCN0YI1JQ\" title=\"\">The US economy grew at an annualised rate of 0.8% in the first quarter of 2016</a>, which was not just weaker than the UK but substantially worse than the eurozone. Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s May payrolls were not a one-off, since the totals for March and April were revised downwards by a combined 59,000.</p> <p>Even what looked like good news \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a drop in the unemployment rate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was caused by discouraged workers giving up hope of finding a job. Growth will pick up a bit in the second quarter on the back of stronger consumer spending, but not by all that much.</p> <p>In the circumstances, it beggars belief that the Fed will raise rates in the next couple of months. If Yellen continues to talk tough, the markets will throw a tantrum, and that will be enough to tip an already feeble economy over the edge into recession. Share prices will plummet, the oil price will head back towards $30 a barrel. It will be like early 2016, only worse.</p> <p>So all the Fed can do is respond to the data by toning down the rhetoric. That will be embarrassing. It will mean eating humble pie. It will further damage the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credibility. But it has no choice.</p> <h2>The writing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on the wall for Opec \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and Riyadh knows it</h2> <p>No one got in much of a lather about the failure of Opec to agree anything meaningful at the ministerial meeting in Vienna last week. In fact, the only announcement the oil cartel had to make was that they had picked a new (Nigerian) secretary general.</p> <p>Why the calm? One, because the oil price is drifting upwards again anyway; two, because everyone has become used to Opec agreeing nothing; and three, because the world of black gold is increasingly losing its glitter.</p> <p>No one has yet found a way to fly commercial planes without aviation fuel from hydrocarbons, road transport still relies on petrol, and power stations still produce electricity from gas.</p> <p>But the writing is on the wall for those at Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gatherings and the oil industry around them. Global governmental action to counter climate change, plus the fast development of electric vehicles and storage systems, will crush the oil industry.

                "bodyText":"Britain is trapped in its own little Brexit bubble. For the next two and a half weeks, the country will be obsessed with the result of the referendum on 23 June. Nothing that is going on in the rest of the world will get much of a look-in. But beyond these shores, things are happening. The authorities in China are desperately trying to shore up growth. Eurozone finance ministers have all but guaranteed that, sooner or later, the Greek crisis will flare up again. Most pressingly, the US economy looks to be heading for serious trouble. Make no mistake, the jobs report issued in Washington on Friday was a shocker. Wall Street had been expecting the non-farm payroll \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the benchmark for the strength of the US labour market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to increase by 164,000. The actual figure was 38,000, the smallest monthly increase since September 2010. True, the total was slightly distorted because 35,000 striking workers at Verizon were counted as jobless because they were not being paid. But that still would have meant an NFP increase of just 73,000. The weak jobs report comes at a particularly sensitive time because America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank, the Federal Reserve, has been softening the markets up for an increase in interest rates, either this month or next. Any such move is now out of the question. US borrowing costs will not be going up again until the autumn at the earliest. This is all rather chastening for the Fed. When it raised interest rates in December for the first time since the Great Recession, the central bank signalled that there would be four more increases during the course of 2016. Financial markets subsequently went into freefall during the early weeks of the year, forcing the Fed into a crash rethink. In March, it indicated that the number of 2016 rate increases had been halved from four to two \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but the guidance was promptly ignored by traders, who based their decisions on the assumption that there would be no further tightening of policy by the Fed until 2017. With its reputation at stake, the Fed has gone out of its way since March to convince the markets that it was serious about two rate rises in 2016. Really, really it was. Janet Yellen, the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chair, told Wall Street that it might be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153confused\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about the way the central bank was going about its business. Yet if anyone is confused it is Yellen, not the markets, which have rightly calculated that the Fed is all talk and should be judged by what it does and not by what it says. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the position. The US economy grew at an annualised rate of 0.8% in the first quarter of 2016, which was not just weaker than the UK but substantially worse than the eurozone. Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s May payrolls were not a one-off, since the totals for March and April were revised downwards by a combined 59,000. Even what looked like good news \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a drop in the unemployment rate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was caused by discouraged workers giving up hope of finding a job. Growth will pick up a bit in the second quarter on the back of stronger consumer spending, but not by all that much. In the circumstances, it beggars belief that the Fed will raise rates in the next couple of months. If Yellen continues to talk tough, the markets will throw a tantrum, and that will be enough to tip an already feeble economy over the edge into recession. Share prices will plummet, the oil price will head back towards $30 a barrel. It will be like early 2016, only worse. So all the Fed can do is respond to the data by toning down the rhetoric. That will be embarrassing. It will mean eating humble pie. It will further damage the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credibility. But it has no choice. The writing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on the wall for Opec \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and Riyadh knows it No one got in much of a lather about the failure of Opec to agree anything meaningful at the ministerial meeting in Vienna last week. In fact, the only announcement the oil cartel had to make was that they had picked a new (Nigerian) secretary general. Why the calm? One, because the oil price is drifting upwards again anyway; two, because everyone has become used to Opec agreeing nothing; and three, because the world of black gold is increasingly losing its glitter. No one has yet found a way to fly commercial planes without aviation fuel from hydrocarbons, road transport still relies on petrol, and power stations still produce electricity from gas. But the writing is on the wall for those at Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gatherings and the oil industry around them. Global governmental action to counter climate change, plus the fast development of electric vehicles and storage systems, will crush the oil industry. The question is not if but when, and the decline is likely to be faster than many imagine. Oil-rich Saudi Arabia knows this. It has announced plans to dilute its holdings in the state oil company, move its economy away from petroleum dependency and put its cash in other activities, including low-carbon ones. The Saudis are investing in solar, in carbon capture and in tech companies. Last week, the Saudi sovereign wealth fund put $3.5bn into ride-sharing business Uber. The oil companies, led by Total, have been buying stakes in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153green\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd businesses, such as windfarms, and battery and storage firms like Saft. Meanwhile, traditional car manufacturers are making similar moves. Toyota has also invested in Uber, while Volkswagen has purchased a stake in a similar business, Gett. General Motors and BMW have also bought into ride-sharing services \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Lyft and Scoop, respectively. Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk reckons his new line of electric storage systems will sell as fast as his Tesla electric vehicles (EVs). The message for the future is: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think Opec, think EV.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The UK is content to avoid doing much about tax On Friday, police searched the Spanish HQ of Santander for evidence of its customers hiding their money in HSBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Swiss private bank.

                "bodyText":"A big pick-up in high skilled jobs helped Yorkshire and the Humber record the fastest employment growth in the UK last year, according to a report that will be a welcome boost to George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153northern powerhouse\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd agenda. Analysis of official figures by economists at NatWest found Yorkshire and the Humber enjoyed employment growth of 3.7% last year, almost twice the UK rate of 2%. That helped make up for some of the post-crisis slump in the region and meant there were now 5% more jobs there compared with the start of the global financial crash in 2008. The strongest employment recovery over 2008 to 2015 was in London, followed by the east of England. Yorkshire and the Humber was in third place, NatWest said in its latest regional economic tracker. The bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s senior economist Sebastian Burnside highlighted the promising nature of the jobs growth in the region. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Behind this success is a 6.2% surge in high-skilled jobs over the last year, more than offsetting a small fall in low skilled employment. As the labour market changes and technology becomes ever more important it is reassuring to see the region continuing to generate high quality jobs and benefit from the higher wages they tend to attract,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. For the UK as a whole, there had been a 12.5% increase in highly skilled jobs such as doctors and nurses, lawyers, accountants, teachers, managers and directors since 2008, the report found. Over the same period there had been a small drop in the number of people employed in low-skilled jobs, including retail assistants, cleaners and call centre staff. Burnside said the pattern of employment growth reflected the rise of technology in workplaces. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greater use of technology is improving the efficiency of many retail operations, the replacement of check-out staff with automated tills is one of the most visible ways this is happening and has contributed to the number of people employed as cashiers falling by over 70,000 since 2008,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. The chancellor will be cheered by signs in this report that some of those lost low-skilled jobs are being replaced with higher skilled roles, particularly in parts of what he has dubbed a northern powerhouse. A report last week criticised the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s northern plans for placing too little focus on improving the performance of individual cities. The Centre for Cities thinktank said Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s push to bridge the economic gap between the wealthier south and the poorer north was too heavily focused on intercity transport links. While ministers and local authorities will welcome this new report on high-skilled jobs growth in region, such analyses reveal little about how individuals fare when their roles are replaced by technology. As such, the NatWest figures are unlikely to dim calls from trade unions for better training and adult education to help workers adjust to changing employer needs. But Burnside said the growth in skilled jobs still provided some encouragement that in the labour market battle between man and machine, the humans could win out as demand in new areas of the economy creates new opportunities. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This longer view is encouraging ... It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another example of just how incredibly flexible the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market is,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said.

Perhaps not even this year, some believe.</strong> Christopher Vecchio, currency analyst at DailyFX, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The May US labor market was the exact type of jobs report that could that could upend Federal Reserve policymakers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hopes of raising rates in June. Remember in January when the Federal Open Market Committee was suggesting it was still going to raise rates four times this year? That was an odd notion then, and it outright laughable now.</p> <p>Before Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labor market report, the Fed funds futures contract was implying around a 22% chance of a rate hike in June. Today, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pricing just 4%.</p> <p>Markets have quickly scaled back expectations of any further tightening this year, with the only rate hike projected to come in December (58.5% chance). Still, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unconvincing, considering that the Fed has never raised rates unless the Fed funds futures contract has implied at least a 60% chance of hiking rates in the front month. Markets themselves aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fully convinced that another hike is coming this year.</p> <p>This doubt about further policy normalisation by the Fed in 2016 is well-founded. We continually express our disbelief that the Fed (or the ECB for that matter) would announce a significant change to policy without concurrently releasing new staff projections and letting Fed Chair Janet Yellen hold a press conference to try and soothe markets.</p> <p>In an effort to become more transparent, central banks have become more predictable. Skipping ahead past June, September is the next time the Fed would have a staff projections update and press conference, but it seems highly unlikely that any policy tightening will be done on the doorstep of what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already a vicious US Presidential election.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57558b48e4b0d1779f1e1805\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-06T14:42:04.925Z\">3.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is likely to hint at further rate rises later this year at her speech today, despite last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor US jobs numbers, says Reuters. But an increase this month looks off the table:</p> <blockquote> <p>Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen will likely keep the door open to an interest rate hike within the next few months when she speaks on Monday, while striking a balanced tone about recently disappointing jobs growth and mixed signals in the U.S. economy.</p> <p>Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech to the World Affairs Council of Philadelphia at 12:30 p.m. ET (1630 GMT) will address the economy and monetary policy, and is the last public comment by U.S. central bankers before their June 14-15 meeting. </p> <p>The chances of a rate hike at that meeting were all but killed by a report showing the U.S. economy added only 38,000 jobs in May, muting recently upbeat data on consumer spending and overall growth. A sensitive British vote on European Union membership set for later this month is another reason for the Fed to wait.</p> <p>Economists now see July or September as more likely timing for a quarter-point policy tightening, after the central bank lifted off from near-zero rates in December.</p> </blockquote> <p>The full story is <strong><a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-yellen-idUSKCN0YS142?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=Social\">here.</a></strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-575580a0e4b0d1779f1e17bd\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-06T13:56:31.824Z\">2.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street rises at open</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US markets have joined in the general positive mood for equities, ahead of the speech later from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen.</p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up around 100 points or 0.5% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq both opened in positive territory.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57557bf8e4b0be576f9d9bae\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-06T13:35:20.002Z\">2.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More signs of Leave gaining ground, from spread betting firm IG:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/minefornothing/status/739812080195272705\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">IG SAYS MORE MONEY NOW BEING TRADED ON AN &quot;OUT&quot; VOTE IN UK&#39;S EU REFERENDUM VS &quot;IN&quot; VOTE <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash\">#Brexit</a></p>&mdash; MineForNothing (@minefornothing) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/minefornothing/status/739812080195272705\">June 6, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57557a93e4b052682026580a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-06T13:31:48.922Z\">2.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>It will be a long night for City traders on 23 June, the day of the EU referendum.</strong></p> <p>According to Bloomberg a number of banks, including RBS, JP Morgan, Lloyds Banking Group and Morgan Stanley plan to keep traders in place overnight to monitor market movements as the results unfold.</p> <p>The full story is <strong><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-06/jpmorgan-rbs-said-to-staff-trading-floors-overnight-for-brexit\">here</a></strong>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57557689e4b0be576f9d9b8f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-06T13:14:21.185Z\">2.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Brexit risk justifies US rate patience - Fed's Lockhart</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>For hints at the timing of further US rate rises, all eyes are on a speech later from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen.</p> <p>But ahead of that Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart has urged patience following <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jun/03/markets-await-services-data-for-clues-on-uk-economy-business-live\">Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing US jobs numbers,</a></strong> telling Bloomberg the economy is on track for only moderate growth and Brexit is a risk for the economy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Livesquawk/status/739805047421337600\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Lockhart: Jobs Number, Brexit Justify Patience<br>- On Track For Moderate US Growth</p>&mdash; Livesquawk (@Livesquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Livesquawk/status/739805047421337600\">June 6, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bsurveillance/status/739804898578051072\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AtlantaFed\">@AtlantaFed</a> President Lockhart: Jobs report, Brexit, justify patience.

                "bodyText":"Sterling is little changed after Fed chair Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments that US rates could gradually rise without specifying when that might happen, with investors more preoccupied with the Brexit polls showing the Leave camp in the ascendency. The pound is currently down nearly a cent at $1.4451, while against the euro, the UK currency has weakened slightly again, down 0.49% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.2708. Meanwhile the dollar has lost some of its earlier gains against the yen, now up just 0.4% in the wake of Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. In her comments at Harvard at the end of May, Yellen talked about it being appropriate to raise US interest rates \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in the coming months\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Now she has repeated that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153further gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to be appropriate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but the timescale appears to have gone. Yellen concludes: To summarize, I have explained why I expect the U.S. economy will continue to improve and why I expect that further gradual increases in the federal funds rate will probably be appropriate to best promote the FOMC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goals of maximum employment and price stability. I have also laid out the considerable and unavoidable uncertainties that apply to both this outlook for the economy and to the appropriate path of the federal funds rate. My colleagues and I will make our policy decisions based on what incoming information implies for the economic outlook and the risks to that outlook. What is certain is that monetary policy is not on a preset course, and that the Committee will respond to new data and reassess risks so as to best achieve our goals. She pointed to a number of uncertainties for the global economy, including US domestic demand, the outlook for economies elsewhere and the prospect of Brexit: One development that could shift investor sentiment is the upcoming referendum in the United Kingdom. A U.K. vote to exit the European Union could have significant economic repercussions. Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech is available here, with a live link here. On the poor US jobs figures on Friday, she said: Although this recent labor market report was, on balance, concerning, let me emphasize that one should never attach too much significance to any single monthly report. Other timely indicators from the labor market have been more positive. For example, the number of people filing new claims for unemployment insurance--which can be a good early indicator of changes in labor market conditions--remains quite low, and the public\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perceptions of the health of the labor market, as reported in various consumer surveys, remain positive. That said, the monthly labor market report is an important economic indicator, and so we will need to watch labor market developments carefully. Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen still expects further gradual increases in interest rates, although she said monetary policy would depend on the outlook for the economy: If incoming data are consistent with labor market conditions strengthening and inflation making progress toward our 2 percent objective, as I expect, further gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to be appropriate and most conducive to meeting and maintaining those objectives. However, I will emphasize that monetary policy is not on a preset course and significant shifts in the outlook for the economy would necessitate corresponding shifts in the appropriate path of policy. Janet Yellen is up shortly, speaking to the World Affairs Council of Philadelphia. Despite fears about the consequences of the referendum on whether the UK should leave the EU, equities are holding their nerve, lifted by a strong performance from commodity companies. The FTSE 100, filled as it is with mining businesses, has outperformed other markets as the recent dollar weakness helped support metal prices. The UK index seemed unfazed by volatility in sterling as a number of new polls showed the Leave campaign in the ascendency. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 63.77 points or 1.03% at 6273.40 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax added 0.18% at 10,121.08 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac edged up 0.04% to 4423.38 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB was 0.74% better at 17,625.00 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 0.25% higher at 8823.5 But in Greece, the Athens market slipped 1.47% to 639.11 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 117 points or 0.67%. Commodity companies are supporting stock markets, not least because of the recent weakness in the dollar following Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor US jobs numbers. Oil has also moved sharply higher, with Brent crude now up 1.9% at $50.58 a barrel after output in Nigeria was hit by militant attacks on oil infrastructure. Meanwhile there was a 1m barrel drop last week in inventories at Cushing, the delivery point for US crude, according to information group Genscape. The pound is still lower after the raft of EU referendum polls showing the Leave camp in the ascendency, but the currency has come off its worst levels. Sterling is currently down around a cent against the dollar at $1.4467 having hit $1.4381 earlier. The move is complicated by the US currency being affected by the uncertainty over when (or if) the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this year. Investors are hoping for some clarification from Fed chair Janet Yellen shortly. Meanwhile against the euro, the pound is currently down 0.34% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.2725 having reached \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.2661 earlier. The chance of a June rate hike in the US is much lower now after the poor jobs numbers last week, according to St Louis Fed president James Bullard, but July is still a possibility. In comments to the Wall Street Journal he also said Brexit was not a significant risk for the Fed. Over in Greece, and another deadline apparently looms: So when might the Fed hike rates? Perhaps not even this year, some believe. Christopher Vecchio, currency analyst at DailyFX, said: The May US labor market was the exact type of jobs report that could that could upend Federal Reserve policymakers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hopes of raising rates in June. Remember in January when the Federal Open Market Committee was suggesting it was still going to raise rates four times this year? That was an odd notion then, and it outright laughable now. Before Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labor market report, the Fed funds futures contract was implying around a 22% chance of a rate hike in June. Today, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pricing just 4%. Markets have quickly scaled back expectations of any further tightening this year, with the only rate hike projected to come in December (58.5% chance). Still, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unconvincing, considering that the Fed has never raised rates unless the Fed funds futures contract has implied at least a 60% chance of hiking rates in the front month. Markets themselves aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fully convinced that another hike is coming this year. This doubt about further policy normalisation by the Fed in 2016 is well-founded. We continually express our disbelief that the Fed (or the ECB for that matter) would announce a significant change to policy without concurrently releasing new staff projections and letting Fed Chair Janet Yellen hold a press conference to try and soothe markets. In an effort to become more transparent, central banks have become more predictable. Skipping ahead past June, September is the next time the Fed would have a staff projections update and press conference, but it seems highly unlikely that any policy tightening will be done on the doorstep of what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already a vicious US Presidential election. Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is likely to hint at further rate rises later this year at her speech today, despite last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor US jobs numbers, says Reuters. But an increase this month looks off the table: Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen will likely keep the door open to an interest rate hike within the next few months when she speaks on Monday, while striking a balanced tone about recently disappointing jobs growth and mixed signals in the U.S. economy. Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech to the World Affairs Council of Philadelphia at 12:30 p.m. ET (1630 GMT) will address the economy and monetary policy, and is the last public comment by U.S. central bankers before their June 14-15 meeting. The chances of a rate hike at that meeting were all but killed by a report showing the U.S. economy added only 38,000 jobs in May, muting recently upbeat data on consumer spending and overall growth. A sensitive British vote on European Union membership set for later this month is another reason for the Fed to wait. Economists now see July or September as more likely timing for a quarter-point policy tightening, after the central bank lifted off from near-zero rates in December. The full story is here. US markets have joined in the general positive mood for equities, ahead of the speech later from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up around 100 points or 0.5% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq both opened in positive territory. More signs of Leave gaining ground, from spread betting firm IG: It will be a long night for City traders on 23 June, the day of the EU referendum. According to Bloomberg a number of banks, including RBS, JP Morgan, Lloyds Banking Group and Morgan Stanley plan to keep traders in place overnight to monitor market movements as the results unfold. The full story is here. For hints at the timing of further US rate rises, all eyes are on a speech later from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen. But ahead of that Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart has urged patience following Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointing US jobs numbers, telling Bloomberg the economy is on track for only moderate growth and Brexit is a risk for the economy. The pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s volatility in recent days shows that City traders have been rapidly revising their expectations on this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum. Ulrich Leuchtmann at Commerzbank sums things up (via the FT) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The market has become too comfortable with its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthings will work out all right\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 approach. [It] would be far less prepared for a Brexit outcome than for a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBremain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. That is the reason why these polls receive far more attention and move the market much more than those polls that still see a lead for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBremain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why the cost of insuring against wild swings in the pound over the next month is at its highest levels since the financial crisis: The Telegraph have pulled together a few interesting charts on the Brexit issue (click on the tweet to scroll through them). Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency firm World First, reckons the pound could fall sharply in the next couple of weeks. He says the pressure on sterling has intensified, now that several polls are showing the Leave side in the lead. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sterling and Brexit remain odds; falling together like Icarus on a hot Monday in London. With 3 weeks to go I do not think it is incorrect to say that it is anyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to win; Leave have the momentum and opinion polls are frankly a mess; the differential between online and telephone polling has broken down. Given the level of campaigning, which has been abysmal, it is no surprise that polling is so confused; the electorate is confused and I think polls are showing more of an off-the-cuff-which-way-the-wind-is-blowing-at-this-particular-moment voting intention, not longer held beliefs. In this atmosphere momentum is key; the Remain camp has to get agitated.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It seems to be however that the economy is not what agitates British voters anymore and once someone makes immigration their top voting priority there is little than can shift that, regardless of how much of a monetary hit may be forthcoming.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Although the pound is down, shares in London have actually risen to a one-week high today. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares has jumped by 60 points, or around 1%, to 6268 points. The rally is led by mining stocks, who are benefitting from rising commodity prices today. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the US dollar has fallen against most currencies (but not the pound, obviously), following the disappointing American jobs figures on Friday. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Remain campaign event: University of Kent professor Matthew Goodwin has crunched the latest polling: The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPurdah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 period began on Friday 27 May, meaning the government cannot use the civil service to push the Remain side\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s message. Breaking: ICM have just issued a poll showing that the Leave campaign hold a five-point leave over Remain, at 48% to 43%. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s their regular online poll, which took place after Sky News held two debates last week - one with David Cameron, and one with Leave campaigner Michael Gove. ICM says that the polls appear to have moved: After a fairly tumultuous week in which both Prime Minister and Michael Gove set out their stalls on TV, ICM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weekly tracker and indeed at least two other polls published in the last 24 hours, suggest a move to Leave might have occurred. Our poll today has Leave on 48% (+1), Remain on 43% (-1) with Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Knows still on 9%. This equates to a 53% vs 47% lead for Leave. Our poll somewhat reinforces a Yougov poll this morning which found a 4-point move to Leave, and polls from TNS and Opinium which also gave cause for concern for the Remain camp. All these polls were conducted online, however, and outside of ICM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unexpected leap toward Leave in our phone poll last week, no other evidence has been forthcoming from phone polls that Remain are falling back. If new phone polls do emerge with such an outcome, however, we could be more confident that \u00e2\u20ac\u201c irrespective of where the actual standings are on a poll-by-poll basis \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Leave have pushed on. Turnout levels appear to be surging. Caution is always advised when it comes to polls estimating actual turnout, as polls nearly always overstate it, but the 10/10 certainty figure has nudged up to 71% now, suggesting that the public are now more engaged with the referendum than at any previous point. Buzzfeed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alberto Nardelli explains that this equates to a six-point margin (once don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t knows are removed): The pound had been recovering a little, but this poll has sent sterling reeling back towards its three-week lows. That means it has shed one and a half cents against the US dollar, to $1.4381. David Cameron has been speaking at the Britain Stronger in Europe event. The prime minister had pointed to the economic uncertainty of Brexit, claiming that leaving the EU would \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcput a bomb under our economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Cameron predicted an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153immediate shock effect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from a Leave vote: Almost everyone now agrees, from the Governor of the Bank of England to the IMF, the OECD to the Treasury, 9 in 10 economists to, yes, even some Leave campaigners, there would be an economic shock if we left Europe. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s be clear what that means: The pound falling; prices rising; house prices collapsing; mortgage rates increasing; businesses going bust; and unemployment going up. In other words: a recession. And he also argues that British trade would suffer badly, during years of uncertainty as politicians tried to negotiate an exit from the EU. Think of the impact on BMW, for example. 80 per cent of Minis are exported. Think of the wider impact: fewer businesses, fewer jobs, a smaller economy and less money for our schools and hospitals. Add those things together \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the shock impact, the uncertainty impact, the trade impact \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and you put a bomb under our economy. And the worst thing is we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have lit the fuse ourselves. He was speaking alongside Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Harriet Harman, Lib Dem leader Tim Farron and Green leader Natalie Bennett. Our EU Referendum Live blog has full details: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff means the pound has shed 2% of its value in the last fortnight. Darren Ruane, head of fixed interest at Investec Wealth &amp; Investment, says sterling is suffering the brunt of Brexit uncertainty. Although bookmakers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 odds continue to show a victory for the Remain campaign, any signs that the vote\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s result is closer than previously predicted is likely to affect the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency by the greatest amount relative to other asset classes. Currencies are often good barometers of international investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 confidence in the economic outlook for a country.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The YouGov report also finds that the public don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t trust certain politicians over the EU referendum. David Cameron has particularly poor trust ratings, it appears, with 19% of those polled trusting the PM, and 72% not trusting him. Alexandra Russell-Oliver, analyst at currency firm Caxton FX, reckons this is a factor: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Many Leave campaigners have cited distrust for the Prime Minister as a main reason for backing Brexit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The YouGov results are online here. YouGov has also found that a majority of people back the Leave campaign, even if Brexit hit them in the pocket. Its new poll asked people to imagine that they were \u00c2\u00a3100 per year worse off after a Brexit; 44% of people said they would vote to leave, while 42% would vote to remain. A month ago, this question showed a small majority for Remain. The latest car registration figures suggest that EU uncertainty may be hitting consumer confidence. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) just reported that sales to private customers fell by 3.0% year-on-year in May. Total sales rose by 2.5%, though, thanks to higher demand for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fleet buyers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (such as car rental firms). SMMT CEO Mike Hawes says the market appears to be cooling in the face of the EU referendum. Whether this is the result of some buyers holding off until the current uncertainty is resolved or a sign of a more stable market for new cars remains to be seen.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd YouGov have just confirmed that their latest poll shows a move towards Brexit: Labour MP Stephen Kinnock fears that the political infighting between Conservative politicians is distracting from the serious questions around Brexit. Speaking on Bloomberg TV a moment ago, Kinnock warns there could be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153constitutional crisis\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if the Leave campaign wins, as we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what relationship Britain would seek with the EU. We need a better discussion about what a post-Brexit UK would look like.... What trading arrangements we would have, the relationship with the single market. the two million British people living outside the UK. Kinnock adds that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153leaving the single market would wreck the UK economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and that the steel industry in his Welsh constituency (home of the Port Talbot steel works) would be finished. [Kinnock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s father Neil, incidentally, is a former European Commissioner] But former chancellor Lord Lawson is arguing that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153baloney\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to argue that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade would suffer badly if it left the single market. Most of the world is outside the single market, and most of the world is doing better than the countries in the single market. According to the BBC, some Remain campaigner are considering using their Commons majority to keep Britain inside the EU single market if there is a vote for Brexit. The pound has fallen against every other major currency this morning, following the string of opinion polls showing the Leave side leading the referendum battle. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Garfield Reynolds writes that sterling suffered a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very ugly start\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the week: With less than three weeks to the June 23 referendum, investors have been disconcerted as the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcLeave\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 campaign gains traction. The currency dropped as much as 1.1% to $1.4353 on Monday and was down against all 16 major peers, while one-month volatility surged to 21.34 percent, a level last seen in February 2009. And this chart shows how the pound fell against the US dollar (white line), while sterling volatility spiked (as explained earlier). This chart highlights how the pound has weakened against the euro in the last couple of weeks, hitting a three week low today (the blue line): James Appleyard of risk management group Maplethorpe also expects a lot more sterling volatility: Our rivals at the Daily Telegraph have also helped to send the pound sliding today, analysts say. A survey of almost 19,000 Telegraph subscribers found that 69% are intending to vote for a Brexit at the June 23 referendum. The poll also found that Leave campaigner Boris Johnson is their favoured candidate to succeed David Cameron as prime minister. FXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed says this report has hurt sterling: This was the most shocking survey released so far, and with only 18 days until the referendum the GBP is extremely sensitive to opinion polls. YouGov and TNS online polls didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help either as both revealed that the leave campaign has picked up momentum and now leads over remain voters. Given the Telegraph\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s traditional audience, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perhaps not such a surprise \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but it may have surprised global investors who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a tight grip on UK media habits.... Sterling is likely to experience wild swings in over the next few weeks, in the run-up to the referendum. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at foreign exchange company OANDA, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The polls are likely to make people rather uneasy and we can see that quite clearly today in the pound. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With both sides likely to step up their game over the next couple of weeks, I imagine we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see a lot more volatility in the pound and the closer the polls get, or if \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcVote Leave\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 continues to push ahead, the pound may find itself back towards April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lows before too long.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (via Reuters) The pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early morning slide came as the Remain campaign prepares to accuse the Leave side of trying to con voters about the consequences of Brexit. My colleague Claire Phipps explains: David Cameron might not want to face fellow Conservatives in debates over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future but today he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll issue a statement with politicians usually found on the opposite side of the Commons, teaming up with Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Harriet Harman, Lib Dem leader Tim Farron and Green party leader Natalie Bennett to label the Brexit campaign a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153con-trick\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Together they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll accuse Leave campaigners \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including the prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own party chums Michael Gove and Boris Johnson \u00e2\u20ac\u201c of producing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153contradictory statements\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic future outside the EU, saying the Brexiteers have put forward 23 different positions on the alternative to the single market. Full coverage in our EU Referendum liveblog: And Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade unions are warning that workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rights could be swiftly eroded after a Brexit vote. Our frontpage story explains: In a joint intervention, the general secretaries of Unite, Unison, the GMB and Usdaw were among 10 trade union leaders warning that the Conservatives would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153negotiate away our rights\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if the UK decides to leave. They argued leaving the EU would pose a great threat to maternity and paternity pay and leave, the right to paid leave for holidays and equal treatment for full, part-time and agency workers. Shares in UK housebuilders are under pressure this morning, matching the slide in sterling. Berkeley Group, Persimmon, Barratt Development and Taylor Wimpey are the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 this morning. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Caroline Hyde blames Brexit fears: Some economists believe that the Bank of England could be forced to raise interest rates if Britain votes to leave the EU, to fight a plunge in the pound. That would obviously drive up mortgage costs. Traders are scrambling to protect themselves against the pound plunging after this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum. The cost of insuring against sterling volatility has hit its highest level since the wild days following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. That shows that investors are expecting sterling to move sharply after the result of the EU vote is known. FastFT have the details: One-month implied sterling volatility, or the price of insuring against swings in the pound against the dollar, has jumped to 21.9, the highest since February 2009. It hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t topped 15 in six years. Sue Trinh, head of Asian foreign-exchange strategy at Royal Bank of Canada in Hong Kong, says the EU referendum could easily roil global markets. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcLeave\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 vote would expose a host of uncertainties. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It would be more negative for the euro and the EU since the issue will drag on for other members.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s via Bloomberg: The pound is sliding this morning after a string of opinion polls gave the Brexit campaign a lead in the 23 June EU referendum. Sterling tumbled in early trading, shedding more than 1.5 cents against the US dollar. It has hit a three-week low of $1.4355, down 1.1%. It is also losing ground against other developed currencies. Against the euro, the pound is down 1 eurocent at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.2661. Traders are reacting to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Observer/Opinium poll, which gave the Brexit campaign a three percentage point lead. As my colleague Daniel Boffey reported: The leave campaign has picked up momentum and taken a three-point lead over remain in the latest Observer/Opinium poll on the EU referendum. The Brexiters now stand on 43%, while 40% say they support the campaign to keep the UK in the union. The poll suggests the remain camp has lost four percentage points in the last two weeks, during which Boris Johnson and Michael Gove have relentlessly campaigned on the theme of immigration. And aYouGov poll for ITV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Good Morning Britain has put Leave in front on 45% and Remain on 41%, according to overnight reports. Many analysts have predicted that the pound would tumble if Britain voted to leave the EU, possibly as low as $1.20 against the US dollar. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets confirms that the City is reacting to signs that the Brexit campaign is gaining momentum. The pound looks set to start the week on the back foot as the opinion polls continue to point to an increasingly close contest in the UK referendum as speculation increases about further gains in the polls for the leave camp. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a new bout of jitteriness in the City today, after last Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US employment report missed expectations by a mile. The news that just 38,000 new jobs were created in America last month has sparked fresh worries about the global economy. So there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of interest in a speech from Janet Yellen, head of the US Federal Reserve, later today (5.30pm BST). Could she hint that a June rate rise is less likely? Analysts at RBC predict that Yellen could move the markets: The chance of a July hike dropped from 65% on Friday morning to 32% by Friday afternoon,which seems reasonable, but Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech today could push that back above 50% or closer to zero, so either way, the chance for a US dollar move seems high. Investors are also worrying about Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum, on June 23rd, with the latest polling suggesting the vote is tight. At 9am, we find out how many new cars were sold in the UK in May. A poor number could show that Brexit worries are hitting consumer confidence. In the eurozone.... We get a new healthcheck on Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, with new factory order and construction data this morning. Worryingly, factory orders have fallen by 2% month-on-month. And Italy will also be in focus, after the anti-austerity Five Star Movement took a large lead in the first round of voting for the mayor of Rome.",

                "bodyText":"The 32-year-old billionaire owner of Twinkies has added the Playboy mansion in Los Angeles to his collection. Daren Metropoulos, the son of Greek American billionaire and private equity tycoon C Dean Metropoulos, has bought the infamous home of celebrity pornographer Hugh Hefner for about $200m. He currently lives in a $18m mansion next door and plans join the two properties together to create a 7.3 acre compound. But, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a catch. Metropoulos won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to move into the 29-room Playboy mansion in the exclusive Holmby Hills neighbourhood until its current tenant, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mr Playboy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd dies. Hefner is 90. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We can confirm that the Playboy Mansion is in escrow with Daren Metropoulos as the buyer,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a Playboy Enterprises spokesman told the Guardian. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Due to confidentiality restrictions, we are not able to comment on any specifics, including what contingencies need to be cleared to close the sale.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Metropoulous, whose private equity firm bought Twinkies-owner Hostess Brands in 2013 and previously bought and sold Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR) beer, did not respond to requests for comment.

A-list celebrities are regularly invited into the estate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gates, past the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Playmates at Play\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sign, to extravagant parties where alcohol flows freely and scantily clad women abound.

                "bodyText":"A rebound in clothing sales in May as the warmer weather brought out the summer shoppers has helped lifted previously becalmed retailers. The British Retail Consortium\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest survey has pushed Next up 75p to \u00c2\u00a354.35, while Marks &amp; Spencer is up 2.3p at 365.7p and Burberry is 15p better at \u00c2\u00a310.94. So it is another bright start for the FTSE 100, up 42.40 points at 6315.80 to hit its highest level since the end of April as equities continue to shrug off Brexit fears. After Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s raft of polls showing the Leave side in the ascendency, a couple of new surveys show Remain marginally ahead which has helped a recovery in the pound. Commodity companies are among the main gainers, prompted by dollar weakness following the latest comments from US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen. She said in a speech on Monday that she still expected gradual rate rises but hinted they were not imminent, given Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor US jobs figures. Oil is also holding firm above $50 a barrel, with output problems in Nigeria expected to hit supply. Royal Dutch Shell B shares are leading the way, up 45p at \u00c2\u00a317.57 as it said it expected savings of $4.5bn from the integration of BG, up $1bn from initial estimates. Anglo American has added 2.8p to 689.4p while BHP Billiton is 10.4p better at 896.2p. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: European markets have a clear appetite for risk this morning, as rising energy prices and a dovish Fed outlook help negate any threat from a potential Brexit in 16 days\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time.

The target is looking increasingly out of reach, but the broader ambition remains.<br></p> <p>You might therefore expect that Osborne would jump on these positive trade numbers, as a sign that his Long-Term Economic Plan is Working. But so far nothing.</p> <p>The Treasury says it is a matter for the Business department. But that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t explain the chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s silence on Wednesday, when official figures took everyone by surprise showing that industrial production grew at the fastest rate in almost four years in April.</p> <p>Larry Elliott, the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economics editor, has a theory about why Osborne remains tight-lipped. [Quick clue: EU referendum.]</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2016/jun/08/why-upbeat-uk-manufacturing-figures-have-silenced-osborne-increase-production-eu\">In Larry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s words:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> In normal times, George Osborne would have been all over the good news from the manufacturing sector like a rash. The figures from UK industry were better \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a lot better \u00e2\u20ac\u201c than the City had been expecting and showed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/08/british-industrial-production-grows-fastest-pace-four-years-manufacturing\">fastest month-on-month increase in almost four years</a>.<br></p> <p>So where was the instant statement from the chancellor praising the strength of the economy and the success of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy?

His narrative is that the risk of Britain leaving the European Union has left the economy trembling on the edge of the precipice and for that story to stick he needs signs that consumers and businesses are taking fright at the risk of Brexit.</p> <p>Unfortunately for Osborne, the recent data is not at all helpful.

A cap limiting bonuses to \u00c2\u00a31,000 was scrapped in November \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a first step to reduce the high staff turnover. You can read the full story here. Ryanair is to take on Airbnb \u00e2\u20ac\u201c by launching the Ryanair Rooms service in October, offering everything from 5-star hotel rooms to hostels and spare rooms in private homes. It will add at least two partners to Booking.com, currently its exclusive accommodation partner, Reuters reported. Chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs said: We see this as a natural progression towards Ryanair.com becoming the Amazon of air travel. Catching up on corporate news\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Argos has reported its strongest sales performance in two years as it prepares for its sale to Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, but also revealed it had set aside \u00c2\u00a330m to compensate store card customers who were charged \u00e2\u20ac\u0153excess fees\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on late payments. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a massive amount of money \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at most \u00e2\u20ac\u0153double-digit pounds\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd per customer. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit embarrassing, just before the sale of the business to Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s which is expected to go through in the autumn. George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: Given the pending takeover, the board of Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s will probably be shaking their heads at the news, though in the grander scheme of things the sum involved is not enough to derail the deal. On a brighter note, 4K televisions, computers and tablets sold well in the first quarter; washing machines and gardening equipment didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. You can read the full story here. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown, has a take on the drop in 10-year UK bond yields to a record low. While all eyes have been on the EU referendum campaign, gilt yields have been slipping, fast. The US Federal Reserve is backing away from interest rate rises following wavering employment data, and in Europe the central bank is pumping billions of euros into the bond market every month in the form of quantitative easing, both of which have served to drive yields down. The low yield on government bonds paints a pretty pessimistic picture of the global economy, and suggests we are set for an extended period of low or negative inflation, and weak economic performance. The question though is whether one can really trust an indicator which has been so heavily distorted by central bank stimulus measures. Back at the Brussels Economic Forum, European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici and Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos have both identified Brexit as a potential crisis facing Europe. Moscovici: A year ago we were talking about Grexit, now we are talking about positive integration. There are several crises around... Brexit, hopefully it will be remain but we await that... The jobless claims will be a relief to those investors concerned by last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shockingly weak payroll numbers. The non-farm payrolls showed just 38,000 jobs were added in the US in in May, compared with expectations of a 164,000 increase. It was the slowest rate of growth since September 2010. There were 264,000 jobless claims in the US last week, slightly down on the 268,000 a week earlier. It was a bigger-than-expected fall, with economists forecasting 27o,000 claims. It was also lower than the four-week average of 269,500. US markets are expected to open lower, as bond markets rally: Investors are selling shares and buying bonds, considered to be less risky assets at times of heightened uncertainty. Benchmark 10-year German bund yields have hit record lows, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX is the biggest faller among the major European equity markets. Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rather gloomy comments earlier - when he appeared frustrated at the lack of progress on structural reforms by eurozone countries - is also weighing on investor sentiment. FTSE 100: -0.9% at 6,247 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -1.3% at 10,084 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -0.9% at 4,408 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.2% at 8,810 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -0.7% at 17,777 Pierre Moscovici, European Commissioner for economic and financial affairs, is speaking at the Brussels Economic Forum. He says that while he understands structural reforms have negative connotations in some countries and can be politically difficult to push through, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we need to stand firm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The way to tackle long-term unemployment and reduce social exclusion is through structural reforms, he says. Output growth will increasingly depend on our ability to improve productivity growth and investment. The key to this is investment in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153human capital\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says, partly through education and training. I want reform to mean progress. Rolls-Royce is one of the FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest fallers, down 3.4% at 590.5p. The chief executive of the aircraft engine maker has apparently written to staff warning them that the company is falling behind on deliveries. Warren East urged his colleagues to work hard to ensure profit targets for this year are met, the FT reports. He wrote: [The] business remains in reasonable shape with opportunities and issues broadly balanced. Delivery issues mean there is a lot to do in the second half and hence a higher risk. East acknowledged times were tough for staff at Rolls-Royce, which issued issued a string of profit warnings and cut jobs. He told staff: Right now I do know that in many parts of the organisation that discomfort is very real indeed \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 For many at the moment \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctransformation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is simply unpleasant. I appreciate that this is a difficult environment, difficult enough just to do the job, without people like me preaching about \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpace\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. If we really want to be the Rolls-Royce of our industry we must push through overdue changes we all know we have to make. Catching up on some corporate news, Amazon begins fresh food deliveries in parts of London today. Taking on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supermarkets, Amazon Fresh will offer more than 130,000 groceries to homes in north and east London, including thousands of fresh produce, dairy and bakery items that the company has not previously sold in the UK. The service is available to Amazon Prime customers, who pay a subscription in return for fast delivery of goods. Ajay Kavan, vice-president of Amazon Fresh, said the key to the success of the service would be a combination of low prices, vast selection and fast delivery. The Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sarah Butler has the full story here. Low-income households are likely to shoulder a disproportionate share of the costs of Brexit if the UK votes to leave the EU in this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum, a respected thinktank has warned. Under a worst-case scenario some low-income households could receive as much as \u00c2\u00a35,542 per year less in tax credits and benefit payments in 2020, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. NIESR concludes that Brexit would knock government tax receipts and so force changes to tax and spending policies, assuming the government sticks to tough goals under George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal charter to get the public finances into surplus. Angus Armstrong, one of the report authors, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our analysis combines the consensus of macroeconomic forecasts with the spirit of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal charter. Based on these assumptions, our results show that a disproportionately large share of the costs of Brexit is likely to fall on low-income households.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Full story here.) We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got more reaction to those better-than-expected UK trade figures. Not everyone is convinced that trade will make a positive contribution to GDP in the second quarter. David Kern, British Chambers of Commerce: While the fall in the trade deficit is welcome, it still remains unacceptably large and is likely to be a drag on UK growth in Q2. April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures also highlight the need for the government to do more to support exporters, including improved access to finance for companies looking to break into new fast-growing economies. Martin Beck, EY ITEM Club: While export volumes were up 4.3% in the three months to April compared with the previous three months, import volumes were up by 4.6% over the same period. So as things stand net trade is likely to exert a drag on GDP growth in Q2, unless April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apparent export strength is sustained. The chances of this happening would appear to be relatively low. Global growth remains pretty subdued and sterling has regained a good chunk of its losses from earlier in the year, so the backdrop for exporters remains very challenging. George Soros, the billionaire investor who famously helped to force the pound out of the exchange rate mechanism on Black Wednesday in 1992, has been speaking about Brexit. He told the Wall Street Journal that a combination of Brexit, problems in Greece, and the migration crisis, could result in the a collapse of the European Union: If Britain leaves, it could unleash a general exodus, and the disintegration of the European Union will become practically unavoidable. Soros added however that the recent strength in the pound was a sign that momentum was behind the remain camp in the referendum debate. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m confident that as we get closer to the Brexit vote, the remain camp is getting stronger. Markets are not always right, but in this case I agree with them. Turning to other events, there has been more reaction to Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock sessions on BHS, where MP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quizzed key members of the BHS team about the collapse of the high street retailer. Among other things, the former owner of BHS, Dominic Chappell, was accused of threatening to kill the retailer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, Darren Topp. When asked by BBC Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today programme whether he was surprised by the testimony, Oliver Parry, head of corporate governance at the Institute of Directors got it spot on: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Absolutely. Who needs Agatha Christie when you have Mr Chappell and the BHS management team yesterday.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Exports grew more than imports in April, triggering a surprise fall in the trade in goods deficit. The news should be a boost to George Osborne, who has long argued that the UK economy would do better to be more reliant on manufacturing and exports, and less reliant on debt-fuelled spending. Back in 2012, the chancellor boldly set a target of doubling UK exports to \u00c2\u00a31 trillion . The target is looking increasingly out of reach, but the broader ambition remains. You might therefore expect that Osborne would jump on these positive trade numbers, as a sign that his Long-Term Economic Plan is Working. But so far nothing. The Treasury says it is a matter for the Business department. But that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t explain the chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s silence on Wednesday, when official figures took everyone by surprise showing that industrial production grew at the fastest rate in almost four years in April. Larry Elliott, the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economics editor, has a theory about why Osborne remains tight-lipped. [Quick clue: EU referendum.] In Larry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s words: In normal times, George Osborne would have been all over the good news from the manufacturing sector like a rash. The figures from UK industry were better \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a lot better \u00e2\u20ac\u201c than the City had been expecting and showed the fastest month-on-month increase in almost four years. So where was the instant statement from the chancellor praising the strength of the economy and the success of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy? Sherlock Holmes would have had the answer. Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unusual reticence was a classic case of the dog that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bark. Put simply, good economic news doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really suit the chancellor at the present juncture. His narrative is that the risk of Britain leaving the European Union has left the economy trembling on the edge of the precipice and for that story to stick he needs signs that consumers and businesses are taking fright at the risk of Brexit. Unfortunately for Osborne, the recent data is not at all helpful. Better weather brought consumers out in their droves in May, according to the British Retail Consortium. Now the Office for National Statistics has reported that industrial production was up by 2% between March and April at a time when the markets had expected output to be flat. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, says the figures suggest trade could make a positive contribution to gross domestic product in the second quarter, after being a drag for a prolonged period. April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data suggests that net trade could actually make a positive contribution to UK GDP growth in the second quarter, having been a significant drag in the first quarter of 2016 and through the second half of 2015. It lifts hopes that UK exporters will increasingly be helped by the overall marked weakening of the pound over the coming months. UK exporters will also be hoping that eurozone activity can hold up after an improved 0.6% quarter-on-quarter GDP expansion in the first quarter. However, the global growth outlook is still pretty uncertain, with the UK referendum on EU membership reinforcing this. More on those trade figures, which were better than expected and showed a surprise fall in the deficit. Goods exports volumes increased by 11.2% - the biggest monthly rise since records began in 1998. At \u00c2\u00a326.1bn, the total value of goods exported in April was not far off the record high set in June 2013. Exports of British-made goods to the EU rose by \u00c2\u00a3900m in April, while exports of goods to countries outside the EU increased by \u00c2\u00a31.3bn to a record \u00c2\u00a314bn. Andrew Sentance, former policymaker at the Bank of England, considered the annual numbers: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade deficit with the rest of the world fell more than expected in April following a record jump in goods exports. The deficit fell to \u00c2\u00a310.5bn from a downwardly revised \u00c2\u00a310.6bn in March according to the figures from the Office for National Statistics. The drop in the deficit was driven by a \u00c2\u00a32.2bn increase in exports, to \u00c2\u00a326.1bn. Imports also increased, but by a lesser \u00c2\u00a32bn to \u00c2\u00a336.6bn. Benchmark 10-year gilt yields have fallen to record lows, part of a global bonds rally as investors dump shares. Government borrowing costs fell as yields dropped to 1.224%, the lowest on record and down three basis points on the day. German bond yields also fell to near record lows, with the 10-year bund yield down 1.3 basis points at 0.043%. All major markets are down in early trading: Connor Campbell, analyst at Spreadex, has this take: Despite Brent Crude hitting an 8-month high the European indices got off to a sluggish start this Thursday morning. The FTSE once again fell away from 6300 as the European session began, the index dragged down by chunky losses for the likes of Vodafone, Johnson Matthey and Berkeley Group Holdings. Matters weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helped by last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chinese inflation figure, which unexpectedly fell to a 3 month low of 2.0%, something that has arguably muted the impact of Brent Crude\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest rise on the commodity sector. Draghi is talking about employment trends in the eurozone and warns unfavourable demographic trends will create challenges. Employment growth [is likely] to decelerate in the not-too-distant future because of the fall in the working age population. Even migration is unlikely to fully offset this natural population decline. He says there is room for productivity improvement in all countries, and that the challenge is first to raise productivity in firms and then get capital to those firms so that can grow. That would boost the eurozone economy, and jobs, the central bank says. Draghi finishes will a warning that eurozone leaders must press ahead with structural reforms \u00e2\u20ac\u0153without undue delay\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, or risk lasting economic damage. The cost of delaying reforms, he says, is too high, because it creates damaging uncertainty and holds back investment. There are many political reasons to delay structural reforms, but very few economic ones. And the cost of delay is too high. Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, has taken to the stage at the Brussels Economic Forum. The man tasked with setting monetary policy for the eurozone is laying out some of the measures the ECB has taken over recent years. He says bank balance sheets are not yet fully repaired. He reiterates that governments must do their bit to boost the eurozone economy. The ECB can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do it alone. Fiscal policies should work with and not against monetary policy. Draghi says doubts over the future of the euro need to be addressed because they are holding back progress in the region. Firms may understandably choose to defer or abandon investment plans. This has been clear in the past when the future of the euro area has been called into question. It can also effect the saving rate of firms and households, leading to higher precautionary [spending behaviour]. There is a critical need for clarity on the institutional make up of the euro area. Many proposals have been put forward to overcome the [shortcomings] of the euro area. Brent crude oil prices have been steadily rising since the beginning of the year... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Oil prices are climbing higher this morning, following larger than expected drawdowns in the US and disruptions to supply in Nigeria, where militant attacks have driven production in the country to a 20-year low. Brent crude is currently trading at $52.70 a barrel, up 0.4%. It is the highest since early October. CMC Markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Michael Hewson says there is no sign that the upswing in oil prices is going to end any time soon: While oil inventories still remain at elevated levels continued supply disruptions in Nigeria, have sent output to a 20 year low and this is helping underpin prices. The third successive weekly draw in a row has also helped sustain the uptrend for oil prices which has been in place now for nearly five months. With the US dollar also on the weak side there appears to be little in the way to stop the upward momentum behind the move higher in the oil price. Also coming up today... We have UK trade data for April at 9.30. Economists are predicting the trade in goods deficit to be unchanged at \u00c2\u00a311.2bn. Mario Draghi is speaking at the Brussels Economic Forum and is due to take the stage shortly. The National Institute for Economic and Social Research will give its verdict on what a UK exit from the European Union would mean for low income households in Britain. In the US, we have the weekly jobless claims data, which will provide the latest snapshot of the labour market following shockingly weak payroll numbers last week. (p.s. If you missed the dramatic events on Wednesday involving death threats and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fingers in the till\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at the highest level of collapsed retailer BHS, catch up here.)",

Certainly, some of the recent data have been disappointing. US non-farm payrolls for May were the weakest since 2010 and the ISM non-manufacturing PMI fell to its lowest level since early 2014... </p> <p>However, in our view these worries about the global economy look over-stated. Most importantly, we suspect that abrupt slowdown in US payrolls growth is not the start of a new recession... </p> <p>The upshot is that a downturn in prospects for global growth cannot explain the slump in global yields. Instead, falling yields probably reflect the reduced expectations for US interest rate hikes. As we think the Fed will resume its tightening cycle before the end of this year, and fears of Brexit should fade whatever the outcome of the referendum, we anticipate that bond yields will rebound. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-06-10T15:04:46.528Z\">at 4.04pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-575ad198e4b064f52e5f9d11\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-10T14:43:00.438Z\">3.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The pound hit a six week low of $1.4315, down 1% on the day, before recovering slightly to $1.4332 as Brexit worries persist.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-575acab3e4b00f7e4b1779b0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-10T14:15:57.668Z\">3.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The US consumer confidence figures come ahead of next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve meeting but are unlikely to prompt a rate rise, says James Knightly at ING Bank:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[The confidence report] gives us some confidence in the view that last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s payrolls disappointment is not the start of a new trend seeing as confidence remains close to cycle highs, suggesting no distress about the state of the jobs market.

Prospects for gains in inflation-adjusted incomes in the year ahead were also the most favorable since the 2007 peak, enabled by record low inflation expectations.</p> <p>On the negative side of the ledger, consumers do not think the economy is as strong as it was last year nor do they anticipate the economy will enjoy the same financial health in the year ahead as they anticipated a year ago. A sustained reduction in the pace of job creation could prompt consumers to hold down spending to increase their precautionary savings.

                "bodyText":"The number of US oil rigs rose for the second week in a row after the recent rise in the crude price to above $50, according to the regular Baker Hughes report. The weekly count showed a total rise of 6 rigs to 414, as the increase in oil prices to an 11 month high encouraged drillers back to the wells. The rise was split between three oil rigs and three gas. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the day and the week. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back next week. Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi has said it would be a disaster for Britain if it voted to leave the EU, and would also hurt Europe and cause short term market instability. [To be fair short term market instability is already with us] According to Reuters, Renzi said at a conference in Genoa in northern Italy that Brexit would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a dreadful mistake for both Britain and Europe.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Moving from fears of the UK leaving Europe to the England football team leaving the Euros, Zoe Wood has been looking at the winners and losers from the feast of football which begins this evening. Read her report here: It was a bad end to the week as investors took fright, with Brexit fears dominating the markets but a fall in oil prices and nervousness ahead of next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US Federal Reserve meeting adding to the uncertainty. Bond yields fell sharply and gold rose as investors took a safety first approach. In the UK, leading shares suffered their sharpest one day percentage fall since 11 February, while European markets also recorded major losses. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Markets have come full circle this week, with the gains seen in the early part of the week giving way to substantial losses towards the end. It is particularly notable that whilst European indices have seen substantial losses, the US markets are have managed to claw back some early losses, highlighting proximity of the link between todays selling and the fear of a Brexit. Banks came under particular pressure on concerns about the impact of negative bond yields while commodity companies suffered as metal and oil prices fell. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 116.13 points or 1.86% at 6115.76 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 2.52% to 9834.62 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 2.24% lower at 4306.72 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 3.62% to 17,120.16 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 3.18% down at 8490.5 In Greece, the Athens market lost 4.18% to 618.67 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 0.43% or 78 points. And Brent crude has slid 2.18% to $50.82 a barrel. Worries about the global economy could be one factor pushing bond yields lower but it may not be the real story, says Andrew Kenningham of Capital Economics: One possible explanation for the latest decline in global bond yields is that concerns about global growth have surfaced again. Certainly, some of the recent data have been disappointing. US non-farm payrolls for May were the weakest since 2010 and the ISM non-manufacturing PMI fell to its lowest level since early 2014... However, in our view these worries about the global economy look over-stated. Most importantly, we suspect that abrupt slowdown in US payrolls growth is not the start of a new recession... The upshot is that a downturn in prospects for global growth cannot explain the slump in global yields. Instead, falling yields probably reflect the reduced expectations for US interest rate hikes. As we think the Fed will resume its tightening cycle before the end of this year, and fears of Brexit should fade whatever the outcome of the referendum, we anticipate that bond yields will rebound. The pound hit a six week low of $1.4315, down 1% on the day, before recovering slightly to $1.4332 as Brexit worries persist. The US consumer confidence figures come ahead of next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve meeting but are unlikely to prompt a rate rise, says James Knightly at ING Bank: [The confidence report] gives us some confidence in the view that last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s payrolls disappointment is not the start of a new trend seeing as confidence remains close to cycle highs, suggesting no distress about the state of the jobs market. Moreover, with the consumer expectations component looking healthy at 83.2, it suggests consumer spending should perform well in the coming months. With job openings at cycle highs, businesses are still recruiting so we would expect a decent rebound in the June jobs report. However, the Fed will probably want to see at least two decent jobs figures before pulling the trigger on higher rates. This means we continue to favour the September Federal Open Market Committee meeting for the next rate rise. The consumer confidence survey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist Richard Curtin said: Consumers were a bit less optimistic in early June due to increased concerns about future economic prospects. The recent data magnified the growing gap between the most favorable assessments of Current Economic Conditions since July 2005, and renewed downward drift of the Expectations Index, which fell by a rather modest 8.6% from the January 2015 peak. The strength recorded in early June was in personal finances, and the weaknesses were in expectations for continued growth in the national economy. Consumers rated their current financial situation at the best levels since the 2007 cyclical peak largely due to wage gains. Prospects for gains in inflation-adjusted incomes in the year ahead were also the most favorable since the 2007 peak, enabled by record low inflation expectations. On the negative side of the ledger, consumers do not think the economy is as strong as it was last year nor do they anticipate the economy will enjoy the same financial health in the year ahead as they anticipated a year ago. A sustained reduction in the pace of job creation could prompt consumers to hold down spending to increase their precautionary savings. Overall, the data still indicate that real consumer expenditures can be expected to rise by 2.5% in 2016 and 2.7% in 2017. In the US, consumer confidence slipped back in the preliminary June reading, but not as much as expected. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index fell from 94.7 in May to 94.3, but this was better than the forecast figure of 94. The current conditions index of 111.7, up from 109.9, was the highest since July 2005. With stock markets under pressure amid a cocktail of concerns - including Brexit, falling oil prices, next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federal Reserve meeting on US interest rates - gold is one of the havens being sought by investors. At the moment the metal is up around $5 an ounce at $1274. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how it has been tracking the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit debate: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the state of bond yields, many in negative territory: Wall Street has opened lower: Dow Jones: -0.5% at 17,896 S&amp;P 500: -0.6% at 2,104 Nasdaq: -0.8% at 4,917 Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg, has written a note on the likelihood of a domino effect across Europe, should Britain vote to leave the EU on 23 June. He describes the possibility of a domino effect as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the main risk to watch for global markets and the global economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. However, Schmieding and his colleagues at Berenberg suggest the likelihood is low, and place the likelihood of Brexit at just 30%. Italy would be the country to watch, Schmieding concludes: First, Italy matters because of its size (the fourth-largest in the EU) and its debt (133% of GDP). Second, since the demise of Silvio Berlusconi, Italy lacks a strong centre-right that could take over from Matteo Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s centre-left. Third, if Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government were to fall, unlikely but not impossible if he loses the referendum on constitutional reform this October, parties with more than 50% support in current opinion polls may campaign in hypothetical early elections with a promise to hold a referendum on euro membership. That could rattle markets. But Renzi remains in the pole position. That Italy could be governed by an anti-euro coalition still looks unlikely. US markets are expected to open lower: Earlier Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank cut interest rates for the first time in nearly a year, citing an imminent economic recovery and more stable inflation. After reducing its main lending rate by 50 basis points to 10.5%, Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina said there was unlikely to be any direct influence on the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy in the event of the UK voting to leave the EU, according to Reuters. But there could be indirect risks through reaction in the currency markets, she told a news conference. If things stay as they are the FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall - now 1.86% - will be the biggest daily decline in percentage terms since the middle of February. With US futures suggesting a 95 point fall on the Dow Jones Industrial Average when Wall Street opens, the chances of a big recovery are not huge. The FTSE 100 is now down 114 points or 1.8% at 6,118. Spreadex\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Connor Campbell gives this update on European markets: Things got far, far worse in Europe, an alarming drop pushing the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s indices to a series of 2 and a half week lows. With Brent Crude dipping below $51.50 per barrel, and the commodity sector rapidly losing the gains seen at the start of the week, the FTSE plunged over 100 points this Friday. Finding a clear, concrete reason for this violent investor reaction is difficult; rather it seems that the commodity reversal, alongside a sharp decline from the financial sector, has joined the pre-referendum jitters to produce a bearish weight the markets are unable to handle. He says the Brexit jitters are now spreading beyond the FTSE to other European markets. The eurozone indices bested the FTSE in the poor performance stakes this morning, the DAX and CAC dropping a whopping 2.1% and 1.8% respectively. Like the UK index that leaves both at their worst price since May 24th, fears of a Brexit taking hold of the eurozone indices in a way that hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t previously been seen. Rewinding to slightly earlier in the day, the OECD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s secretary general Angel Gurria gave an impassioned speech when asked about Brexit by a journalist. Speaking in Paris at the launch of the organisation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic survey of the EU and eurozone, he said the British voters were being purposely misled by members of the leave camp, some of whom were motivated by their own political motivations... The message is not permeating easily because there is a lot of emotion and frankly there is a lot of very misleading messaging that is going on. I give you one example. It is often mentioned by the people who are promoting Brexit that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthere is stifling regulation of the UK economy and we will now be able to deregulate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. That is absolutely false. The UK is one of the least regulated, most flexible, open economies ... so much so that if they were on their own the improvement on regulation would be relatively modest. So you would not gain very much there. People do not have the elements to know whether that is true or not. He said that all the key institutions and groups - the London School of Economics, the CBI, the OECD, the IMF, the WTO, the trade unions - had provided evidence of the likely impact of Brexit. But the leave campaign had not. The people promoting Brexit are speaking emotionally and they fail to provide any evidence to the contrary. For Gurria, Brexit is personal as well as professional. This is an intergenerational decision that has to be taken. I say that with the authority of being the father of a British citizen, married to a British citizen, and with two British children. I would like them to have a better future. And I would like them to have a European future. And not in an isolated society, an isolated economy. Gurria said there were too many voices, leaving the voting public confused. It is a cacophony of voices and in many cases the voices of those who are promoting their own political [ambitions] even if it is at the expense of future generations. It is our duty and obligation to continue with the message, mostly to the British people. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the British people who would suffer this drop in wellbeing and revenue. The Europeans are going to recover pretty fast, but the UK is going to take a much greater hit. Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble is not the only one warning Brexit could prompt other countries to leave the EU. Billionaire George Soros warned on Thursday it could lead to a collapse of the EU, and ratings agency Fitch said last week: If the UK were to thrive outside of the EU, it might encourage other countries to follow suit. No wonder investors are feeling anxious. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all terrible from Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble though, he would take us back, eventually: At some point, the British will realise they have taken the wrong decision. And then we will accept them back one day, if that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what they want. Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble has also warned Brexit could lead to other countries leaving the EU, Reuters is reporting. You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rule it out. How would the Netherlands, which has traditionally been very closely allied with Britain, react, for example? If need be, Europe would work without Britain. It would be a miracle if Britain quitting did not have any economic disadvantages [for the UK]. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister added that in the event of Brexit, a call for more integration among remaining EU members would not be the appropriate response. Even in the event that only a small majority of the British voters reject a withdrawal, we would have to see it as a wake-up call and a warning not to continue with business as usual. Either way, we have to take a serious look at reducing bureaucracy in Europe. Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s combative and influential finance minister has waded into the Brexit debate. In a characteristically frank interview with German magazine Der Spiegel (to be published over the weekend), Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble says the door to the single market would be slammed in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s face should it vote to leave the EU on 23 June. The Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Philip Oltermann reports from Berlin: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble, has slammed the door on Britain retaining access to the single market if it votes to the leave the European Union. In an interview in a Brexit-themed issue of German weekly Der Spiegel, the influential veteran politician ruled out the possibility of the UK following a Swiss or Norwegian model where it could enjoy the benefits of the single market without being an EU member. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble told Der Spiegel. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It would require the country to abide by the rules of a club from which it currently wants to withdraw. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the majority in Britain opts for Brexit, that would be a decision against the single market. In is in. Out is out. One has to respect the sovereignty of the British people.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Reuters is reporting that Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble has also warned Brexit could lead to referendums in other EU countries, therefore destabilising the whole region. Shares in all FTSE 100 companies are lower. The top performers are down... The bottom performers are down... Equity losses are gathering pace. Major European markets are down more than 1%. The FTSE 100 is down 1.5% or 96 points at 6,136. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: -1.7% at 9,921 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: -1.2% at 4,352 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: -2.1% at 17,396 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -1.6% at 8,632 The OECD says the European economy is slowly improving, but new challenges are emerging, including the prospect of Brexit. Gurria turns to the risk of Brexit: It would hurt British growth, FDI inflows, trade. GDP could be 3% lower than if you did not have Brexit, if you go for remain. He says the biggest negative impact will be on Britain. The EU will suffer less, because it is a big unit, able to withstand Brexit. Gurria repeats the OECD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that UK workers would lose the equivalent of a month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wages every year outside the EU. We are strongly saying remain. This is best for the UK, the EU and the world. The last thing we need is uncertainty, we have enough of that already. The OECD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s secretary general, Angel Gurria, says tensions in European financial markets have receded. Why? Gurria lists the reasons. The key has been better European policies. New rules. Monetary policy from the ECB has obviously been supportive. It looks like we are moving to a better fiscal position without having to do much heavy lifting. The building blocks to banking union are underway. But, Gurria says, unemployment is still high, and investment has been weak. We are still below pre-crisis levels, he says. UK, Germany and the US are the only three countries where this is not the case. The OECD press conference on Europe is starting. Watch live here. The European Union must drop barriers to immigration to boost growth, according to the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development, in clear opposition to arguments put forward by the leave camp in the EU referendum that the UK would prosper despite restrictions on migrant workers. The Paris-based thinktank, which is funded by the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest nations, said the EU needed to encourage workers to move to where they can find a job by forcing countries to recognise professional qualifications and allow workers to transfer their pensions. In its latest survey of the EU and the eurozone, the OECD said obstacles to labour mobility remained one of the three significant barriers to growth, alongside a failure to break the banking sector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monopoly on lending to businesses and Brussels\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 inability to tackle restrictions that remain in the single market. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Barriers to intra-EU labour mobility, including recognition of professional qualifications and supplementary pension portability, remain significant and need to be reduced. Labour market requirements for non-EU migrants should be further standardised,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the OECD said. It also said the inflow of refugees was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a major and pressing challenge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that must be met collectively by the EU countries. (Read the full story here.) Asian markets closing prices: Construction output jumped 2.5% in April, beating expectations of a 1.7% rise. It was the largest monthly increase since January 2014. It followed a 3.6% drop in March according to the Office for National Statistics data. New building work was up 2.9%, while repair and maintenance increase by 1.9%. Despite the better-than-expected number, construction output was still lower in April than it was in the same month last year, by 3.7%. But again, this wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as bad as the 4.8% annual drop forecast by economists. Not everyone thinks piling into bonds at any cost is a good idea. Janus Capital\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bill Gross is one of them. The bond market sage thinks there is a disaster brewing. Specifically, he took to Twitter to describe the negative yields on $10trn of sovereign debt as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a supernova that will explode one day\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Benchmark 10-year German bund yields have hit a fresh record low, as investors rush to the relative safety of bonds versus equities. The low was 0.0021%, meaning it is getting cheaper and cheaper for the German government to borrow money. If bund yields venture into negative, investors will be paying the government to buy its debt... The flight from equities continues this morning, with European markets down in early trading. As part of the same story, German bund yields have hit fresh record lows this morning , edging closer to negative territory (more on this soon). Oil prices are lower, with Brent Crude down 0.8% at $51.53 a barrel. Connor Campbell, analyst at Spreadex, has this take: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second half of the week slump continued to gather pace this Friday, the session starting with another sharp slide. With nothing on offer the FTSE had little choice but to focus on Brent Crude\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retreat (the black stuff back down to $51.50 per barrel) and the increasing uncertainty surrounding the EU referendum at the end of the month (the pound dropping another 0.4% against the dollar). The eurozone indices have seen an even more dramatic drop this week. The DAX, which had briefly pushed beyond 10,300 on Tuesday, plunged below 10000 as the morning got underway, while the CAC is now nearing 4,350, a price not seen since May 24th. German annual inflation has been confirmed at zero in May, unchanged from earlier estimates according to the Federal Statistics Office. (This is the harmonised rate, to compare with other European countries.) Also coming up today... We have UK construction output data for April at 9.30. Economists are forecasting a 1.7% increase over the month, following a 3.6% drop in March. Industrial production data and trade data earlier in the week were both better than expected, so it will be interesting to see whether construction had a decent April, and what that might mean for growth in the second quarter overall. At 10am (UK time) the OECD is launching its economic survey of the EU and the eurozone. A press conference hosted by secretary general Angel Gurr\u00c3\u00ada will be available to watch here and we will be bringing you all the key points. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Gold is in focus, nearing a three-week high and on track for a second weekly rise as investors seek save have assets in an uncertain world. The precious metal has been rising since last Friday, when US payrolls data came in shockingly weak, with just 38,000 jobs added compared with the 164,000 forecast by economists. It is part of a fresh wave of jitters among investors, who have plenty of uncertainty to contend with. On Thursday this week, Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, warned of the risk of lasting damage to the eurozone economy if leaders did not urgently introduce structural reforms. And as Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum on EU membership draws ever closer, the outcome of the 23 June poll is too close to call. Brexit, and all the uncertainty that comes with it, is a real prospect. Investors are piling out of equities, with Asian markets falling on Friday following losses on Wall Street and European markets on Thursday. Bonds as well as gold and silver are appealing to investors seeking less risky assets. Gilt yields on German and UK 10-year bonds fell to record lows yesterday, meaning investors had to pay more to hold government debt in those countries. As Michael Hewson comments, German bunds were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153within touching distance of negative territory\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He adds: A move into negative territory for German bunds in the coming days would mean that investors would be paying to lend money to the German government all the way out to ten years, in the same way they currently are for Japan now. Who would have thought that even possible even a year ago, investors paying governments to own their debt? Spot gold was trading at $1,267 an ounce, while bullion touched its highest since May 18 at $1,271.31.",

In Germany, yields on the 10-year \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bunds\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd dropped to a new record low on Friday of 0.022% and there was speculation they could hit zero and maybe even dip into the red. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Negative rates are increasingly becoming the benchmark against which investors judge prospective returns, hence the lack of hysteria in the last couple of weeks as 10-year German bund yields have fallen to within a whisker of zero percent,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Chris Iggo, head of fixed income at AXA Investment Managers. Yields on Bunds and other government bonds have been falling on the back of Brexit worries but also on expectations that the US Federal Reserve will delay an anticipated increase in interest rates. The central bank meets next week having hinted at a June rate rise and then more recently suggested there was too much uncertainty to act this month. That followed news of a sharp slowdown in US job creation in May. James Knightly, economist at ING Bank, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Fed will probably want to see at least two decent jobs figures before pulling the trigger on higher rates. This means we continue to favour the September ... meeting for the next rate rise.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yields on UK government bonds, known as gilts, also hit all-time lows on Friday, albeit in thin volumes as traders hung back from taking any big bets ahead of the tight referendum. The 10-year gilt yield dropped to 1.213% at one point, the lowest on record.",

It could widen further if Britain were to leave the single market, and be unable to sell services to the EU.</p> <p>And that would send the pound sliding hard, probably driving inflation sharply higher. </p> <p>Barings, who warn that Brexit would be likely to be highly damaging to the UK economy, explain:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Practically, the mechanism through which capital flows will need to be attracted into the UK has to be through a cheaper sterling. </p> <p>There has not been an exact match for this event in the past, but previous times of stress have seen sterling depreciate by 15% to 20% on a trade-weighted basis. Research we have seen suggests that sterling could have to weaken by 25% to 30% in the event of Brexit, to continue to attract capital flows, slow imports and boost exports for the UK economy.</p> <p>However, sterling would not be alone. We would also expect the euro to decline in the uncertain aftermath of a vote in favour of Brexit, although sterling would be likely to be the weaker of the two.</p> <p>Of course, such profound currency depreciation would also have consequences for the UK economy. It would be highly inflationary. In turn, this would present the Bank of England with a particular dilemma; whether to raise interest rates to control inflation and risk slowing the UK economy, or do nothing, look through and see inflation rise by as much as 4% or 5%.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-06-13T10:16:36.675Z\">at 11.16am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-575e8109e4b064f52e5fa1fc\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-13T09:59:24.508Z\">10.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Deutsche: London shares might benefit from Brexit</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Ironically, the London stock markets is suffering less of a selloff than the rest of Europe today.</strong></p> <p>The FTSE is currently down 31 points, or 0.5%, while French stock are down a whopping 1.4%.</p> <p>And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because analysts believe British companies will benefit from a weaker pound.

If anyone is going to be feeling unnerved by the deal, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Salesforce. We should expect to see some sort of announcement from then in the months ahead. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Commenting on the growing lead for Brexit, Joshua Raymond of broker XTB.com said: With the latest ICM poll showing support for a Brexit strengthening on both online and phone polls, investors continue to be concerned and are expected to downsize their positions in UK stocks and holdings in pounds sterling. The fact we are not seeing any degree of volatility in the latest polls, which all point to a healthy lead for the leave campaign is making investors risk averse. And here is the latest ICM poll, showing the Leave campaign further in the lead. Tom Clarke reports: Support for leaving the EU is strengthening, with both phone and online surveys reporting a six-point lead, according to a new pair of Guardian/ICM polls. Leave now enjoys a 53%-47% advantage once \u00e2\u20ac\u0153don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t knows\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are excluded, according to the research conducted over the weekend compared with a 52%-48% split reported by ICM a fortnight ago. The pound is down around 0.18% at $1.4221 following the poll news. It took 14 years for LinkedIn to grow into a business worth $26bn to Microsoft, and my colleague Sean Farrell has taken a look at the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history: The $26bn deal for Microsoft to buy LinkedIn has done little to support stock markets, which are more concerned with a global slowdown and the consequences of the UK voting to leave the European Union. With talk of the latest ICM poll showing a lead for the Leave camp, markets have slumped once again. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell to its lowest level since March 10, down 70.79 points or 1.16% to 6044.97 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 1.8% to 9657.44 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 1.85% lower at 4227.02 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 64 points or 0.36%. The pound, having slumped earlier and then recovered, has now slipped back again against the dollar, down marginally on the day from $1.4252 at $1.4240. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said: Microsoft has clearly found another use for some of its cash, and while LinkedIn may have faded from view as the market focusses on the triumphs of Facebook and the travails of Twitter, the social network\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s database offers a tantalising way to expand Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reach once more. The use of debt rather than stock will reassure those that worry this is another sign of a market top, and will have the added benefit of raising the prospect of a buyer for Twitter. In an email to LinkedIn employees, chief executive Jeff Weiner says the Microsoft deal is best for the company: No matter what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re feeling now, give yourself some time to process the news. You might feel a sense of excitement, fear, sadness, or some combination of all of those emotions. Every member of the exec team has experienced the same, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had months to process. Regardless of the ups and downs, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve come out the other side knowing beyond a shadow of a doubt, this is the best thing for our company. He continues: Some of you may be asking \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why Microsoft?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Long before [Microsoft boss} Satya [Nadella] and I first sat down to talk about how we could work together, I had publicly shared my thoughts on how impressive his efforts were to rapidly transition Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy and culture. After all, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extremely rare to see a company of that scope and scale move so quickly to make fundamental changes. The Microsoft that has evolved under Satya\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leadership is a more agile, innovative, open and purpose-driven company. It was that latter point that first had me thinking we could make this work, but it was his thoughts on how we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d do it that got me truly excited about the prospect.... Essentially, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re both trying to do the same thing but coming at it from two different places: For LinkedIn, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the professional network, and for Microsoft, the professional cloud. [On the structure of the deal] I had no idea what Satya was going to propose, but knew how difficult acquisition integrations could be if not established the right way from the start. Long story short, Satya had me at \u00e2\u20ac\u0153independence.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In other words, his vision was to operate LinkedIn as a fully independent entity within Microsoft, a model used with great success by companies like YouTube, Instagram and WhatsApp. Meanwhile back in the foreign exchange market, sterling has recovered all its losses ahead of the forthcoming ICM poll. Despite the excitement about the $26bn deal for Microsoft to buy LinkedIn, the overall US market has failed to move into positive territory. With worries about a global slowdown and the impact of a vote by the UK to leave the EU, the Dow Jones Industrial average has dipped 0.02%, Nasdaq is down 0.12% and the S&amp;P 500 is 0.13% lower. With Twitter shares up on speculation it could be the next to be snapped up after LinkedIn, some believe a deal could make sense. Saxo Bank head of equity Peter Garnry thinks Google could buy the business by the year end. Twitter has 350 millions users, but it has been a problem for the company to grow its user base, he said. Nevertheless Twitter has managed to increase its cash flow profitability over the last 4-5 quarters and on a cashflow basis the company is improving rapidly. He said it had been difficult for Google to create a social media space stronghold and for that reason he thought Twitter would be a good fit for Google. This deal even beats that $19bn which Facebook splashed out on WhatsApp in February 2014..... Microsoft is getting the cash for this deal though issuing new debt, rather than tapping its own cash pile. Why would it do that? Because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more tax efficient; Microsoft won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to repatriate any of the cash currently held offshore back into the US (where it would face higher taxes). [Oxfam singled out Microsoft in a report condemning tax havens back in April] Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alex Hern\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news story on the Microsoft-LinkedIn deal: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: If the deal with Microsoft goes through as planned, Jeff Weiner, who joined LinkedIn in 2008 as the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president before becoming chief executive later that year, will stay on in his current role, reporting directly to Microsoft boss Satya Nadella. In a statement, Nadella hinted at the competitive advantage he expects the network to provide for Microsoft. He said LinkedIn would pair well with the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business-focused software such as Office and customer relationship manager Dynamics. Over on Wall Street, LinkedIn shares have jumped by 47% to $193 in early trading. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close to the $196 per shares which Microsoft is paying, suggesting the deal is expected to pass. Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have fallen by 4% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as explained earlier, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a typical reaction when a company announces a significant acquisition. And this really is a significant deal, as the BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rory Cellan-Jones explains: Social media is buzzing with reaction to Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $26bn cash splurge acquisition: LinkedIn gives Microsoft a serious presence in the business social networking business, says mobile analyst Ben Wood of CCS Insight: Shares in Twitter are rallying in early trading; perhaps on speculation that it could now be snapped up. This is Satya Nadella\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest deal since he replaced Steve Ballmer as Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO in February 2014. Nadella says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been thinking about buying LinkedIn for a while, and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need to persuade analysts that it really makes sense, given the huge price tag. It also dwarfs MS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other recent deals - buying Nokia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mobile phone business for $7bn in 2013, and online telephony firm Skype for $8.5bn in 2011. The Nokia deal hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been a great success, given Microsoft laid off 1,850 staff at its smartphone business last month. The Economist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Stanley Pignal is hoping that the deluge of LinkedIn notifications might now ease... Augustin Eden at City firm Accendo Markets (who doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sound like a great fan of LinkedIn) explains why Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are likely to suffer today: Shares in professional networking/dating/narcissism website LinkedIn are called to open around 40% higher at the US open after confirmation it has welcomed a mammoth takeover approach from Microsoft constituting a nigh on 50% premium over Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price close. Shares in Microsoft were understandably suspended from trading in the lead-up to this bit of news, given that the traditional reaction to such an announcement often involves a shareholder exodus from the predator. With this deal lightening Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coffers to the tune of $26bn, make that an exodus of biblical proportions. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement is full of cheerful quotes justifying the deal. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a selection: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The LinkedIn team has grown a fantastic business centered on connecting the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s professionals. Together we can accelerate the growth of LinkedIn, as well as Microsoft Office 365 and Dynamics as we seek to empower every person and organization on the planet.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner: Just as we have changed the way the world connects to opportunity, this relationship with Microsoft, and the combination of their cloud and LinkedIn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s network, now gives us a chance to also change the way the world works. LinkedIn chairman Reid Hoffmann Today is a re-founding moment for LinkedIn. I see incredible opportunity for our members and customers and look forward to supporting this new and combined business. I fully support this transaction and the Board\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to pursue it, and will vote my shares in accordance with their recommendation on it. LinkedIn shareholders will be celebrating tonight.... Guys, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only one joke about this deal...and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been done. Many times.... Tech analyst Amir Mizroch explains the motivation behind the deal: Microsoft and LinkedIn have released a short video about the deal. In it, MS CEO Satya Nadella talks about his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153great admiration for LinkedIn\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.... and explained that his vision is to combine LinkedIn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s productivity and communication tools with Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s professional network. Cue uplifting talk about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153enhancing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s professional lives and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153empowering\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd them to do better - either in their current job or the next one.... He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been tweeting that message too: Shares in Microsoft have slid by 5% in pre-market trading, as investors react to the news it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s paying $26bn for LinkedIn. The Wall Street Journal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dennis Berman argues that LinkedIn has capitulated, by selling out to Microsoft. Walking away with $26bn (or \u00c2\u00a318.5bn) ) is one heck of a capitulation, though.... This deal values each of LinkedIn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 433 million users at $60 each, points out Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Peter Thal Larsen: Some users may be worth less.... Microsoft has swooped on LinkedIn four months after the company shocked Wall Street by missing its revenue forecasts. Back in February, LinkedIn revealed that its online ad revenue growth had slowed to 20% in the fourth quarter from 56% a year earlier. Financial analysts raced to downgrade LinkedIn, warning that the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s period of rapid growth was over. For example: RBC analysts said they had thought LinkedIn was on the cusp of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fundamentally positive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd change. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We were wrong,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd they said in a client note. That helped to send LinkedIn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares down around 40%, and laying the ground for Microsoft to strike a deal. Some big breaking news in the tech sector - Microsoft, the software giant, is buying business social network site LinkedIn for more than $26bn. The deal, just announced, values LinkedIn at $196 per share - or almost 50% above Friday night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close of $131. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the announcement. The deal comes five years after LinkedIn floated at $45 per share. But they were trading at $270 in 2015. More to follow..... While we wait for ICM to deliver their poll, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hear a few words from George Osborne. The chancellor has just been interviewed by Bloomberg, and urged business leaders to back the Remain campaign. Osborne argues: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People who are concerned or businesses who are concerned or investors who are concerned about the prospect of Britain leaving the EU should speak up. This is not the moment for businesses to sit it out.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Some firms have already piled into the fray. Telecoms group BT has already written to its staff, explaining why it believes Britian should stay in the EU. But Sir James Dyson, the billionaire inventor, is backing the Leave campaign, and slamming warnings that Britain would be locked out of international markets. The US stock market is expected to dip when trading begins in 90 minutes time. That follows today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses in Europe, and the big selloff in Asia overnight. ICM would like everyone to relax until they have finished working on their poll with, ummm, my colleague Tom Clark.... Hmmmm. No sign of that ICM Referendum poll yet. And its website has just crashed under the weight of web traffic looking for it.... City traders are bracing for fresh volatility, as polling company ICM is expected to release a new survey at 12.30pm BST. Another sign of European Brexit fears: Barings are also worried that Brussels would not cut Britain a generous deal if the public vote to leave the EU. They write: Post-Brexit concessions to the UK would send the wrong signal to other EU countries where nationalistic movements are growing. This could result in a political chain-reaction that could easily trigger a series of national referendums in numerous member countries. In terms of financial commitments, if the UK leaves the EU, it would save around \u00c2\u00a310 billion in net contributions. The government would, however, be likely to need to step in to help sectors and regions which would stop receiving European structural funds, and which could be disproportionately affected by tariffs on trade. It is also not yet known what level of payment would be required to permit the UK business sector to access the 500 million people living in the EU. How badly could the pound be hit by a victory for Brexit campaigners? Well...economists at Barings Asset Management predict this morning that sterling could slump by a fifth! They point out that Britain is running a huge current account deficit, due to importing far more than it exports. It could widen further if Britain were to leave the single market, and be unable to sell services to the EU. And that would send the pound sliding hard, probably driving inflation sharply higher. Barings, who warn that Brexit would be likely to be highly damaging to the UK economy, explain: Practically, the mechanism through which capital flows will need to be attracted into the UK has to be through a cheaper sterling. There has not been an exact match for this event in the past, but previous times of stress have seen sterling depreciate by 15% to 20% on a trade-weighted basis. Research we have seen suggests that sterling could have to weaken by 25% to 30% in the event of Brexit, to continue to attract capital flows, slow imports and boost exports for the UK economy. However, sterling would not be alone. We would also expect the euro to decline in the uncertain aftermath of a vote in favour of Brexit, although sterling would be likely to be the weaker of the two. Of course, such profound currency depreciation would also have consequences for the UK economy. It would be highly inflationary. In turn, this would present the Bank of England with a particular dilemma; whether to raise interest rates to control inflation and risk slowing the UK economy, or do nothing, look through and see inflation rise by as much as 4% or 5%. Ironically, the London stock markets is suffering less of a selloff than the rest of Europe today. The FTSE is currently down 31 points, or 0.5%, while French stock are down a whopping 1.4%. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because analysts believe British companies will benefit from a weaker pound. It would make exporters more competitive, and boost earnings in foreign currencies. Pharmaceutical giant Glaxo and tobacco firms BAT and Imperial are thus among the risers today. Deutsche Bank analysts are advising buying London stocks, rather than the German equivalent. In the case of a Leave vote in the UK referendum (a scenario to which bookmakers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 odds attribute a 30% probability), we expect UK equities to outperform the European market, given the likely depreciation of the pound in such a scenario as well as the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defensive sector structure. However.... UK companies won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t benefit if the Bank of England is forced to hike interest rates to prevent a sterling crisis. Brexit fears have rippled as far as Prague. The Czech Republic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main stock market has fallen 2% today, to its lowest level in seven years. And next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum is, apparently, partly to blame. Analysts at Pekao, a Polish bank, told clients that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153High probability of Brexit (Britain leaving the European Union) remains the biggest short-term risk.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound is hitting fresh two-month lows, as investors react to the tightening of the EU referendum race. Sterling is now down one cent against the US dollar at $1.4137, and more than eurocent against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.254. And with stock markets still in the red, Joshua Mahony of firm IG says investors are worrying about Brexit, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowing economy and the possibility of US interest rate rises this year, Even if we manage to navigate the near term threats of a Brexit and a likely US rate hike, the continued slowdown in China will provide a remains a significant ongoing risk to global demand. It is clear that in a week which is relatively light on economic data, the focus will remain on the risk of a Brexit, which could destabilise not only the future of England, but also the European project as a whole. Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Jemima Kelly flags up the latest odds: In another sign of global anxiety, Fitch has just cut the outlook on Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating to negative, from stable. Fitch left Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rating at A (only the sixth-highest level), but warned that it is losing faith in its government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commitment to fiscal consolidation. Tokyo has just postponed plans to raise the sales tax, and could be forced into launching another stimulus package to spur growth. City firm ETX Capital believes there is a growing chance that Britain votes to leave the EU, given the latest polling. Joe Rundle, their head of trading, explains: Momentum is behind the Vote Leave camp as polls seem to show more support for Brexit than at any point in the campaign so far. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen heavy selling and shortened our Brexit market price from over 80% - implying a one-in-five chance of Britain leaving the EU \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to 66%, which indicates a one-in-three chance of Brexit. Betfair, the online gambling company, also reports that more money is being wagered on Brexit. It now estimates there is a 34% chance of the Leave campaign winning, based on betting patterns. Investors have also been dizzied by the flurry of opinion polls, which have shown the vote is tight: The cost of insuring against the pound tumbling against the euro over the next month has hit a record high this morning. Reuters explains: Euro/sterling one-month implied volatility, derived from an option that covers the June 23 referendum date and its aftermath, hit 26.3% according to Reuters data, exceeding the previous record of around 25% hit during the global financial crisis in 2008. The equivalent sterling/dollar one-month implied volatility also rocketed to 28.1%, close to its 2008 peak of around 29%. UK chip-maker ARM is the biggest faller in London this morning, along with financial stocks and miners. ARM is being hit by fears that a global downturn would hurt demand for its semiconductors, helping to drag the FTSE 100 down to a three-week low. UK banks are suffering from concerns over the EU vote, as Conner Campbell of SpreadEx explains: The markets got off to a dreadful start this Monday.... A healthy dose of drag from the Brexit-fearing banking stocks (especially Barclays and Lloyds) is adding to the FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. With the referendum growing ever closer the pound is all set for an ugly week and a half, something immediately in evidence this morning. Cable [\u00c2\u00a3/$] collapsed by another half a percent, leaving sterling at its lowest point against the dollar in 2 months, with a similar pattern occurring against the euro and a whole basket of currencies. This chart shows how the London stock market has dropped back to its recent lows: The London stock market is now at its lowest level since May 20. The FTSE 100 has lost 200 points since last Wednesday; today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff, plus the heavy losses on Thursday and Friday, have wiped out the gains of the last three weeks. As feared, European markets are falling at the start of trading. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has already shed 43 points, or 0.7%. There are deeper losses across the channel, with the French CAC down 1% and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX losing 1.2%. Brexit is obviously a factor, as is new data showing Chinese investment growth hitting a 10-year low. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153risk aversion\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is rife this morning: Investors continue to fret over global growth with China weekend data failing to inspire and the IMF sounding the alarm (again) over a Chinese corporate debt bubble. Anxiety persists about the risks of a UK vote to leave the EU (Brexiety?) and traders prepare themselves for a hat-trick of central bank updates this week - from the US Federal Reserve (Wednesday), the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England (both on Thursday). The pound is sliding against other major currencies this morning, as worries about a possible Brexit take hold. Sterling hit a two-month low against the US dollar in early trading, losing 0.5% or 0.7 of a cent to $1.4182, a drop of 0.7 of a cent. This adds to Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tumble, which wiped two cents off the pound. Sterling has also hit a six-week low against the euro, at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.2592, as traders bail out of sterling. Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman, reckons the pound may drop further this week: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ahead of the referendum, many look for sterling to underperform and the yen and Swiss franc to outperform,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The euro and central and eastern European currencies are vulnerable, while risk assets, in general, are expected to weaken on a Brexit victory,.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Asian stock markets have already suffered chunky losses overnight, with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei tumbling by 3.5%. Worries over the global economy, and Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum, also sent China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market down 2% and wiped almost 1% off the Australia market. Analysts at RBS Capital Markets say: The market opened in Asia in the same spirit as it closed on Friday: equity markets were under heavy pressure losing more than 2% across the board Money has poured into the Japanese yen, as investors flee shares and the pound in favour of safe-haven assets. That has hit Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exporters, who are already vulnerable to a slowdown in global growth. And investors expect more swings this week. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest story on the markets: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Hold onto your hats. Investors are starting the week in gloomy mood, which means we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to see fresh falls on the European stock markets when trading begins. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares is expected to shed 1%, or 61 points, when the markets open. That adds to Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 116-point tumble, which wiped out around \u00c2\u00a317bn of value. With Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum just 10 days away, traders are increasingly jump about the prospect of a Brexit. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weighing on the pound, which is losing ground this morning as opinion polls show the race is still very close. The markets are also anxious about the state of the global economy, which looks bruised even without the shock of a Brexit. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank, the Federal Reserve, meets to set interest rates this week. Few traders expect a hike at this meeting, but they are nervous that the Fed could still raise rates too quickly. Kit Juckes, currency expert at French bank Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale, explains why the City is so jittery: If the global economy does not slide towards recession, the Fed will eventually raise rates (timidly). That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the best-case scenario, one in which oil-sensitive currencies can gain, but China-sensitive ones will struggle. The risk is that growth slows more sharply in China, causing capital to take fright. Pity the currencies of nations with big current account deficits then [such as the UK]. There are other dangers lurking too, like the UK referendum, the US presidential election and rising anti-European sentiment into the 2017 elections. So, lots to worry about today.....",

                "bodyText":"Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has hit a new three-month low as Brexit worries sweep through the City. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index has closed down 121 points at 5923, its lowest level since late February, and its fourth day of heavy falls. That wipes around \u00c2\u00a330bn off its value. The Footsie has now shed 378 points since the start of trading on Thursday, when Brexit fears began to mount. That means a staggering \u00c2\u00a398bn has been wiped off the value of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest companies in four trading days. Sterling is also languishing at two-month lows; the pound has lost 1.1% against the US dollar to $1.4108 at pixel time. The TNS poll, showing a seven-point lead for the Leave campaign, sent shares down heavily in late trading. Mining shares are among the top fallers, reflecting fears about the global economy. Housebuilders such as Taylor Wimpey and Barratt Development also suffered falls; they would be hit by a decline in the UK housing market if the Bank of England raised interest rates to prop up sterling. The prospect of Britain voting to leave the EU next week also sparked big losses across Europe, sending markets to three-month lows. German DAX: down 1.5% French CAC: down 2.3% Spanish IBEX: down 1.9% Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says fear is gripping the markets - driving money into save-havens such as German bonds. Yet another day in the red for European markets has seen fears surrounding a potential Brexit continue to restrain risk appetite. The flight to safety is clearly evident in the foreign exchange markets, with money moving out of European currencies and into distant havens such as the yen and dollar. With the news that Germany has joined the negative 10-year club, it is clear that investors are looking for a shelter from the storm that is moving in over the next two weeks. Yet another EU referendum poll has hammered home the increasing threat of a Brexit next week, with the TNS poll coming out heavily in favour of the UK leaving the EU today. What initially looked like an anomaly, has turned into the norm, with 8 of the last 10 polls coming out in favour of a Brexit. And on that note, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m wrapping up for day. Our politics liveblog has full action from the Referendum campaign. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW In other news, retail magnate Sir Philip Green has just announced that he will attend a parliamentary hearing tomorrow on the collapse of BHS. Green had threatened not to appear unless Frank Field, the chairman of the work and pensions committee, stepped down, and accused Field of trying to destroy his reputation. Now, though, Green has decided to give his side of the story. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to explain why he sold BHS for \u00c2\u00a31 to a man with no retail experience, how much he took out of the company during his ownership, and how he plans to help fix its pension black hole. Kick-off 9.15am sharp! The Brexit referendum has come at a tricky time for the global economy. Investors have been fretting for months about China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowing economy, while the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weak recovery has been an ongoing sore. So the prospect of Europe being thrown into political crisis has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153added fuel to the fire\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for nervous investors, says Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets. Markets are already worried about slowing global growth and the inability of central bank policy to stem the decline. The June 23 EU referendum gives a specific date when all the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s troubles could come to a head. Stocks and the British pound are being shunned in favour of havens like German and British bonds, the yields of which have struck new record lows. Expectations of weak global growth and ever-enduring easy monetary policy, likely to be reinforced at central bank meeting this week, is seeing a mass exit from equities and feeding demand for bonds, sending yields to record lows. The London stock market has now suffer four days of steady losses, as the City has become steadily consumed by the looming EU vote. Mihir Kapadia, CEO at Sun Global Investments, says the markets are being hit hard by Brexit uncertainty. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122The risk of a potential \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBrexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is dominating global markets today as we enter the home straight towards the influential EU referendum vote on 23 June. Investors seem to have suddenly woken up to Brexit risk and have become nervous.... The London stock market has hit a new three-month low as it staggers towards the close with fresh losses. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares just fell as low as 5944 points, a loss of 101 points today. Almost every share has lost ground. Mining group Anglo American is the worst performer, down 4.6%. Ouch. The pound just slipped below $1.41 for the first time in two months. The TNS poll, showed Leave holding a 7-point lead, is clearly weighting on the markets. Investors haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been this worried about a sterling crisis since the aftermath of Lehman Brothers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 collapse: The pound just took another knock, after the TNS polling company reported that the Leave campaign have a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significant lead\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the run-up to the EU referendum. TNS says that Leave is on 47% of the vote, with Remain trailing at 40% (with 13% of voters still undecided). And sterling is now down one and a half cents, or 1%, at $1.411 - its lowest point of the day. Insiders at the European Central Bank have revealed they would publicly pledge to backstop financial markets, in partnership with the Bank of England, should Britain vote to leave the European Union. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a clear signal that central bankers are preparing for Britain to shock the global markets and vote for Brexit. Reuters has the story. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: The preparations illustrate the heightened state of alert ahead of the June 23 referendum, which will help determine Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future in trade and world affairs and also shape the EU. The pound and euro have lost value on fears a Brexit could tip the 28-member bloc into recession. Such an announcement from the ECB would come on June 24 if an early-morning result showed that British voters had chosen to leave the EU, according to the sources. The aim is to underpin investor confidence across Europe and contain further market jitters. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There will be a statement to do whatever it takes to maintain adequate market liquidity,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said one senior central bank official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge would involve opening so-called swap lines with the Bank of England, allowing euros and sterling to be exchanged and effectively making unlimited funding in both currencies available to European banks, the sources said. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: Exclusive: ECB would pledge to backstop markets after a Brexit - sources The US stock market has opened calmly, bring some order to proceedings after a volatile European session. The Dow Jones industrial average has dipped by 0.1%, or 15 points, while the Nasdaq index of tech stocks is up 0.2%. Investors may be keen to sit sight until the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum has been cleared up; and few believe the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates at this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two-day meeting (which finishes tomorrow). Christopher Vecchio, currency analyst at DailyFX, says: With all the attention on the Brexit, the central bank meetings this week have seemed to take a back seat. This makes sense, though. If the Fed hikes, and there is a Brexit? The Fed will have to backtrack, which will cost them credibility Pro-Brexit economist Dr Gerard Lyons has written a piece for us, arguing that UK manufacturing could thrive outside the EU. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: In the future we can craft policy to suit domestic needs, not least the possibility of an industrial policy if we wanted it. We could directly help sectors. The US, never accused of not being free market, directly targets help to strategic sectors, like autos. So too could we if we wished. EU state aid rules prevent the ability to selectively help areas or sectors. Add in the need to abide by EU regional development criteria, and our hands are tied on regional policy too. More here: Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, says the Bank of England will be delighted that UK inflation remained at 0.3% last month. He explains: For the Bank of England, lower than expected inflation is a double bonus. On the one hand, it increases the spending power of households and so boosts growth. On the other, it provides greater wriggle room before the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% inflation target comes under serious threat. With the referendum making the outlook so uncertain, the extra leeway will be extremely welcome in Threadneedle Street. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Larry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s analysis: Here comes the US retail sales figures for May.... ...and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve beaten expectations, with sales growing by 0.5% during the month. That suggests American consumers are continuing to spend, and haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been spooked by the latest twists in the race to succeed president Obama, or by the Brexit campaign. However.... it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partly due to more expensive gasoline; fuel spending jumped by 2.1%, reflecting higher price at the pumps The boss of French insurance group Axa has gone public with his concerns about next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum. Axa CEO Henri de Castries told a conference in Paris that the chances of Brexit are now \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extremely high\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It would leave investors strugging to navigate \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a true landscape of uncertainties\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he warned. De Castries added that the future is uncertain, even if Britain votes to stay in the EU (via Bloomberg): \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If they remain, the situation isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t simple either, and this is underestimated by lots of people.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Stresses in the financial markets have jumped to their highest level since late February: Times City hack Simon English highlights how the mood has changed: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borrowing costs are also hitting fresh all-time lows today. The yield on UK 10-year gilts has slid to just 1.15% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is the lowest borrowing rate on record. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sharp fall from the 1.21% yield yesterday. [yields, or interest rates, fall when the price of a bond rises] At the start of 2015, Britain was paying 2% to borrow for a decade. Leave campaigner Douglas Carswell claims that this shows that investors are relaxed about the prospect of Britain quitting the EU.... However, falling bond yields is usually a sign that the City is worried \u00e2\u20ac\u201c buying bonds as a way of protecting their cash. David Miller, investment director at fund manager Quilter Cheviot, says the markets are worried about the referendum , rather than \u00e2\u20ac\u0153looking good\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.... Markets are in a strange state. Gilt yields are lower than any time since records began in 1729 and companies are issuing huge amounts of corporate debt in order to take advantage of low interest rates. Short term traders and long term investors are on the sidelines waiting for the referendum result. Referendum uncertainty is damaging confidence and there is evidence of a slowdown in economic activity. Markets and social media amplify the daily headlines created by the politicians. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is plumbing new lows as traders continue to quake in the shadow of the EU vote. The FTSE 100 has shed 77 points, or 1.3%, to 5967 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c falling through the 6,000 point mark for the first time since late February. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says stock market bulls are racing to the exits, before the UK makes its own exit decision: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Equity indices are extending their losses, fearful of a now heightened prospect that the UK votes to leave the European Union, worsening an already fragile global growth situation by delivering an economic and political blow to a struggling Eurozone. And Chris Beauchamp of IG says traders are reacting to the latest polls, and the Sun newspaper\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to back the Leave campaign. Panic appears to be gripping markets as the headlines fill up with references to a possible Brexit, with the Sun\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s declaration for Brexit emblematic of the worry that the Remain campaign has lost a crucial segment of the population.... The move in the polls has been matched by a noticeable shift in the IG Brexit binary, with clients now thinking that the chance of the UK voting to leave has now hit 40.5%, up from the low 30s yesterday. A Brexit isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fully priced in, though, Beauchamp adds: What is interesting is, despite the sharp selloff in sterling in recent days, the pound is still holding on above $1.41.. Either this is a symptom of limited volumes as traders abandon the field, or a sign that the market still thinks the status quo will win out in the end. European stock markets are also deep in the red. France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC is down 1.2%, while the German DAX is down 0.7%, as traders continue to dump shares and buy bonds (which is why German 10-year bond yields are now negative) This chart shows why Brexit would have such an impact on the European political landscape: Breaking: The Bank of England had allocated almost \u00c2\u00a32.5bn of cash to City firms to help them handle any Brexit-related panic. This is the result of the first special liquidity operation run by the BoE, ahead of next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum. The auction was designed to prevent the money markets running dry, if panic broke out over the referendum. Banks can swap assets for ready cash, and only have to repay the funds in six months. But the take-up is actually quite modest, and the lowest for any such market operation since February. Last week, for example, firms took around \u00c2\u00a33.2bn of liquidity via a regular operation. Reuters has the details: BANK OF ENGLAND SAYS ALLOTS \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.455BN IN PRE-REFERENDUM INDEXED LONG-TERM REPO BANK OF ENGLAND REPO RESULTS SHOW BIDS RECEIVED FROM BANKS AND FUNDS ALLOTTED LOWEST SINCE FEB 2016 So, this suggests the City is still operating as normal, despite the recent tumble in the pound and in share prices. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some instant reaction, from Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ed Conway: And from private equity firm Pegasus: The inflation report didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have much impact on the pound, which is still down around 1% against the US dollar. Joshua Raymond of City broker XTB.com says next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum is still dominating the markets. May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation reading is unlikely to have any impact at the Bank of England, who remain expected to keep interest rates on hold for the remainder of the year. As such, the reaction to this data in the pound was minimal, and the main driver for pound buyers or sellers right now continues to be the uncertainty over a potential Brexit, with the latest polls showing a strengthening in popularity for the leave camp. With inflation this low, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no chance that the Bank of England will raise interest rates when policymakers meet on Thursday. Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, reckons borrowing costs will remain extremely low for many months: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Inflation is up from its all-time lows but is still way too low. The fight against low inflation continues. The era of ultra-low interest rates has much further to run. Maike Currie, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International, has summed up today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation data: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153After falling to 0.3% in April, inflation remains unchanged in May, below the 15-month peak of 0.5% recorded in March this year. Rising oil prices pushing up the cost of filling up your petrol tank coupled with eating out at restaurants and the price of smartphone services were the main upward drivers. This was offset by falls in clothing and food prices. Since the beginning of the year, the pound has been markedly weaker, which is also likely to have pushed up prices. UK house price inflation has also slowed down, perhaps reflecting economic uncertainty ahead of the EU referendum. The ONS reports that the cost of average house rose by 8.2% annually in April, down from 8.5% in March. Prices rose fastest in London (+14.5%) and the East of England (13.6%), but only rose by 0.1% in the North East. And there are some stark regional differences, with the Welsh town of Merthyr Tydfil suffering the biggest fall in house prices. The inflation report also shows that UK consumers have been hit by the recent recovery in the oil price. Transport costs climbed 0.9% in May, partly due to a 3p rise in a litre of diesel. Rising sea fares also had an upward impact, picking up slightly in 2016 after falling a year ago. Clothing and footwear prices fell by 0.2% between April and May this year, helping to keep the cost of living low. The downward contribution came from a variety of clothing but particularly children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outerwear. Food and non-alcoholic beverage prices fell by 0.4% between April and May 2016. The downward contribution came from a variety of food product groups, most notably vegetables and confectionery. Recreation and culture prices, fell by 0.4%: The downward contribution came mainly from games, toys and hobbies (particularly computer games) with prices falling between April and May 2016 compared with a rise last year. At just 0.3%, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation rate remains stubbornly low below the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target. Breaking: The UK inflation rate remained at 0.3% in May, below the 0.4% expected by the City. That matches April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading for the consumer prices index. The Office for National Statistics says the clothing and footwear, recreation and culture and food and beverages had the largest downward pressure on the inflation rate. Transport, restaurants and hotels and communication services had the largest upward pressures. More details and reaction to follow... The deputy chief of the International Monetary Fund has warned that Brexit would damage trade and hurt the global economy. David Lipton, first deputy managing director of the IMF, told a press conference in Beijing that the referendum comes at a difficult time for the world economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very hard to anticipate what those effects [of Brexit] may be, that uncertainty would be a negative factor and come at a time when the global recovery remains slow and somewhat weak. That kind of uncertainty would be unhelpful.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ouch. The FTSE 100 has now tumbled below the 6,000 mark for the first time since February 25. The index has shed 50 points this morning, or 0.8%, to 5994 points. Banks, building firms and miners are leading the selloff, while only four blue-chip shares index have risen: FXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed confirms that investors are racing to safe-haven assets: Markets anxiety was clearly reflected in CBOE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s volatility index \u00e2\u20ac\u0153VIX\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which climbed above 20 for the first time since late February, indicating that investors are now taking the vote more seriously than in the past couple of weeks, and accordingly are adjusting their portfolios. European stock markets have hit their lowest levels since last February, as Brexit fears stalk the trading floors. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has shed 34 points in early trading, down 0.5% at 6010. And there are deeper losses in other markets; the French CAC has lost 1.2% and the German DAX is down 0.9%. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx says pre-referendum fears are growing. The latest Guardian/ICM survey has the Leave campaign with a 6 point advantage, with polls from the ORB/Telegraph and YouGov/Times suggesting similar leads for Boris Johnson and co. Perhaps most damning is the fact that The Sun this morning came out in favour of a Brexit with a flashy and trashy editorial on the reason why Britain should quit the EU. The Brexiters have begun to dominate the conversation at the key time, and as shown by the market reaction there is a genuine fear that Europe is on a collision course with history. Boom! Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-year bond yield has just turned negative as investors scramble to buy debt issued by Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest member. This means they are effectively paying to lend to Berlin for a decade, in another sign that fear is gripping the markets today. In another sign of market angst, the interest rates on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government debt has hit a record low. The price of a UK 10-year gilt has hit record highs this morning, as money pours into government debt. And that has driven down the interest rates (or yield) on the debt to just 1.187%. You could argue that this is a sign of optimism in the UK. But I think it actually shows that investors are worried, and piling into safe assets -- as other government bonds are also hitting record highs. The Bank of England is preparing to pump billions of pounds into the UK financial sector today. This is the first of three special scheduled liquidity auctions planned around the EU referendum on 23 June. It will allow financial institutions to get their hands on cash, by swapping assets such as mortgages loans. The idea is to prevent the money markets seizing up, if worried banks are reluctant to trade with each other. The BoE usually holds such auctions, called Additional Indexed Long-Term Repo operations (ILTRs), once a month. These three extra auctions are meant to avoid turmoil breaking out in the markets (as we reported earlier this month). We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expecting to get the results around 10.40am. They will show just how worried the City is about a potential Brexit. Sterling is starting the morning on the back foot, as traders digest reports of rising panic inside Downing Street about the EU referendum. The pound has dropped by over one cent against the US dollar, to $1.4149. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close to the two-month low hit yesterday morning (before sterling curiously bounced back). Against the euro, the pound is down half a percent at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.2561. Sterling has also hit a three-year low against the Japanese currency. It now only buys 150 yen, compared with more than 190 a year ago. The yen is strengthening generally today, as investors race into safe-haven currencies. Yesterday, a Guardian/ICM poll showed that the Leave campaign now hold a five-point lead. That has helped to spark serious alarm among remain campaigners that Britain could be on the verge of voting to leave the EU. The news that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most popular newspaper (which like to pin its colours to a winning horse) is backing Brexit is also hitting the pound: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Inflation Tuesday, the time when we find out how the cost of living changed in the UK in the last month. Fuel prices probably picked up in May, due to the rise in crude oil prices. But consumers have also benefitted from falling clothing prices. The data comes at 9.30am GMT, along with house price inflation figures for April. Economists predict that the consumer prices index rose by 0.4%, up from 0.3% a month ago. That would take us a little closer to the official 2% target \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and a strong reading might, usually, reignite talk of interest rate hikes. But these are not normal times, of course. The EU referendum is just nine days away, so the City is getting increasingly agitated about the prospect of Brexit. The pound is taking the brunt of this, being buffeted by the latest opinion polls which have shown a steady move towards leaving the EU. Analysts expect a lot more volatility over the next few weeks. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why the Bank of England is offering the City fresh liquidity today, to help them handle any turmoil (more on that in a moment). Also coming up: The latest eurozone industrial production figures, at 10am BST US retail sales at 1.30pm BST Investors are also bracing for central bank action this week, with the US Federal Reserve setting monetary policy on Wednesday, followed by the Bank of Japan and the BoE on Thursday. So it could be another volatile day....",

It would rather delay the day when the eurozone has to sign up to fiscal transfers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c rich countries paying for poorer members \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to ensure long-term survival. Treaty changes will be necessary and demands for referendums will only be encouraged by the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s example. While one vote to leave the EU might be tolerable, two might lead to a deeper unravelling, especially if the next opt-out were to be a eurozone member such as the Netherlands. Have markets priced in such political risks? Almost certainly not. There has been a modest widening of bond spreads between Germany and so-called peripheral eurozone members, like Spain and Portugal, but faith remains high in the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to do \u00e2\u20ac\u0153whatever it takes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to keep the show on the road. Maybe, in the long-run, a UK exit from the EU would have a bracing effect of the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to cure its deep economic ills. That must be one possible script since eurozone politicians seem capable of collective action only when presented with a crisis. Just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect markets to display any such breezy confidence if they wake up to a leave vote on 24 June. If Grexit looked scary, Brexit raises bigger uncertainties. The past week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market action, one suspects, would look like a tea party. Shy Green comes out of his shell Hurrah, Sir Philip Green has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153given long and hard thought to the matter\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and decided to turn up to answer questions from MPs on Wednesday about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the very sad BHS story\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still complaining about parliamentarians making up their minds before they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve heard the evidence but, never mind, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be there. But, please, Sir Philip, drop the parallel grumble about this being your \u00e2\u20ac\u0153first and only opportunity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to tell your side of tale. You were free at any point since BHS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration in April to give an account. You could have issued a statement, held a press conference, whatever you wished. You have never previously been shy about sharing your views. Well done, the MPs, for ensuring we hear them. Bookies need a nought to worry about Is the Gambling Commission getting tougher? Well, the financial penalties for disobeying anti-money laundering and responsible gambling rules are becoming bigger. Betfred received an \u00c2\u00a3800,000 penalty on Tuesday. That \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and an \u00c2\u00a3880,000 hit to GalaCoral a few weeks ago \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was a step up from the derisory \u00c2\u00a3280,000 handed down to Paddy Power earlier in the year. All different cases, of course. But given the size of some of these firms, penalties of less than \u00c2\u00a31m don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hurt. Add a zero and the commission might get noticed in boardrooms.",

While the good times had been rolling, he says, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d stopped paying attention. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d just bought a $2.5m castle. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I was a millionaire by the age of 26 and I was broke by the age of 26 and a half.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2JKXbVGq7A\">He likens it to the Seinfeld episode</a> where Jerry takes the offer of a seat in first class because Elaine hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ever been and so doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s missing out on. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That was my life.

Then comes the redemption, almost biblical in his retelling: the soles of his shoes wearing out from his pounding the pavement, evenings spent icing his knuckles after days of door-knocking.</p> <p>Hard work pays off is the lesson here, one of several Altman has for the gathered Australian real estate agents.

It helps.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd </p> <p>He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s joking, but what does help is selling luxury properties worth many millions of dollars to people with just that to burn. Mansions of between $1m and $5m are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153flying off the shelves\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Altman; his clients are among the richest celebrities in the world. (No wonder they \u00e2\u20ac\u0153love what they do\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, his No 1 rule for success.)</p> <p>How hard can it be to sell them a house?</p> <p>I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d imagined that for the super rich, property was a negligible expense like the gum or discounted chocolate bars that you chuck on to the conveyer belt while in line at the supermarket \u00e2\u20ac\u201c yeah, thinks Kylie Jenner, Mom won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t notice <a href=\"http://la.curbed.com/2016/5/19/11715586/kylie-jenner-house-hidden-hills\">a $6m six-bedroom house in the Hidden Hills</a>. (Just kidding, she bought it herself!)</p> <p>To hear Altman tell it, that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem so far from the truth. He convinced the actor Tyler Perry, net worth $400m, to sell his house after he got on to the treadmill next to him at the gym. Perry told him he hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been to the house in more than a year.</p> <p>Altman made more than half a million dollars, he says, on a day when he had nothing to do.</p> <p>Another time, Altman sold a property to an NBA star he introduced himself to while in line at Starbucks, who volunteered that he was at that moment in the market for three: for himself, his family and his entourage.

While the good times had been rolling, he says, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d stopped paying attention. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d just bought a $2.5m castle. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I was a millionaire by the age of 26 and I was broke by the age of 26 and a half.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He likens it to the Seinfeld episode where Jerry takes the offer of a seat in first class because Elaine hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ever been and so doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s missing out on. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That was my life. I knew exactly what I was missing,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. This was Josh Altman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rock bottom: making a $800,000 loss on his castle, having his luxury cars taken away, a brush with depression. Then comes the redemption, almost biblical in his retelling: the soles of his shoes wearing out from his pounding the pavement, evenings spent icing his knuckles after days of door-knocking. Hard work pays off is the lesson here, one of several Altman has for the gathered Australian real estate agents. The first is: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Get a reality show. It helps.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s joking, but what does help is selling luxury properties worth many millions of dollars to people with just that to burn. Mansions of between $1m and $5m are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153flying off the shelves\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Altman; his clients are among the richest celebrities in the world. (No wonder they \u00e2\u20ac\u0153love what they do\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, his No 1 rule for success.) How hard can it be to sell them a house? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d imagined that for the super rich, property was a negligible expense like the gum or discounted chocolate bars that you chuck on to the conveyer belt while in line at the supermarket \u00e2\u20ac\u201c yeah, thinks Kylie Jenner, Mom won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t notice a $6m six-bedroom house in the Hidden Hills. (Just kidding, she bought it herself!) To hear Altman tell it, that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem so far from the truth. He convinced the actor Tyler Perry, net worth $400m, to sell his house after he got on to the treadmill next to him at the gym. Perry told him he hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been to the house in more than a year. Altman made more than half a million dollars, he says, on a day when he had nothing to do. Another time, Altman sold a property to an NBA star he introduced himself to while in line at Starbucks, who volunteered that he was at that moment in the market for three: for himself, his family and his entourage. (Altman offered him $1,000 to get in his car there and then.) For all their earlier reluctance to identify as real estate addicts, the audience is well and truly warmed up by the time it comes for questions and answers, grilling the Altman brothers on the finer points of their success as though it could be replicated to scale. One man asks if they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d ever invest in Sydney. They should have, says Matt Altman: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m still angry about Barangaroo.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd They were advised to invest in the waterfront property complex (a controversial development still under way) on their last visit to Australia. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The answer is yes, and I should have done it last year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Josh Altman remarks on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extremely cool, sexy houses\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Sydney, just like those in vogue in Beverly Hills. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d totally buy them \u00e2\u20ac\u201c except yours are way too overpriced.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Just about the only concession made to the school of thought that there might be more to life than closing deals and making money comes in the last five minutes. As much as he wants \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to sell every house in the world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Altman says he wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to take 5% to the grave with him. He then turns his iPhone towards himself with the crowd in the background. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to take a video, and he wants a little bit of audience interaction. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What do you guys do?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he asks the camera. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I sell the dream!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the crowd shouts. The article was amended on 16 June 2016 to correct the figure in Josh Altman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dream. His 5% commission on $200m would have been $10m, not $1m.",

This is perhaps seen most clearly in the strong performance of safe havens such as the Japanese yen and the price of gold, which have been tracking the latest referendum odds closely. However, this may not last much longer \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for three main reasons. </p> <p>First, to some extent the nervousness in the markets simply reflects the fact that no-one yet knows the result of the referendum on the 23rd, which is too close to call... </p> <p>Second, even if the vote is for Brexit, the UK would probably remain a member of the EU for several years. The result of the referendum would only be advisory. While UK politicians cannot ignore the views of the electorate completely, most favour Remain and could drag the process out or try to find a relationship which replicates EU membership in all but name... </p> <p>Third, the rhetoric of global policy-makers is likely to change dramatically. Currently those favouring Remain have an incentive to talk up the risks of Brexit in an attempt to influence the electorate. But once the votes have been cast, we would expect them to seek to reassure businesses and investors instead.</p> <p> Admittedly, a UK vote for Brexit (or even a narrow majority for Remain) might embolden EU-sceptics elsewhere in Europe. Other governments may not be able to resist pressure for their own referendums. Brexit could conceivably be the first step towards the break-up of the EU, or the exit of one or more countries from the euro... </p> <p>The upshot is that the initial market turmoil created by a Brexit vote may be both smaller and shorter-lived than many fear. Indeed, even sterling may not react in the way that many expect. It is likely that worries about the impact on the UK economy would initially cause the pound to weaken \u00e2\u20ac\u201c perhaps to as low as $1.20.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile Capital Economics has been rehearsing the various outcomes of the referendum in more detail:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CapEconUK/status/743464367669317632\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Regardless of which way <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/EUref?src=hash\">#EUref</a> vote goes, whether it is won by big or small margin will have implications.

                "bodyText":"In another volatile day, leading shares fell back as concerns about the effect of a Brexit vote grew, along with nervousness after the US Federal Reserve expressed caution about the global economy. But markets came off their lows, helped by a recovery on Wall Street and despite continuing weakness in the oil price, with Brent crude down more than 3%. At one point the FTSE 100 hit its lowest point since mid-February but it ended only marginally down at 5950. But analysts at Morgan Stanley warned the leading index could fall as low as 5,000 if the UK voted to leave the EU. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 0.27% or 16.32 points to 5950.48 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 0.59% to 9550.47 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.45% at 4153.01 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.98% to 16,351.90 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 0.62% at 8199.9 In Greece, the Athens market lost 3.31% to 556.48 despite news that the next tranche of bailout money was set to be given the go-ahead On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is barely changed, up 9 points or 0.05%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has cancelled his planned speech on fintech at the Mansion House tonight following the terrible attack on MP Jo Cox. The Bank said: In the light of the dreadful attack today on Jo Cox MP the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, will no longer be delivering the planned speech at Mansion House. The Governor will be attending the event and will now deliver a short speech reflecting on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s events. Over in Greece, the country is likely to get the formal go-ahead for a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7.5bn loan tranche on Friday, after it met all the requirements demanded by creditors. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem said Greece had met all the prior actions necessary, while the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos said the first review of Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bailout programme was now essentially completed. On Friday the European Stability Mechanism is set to ratify the payment. Tsakalotos said, as reported by the Athens-Macedonian news agency: I appreciate that for many Greeks things are still very difficult, since we passed a lot of difficult measures. I feel a need to say that the next year must not just be the year when we exit the crisis through growth, but a time when we place emphasis on the qualitative aspects of this growth. The market worries about the UK leaving the EU may be overdone, says Julian Jessop at Capital Economics: Nervousness about Brexit has obviously been having an increasing impact on sentiment in global markets. This is perhaps seen most clearly in the strong performance of safe havens such as the Japanese yen and the price of gold, which have been tracking the latest referendum odds closely. However, this may not last much longer \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for three main reasons. First, to some extent the nervousness in the markets simply reflects the fact that no-one yet knows the result of the referendum on the 23rd, which is too close to call... Second, even if the vote is for Brexit, the UK would probably remain a member of the EU for several years. The result of the referendum would only be advisory. While UK politicians cannot ignore the views of the electorate completely, most favour Remain and could drag the process out or try to find a relationship which replicates EU membership in all but name... Third, the rhetoric of global policy-makers is likely to change dramatically. Currently those favouring Remain have an incentive to talk up the risks of Brexit in an attempt to influence the electorate. But once the votes have been cast, we would expect them to seek to reassure businesses and investors instead. Admittedly, a UK vote for Brexit (or even a narrow majority for Remain) might embolden EU-sceptics elsewhere in Europe. Other governments may not be able to resist pressure for their own referendums. Brexit could conceivably be the first step towards the break-up of the EU, or the exit of one or more countries from the euro... The upshot is that the initial market turmoil created by a Brexit vote may be both smaller and shorter-lived than many fear. Indeed, even sterling may not react in the way that many expect. It is likely that worries about the impact on the UK economy would initially cause the pound to weaken \u00e2\u20ac\u201c perhaps to as low as $1.20. Meanwhile Capital Economics has been rehearsing the various outcomes of the referendum in more detail: But the pound has recovered from lows after England won the Euro 2016 match against Wales. Coincidence? Or was it that brokers were watching the match and weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t around to halt the slide? And this: Sterling is under pressure, shares are falling, oil and base metals are down, but gold continues to be a haven for investors. Gold has jumped from $1292 an ounce to $1311, a near two year high, on worries about Brexit, as well as the US Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s caution about the global economy. A survey of companies finds 35% of them think that the UK leaving the EU would be harmful, writes Katie Allen: A third of businesses in the UK think Brexit would be bad for the economy, according to a poll that also shows company bosses in London and Scotland are most worried about a vote to leave the EU in next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum. The survey of 3,394 business owners and finance directors found those in the Midlands, east of England and northern England were the most optimistic about Brexit being helpful to the economy. The survey, by Charterhouse Research consultancy, found 35% of respondents thought Brexit would be harmful, 25% thought it would be good for the economy and 39% did not think it would make any difference. The full story is here: Despite the poll lead for the Leave campaign, some spread betting clients appear to take the opposite view, according to Spreadex financial analyst Connor Campbell: Interestingly for all the Brexit-fear currently plaguing the markets, Spreadex has seen a consistent trend of clients opting to put their money behind the Remainers. In both size and frequency of bet choosing to stay in the EU has come out on top, that support by and large continuing throughout the last fortnight despite the deluge of polls having Vote Leave pulling ahead. Of course this is no guarantee that Britain will still be in the EU come Friday 24 June. However, in the run up to the general election last year Spreadex\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clients consistently backed a Conservative majority even as the polls predicted the tightest race in decades, so it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hard to imagine a similar outcome this time around. Britain leaving the EU would not have a direct effect on the Russian economy, said the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina, repeating comments she made a week or so ago. In an interview with CNBC (transcript here ) ahead of her appearance at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, she said foreign investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 perception of the Russian economy has improved. And after last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate cut she said the central bank might reduce its key rate further. In line with other global markets, US shares have come under pressure on fears of Brexit and the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s caution about the global economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 130 points or 0.7%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.38% lower and Nasdaq down 0.5%. The US opening fall has seen the declines in other markets accelerate, with the FTSE 100 now down 62 points or 1%. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is down 1.3% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac has lost 0.95%. Meanwhile there have been some mixed economic numbers from the US. Consumer price inflation rose 0.2%% in May, down on the April figure of 0.4%. Analysts had expected a rise of 0.3%. Core inflation was unchanged at +0.2% Weekly jobless claims jumped to 277,000, compared to expectations of a 267,000 increase, while the Philadelphia Federal Reserve business conditions index came in at 4.7 compared to expectations of a flat performance. David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spread Co, said: The dollar fell in the immediate aftermath of the releases while stock index futures also declined. Referendum or no referendum, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a growing feeling that the Fed has lost the plot when it comes to monetary policy. The US central bank switches from dovish to hawkish and back again with worrying regularity and has thrown the notion of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153data dependence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd out of the window. It is becoming obvious to an increasing number of investors that the Fed cannot bring itself to raise rates, yet is taking all measures to attempt to hide this fact from the market. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in a corner where hiking raises the prospect of a violent stock market sell-off, whereas a failure to tighten monetary policy suggests deep-rooted economic problems. The continuing uncertainty over a possible Brexit, with polls continuing to show the Leave campaign on the front foot, has sent London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading shares to their lowest level since the middle of February. The FTSE 100 is currently down 0.9% at 5911, a low not seen since February 17. As well as Brexit, the cautious comments from the US Federal Reserve about the global economy are also having an impact. Mining shares are among the main fallers, with copper prices down more than 2% and oil 1.5% lower. However precious metal specialists such as Randgold Resources and Fresnillo are on the rise, as investors seek out gold and silver as havens for their cash. Banks are also under pressure on fears they would be hard hit by a Brexit decision. On the foreign exchange markets the pound is down around a cent at $1.41, a near two month low. Still on interest rates, economist Sam Alderson at the Centre for Economics and Business Research said: In the absence of a vote to leave later this month, interest rates look unlikely to change for some time to come. Given a generally softening domestic economy and relatively gradual recovery in inflation, we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect the MPC to raise rates until the middle of 2017 at the earliest. However, the currency impact of a leave vote is likely to have a notable impact on the outlook for inflation. This in turn will clearly affect the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy stance in the months that follow. UK interest rates would be cut close to zero in the event of a vote to leave the EU, says RBC Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s senior UK economist Sam Hill: The minutes continue to be non-committal on the direction of a change in monetary policy following a Leave vote even though the Committee acknowledge it could \u00e2\u20ac\u0153materially alter the outlook\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Although the MPC only go as far as saying the direction of any move in policy \u00e2\u20ac\u0153will depend on the relative magnitudes of the demand, supply and exchange rate effects\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd we are of the view that Bank Rate would be cut \u00e2\u20ac\u0153towards zero\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the event of Brexit. Any short-term spike in inflation following a decline in the exchange rate we would expect to give way to downward pressure on inflation in the medium term \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy-relevant horizon \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as weak demand is likely to weigh on output. The one change [in the minutes] which was discernable was an increased emphasis on the international implications. Firstly on referendum uncertainty (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The outcome of the referendum continued to be the largest immediate risk facing UK financial markets, and possibly global financial markets.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) and secondly on the event of a Brexit outcome (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Through financial market and confidence channels, there were also risks of adverse spillovers to the global economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). There was also reference to a further fall in sterling \u00e2\u20ac\u0153perhaps sharply\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in a Leave scenario but in the grand scheme of things these minutes don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t add much to what the MPC has already said on the EU referendum. The outlook for policy in the Remain scenario \u00e2\u20ac\u201c effectively the scenario on which the May Inflation Report was conditioned \u00e2\u20ac\u201c isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t likely to be presented with greater clarity until August at the earliest. However, at this stage news since May \u00e2\u20ac\u0153had done relatively little to change the MPC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assessment of the economic outlook\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The Committee has been clear that data are difficult to interpret due to potential referendum effects. The same will be true until such time as it is thought any such effects have unwound after a Remain vote. We concluded last week... that any Remain rebound in economic activity may be underwhelming. So, whilst in that scenario our central case is for a 25 basis point Bank Rate hike in February 2017, the skew of risks is now clearly to a more dovish profile rather than a tightening in 2016. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our report on the Bank of England comments: The Bank of England has issued a fresh warning that a vote to leave the EU in next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum risks knocking economic growth, pushing the pound sharply lower and sending shockwaves through the global economy. Against the backdrop of jittery financial markets, the Bank also revealed its top policymakers had been briefed by staff on contingency planning for the referendum as it readies measures to prevent markets seizing up in the event of a leave vote next week. Announcing its decision to keep interest rates at their record low of 0.5%, the Bank said the referendum on 23 June was the biggest immediate risk to UK financial markets, and perhaps those overseas, and that the current uncertainty was already denting spending. The pound has weakened in the run-up to the vote as opinion polls have pointed to a lead for the leave vote and the Bank warned in minutes to its latest rate-setting meeting that it would fall further in the event of Brexit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The outcome of the referendum continued to be the largest immediate risk facing UK financial markets, and possibly global financial markets,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said the minutes. In addition: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153On the evidence of the recent behaviour of the foreign exchange market, it appears increasingly likely that, were the UK to vote to leave the EU, sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exchange rate would fall further, perhaps sharply.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The full story is here: But alternatively, a remain vote could mean a rate rise, some believe: Some economists believe the Bank of England would slash interest rates to fresh record lows if the UK votes to leave the EU next week. James Knightley of ING predicts an emergency rate cut on Friday if the Leave campaign wins: He writes: In the case of Brexit, there is a high probability that inflation rises sharply as a result of currency weakness, but we think that the BoE will look through this, as they did in 2011. Instead we think the focus will be on the growth risks and financial market turbulence, which would dampen domestic inflation pressures over the medium term. Consequently, we would expect a 25bp rate cut on June 24th. Andrew McPhillips, chief economist at Yorkshire Building Society, also expects a cut: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is likely that if the UK votes to leave the EU, the MPC will cut base rate in an attempt to stabilise the economy. Though this could lead to an increase in inflation due to the depreciation of Sterling, the Bank is likely to be willing to trade that off against trying to maintain economic growth and avoid the risk of increasing unemployment. Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron, a Remain campaigner, has welcomed the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is yet more independent evidence that our economy could plummet if we leave Europe. We cannot afford to let people like Norman Lamont crash the economy for a second time. This is not a political parlour game - people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs, homes and businesses are at risk.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd [Lord Lamont, a Leave supporter, was chancellor on Black Wednesday when Britain crashed out of the European exchange rate mechanism] The pound has fallen since the Bank of England minutes hit the wires. It has lost one cent against the US dollar to hover around $1.41, near to a two-month low. Traders are also reacting to yet another poll showing Leave ahead. Survation reports that 45% of voters support Leave, with 42% backing Remain (and the rest undecided). The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policymakers heard plenty of evidence that the UK economy has weakened due to next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum vote. The minute of the MPC meeting state that: In the corporate sector, this included a sharp decline in the value of commercial real estate transactions and M&amp;A, and reports of delayed business investment. Evidence from the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Agents had suggested increased delays in corporate decision making, which was corroborated by a Deloitte survey of chief financial officers. Survey information from Markit/CIPS and the BCC showed that for a material proportion of responding firms the referendum was having a detrimental effect on business activity, sometimes significantly so. They also point to signs that demand for new cars and houses has fallen recently. However.... the Bank also points out that other surveys have shown consumer demand is solid (such as this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong retail sales). The full Bank of England minutes are here. You can read a summary of the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minutes yourselves, here. The Bank of England appears to have hardened its Brexit warnings, despite pressure from the Leave campaign to cool things down. The Bank of England has also issued a fresh warning that the pound will tumble in the event of a Brexit vote. The minutes state that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153On the evidence of the recent behaviour of the foreign exchange market, it appears increasingly likely that, were the UK to vote to leave the EU, sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exchange rate would fall further, perhaps sharply.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Bank also revealed its top policymakers had been briefed by staff on contingency planning for the referendum as it readies measures to prevent markets seizing up in the event of a leave vote next week. The Bank of England has warned that next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum is already hurting the UK economy. It says there are signs that major spending decisions are being delayed, such as car and house purchases, as consumers and businesses wait to see if the UK votes to leave the European Union. In the minutes of this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monetary policy meeting, just released, they say: The outcome of the referendum continues to be the largest immediate risk facing UK financial markets, and possibly also global financial markets. While consumer spending has been solid, there is growing evidence that uncertainty about the referendum is leading to delays to major economic decisions that are costly to reverse, including commercial and residential real estate transactions, car purchases, and business investment BoE policymakers were unanimous in leaving borrowing costs on hold, and also leaving the quantitative easing programme unchanged. Breaking: The Bank of England has left interest rates unchanged at their record low of 0.5%, continuing a run dating back to March 2009. And here come the minutes of the meeting..... 10 minutes to go..... Bad news from Greece -- the unemployment rate has jumped to 24.9% in the first quarter of this year. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a rise from 24.4% in October-December. Indonesia just surprised the markets by unexpectedly cutting interest rates! Most economists surveyed by Reuters had expected the BoI to hold, butt instead it has eased monetary policy to in a bid to stir growth. Consumer goods giant Unilever has become the latest UK company to encourage staff to vote Remain next week. It has sent a letter to all 100,000 staff, signed by CEO Paul Polman and his three predecessors, saying the firm would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153negatively impacted\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by Brexit, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We therefore hope that in the interests of Unilever, the UK,Europe, and indeed the wider global economy, the UK will choose to Remain and thereby continue to play a central role in Unilever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term growth and prosperity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd So not actually a demand that staff reject Brexit, but a clear nudge..... The Bank of England have now published governor Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s letter to Leave campaigner Bernard Jenkin MP. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a tinglingly robust slapdown to Jenkin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism that the BoE shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make \u00e2\u20ac\u0153public comments\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about the referendum. Carney begins by saying: I am responding to your letter to dispel immediately the numerous and substantial misconceptions it contained. And he then explains that the Bank of England has respected its independence, and stuck firmly to its remit when it has talked about Brexit dangers. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s online here. The US Federal Reserve must take some blame for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff. Last night, the Fed cited weakening economic growth as one reason for leaving interest rates on hold. And that has dampened the mood in the City, says Chris Beauchamp of City firm IG: There has been little to comfort investors over the past 24 hours, which is why yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains have withered on the vine. The Fed meeting was perhaps their best hope, but even here Janet Yellen was not able to offer much in the way of good news. After two hours of trading, every European stock market has lost ground. Worries about the global economy, and central bankers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ability to stimulate growth, are hitting shares -- along with Brexit concerns. Avtar Sandu, senior commodities manager at Phillip Futures in Singapore, told Reuters: The market is going to be soft until next week. The fear is that if the British actually decide to leave the EU there may be some sort of contagion. Investors are also alarmed by the big moves in Japan overnight, with shares sliding and the yen soaring. Boom! UK retail sales jumped by 0.9% last month, beating forecasts of a 0.2% rise. A surge in clothing sales led the recovery, according to the Office for National Statistics. Sales were 6.0% higher than a year ago, the biggest jump since September 2015. Clothing sales jumped by 4.3% during the month, the biggest rise in two years. Brits may have splashed out on new summer outfits as the sun made a rare (if brief) appearance through the clouds. This doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t suggest shoppers are hunkering back in fear that Britain is about to leave the EU. Unless.... The European Central Bank has warned that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum as a threat to the eurozone economy. In its monthly economic outlook, released this morning, the ECB says: Downside risks continue to relate to developments in the global economy, to the upcoming British referendum on EU membership and to other geopolitical risks. The ECB is also worried about the global economy, cautioning that: ....the outlook for emerging market economies remains more uncertain as growth in China decelerates and commodity-exporting countries adjust to lower commodity prices. The pound is weakening this morning, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a full-blown rout. Sterling is down around half a cent against the US dollar at $1.415, and a similar amount against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.256. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fairly muted reaction to this new IPSOS MORI poll putting Leave ahead. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being published in the Evening Standard today, which says: It is the first time since David Cameron pledged the referendum in January 2013 that Vote Leave have come out ahead in the respected monthly Ipsos MORI telephone survey, which is exclusive to the Evening Standard. Immigration has overtaken the economy as the most important issue to how the public will vote, which is a significant boost to Boris Johnson and the Leave campaign. Just in.... a new opinion poll, putting giving the Leave campaign in the lead by 53% to 47%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a significant turnaround compared with last month: All this criticism from the Leave campaign probably won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t prevent the Bank of England from citing Brexit fears in the official minutes of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s MPC meeting. It would be odd, frankly, if they ignored it, given the recent volatility. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx reckons it could spark a deeper selloff. The FTSE could well see its losses intensify as the day goes on with the Bank of England set to stoke those Brexit-fearing fires later this morning with a firmer warning against leaving the EU (the central bank is also expected to unsurprisingly keep interest rates on hold). Mark Carney faced a lot of criticism last time he expressed an opinion on the referendum, so expect an apoplectic reaction from Vote Leave (and perhaps another fall from the pound) as Thursday continues. Crumbs, the Bank of England is really under fire from the Brexit camp. Bernard Jenkin MP, a director of the Vote Leave campaign, has written to governor Mark Carney warning him not to breach the pre-referendum \u00e2\u20ac\u0153purdah\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rules by talking about the referendum. Clearly Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that Brexit was the biggest domestic risk to the UK economy, and could trigger a recession, has riled Leave campaigners. But Carney has hit back, telling Jenkin that the Bank has simply been following its statutory duty to the UK people. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All of the public comments that I, or other Bank officials, have made regarding issues related to the referendum have been limited to factors that affect the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statutory responsibilities and have been entirely consistent with our remits.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And he finished with a zinger: More here. Prime minister David Cameron has leapt to the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defence, after a volley of criticism from senior grandees. Former chancellors Lord Lamont and Lord Lawson and ex-Tory leaders Iain Duncan Smith and Lord Howard accused the BoE, and the Treasury, of peddling \u00e2\u20ac\u0153phoney forecasts\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about the dangers of Brexit. The quartet declared: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There has been startling dishonesty in the economic debate, with a woeful failure on the part of the Bank of England, the Treasury and other official sources to present a fair and balanced analysis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They have been peddling phoney forecasts and scare stories to back up the attempts of David Cameron and George Osborne to frighten the electorate into voting Remain.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Cameron (whose Remain campaign has relied on dire economic warnings), has hit back: Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says: Brexit fears continue to intensify a week out from the referendum, with the Federal Reserve again citing it as a headwind last night. The markets struggling to shrug off risk aversion sending bond prices higher and yields ever lower or more negative. And he fears the FTSE 100 could continue to slide, perhaps losing another 400 points to 5,500: European stock markets have opened in the red, hit by the familiar cocktail of economic worries and Brexit angst. In London, the FTSE 100 has dropped by 50 points, or 0.85%, to 5916. That erases yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery, and is the lowest point since 24 February. It means the index has lost around \u00c2\u00a3100bn of value in the last week alone. Mining stocks and banks are among the biggest fallers in the City. The French, German, Spanish and Italian markets have all dropped by over 1%, with traders fretting about how their economies will suffer if Britain leaves the EU. The Tokyo stock market has tumbled by 3% today, after the Bank of Japan left its stimulus programme on hold ahead of the Brexit referendum. Hopes that the BoJ might announce fresh stimulus measures were dashed. Instead, policymakers voted to continue expanding the monetary base at an annual rate of about 80 billion yen. That hit stocks, but also triggered a rush of money into the yen. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency smashed through the \u00c2\u00a5104 mark against the US dollar for the first time since August 2014, trading as strongly as \u00c2\u00a5103.98 to $1. That will alarm top brass in Tokyo, who would rather see a rather weaker currency (to push up inflation away from around zero) The BoJ also singled out next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum as a key geopolitical threat to the Japanese economy, along with the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153European debt problem\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bank of England day. At noon, the Monetary Policy Committee will release its latest decision on interest rates, and say whether is is taking any fresh steps to stimulate the economy. No changes are expected. But instead, the MPC is likely to release a fresh warning about the risks posed by next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum. The minutes of this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting could also highlight the harm already caused by Brexit uncertainty. The financial markets are already in a nervous mood today, after the US Federal Reserve slashed its forecasts for interest rate hikes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and pinned some of the blame on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum vote. Also coming up today: 9am: The European Central Bank publishes its latest economic bulletin 9.30am: UK retail sales figures for May 12: Bank of England decision, and minutes released Eurozone finance ministers are holding a Eurogroup meeting this afternoon. BoE governor Mark Carney will be speaking at the Mansion House tonight, but not until 9pm. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

With European shares heading higher after the suspension of Brexit campaigning, Campbell said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Doing its best to dampen the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rebound was the Dow Jones, the US index opening 20 to 40 points lower after the bell. There wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily much to cause that decline bar a relatively weak pair of housing starts and building permits readings. Nevertheless the Dow sporadically dipped below 17700, perhaps playing catch up with the sharper declines seen across the week in Europe.</p> <p>Talking of Europe, while the Eurozone indices lost some of their lustre (the DAX now up by a reduced 0.7%) the FTSE held on its growth this afternoon, the UK index increasing by 1.1%. The pound, meanwhile, saw an even more surprising rise, with cable at points grazing $1.43 for the first time since the start of the week.</p> <p>Given their behaviour in the past few days the markets could be in for a real rough ride next week. The persistent polls likely to leak out in the run up to the referendum should leave the pound in a constant state of flux, while the FTSE may well see itself return to that 5900, 4 month low pretty quickly on Monday. However, while the potential post-Brexit reaction is clear, it will be interesting to see how much momentum the markets can gain if Britain opts to remain in the EU, an eventuality seemingly backed by the behaviour of Spreadex\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clients.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5763ffbce4b0b4b233940b29\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-17T14:14:38.113Z\">3.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The result of the UK referendum could spark a spate of central bank intervention in the currency markets, including the Bank of England and potentially the Bank of Japan which has been worried about the strength of the yen anyway.</strong></p> <p>But a Brexit is less of a risk than Grexit - if Greece left the eurozone - according to Alan Ruskin. strategist at Deutsche Bank. He said in a note to clients:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The most likely scenario for the Bank of Japan to intervene and sell yen in the currency market, is if US dollar/Japanese yen threatened or breached Y100 following the UK referendum. Presumably, the Yen would also be registering even larger gains versus European currencies in such circumstances. In that situation, the Bank of Japan would likely intervene \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunder the cover\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of the UK referendum vote, by making a strong case to the US and G20, that i) Japan is being placed under unique duress from a dramatic tightening in financial conditions allied to the stronger yen; and, ii) that the exchange rate is reflective of volatile international events, and not domestic conditions.</p> </blockquote> <p>As for the Bank of England, any intervention was likely to be co-ordinated with the European Central Bank and the US Federal Reserve:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Were sterling trading to become particularly unruly following the UK referendum (say Cable through 1.30 and continuing to drop) the Bank of England is unlikely to sit idly by. Were the Bank of Englan to intervene to support the pound, it would make sense to also have the ECB and Federal Reserve intervene on the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s behalf, as a signal of global solidarity.</p> <p>Only if events in the foreign exchange market were reflective of a global systemic event that might trigger a significant tightening in financial conditions in the the US, would the Fed intervene on its own book.</p> <p>Such a global systemic spillover is not expected. The precedent of a potential Grexit was far more threatening for financial markets than the UK referendum, if only because monetary unions promote huge financial flows premised on a fixed exchange rate/price, and there are large winners and losers when they unravel. Unraveling trade agreements, do not have the same immediate risk management implications that lead to self reinforcing financial dislocations. </p> </blockquote> <p>At the moment Cable - the sterling dollar rate - is at $1.4295.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-06-17T14:20:40.142Z\">at 3.20pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57640230e4b01f3be8715c1e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-17T14:01:03.611Z\">3.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More on the comments from German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble on Brexit.

                "bodyText":"After another torrid week, European markets ended on a high note. Investors were in calmer mood as the prospect of Brexit appeared to fade a little, with the mood helped by the suspension of the campaigning by both sides for a while. Banks and housebuilders, which had fallen sharply in recent days on concerns about the effect of the UK leaving the UK, were among the biggest risers. But Wall Street was weaker, with Apple down on worries about its sales in China. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 added 1.19% or 70.61 points to 6021.09 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.85% to 9631.36 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 0.98% at 4193.83 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB jumped 3.49% to 16,923.29 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 1.98% higher at 8362.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 5.4% to 586.55 after an agreement to release the latest tranche of bailout cash But on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 81 points or 0.46%. Meanwhile sterling rose from Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lows of $1.4010, and is currently sitting at $1.4318. On that note it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back next week for what promises to be a crucial few days. Europe has to find a new way to build trust between member states and the people, European Central Bank president Mario Draghi has said. In a speech in Munich in honour of former German finance minister Theodor Waigel, he said: Today we face a choice \u00e2\u20ac\u201c between leaving things as they are and moving forward. And this is not a choice without costs. We have seen that the price of inaction is high. We have seen how it leaves the economy vulnerable to instability. We have seen how the perceived impotence of public authorities in meeting the needs of their people feeds into frustration and rejection. And we have seen how that risks undermining trust in and support for our institutions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and even the European Union itself... We have to find.. a way that builds on existing institutions to better ensure that the common needs of the people are met. The needs that we share in common, and that can be more safely delivered in common, must be identified and explained more clearly. They include economic interests, such as the benefits provided by a large and fully integrated financial area. They include defence, and more generally security against internal and external threats, the capacity to address global migration challenges and the protection of intellectual property \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all of which the European Union helps deliver, in ways that individual governments may not necessarily be able to do. And they include environmental protection and the fight against climate change. It is the demonstration of why, and how, those interests can be better protected in common that will gradually complement compliance and convergence as the basis for trust and the cement of the Union. European markets are holding onto their gains as we head into the close, but Wall Street has fallen back. Recent Federal Reserve comments showing concern about the state of the global economy have not helped, nor has a drop in Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price on worries about iPhone sales in China. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: For once we are seeing market jitters emerge from the US markets today, as relatively solid session for the FTSE has been overshadowed by a sharp deterioration in US equities today. The fears surrounding a Brexit have abated somewhat today, with a break from the polls allowing for a more positive end to a very mixed up week for UK equities. Crucially, the incessant rise in crude prices today has provided enough emphasis to keep the main UK benchmark afloat. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ultra-dovish comments from the traditionally hawkish St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard mark a significant shift in emphasis at the FOMC, with an indication we could only yet see one hike in the next 18 months. While there is no doubt that Fed confidence will have been knocked by this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s payrolls shocker, the accompaniment of a growth slowdown means that Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dream of a summer hike may turn into a dream of a 2017 hike. The uncertainty over the result of the UK referendum has seen investors pull out $1.1bn from UK equity funds in the past week, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. This is the fastest pace for 13 months and the second largest outflow over the past decade, after the last general election. Donald Tusk, head of the European Council, has shared his meeting schedule for next week. Wonder what they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find to talk about at 10.30 on Friday 24th? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the calm before next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probable storm in the markets, according to Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex. With European shares heading higher after the suspension of Brexit campaigning, Campbell said: Doing its best to dampen the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rebound was the Dow Jones, the US index opening 20 to 40 points lower after the bell. There wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily much to cause that decline bar a relatively weak pair of housing starts and building permits readings. Nevertheless the Dow sporadically dipped below 17700, perhaps playing catch up with the sharper declines seen across the week in Europe. Talking of Europe, while the Eurozone indices lost some of their lustre (the DAX now up by a reduced 0.7%) the FTSE held on its growth this afternoon, the UK index increasing by 1.1%. The pound, meanwhile, saw an even more surprising rise, with cable at points grazing $1.43 for the first time since the start of the week. Given their behaviour in the past few days the markets could be in for a real rough ride next week. The persistent polls likely to leak out in the run up to the referendum should leave the pound in a constant state of flux, while the FTSE may well see itself return to that 5900, 4 month low pretty quickly on Monday. However, while the potential post-Brexit reaction is clear, it will be interesting to see how much momentum the markets can gain if Britain opts to remain in the EU, an eventuality seemingly backed by the behaviour of Spreadex\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clients. The result of the UK referendum could spark a spate of central bank intervention in the currency markets, including the Bank of England and potentially the Bank of Japan which has been worried about the strength of the yen anyway. But a Brexit is less of a risk than Grexit - if Greece left the eurozone - according to Alan Ruskin. strategist at Deutsche Bank. He said in a note to clients: The most likely scenario for the Bank of Japan to intervene and sell yen in the currency market, is if US dollar/Japanese yen threatened or breached Y100 following the UK referendum. Presumably, the Yen would also be registering even larger gains versus European currencies in such circumstances. In that situation, the Bank of Japan would likely intervene \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunder the cover\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of the UK referendum vote, by making a strong case to the US and G20, that i) Japan is being placed under unique duress from a dramatic tightening in financial conditions allied to the stronger yen; and, ii) that the exchange rate is reflective of volatile international events, and not domestic conditions. As for the Bank of England, any intervention was likely to be co-ordinated with the European Central Bank and the US Federal Reserve: Were sterling trading to become particularly unruly following the UK referendum (say Cable through 1.30 and continuing to drop) the Bank of England is unlikely to sit idly by. Were the Bank of Englan to intervene to support the pound, it would make sense to also have the ECB and Federal Reserve intervene on the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s behalf, as a signal of global solidarity. Only if events in the foreign exchange market were reflective of a global systemic event that might trigger a significant tightening in financial conditions in the the US, would the Fed intervene on its own book. Such a global systemic spillover is not expected. The precedent of a potential Grexit was far more threatening for financial markets than the UK referendum, if only because monetary unions promote huge financial flows premised on a fixed exchange rate/price, and there are large winners and losers when they unravel. Unraveling trade agreements, do not have the same immediate risk management implications that lead to self reinforcing financial dislocations. At the moment Cable - the sterling dollar rate - is at $1.4295. More on the comments from German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble on Brexit. Reuters reports: Sch\u00c3\u00a4ulbe said on Friday that Europe was trying to prepare for any possible outcome of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum on whether to stay in the European Union. Speaking after a meeting of EU finance ministers in Luxembourg, Schaeuble also said Europe was well prepared to respond to current Brexit-related anxiety in financial market. His comments came after Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Thursday Britain would lose privileged access to the single European market if it leaves the European Union, in her strongest remarks yet on next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum. Wall Street is down in early trading. Dow Jones: -0.1% at 17,716 S&amp;P 500: -0.1% at 2,076 Nasdaq: -0.3% at 4,832 According to Reuters, the German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble says Germany is trying to prepare for all eventualities following the UK referendum on EU membership. He added: We think we are well prepared to respond to the current anxiety in financial markets. US housing starts dipped in May according to the Commerce Department. Privately-owned housing starts fell 0.3% to 1.164m from a downwardly revised 1.167m in April. Building permits rose however by 0.7% to 1.138m, suggesting the housing sector would continue to be a boost to the US economy. On both measures it was better than economists expected. Also this on BHS: The parliamentary committees investigating the demise of high street retailer BHS have published some more written evidence as part of the inquiry. Among the documents is a letter from Mike Ashley, the entrepreneur and founder of Sports Direct. In it, he outlines his version of events relating to his communication with former BHS owner Dominic Chappell and others over a possible rescue of the business. He suggests that Sports Direct looked twice at a potential rescue of BHS shortly before its collapse. Ashley claims that a proposed deal would have saved the vast majority of jobs and BHS stores: Following the announcement on 25 April 2016 that BHS was now in administration, Sports Direct contacted Duff &amp; Phelps with a view to putting together a second rescue package. A subsequent meeting took place at the offices of Arcadia on 27 April 2016. I attended this meeting in person along with my acquisition team. The other attendees included, amongst others, Sir Philip and Phil Duffy of Duff &amp; Phelps. Our proposal would have potentially saved the vast majority of the jobs and stores at BHS and we felt that this should be taken into account when making a decision as to whether or not our bid was accepted. Our understanding when we left the meeting was that we had an agreed deal, which was to be executed on Friday 13 May 2016. Following the meeting an SPA (Sale &amp; Purchase Agreement) was sent out by DLA on behalf of Duff &amp; Phelps, which was duly returned within 48 hours. However, as you know, the deal did not happen. Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics, says a British vote to leave the EU would force the European Central Bank to act. European equity markets would be very likely to drop further and peripheral bond yields could rise further, raising the threat of a re-ignition of the [eurozone] debt crisis. Meanwhile, an appreciation of the euro against a declining pound would exacerbate any negative effect on exports to the UK. Against this background, the European Central Bank will come under strong pressure to provide further policy support... the Governing Council would surely err on the side of caution and take more action. A further acceleration in its monthly asset purchases would be likely and another cut in interest rates possible. The ECB may even engage, with other central banks, in FX intervention to limit disruption in the currency markets. Speaking of CNBC, it also has an interview with US Federal Reserve board member James Bullard, who said there should only be one rate hike before 2018. CNBC reports: St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard, in a significant shift in his outlook for the U.S. economy, now says low growth and a very low fed funds rate of just 63 basis points will likely remain in place through 2018. Bullard, reversing earlier forecasts that looked for growth to pick up and rates to rise, now says 2 percent growth is the most likely forecast and that rates will remain low. Bullard also sees unemployment at 4.7 percent and trimmed-mean PCE inflation of 2 percent during this window. As a result, he says the Fed funds rates should remain at 63 basis points during the remainder of his forecast. The current target rate is 25 to 50 basis points. As a reminder, after the Fed raised rates in December there was talk of three or four further rises this year. Earlier this week the Fed held rates and made cautious comments about the risks to the global economy, not least the prospect of Brexit. More from IMF managing director Christine Lagarde. Speaking on CNBC she said there were significant benefits from the UK being in the European Union, and that Brexit was a concern not just for the UK but for the world. Brexit would hurt the UK more than the EU according to Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi (Reuters is quoting the Tass news agency in Russia). Of course it would be a problem but it would be a small problem for Europe and a much larger problem for Britain. He made the comments on the sidelines of the St Petersburg International Economic Forum. This follows his comments earlier in the month that a vote to leave the UK would be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disaster\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for Britain. Brent crude oil is inching closer towards the $50 a barrel mark - currently up 2% at $48.12. Mihir Kapadia, chief executive of Sun Global Investments, has a view: Crude oil prices have risen today for the first time in a week, with global markets enjoying a respite from worries about the upcoming EU referendum. The anticlimactic return back below $50 per barrel for prices recently has taken the wind out of some traders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sails, after a light at the end of the tunnel in the form of $53 a barrel last week was met with a 5-day slide. The impressive recovery in oil prices from early February led to some guarded optimism that we may see oil back closer to the highs of 2014, but the ubiquitous uncertainty in global markets since then makes prediction more difficult than usual. For now, oil is back on the rise. The problem for the markets is: we have no idea how long that will last. US cosmetics company Revlon has agreed to buy Elizabeth Arden in an $870m (\u00c2\u00a3611m) deal, which will bring together Revlon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hair colour products with its rival\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anti-ageing creams and celebrity fragrances. The move will create a cosmetics giant with annual sales of $3bn. It comes less than six months after Revlon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main shareholder and chairman, the billionaire Ron Perelman, considered putting the company up for sale. The New York-based firm has been struggling under its heavy borrowings and the deal will help it refinance the debt. Elizabeth Arden is known for its luxury skincare products, especially anti-ageing ranges, such as Prevage, Ceramide and SuperStart. Its fragrances include those licensed from celebrities including Britney Spears, Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift. However, the popularity of celebrity fragrances has waned, with sales falling, while Elizabeth Arden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s namesake brand has been performing better. Revlon was founded in 1932 by Charles Revson, his brother Joseph and a chemist, Charles Lachman, who contributed the L in the Revlon name. In the midst of the Great Depression, they started with a single product, a nail polish \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the first opaque nail enamel (at the time the only shades available were pale and transparent). Called Cherries in the Snow, it was inspired by the scarlet-lipped, cigarette-smoking Hollywood actresses of their day and is still selling today. Revlon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other nail polishes had names such as Fatal Apple and Kissing Pink. Lipstick became the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next big item in 1940 and it launched an advertising campaign touting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153matching lips and fingertips\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Jasper Lawler, analysts at CMC Markets, has this take on the markets: Fear-based trades sent markets to extreme levels in a short space of time and they have snapped back. Gold soaring to two-month highs typified the level of market anxiety. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp reversal has typified the sentiment reversal. The course-reversal across markets has seen everything that was doing badly, do the best and everything that was doing poorly, outperform. That means banks, particularly debt-laden peripheral European and Brexit-exposed UK banks are ruling the roost. Homebuilders are also amongst top-risers. US stocks look set to open basically unchanged following a day that saw the biggest daily gain after a loss of over 100 points for the Dow Jones Industrial Average since February. German bond yields are back in positive territory, reflecting a tick-up in risk appetite on Friday. The yield on benchmark 10-year bund yields is 0.005% after turning negative for the first time ever earlier in the week amid heightened investor caution. The pound is rising against the dollar and the euro this morning. Sterling is up 0.4% against the dollar at $1.4254 and up 0.2% against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.2672. UK investor sentiment has picked up following the suspension of the EU referendum campaign. Full story on Christine Lagarde\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech: Lagarde\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full speech is available here. She says the UK has benefited from additional jobs and income gains generated from increased trade with the EU as a result of its membership. This is not trade that would have happened anyway, or trade that has simply been diverted away from other parts of the world. The formation of the EU and the single market has been instrumental in generating more trade than would otherwise have been the case. And with more trade has come more investment, as the U.K. has become integrated into European supply chains\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsuch as in the aerospace industry, and in factories producing cars for the whole European market. Increased trade has also raised productivity and incomes by increasing the scope for economies of scale in production and efficient specialisation. Lagarde is also making a broader argument for unity in Europe. Pro Europeans must speak out against the tide of negativity surrounding the European project, she says: Right now, too many Europeans are worried about their cultural identity, their security, their jobs, incomes, and living standards. And too many of them are led to believe that things would be better if only Europe returned to closed borders and economic nationalism. This is a serious challenge for the European project. It is high time to confront this negative vision with a new perspective for those citizens who feel left behind. Those who believe that only a united Europe can be prosperous and dynamic need to step forward and speak up. Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, has urged the UK to stay in the EU. Giving an impassioned speech in Vienna, Lagarde said that while the EU was not perfect, Britain had been more successful as a result of its membership. Membership in the EU has made the UK a richer economy, but it has also made it a more diverse, more exciting, and more creative country. As in all countries, there are people who are struggling in this new environment, but for the majority of citizens, this has been a great success story. It has been said that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it takes great courage to see the world in all its tainted glory, and still to love it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd So I wish bon courage to our fellow Europeans from the United Kingdom! Some garden centre news now, as we approach the weekend... Tesco has sold Dobbies, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second largest garden centre chain, for \u00c2\u00a3217m. Dobbies has 35 garden centres across Scotland, England and Northern Ireland, and was bought by Tesco for \u00c2\u00a3150m in 2007. The supermarket chain has sold the company to a group of investors led by Midlothian Capital Partners and Hattington Capital. It is the latest in a string of a disposals by Tesco, as it attempts to focus its UK retail business on its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153core strengths\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Read our full story here. Connor Campbell, analyst at Spreadex, says the Greek deal is helping to lift investor spirits this morning. Once again the markets have bounced away from their lows, a solid US session and confirmation of a fresh Greek bailout seemingly lifting investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 spirits. Jumping by 1% the FTSE enjoyed the recovery from its commodity and finance stocks this Friday, with Brent Crude now back approaching $48 per barrel. The eurozone saw a similar (dead cat?) bounce this morning, the DAX and CAC rising 1.3% and 1.4% respectively. Unlike the FTSE, however, the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s indices arguably had something to celebrate, with European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici revealing that yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eurogroup meeting had seen the finance ministers sign off on Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7.5bn tranche of funding just in time for the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hefty July loan repayments. Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, is in Vienna and will be giving a speech on European unity at 10am UK time. We will bring you the highlights. The bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s are leading the charge on the FTSE this morning. Lloyds Banking Group is the top riser, up 5.5% at 65p. Biggest risers: Biggest fallers: Markets appear to be taking a breather from Brexit fears today following the suspension of the referendum campaign. The campaign was suspended on Thursday following the death of Jo Cox, the Labour MP for Batley and Spen. The International Monetary Fund will publish its latest report on the UK at midnight. The Washington-based fund said on Thursday it was delaying publication by 24 hours \u00e2\u20ac\u0153out of respect for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tragic event in the UK.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Oil prices are climbing this morning, as the fears pervading markets over recent days appear to ease. Brent crude oil is up 1.6% at $47.96 a barrel. The FTSE 100 is back above the 6,000 mark, driven higher by the banks. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up 74 points. All major European markets are trading strongly this morning: FTSE 100: +1.2% at 6,024 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +1.1% at 9,658 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +1.1% at 4,198 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: +2.3% at 16,723 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: +1.9% at 8,352 European markets have opened higher, following Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains on Thursday. The FTSE 100 is hovering close to the 6,000 mark, up 0.8% or 48 points at 5,998. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Good news for Greece, as its eurozone creditors have agreed to release a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7.5bn (\u00c2\u00a36bn) tranche of funding urgently needed by Athens. Pierre Moscovici, European Commissioner for economic and financial affairs, said the agreement was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a welcome breath of oxygen for the Greek economy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after ministers from the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 19 countries agreed to unlock funds. Minsters gave the green light at a meeting in Luxembourg after agreeing Greece had made sufficient progress on reforms, but the technical details of releasing the funds will be dealt with by senior officials today. The money is expected to arrive in Athens next week, allowing the government to meet two debt repayments to the European Central Bank next month. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was clearly relieved and said the funding would allow Greece to move into a new, more positive phase: A cycle is ending for the country. The country is entering a stable macroeconomic, fiscal and investment environment.",

                "bodyText":"Stock market flotations by British companies have slumped in 2016 because of fears about the outcome of the referendum on EU membership and the slowing economy. Funds raised by UK companies have fallen to $3.3bn (\u00c2\u00a32.3bn) so far this year, down from more than $8bn in each of the preceding two half-year periods, Thomson Reuters figures show. The figure is the lowest since the second half of 2012, when companies raised $2.9bn, and the third lowest since the second half of 2008 when the financial crisis reached its peak. The value of UK flotations has almost halved so far in the current quarter to $1.14bn from $2.15bn in the first three months of 2016, as the EU referendum has drawn nearer. By contrast, the value of global IPOs has taken off, rising to $22.7bn so far in the current quarter from $8.9bn in a slow first three months of the year. Viv Maclachlan, a capital markets director at the accountancy firm PwC, said companies had delayed going to the market because they feared wary investors would push the price of new shares down with markets in turmoil ahead of the EU referendum vote. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The reason is absolutely the EU referendum and that has been pretty much the case since the beginning of April. People don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like uncertainty and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think investors, companies or any of us understand the ramifications of what it means if we leave,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Investors don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to pay for things while there is uncertainty and the danger is you might be forced to undervalue your company.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The IPO slowdown is the latest sign of jitters in the financial world over the outcome of the referendum with polls suggesting a very close contest. The health of the market is a measure of wider business confidence. In the second half of 2008, when Lehman Brothers went bust, no UK companies floated on the stock market as investors were seized by fear of economic disaster. The FTSE 100 index sank to a four-month low last week before recovering slightly, and the pound has fallen heavily against the dollar.

Along a broad based sell-off across markets, Brent crude sold 11% off from the recent peak of $52.86 a barrel to a low last week of $46.94. There was a clear exit from long speculative positions and an increase in short positions in WTI crude [the US benchmark].</p> <p>In the event of a Brexit, we expect Brent to sell down to between $40 a barrel and $45, which would be a great buying opportunity. The sharp rebound in the oil price during the last two days is a good indication of the solid appetite for buying oil whenever it drops below $50 a barrel. While a Brexit would be damaging for the Brent crude price in the short term, we think that its impact on oil demand would only be marginally negative. While overall sentiment in financial markets could be depressed for quite some time, the supply/demand balance for oil would not be impacted very much.</p> <p>If we get a second negative round of sell-off ahead of the vote this week, with Brent crude down towards $45 a barrel, we view it as a good buying opportunity. If a Brexit then actually happens, Brent crude would sell further down, but it would not stay there long.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"efbac432058bdffab9fb8939e26b277b7912ee9f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/efbac432058bdffab9fb8939e26b277b7912ee9f/0_192_5106_3065/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oil worker in Bahrain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oil worker in Bahrain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hasan Jamali/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>   </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5767f9f4e4b0412970e2c108\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-20T14:15:00.477Z\">3.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>On Wall Street, the market has now indeed settled down, and the optimism continues.</strong></p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now up 252 points or 1.4%, while European markets are holding on to the bulk of their gains.</p> <p>In the general risk-on attitude among investors, oil is also on the rise, with Brent crude up 1.6% at $49.97 a barrel.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5767f89ce4b0fa9ae41007aa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-20T14:10:42.064Z\">3.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Carmaker Nissan has said it will take legal action against the official Leave campaign for using its logo in a leaflet calling on voters to back Brexit.

                "bodyText":"But here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key question: On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close up. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow as we continue the run up to the EU referendum and find out if indeed the market rally can last. Volatility surrounding this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote on whether the UK leaves the European Union has continued, with shares and the pound surging on signs that the Remain camp was regaining lost ground, recovering from their recent slump. The FTSE 100 saw \u00c2\u00a347.5bn added to the value of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top companies, with the index up more than 3% - its biggest daily rise since February. The pound recorded its biggest one day gain since the financial crisis of 2008, up more than 2% agains a basket of currencies. Meanwhile oil rose more than 2.4% to $50.35 a barrel, helped by the latest on the referendum and a survey from data firm Genscape pointing to a fall in US crude stocks. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 jumped 182.91 points or 3.04% to 6204.00 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax soared 3.43% to 9962.02 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 3.5% higher at 4340.76 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB added 2.54% to 17,353.45 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 3.41% higher at 8647.1 In Greece, the Athens market rose 5.4% to 586.55 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 1.09% or 192 points. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: Global markets have had a Bremain bounce. A new optimistic tone has taken hold at the beginning of the final week before the Brexit referendum. A phone poll from Survation and an internet poll from YouGov showing a lead for the Remain side has prompted a perception that the Brexit tide has turned. A change in bookmaker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s odds in favour of the UK remaining in the EU has been another contributor to fading fears of a Brexit in financial markets. The FTSE 100 has closed 3% higher at 6204.00 after the latest polls suggested that the chances of the UK voting to leave the European Union had receded somewhat. This is the biggest one day rise since 12 February this year, although the index has come off its best levels of the day, when it saw the largest daily increase since last August. And it has only regained the levels seen on 9 June, before the polls started showing big gains for the Leave campaign. Sterling is now 2.3% higher against the dollar, trading around $1.47, its highest level since January this year. The pound is also up 2% on the day against the euro at 77.07p a euro. Buy oil if the UK votes for Brexit, according to Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at Nordic Bank SEB: Last week we saw a taste of what might happen to markets if the UK votes to exit the EU. Along a broad based sell-off across markets, Brent crude sold 11% off from the recent peak of $52.86 a barrel to a low last week of $46.94. There was a clear exit from long speculative positions and an increase in short positions in WTI crude [the US benchmark]. In the event of a Brexit, we expect Brent to sell down to between $40 a barrel and $45, which would be a great buying opportunity. The sharp rebound in the oil price during the last two days is a good indication of the solid appetite for buying oil whenever it drops below $50 a barrel. While a Brexit would be damaging for the Brent crude price in the short term, we think that its impact on oil demand would only be marginally negative. While overall sentiment in financial markets could be depressed for quite some time, the supply/demand balance for oil would not be impacted very much. If we get a second negative round of sell-off ahead of the vote this week, with Brent crude down towards $45 a barrel, we view it as a good buying opportunity. If a Brexit then actually happens, Brent crude would sell further down, but it would not stay there long. On Wall Street, the market has now indeed settled down, and the optimism continues. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now up 252 points or 1.4%, while European markets are holding on to the bulk of their gains. In the general risk-on attitude among investors, oil is also on the rise, with Brent crude up 1.6% at $49.97 a barrel. Carmaker Nissan has said it will take legal action against the official Leave campaign for using its logo in a leaflet calling on voters to back Brexit. Reuters reports: On one \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Vote Leave\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd flyer, the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s logo appeared next to those of four other major companies including Unilever and fellow carmaker Vauxhall with the message: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Major employers ... have all said they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll stay in the UK whatever the result of the referendum.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Nissan, which says it would prefer Britain to remain in the EU, said it would be issuing legal proceedings on Monday in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s High Court to stop \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcVote Leave\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from using its name and logo and to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153prevent them making any further false statements and misrepresentations concerning Nissan. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is joining the global rally, as nerves over Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum recede. The Dow Jones index has jumped by 202 points, or 1.1%, as the chimes of the Wall Street bell ring out. It will take a few minutes for trading to settle down, though..... More analysts are predicting today that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t-know\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 voters will decide to back the status quo in Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a key factor behind the flood of money into shares, and the British pound, today. Mujtaba Rahman of Eurasia Group says that many referendums across the world show that undecided voters don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t \u00e2\u20ac\u0153break evenly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The British public is risk-averse and, absent a well-articulated plan for EU exit, is still more likely to opt for the status quo than a leap into the unknown. Historical analysis of six previous referenda in the UK (most prominently on the Alternative Voting system, devolution and Scottish independence) since 1975 show a tendency for a hefty swing towards the status quo in the run-up to polling day \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a trend we are beginning to see from this weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s polling. Derek Halpenny, the European head of global market research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, makes a similar point (via Reuters) The momentum has changed, and perhaps this is the first sign of what a lot of the polling experts had been suggesting,which is that the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 portion was going to be crucial and historically there tends to be a shift towards the status quo in the final days before a referendum. I think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what the market is reacting to.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The stock market rally is hitting new heights, driving the FTSE 100 index up by 200 points today to 6223. Unless the mood changes, we could be looking at the biggest one-day leap in 10 months. City expert Louise Cooper has cautioned against assuming that the EU referendum is now \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in the bag\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the Remain campaign. She says: Firstly, it should be no surprise to read that markets get things wrong. Secondly this move is driven by computer trading, with computer algorhythms driving the move higher. As various technical levels are breached, more buy orders come in and momentum gathers. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153real players\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the market - corporates and pension funds - are mostly on the side lines.... The sterling rally does not suggest that the Remain campaign has it in the bag. This is going to be one hell of a week. Louise also confirms that the surge in the pound today is quite remarkable: The pound has moved from buying one dollar forty cents on the lows of Thursday to buying $1.46 now... As one FX strategist said to me this morning: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d normally expect to see that size of move in a month\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Ladbrokes and William Hill have also cut their odds on Remain winning Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote (meaning they see it as more likely) The Brexit referendum is already the biggest political betting event in Betfair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history (it was founded in 1999). Betfair spokesperson Naomi Totten reports that more than \u00c2\u00a340m has now been staked on the result, including one \u00c2\u00a3315,000 wager on Remain. Totten says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With just three days left until the vote the Betfair market momentum is now all behind Remain, which was backed as low as 1/5 this morning, with one customer backing it to the tune of \u00c2\u00a3100k. This market continues to mimic the pattern of the Scottish Referendum, where historical confidence in the eventual \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcNo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 vote slipped slightly ten days before referendum day only to resettle in the week of the vote.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd One City fund manager, though, suggests investors shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get carried away... City investment management company Charles Stanley has warned customers that they could find it harder to trade on Friday morning. They believe there will be massive demand to buy and sell shares and currencies, as the referendum result becomes clear. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an email sent to clients today: This Thursday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c June 23rd2016 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the country goes to the polls to decide on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future in Europe. It is a simple \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcyes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 vote but we are expecting considerable volumes being traded through the Charles Stanley Direct platform as investors react to the news. Whatever the results, we anticipate that we may experience higher volumes and more market volatility than usual on the 23rd June and in the days following the vote. The immediate impact is likely to be felt most directly by those of you wishing to trade shares during such market conditions. It is possible that market makers will limit the size of orders that can be placed online and be slow to answer phones. In practice this may mean that you are more likely to have to place a limit order instead of a market order and it may take longer for us to be able to place such trades. Foreign exchange rates could also witness fluctuations and this has the potential to impact overseas trades placed during this time. We ask for your understanding if you are thus affected. Our experienced Edinburgh-based helpdesk may also receive a surge in call and query volumes. We will respond to queries as quickly and thoroughly as possible, but once again we would be grateful for the forbearance of our clients in the event of unusually high volumes. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the best-performing major shares in London this lunchtime: Time for a catch-up. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is on a tear this morning, as investors react to signs that Britain is more likely to vote to stay in the European Union. The FTSE 100 index of leading shares has surged by 196 points, or 3.2%, by lunchtime in the City. That means around \u00c2\u00a350bn has been wiped back onto the index, which is on track for its biggest one-day rise since last August. Financial stocks are among the big risers, with Royal Bank of Scotland gaining 7.8% and Lloyds Banking Group up 6%. Building firms are also up, led by Taylor Wimpey (up 7%). Traders are citing weekend polls, showing a pick-up in support for the Remain campaign in the last few days. Three polls gave Remain a small lead, and one had the two sides tied. Mihir Kapadia, CEO at Sun Global Investments, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s markets opened with a strong risk-on sentiment as news over the weekend suggests that the Remain camp is gaining momentum in the UK ahead of this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Betfair, the online gambling site, reports that the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcimplied odds\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of the UK remaining in the EU have risen to around 77%. This has forced some investors to cut insurance which they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d taken out against Brexit. Sterling is also bouncing back, and on track for its biggest one-day rise since 2009. The pound is up by 1.8% right now at $1.4622 against the US dollar, a gain of over 2.5 cents. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets have suggested that some voters are returning to the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstatus quo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and deciding against Brexit. Others have warned, though, that there could be further twists before Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWaves from the Brexit vote are buffeting the UK stock market, tossing it up and down as the opinion polls shift this way and that. Until the vote is over we can expect more price swings, as markets struggle to price in a unique event that carries with it such a high degree of uncertainty. If you want to get an idea of what stocks will do well in the event of a vote to stay in the UK, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth taking a look at today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE leader board. The market has clearly identified financials and house builders as beneficiaries of a vote to remain in the UK, with a Sterling rally also indicating how the currency might move if we vote to remain in Europe. The move comes after David Cameron urged the public to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stay and fight\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the EU last night. Overnight, a clutch of Nobel-prize winning economists warned against Brexit. And the head of Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade body has warned that it would be a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccatastrophe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 if Britain left the EU. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a handy chart, showing how the share prices of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest 600 companies (dark blue) have tracked the twists and turns in the EU referendum race. The latest opinion polls are prompting some international investors to readjust their views on the EU referendum - for the second time this month. Initially, the City had broadly expected the Remain campaign to win the vote, before polls in early June showed Leave taking the lead. So polls over the weekend, suggesting it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s neck-and-neck again, have triggered today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally. Christian Gattiker, head of research at Julius Baer in Zurich, told Bloomberg that sentiment has shifted: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We were steering into a clear Brexit scenario and now we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen a counter move which makes it more balanced, more in line with what investors thought in the first place. \u00e2\u20ac\ufffd So, some traders who had protected themselves against Brexit are now \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunwinding\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 those positions - helping to drive the pound up. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains: The bias in the city has generally been that a Remain vote is more likely, but polls pointing otherwise meant that assertion needed to be hedged. The unusually large jump in Sterling on Monday is in part, those hedges being unwound. The US stock market is also expected to open strongly, in around four hours time: The rally is gathering pace, as investors worldwide shake off their recent fears. After two hours of trading, the FTSE 100 is up a mighty 160 points, or 2.5%, at 6181. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its highest level since June 10th, and its biggest once-day rally since 17 February. And the pound is continuing to bounce - up almost three cents at $1.4628, and well away from the two-month lows ($1.40) hit last week. Traders are continuing to respond to polls showing a pick-up in support for Remain. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, comments: It is clear that the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcremain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 campaign has suffered from a distinct lack of a positive message, with critics accusing the campaign leaders of fearmongering. However, in some ways, it took the tragic death of Jo Cox for people to wake up to the positive message that she purveyed on the benefits of integration and tolerance. Perhaps it is a coincidence, but that incident has seemingly formed a turning point for the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcremain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 campaign, with the improved fortunes of both polls and the pound ever since. Reminder, our main EU referendum liveblog will be covering the recall of parliament today to pay tribute to Jo Cox MP: The head of Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BGA trade federation has declared that Brexit would be a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccatastrophe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. Anton Boerner told a press conference in Berlin that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A Brexit would lead to uncertainty and a loss of trust over several years. This is poison for the economy in Britain, but also for Europe as a whole. Nobody will benefit from an exit. On the contrary, it would be a catastrophe for everybody and especially for us in Germany. There will be no winners, but only losers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Last night, 10 top Nobel Prize-winning economists predicted that Brexit would create major uncertainty, hurting global trade. UKIP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nigel Farage, though, told the BBC this morning that Brexit wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a major shock to the economy as European countries would be keen to strike a trade deal quickly. Last night, prime minister David Cameron tried to persuade voters to back his campaign to remain in a reformed European Union. The PM told a special edition of Question Time that he believes Britain should \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stay and fight\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, rather than quitting the EU. At one point, Cameron declared: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At my office, I sit two yards away from the cabinet room where Winston Churchill decided in May 1940 to fight on against Hitler, the greatest decision that anyone has ever made in our country. Ana Thaker, market economist at PhillipCapital UK, reckons this is helping to push the pound up today: Sterling has pared any losses we saw last week. PM Cameron appeared on Question Time yesterday, answering questions from the public regarding the impending referendum and support for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcRemain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 has seen the currency strengthen. Despite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally, the markets are still in a relatively precarious position, says Connor Campbell of City firm SpreadEx: The slightest sign that the public are shifting in favour of Vote Leave will likely see today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains rapidly dissipate, while an intensification of pre-referendum nerves as the week goes on could see markets chop and change even without any new polling news. Sterling is on course to post its strongest day since the aftermath of the financial crisis. The pound is holding onto its early gains, and is up 1.6% against the US dollar at $1.458 right now. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a really chunky move for sterling \u00e2\u20ac\u201c according to Reuters data, such a big swing hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happened since 2009. Our friends at fastFT confirm that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally is one of the biggest of the last decade: There are still two referendum debates to look forward to... Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market rally looks decisive, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably see more market turmoil in the next few days Kit Juckes, the experienced foreign exchange expert at French bank Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale, explains: Polls remain very even, with the FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poll tracker showing both camps at 44%. The market will surely gyrate some more in the next few days as any shift in that position triggers an exaggerated reaction, not just for sterling but for wider risk sentiment. Ilya Spivak, currency strategist at DailyFX, says there is a global rush into \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrisky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 assets today. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The British Pound soared at the start of the week and the Euro followed upward after new polling data released over the weekend showed ebbing support for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK EU membership referendum. Survation reported a 45 to 42 preference for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Remain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd vote while an analogous poll from YouGov gave the status quo a 44 to 43 percent lead. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The outcomes likewise bolstered risk appetite. The sentiment-linked Australian, Canadian and New Zealand Dollars tracked stocks upward while the anti-risk Japanese Yen plunged. The likewise haven-linked US Dollar is also under pressure. Gold prices and US 10-year Treasury futures likewise swooned as capital flowed away from safety-seeking assets. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the best-performing shares in the City this morning: The London stock market has hit its highest level since 10 June, as this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally wipes out recent losses. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 index has surged by 136 points at the start of trading, as City investors react to the polls showing the Remain campaign gaining ground. Almost every share is gaining ground, as money pours back into shares, pushing the benchmark index up by over 2%. Royal Bank of Scotland, the taxpayer-owned bank, is leading the rally with a 6% surge. Lloyds Banking Group are up 5%. And housebuilders are also leading the charge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they had suffered from fears that Brexit would mean less demand for housing, especially if the UK entered recession. Mike van Dulken, analyst at Accendo Markets, explains: A positive European open comes as weekend Brexit polls (and bookies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 odds) suggest the Remain campaign regaining some lost ground and in some cases re-taken the lead ahead of Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK referendum vote on EU membership. A higher chance of the UK voting to stay is a relief for markets (equities and the pound sterling) that had been preparing themselves for a Leave vote and the uncertainty it could inflict from both a financial, economic and political standpoint. In Europe, the French and German stock markets both leapt by around 2.4% at the open. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re off! European stock markets are opening sharply higher, with financial stocks leading the way...... Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s newspaper front pages show how the EU referendum campaign picked up last night: Sterling is rallying hard this morning - another sign that Brexit worries are easing. The pound has jumped more than two cents, or 1.5%, to $1.4572, after weekend opinion polls showed the Remain campaign picking up more support. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its highest level since June 7, before opinion polls showed the Leave campaign in the ascendant. Against the euro, the pound has gained 1% or 1.2 eurocents to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.2848. That means one euro is worth 77.8p. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets say investors are reacting to the latest opinion polls: In the UK, there were three surveys released over the weekend that all showed some swing back towards \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcRemain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The Survation poll showed a 45/42 lead for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcRemain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (up from 42/45 previously), a YouGov Poll showed a 44/42 lead (42/44 previously) while Opinium stood at 44/44 equal split. Those polls were all conducted around the tragic events of last week - with some responses coming in before and some after the murder of Jo Cox. Thus, it might be possible that the events influenced the polls but most experts commented that it is more likely that an expected and well documented \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpull to the status-quo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is responsible for the latest swing. The poll-of-polls averaging the last six polls has returned to 50/50 while the bookmakers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 odds for Brexit have fallen considerably to around 30% again. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a round-up of the latest referendum opinion polls (from our EU referendum liveblog): A Sunday Times/YouGov poll had remain on 44% and leave on 43%. An Opinium/Observer poll put both campaigns on 44%. A Survation poll for the Mail on Sunday had remain ahead, by 45% to 42%. A UK-wide BMG poll for the Herald showed a bigger gap, with remain up to 53.3% and leave on 46.7%. A Comres poll for the Independent didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ask those surveyed how they would vote \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but 44% said they would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153delighted\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if the UK voted to leave the EU, with only 28% saying they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d celebrate a vote to stay with the same fervour. The FT poll of polls now pegs remain and leave on 44% apiece. Stock markets across Asia have soared today, as investors grew more confident that the British public will vote to remain in the EU. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei 225 index led the way, gaining almost 2.3% today. The Nikkei is often a good barometer of investor sentiment -- liable to tumble when nervous traders drive up the value of the Japanese Yen (hurting the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exporters and raising deflation fears). The Hong Kong Hang Seng index is close behind, up 1.8%, as is Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s S&amp;P/ASX 200 index. Although these trading floors are thousands of miles from the UK, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum is still top of the agenda. Margaret Yang, an analyst at CMC Markets in Singapore, explains: The entire market is now focused on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum result.... It is expected that a vote to remain would lead to a quick unwinding of risk premium and a substantial risk-on rally, whereas a Brexit vote would have the opposite effect.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a crucial week for investors around the globe, as the long-running UK referendum campaign enters its final days. And London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial markets are expected to soar, following weekend polling showing that the campaign to Remain in the European Union is making up ground. Asian stock markets have rallied strongly overnight, and it looks like Europe will follow suit at 8am. IG are predicting that the FTSE 100 will soar by nearly 3% at the open \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a really big move - as fears of a Brexit ease. The pound is also rallying in early trading, hitting a two week high (more on that shortly) This may be premature...... there are still three days to go until the vote. Campaigning resumed last night, following a two-day break following the awful, tragic death of Jo Cox MP on Thursday. Our main EU referendum blog will be tracking all the key political developments in the referendum today, including tributes to Jo Cox and her work in parliament: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much else in the economic or financial calendar, so the City should be free to watch the referendum campaign enter its final lap. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main economic and financial news through the day....",

Investors have rushed back to buy up stocks, currencies and commodities in a similar fashion to the way in which they abandoned them a few days ago. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That such shifts in global markets can be occasioned by shifts in polling of a few thousand people in just one nation seems odd, but such is the importance of the Brexit referendum to global markets that all other concerns have been cast aside, at least for now.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The sharp move in the pound against the dollar also reflected receding expectations of a near-term interest rate rise from the US central bank, especially following remarks from a key policymaker last week. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important not to get Brexit tunnel vision. Central banks still matter,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Lawler. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A very dovish shift from the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s James Bullard, who on Friday said the Fed may only raise rates once before 2018, has contributed to a drop in the US dollar, adding to sterling strength.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd",

Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>George Soros is correct to say that a Brexit could lead to a catastrophic day for the pound but preparing for a re-run of Black Wednesday is not easy.</p> <p>Very few of those working on trading desks in 1992 are still in the City so there is something of the unknown about what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coming. Even the dark days of Lehmans are a distant memory for most traders. If Britain votes out, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fair to say we will not have seen a day in the markets quite like it.</p> <p>The worry is that a collapse in sterling today could be much more devastating than it was a quarter of a century ago.</p> <p>If the markets go completely crazy we could see an emergency Bank Holiday declared, or even a Sunday trading session to limit panic and losses.</p> <p>Financial markets are much more interconnected than they were in the early 90s, although the processes and trading systems have come a long way. </p> <p>Speed and access to market information is much faster today than it was back in 1992 and Brexit is a known quantity in the sense that we know when it will happen if it does. Crashing out of ERM took everyone by surprise. </p> <p>Central banks are ready to step in with extra liquidity should markets be thrown into chaos and the Bank of England has currency swap lines in place if required. </p> <p>But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interesting that the Bank of England says uptake of its most recent extra liquidity auction was lower than expected, which either suggests that UK banks do not anticipate Brexit happening or they have plenty of liquidity to play with.

Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois Mitterrand\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lurch toward socialism in France, Ronald Reagan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s excessive tax cuts in the U.S., and Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s encouragement of bubbles were all egregious errors, but all were reversed, albeit not before substantial damage had been done. Divorce can be reversed by remarriage if regretted. There is no reversing Brexit if it proves unwise. Indeed, given the E.U.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very strong incentive to discourage further dissolution, it is far from clear that there would even be concerted efforts to minimize its cost.</p> <p>Second, markets are likely to suffer extraordinary volatility in the wake of Brexit. A Black Friday could follow referendum Thursday. It is likely that foreign investors in British stocks would lose 15 percent off the bat, adding together market declines and currency losses. This is a judgement supported by <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/05f69210-3684-11e6-a780-b48ed7b6126f.html#axzz4C8AzRdOS\">the gyrations in markets</a> induced by relatively small fluctuations in the perceived chance of Brexit and by the very high prices commanded by out of the money options. The truth is that even with all the regulatory changes that have been put in place, we do not know for sure how the financial system will respond. A return of systemic risk as large losses lead to cascading liquidations cannot be ruled out. At a time when central banks have far less ammunition than they did in 2008, the consequences could be grave.</p> <p>Third, Brexit will undermine confidence and increase uncertainty. No one knows what the new structure will be or how soon it will emerge. Quite likely Brexit would lead to changes not only in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relationship with Europe but also within Europe itself. While businesses wait to see what happens, they will hold off on new investment. Some will decide that it is much safer to base European operations outside the U.K.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LHSummers/status/745221782999703552\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Markets are likely to suffer extraordinary volatility in the wake of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash\">#Brexit</a>.

                "bodyText":"After a shaky start it looked like markets would fail to build on Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong gains. But shares moved into positive territory by the close as Wall Street edged higher and polls indicated the Remain camp was slightly ahead. But investors were still uneasy ahead of Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 0.36% or 22.55 points at 6226.55 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 0.54% to 10,015.54 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 0.61% better at 4367.24 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB added 0.45% to 17,431.17 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 0.23% at 8667.3 In Greece, the Athens market was 3.71% better at 608.29 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now 29 points or 0.16% higher. Sterling hit a five and a half month high before falling back, trading down 0.12% at $1.4659. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Janet Yellen has now finished her testimony. Another warning there may be liquidity problems on Friday following the referendum result: European markets closed higher, but Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, expects further volatility ahead of the EU vote: The prospects of a Brexit appears to be on a knife edge just two days before the UK goes to the polls. The IG Survation poll shows a clear narrowing between \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcremain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (45%) and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcleave\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (44%) campaigns, with the result likely to be dictated by the factors such as turnout and the action of the so far undecided (11%) voters. Yesterday may have seen a sharp relief rally in GBPUSD as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcleave\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 swung back into the lead, yet the increasingly \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctoo close to call\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 nature of this referendum should provide a highly unpredictable and volatile week in the markets. While there is only a marginal lead for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcremain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 when polls are concerned, the IG Binary (currently 72% remain) shows that the money is clearly backing a decision to remain in the EU. Back with US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony to Congress. Asked further about Brexit Yellen says: It could launch a period of uncertainty [with] negative economic consequences for the UK spilling over into Europe. The market reaction could result in a risk off sentiment that we would see impact on the financial markets. We might see a flight to safety which might push up the dollar and other safe haven currencies. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to overblow the likely impacts but we will watch it carefully. Could Brexit push the US into recession? I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that is the most likely case, but we just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what will happen. Fund manager Hargreaves Lansdown is the latest firm to say it will extend opening hours and has tripled its number of dealing staff to deal with the aftermath of the EU referendum vote. Could we see an emergency bank holiday in the event of Brexit? Or even a Sunday trading session. Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, said: George Soros is correct to say that a Brexit could lead to a catastrophic day for the pound but preparing for a re-run of Black Wednesday is not easy. Very few of those working on trading desks in 1992 are still in the City so there is something of the unknown about what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coming. Even the dark days of Lehmans are a distant memory for most traders. If Britain votes out, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fair to say we will not have seen a day in the markets quite like it. The worry is that a collapse in sterling today could be much more devastating than it was a quarter of a century ago. If the markets go completely crazy we could see an emergency Bank Holiday declared, or even a Sunday trading session to limit panic and losses. Financial markets are much more interconnected than they were in the early 90s, although the processes and trading systems have come a long way. Speed and access to market information is much faster today than it was back in 1992 and Brexit is a known quantity in the sense that we know when it will happen if it does. Crashing out of ERM took everyone by surprise. Central banks are ready to step in with extra liquidity should markets be thrown into chaos and the Bank of England has currency swap lines in place if required. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interesting that the Bank of England says uptake of its most recent extra liquidity auction was lower than expected, which either suggests that UK banks do not anticipate Brexit happening or they have plenty of liquidity to play with. Confidence is high for Remain but markets may be underestimating the chances of Brexit. Equities are more complex. A slump in sterling could be net positive for FTSE 100 companies as up to 80% of earnings come from abroad. In fact the DAX and CAC may be a lot more exposed than the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue chip index. Yellen had said at previous testimonies that the Fed was looking into whether negative rates would be legal. Asked for an update she says: We have the legal basis to pursue negative rates but it is not something we are considering or looking at. Back with Yellen and the Fed chair says a UK exit from the European Union could bring a period of uncertainty and financial volatility and affect the US outlook. She said the banks had put in place enhancements to liquidity [in the case of Brexit]. In another sign of mounting concern over Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote, global law firm Dechert has set up a new hotline for clients who need expert advice about Brexit. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be staffing it with lawyers, who can explain the legal implications if Britain votes to leave the EU. Miriam Gonzalez, co-chair of the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s International Trade and Government Regulation practice, says a Leave victory would create \u00e2\u20ac\u0153enormous legal uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Clients will need to react to questions from employees, shareholders and investors, as well as assess which areas of their businesses would be most at risk. At Dechert we realise that speed will be of essence in the days following the referendum to avoid such legal uncertainly impacting negatively on our clients and that is why we are creating the tools to allow clients to have access to the expertise they will need. Draghi is quizzed further on Brexit and what problems he foresees. He says: I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to speculate on the outcome or the consequences. We monitor all economic, political and legal developments so we can assess and manage the ensuing risks. Mostly, to be able to stabilise markets, provide liquidity. We have existing swap lines with other central banks. The agreements are there, we want to make sure they are useable, active and adequate. The event will have short and long term effects. It is hard to say what sort of action we would take in each contingency. Back with Draghi on Brexit: Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen has again warned of the risk of the UK voting to leave the European Union. In her testimony to Congress she said: In the current environment of sluggish growth, low inflation, and already very accommodative monetary policy in many advanced economies, investor perceptions of and appetite for risk can change abruptly. One development that could shift investor sentiment is the upcoming referendum in the United Kingdom. A U.K. vote to exit the European Union could have significant economic repercussions. She also expressed concerns about the domestic US market and the outlook for China: The latest readings on the labor market and the weak pace of investment illustrate one downside risk--that domestic demand might falter. In addition, although I am optimistic about the longer-run prospects for the U.S. economy, we cannot rule out the possibility expressed by some prominent economists that the slow productivity growth seen in rece Although concerns about slowing growth in China and falling commodity prices appear to have eased from earlier this year, China continues to face considerable challenges as it rebalances its economy toward domestic demand and consumption and away from export-led growth. So that means the Fed is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153closely monitoring global economic and financial developments\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and taking a cautious approach to raising interest rates: The FOMC continues to anticipate that economic conditions will improve further and that the economy will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate. In addition, the Committee expects that the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below the levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run because headwinds--which include restraint on U.S. economic activity from economic and financial developments abroad, subdued household formation, and meager productivity growth--mean that the interest rate needed to keep the economy operating near its potential is low by historical standards. George Soros has warned of the dangers of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Black Friday\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for sterling in the event of a Brexit vote, and now Ladbrokes is offering odds of 3/1 on that happening. It will pay out if the pound falls by more than 15% against the dollar in the 24 hour window between midnight on the 23rd and 24th in the event of Brexit. Ladbrokes said: Remain gained more ground over leave during trading on Tuesday, with the latest Brexit barometer reading showing a 78% chance of a remain outcome, up from 74%, or 2/9 in betting terms, ahead of leave at 10/3. Alex Donohue of Ladbrokes said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the event of Brexit we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not ruling out Black Friday at all. Britain has to vote to leave first however, and our barometer continues to tick round in favour of remain hour by hour.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yellen is delivering the Semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress, and is likely to repeat the caution expressed by the Fed last week. The bank was concerned about weakness in the global economy, poor recent jobs figures and of course, the risks posed by the outcome of the UK referendum. The caution contrasted sharply with a number of hawkish comments made by Fed members in the run up to the disappointing non-farm payroll numbers. Analysts have gone from predicting three or four US rate rises this year to perhaps one at most. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a brief moment of levity in Brussels, as Mario Draghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mobile phone goes off as he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s answering a question on the eurozone economy. Ahead of the latest testimony from US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, Wall Street has opened in positive territory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 26 points or 0.14% while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.13% and Nasdaq 0.25%. What does Mario Draghi mean when he says the European Central Bank is ready for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all contingencies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd following Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote? Well, the ECB is likely to unleash every weapon at its disposal to prevent a market crash, and prevent the financial system seizing up. And that will include massive injections of liquidity into the euro system, in partnership with the Bank of England. Last week, ECB board member Ewald Nowotny cited the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcswap lines\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 which central banks have, to share their respective currencies at times of crisis. Nowotny said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If needed, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s secured that neither English nor European banks will have liquidity shortages\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. ECB ready to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccushion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 markets with liquidity after Brexit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Nowotny That would protect banks from having to sell their assets at bargain basement prices, to get their hands on cash. But it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t prevent a general repricing of assets, such as the pound and UK stocks and shares. Central banks could also act together to prevent a sterling crisis, potentially propping up the pound to prevent it weakening too much against the US dollar, the euro and the yen. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a video clip of David Cameron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lunchtime skit at Downing Street: Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank, has told the European Parliament that he is ready to take action if Britain votes to leave the EU. Draghi singled out the risks posed by Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote, while testifying to MEPs on the Economic and Monetary Affairs committee. He says that the recovery of the euro area economy \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gained momentum at the start of the year\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but added: At the same time, uncertainty remains high and downside risks are still significant due to the continued fragile state of the global economy and geopolitical developments. We will closely monitor the evolution of the outlook for price stability. We stand ready to act by using all the instruments available within our mandate, if necessary, to achieve our objective. In particular, the ECB is ready for all contingencies following the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum. Draghi also reminded MEPs that further stimulus is coming soon, and urged them to help deepen the single market and reform their economies. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full statement: The session is being streamed live here. Time for a quick catch-up. The pound has clambered to its highest level against the US dollar since early January today, as international investors continue to expect a Remain campaign victory in Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum. Sterling hit $1.4781 this morning, its highest level since David Cameron called Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote. But it dipped back after a poll showed the Leave campaign close behind Remain, at 44% versus 45%. After a weak start, the London stock market has crawled back into positive territory. The FTSE 100 is up 2 points, lagging the rest of Europe today. UK banks have only taken \u00c2\u00a3370m from the Bank of England in a special liquidity auction. One banker has told us that the City is less worried about the referendum. But Brexit fears have also been blamed for pushing Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public borrowing over target in last two months: Three top figures in economics and finance have all warned again leaving the EU. George Soros said it would trigger a sterling crash Nouriel Roubini predicted a recession, Larry Summers warned it could cause a market crash on Friday. But other City experts have warned that investors could be complacent; given the opinion polls are so close. Our main EU referendum liveblog is here (including speculation that the referendum could trigger a general election). The pound has dropped back after David Cameron made a solemn plea to the country to vote Remain. Speaking (unexpectedly) outside Number 10, the PM said the economy will be stronger if we stay, and weaker if we leave. He also cited national security, warning that it will be harder to keep the country safe outside the EU. At one point, Cameron declared that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brits don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd; and that the EU will carry on making vital decisions without the UK after a leave vote. And he also made a direct appeal to older voters, saying Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote was vital for their children, grandchildren and future generations. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear if this was a scheduled move by the PM, or an off-the-cuff decision. But the pound has now lost its early gains, and is hovering around $1.4688, where it started the day. The FTSE 100 is down 8 points too. But traders are also reacting to the latest Survation poll, which showed Remain just one percentage point ahead of Leave. Our Politics Liveblog will have full reaction and analysis to Cameron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech. Hello... David Cameron is speaking outside Downing Street right now. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s explaining why Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote is so crucial economically, and for national security. Our politics liveblog is covering it.... A new survey from Survation has shown that the Remain campaign has 45% support, with Leave very close behind on 44%. Larry Summers, the former US Treasury secretary, has joined the ranks of international experts warning against Brexit. In a new blog post, Summers predicted wild market gyrations on Friday if the Leave campaign in, and long-term economic damage. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: First, unlike almost all other economic policy choices, Brexit is irreversible. Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois Mitterrand\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lurch toward socialism in France, Ronald Reagan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s excessive tax cuts in the U.S., and Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s encouragement of bubbles were all egregious errors, but all were reversed, albeit not before substantial damage had been done. Divorce can be reversed by remarriage if regretted. There is no reversing Brexit if it proves unwise. Indeed, given the E.U.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very strong incentive to discourage further dissolution, it is far from clear that there would even be concerted efforts to minimize its cost. Second, markets are likely to suffer extraordinary volatility in the wake of Brexit. A Black Friday could follow referendum Thursday. It is likely that foreign investors in British stocks would lose 15 percent off the bat, adding together market declines and currency losses. This is a judgement supported by the gyrations in markets induced by relatively small fluctuations in the perceived chance of Brexit and by the very high prices commanded by out of the money options. The truth is that even with all the regulatory changes that have been put in place, we do not know for sure how the financial system will respond. A return of systemic risk as large losses lead to cascading liquidations cannot be ruled out. At a time when central banks have far less ammunition than they did in 2008, the consequences could be grave. Third, Brexit will undermine confidence and increase uncertainty. No one knows what the new structure will be or how soon it will emerge. Quite likely Brexit would lead to changes not only in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relationship with Europe but also within Europe itself. While businesses wait to see what happens, they will hold off on new investment. Some will decide that it is much safer to base European operations outside the U.K. The small rally in the pound today shows that Brexit fears are easing today, says Bill O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Neill, head of the UK Investment Office at UBS Wealth Management. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Markets are now assuming a remain outcome, with sterling edging up slightly against the dollar this morning following the significant gains of yesterday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Polls released overnight suggest a swing back to show a mixed picture, but there is a sense that the momentum favouring leave has been halted. Additionally, betting odds are now also pointing to that outcome. It is worth bearing in mind that the odds have consistently been in favour of remain, despite the narrowing seen last week. The US stock market is expected to open calmly in 90 minutes time. The main indices predicted to rise by around 0.4%, as investors wait to hear from Janet Yellen, Fed chair, when she starts testifying to the Senate banking committee at 3pm BST (10am local time). JP Morgan have done us a big favour by working out when the key EU referendum results will come. Using data from the University of Bristol, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve identified the most pro-Remain and pro-Brexit areas of the country. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also estimated the voting split in each area, based on a national dead-heat. That could help us work out who is actually winning as the results come in (as pro-Remain areas are likely to report first). Veteran US investor Wilbur Ross has revealed that the looming EU referendum has deterred him from buying assets in Europe. Speaking on CNBC, Ross also accused George Soros of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exaggerating\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, in The Guardian today. Ross isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convinced that the pound would suffer a worse fall than on Black Wednesday if the public vote to leave the EU. Ross also reckons house prices would fall very sharply after a Brexit vote. He also revealed that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s planning to raise money for Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tilt at the White House... Here are the Reuters snaps: Wilbur Ross on CNBC - Home prices would plummet in the event of a British exit Wilbur Ross on CNBC - George Soros \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exaggerating\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with his take on Brexit effect on pound Wilbur Ross on CNBC - Intends to work hard to raise funds for Trump Boom! The pound has hit its highest level since the start of the year, in a fresh signal that Brexit fears are easing. Sterling has jumped by almost 0.5% against the US dollar to $1.4781, a level last seen on 4 January - before the whole dratted EU referendum campaign began. The pound is also up around 0.2% against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.3017, its highest level in June. The rally comes as the Bank of England reveals that UK financial institutions took just \u00c2\u00a3370m in a special liquidity auction today. That auction was set up to flood the City with liquidity, if needed, by allowing banks to get ready cash off the BoE in return for handing over assets [here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an explainer] \u00c2\u00a3370m is the smallest take-up for any such auction since January 2015. Such a small take-up suggests that banks are not worried about panic gripping the financial world on Friday morning, when the referendum result is known. Alternatively, they may feel they have enough liquid assets to sell if needed. City traders need to set their alarm clocks extra early on Friday morning. Assuming they go to bed at all. Fixed income and derivatives platform Tradeweb has announced it will open for business from 4am on Friday morning, as referendum results will be coming in through the night. In a note released to clients late on Monday, reported by Reuters, Tradeweb says it will help traders execute electronic orders outside usual trading hours. Shares in London are recovering from their early losses, on the back of a decent set of financial results from Whitbread (which owns Costa Coffee and Premier Inn). Investors are also digesting the news that David Beckham has backed the Remain campaign (an interesting way of marking the looming 18th anniversary of his freekick against Columbia in the 1998 World Cup) Chris Beauchamp, Senior Market Analyst at IG, says investors are taking a breather after Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big gains. After a barnstorming day yesterday markets are, unsurprisingly, much quieter, although the lion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share of the stock market gains seen yesterday remain intact. Perhaps investors are exhibiting signs of fatigue with the ongoing Brexit debate, with fresh polls and the commitment of a certain Mr D Beckham to the Remain campaign providing little spark. However, sterling remains in demand against both the euro and the dollar, an indication that markets remain confident about the outcome. Away from Brexit, Whitbread has soared to the top of the FTSE, as a return to solid growth for Costa Coffee assuages fears that the hospitality firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth engine is sputtering. Those disappointing UK public finance figures mean Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actually borrowed \u00c2\u00a3200m more this year than in 2015-16. Ross Campbell, public sector director at accountancy group ICAEW, blames the EU referendum for creating uncertainty - and distracting chancellor George Osborne. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The impending EU referendum vote has contributed to an uncertainty that has resulted in a sluggish UK economy, therefore it was imperative that the Chancellor put public sector finances at the top of his priority list for May 2016. An increase of \u00c2\u00a30.2 billion in public sector net borrowing in the current financial year-to-date, when compared with the same period in 2015, illustrates that he has done quite the opposite and has taken his eye off the economic ball.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whatever the result on Friday morning, whether we remain in or leave the European Union, it is vital that Government devises a comprehensive and rigorous strategy to kick-start a faltering economic recovery. Back to the referendum....and chancellor George Osborne has seized on the latest warnings from economists: Here come the latest UK public finances..... ... and they show that Britain borrowed \u00c2\u00a39.14bn in May, to cover the gap between tax receipts and government spending. May is never a good month for the public finances, and this is actually the smallest deficit for a May since 2007 (which tells you something about how bad the situation has been since). But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than expected, and it pushes up the total national debt to \u00c2\u00a31.6069 trillion, or 83.7% of GDP. And in another blow, April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borrowing figures have also been revised higher, to \u00c2\u00a38.2bn from an initial forecast of \u00c2\u00a37.2bn. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too early to say whether the UK is on track for its deficit targets this financial year (which runs from April 2016 to March 2017): Newsflash from Germany: The German constitutional court has rejected attempts to block the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bond-buying rescue plan, the Outright Monetary Transactions scheme. That is important, because OMT is a key part of the rescue plan for the eurozone. It allows the ECB to buy unlimited quantities of eurozone government bonds, if they suffer a spike in borrowing costs. This would, in theory, avoid a repeat of the 2011-2012 eurozone debt crisis, when countries such as Greece, Portugal and Ireland were locked out of the markets. Although it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s never been used, OMT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very existence helped to calm the crisis in the eurozone (as speculators were reluctant to risk being crushed by the ECB). Campaigners had asked Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s constitutional court to block it, claiming it violated rules banning central banks from funding national governments. Back in 2014, the German judges referred the issue to the European Court of Justice, which approved OMT with some minor caveats. That decision has now been rubber-stamped, which will reassure the markets.. Some City experts are concerned that investors may be too complacent about Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum. Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, warns that the markets could be overreacting to a few polls putting Remain in the lead. Investors are rolling the dice on Britain choosing to remain part of the EU but there is still plenty of opportunity to get burned. The polls are close and there is still every chance of a Brexit, despite the swing towards the In camp over the last few days. Traders betting the farm on a sterling rally happening on Friday should remember just how wrong polls were at the last General Election and just how far the pound could drop if Britain votes out. While the polls are close, the odds paint a different picture. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve lengthened the odds of a Leave vote on our Brexit market, with a roughly 75% probability that Remain will triumph. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s far from over \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there is still huge uncertainty for the markets and the City over the coming days as support for the Leave is holding up and could rally further. Duncan Weldon, head of research at the Resolution Foundation, agrees: This chart underlines how strongly the markets reacted yesterday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with shares rallying around the globe. Bank of America has warned its customers that it could be tricky to trade on Friday. It fears that the huge interest in the EU referendum will make it harder to get accurate, fast quotes and execute orders as fast as usual. Other trading companies have given similar warnings recently, including City firm Charles Stanley. Investors are digesting two new opinion polls this morning, which give conflicting views on the referendum race. An ORB poll for the Telegraph puts remain back in front for the first time in almost a month on 53% to leave\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 46%, among those certain to vote. But a Times/YouGov poll sees leave retain a lead of two points over remain, 51% to 49%. Ana Thaker, market economist at PhillipCapital UK, reckons the pound could be lively today: The currency continues to reflect market sentiment ahead of the vote and as new polling information is released, we could see further volatility in the currency over today. Sterling has touched a new seven-week high this morning, extending yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery. The pound hit $1.4740 against the US dollar, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best level since the start of May. Yesterday it surged by around three cents, in its strongest rally in almost eight years. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is falling in early trading, as traders get another dose of Brexit jitters. The FTSE 100 index had shed 40 points in the first few minutes, a drop of 0.6%, to 6165 points. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a reason to panic - given the Footsie surged by 180-odd points on Monday. But it does show that investors are still anxious about Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in the light of these fresh warnings from Nouriel Roubini and George Soros. Mining companies are leading the fallers, showing concerns about global economic growth. UK housebuilders such as Berkeley, Barratt and Persimmon are also dropping back. They would probably suffer from Brexit, if it meant higher interest rates and fewer EU workers looking for property. Nouriel Roubini, one of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most famously pessimistic economists, has urged the UK not to quit the EU. Roubini won the nickname \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Dr Doom\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for his dark predictions in the run-up to the financial crisis, and was proved right when the 2007 credit crunch struck, leading to the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. And in a flurry of tweets, he predicted that Britain could plunge into recession if it decided to leave the EU - especially given its record trade deficit, and government borrowing needs. Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Faisal Islam reckons this gives Roubini extra credibility, compared to the more \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcestablishment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 voices such as the IMF and the OECD. Roubini is certainly not a dusty old economist. Back in 2013, he was ordered to remove a hot tub from the roof of his New York penthouse. Roubini told one reporter he would cram up to 10 young models into the tub, adding (immodestly) that: They love my beautiful mind. I am ugly, but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re attracted to the brains. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a rock star among geeks, wonks and nerds. Apparently the hot tub returned to action in 2015 - with Roubini hosting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153special meditation sessions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201d plus a dip in the tub \u00e2\u20ac\u201d during New York Fashion Week. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unclear whether last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit tweets were sent from the tub...... The warning comes hours after George Soros, the veteran financial speculator-turned-philanthropist, predicted that the pound would plunge if Britain voted for Brexit. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With two days to go, Britain is still locked in its referendum bubble. And investors around the globe are pressing their noses against the glass, wondering whether the UK will take the historic step to leave the European Union. Yesterday, shares and sterling both rallied strongly after polls suggested a swing towards the Remain campaign. But this morning, traders are more nervous. The pound has come under pressure overnight in Asia, and the London stock market is expected to dip a little when trading begins. CMC Markets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Michael Hewson reckons it could be a choppy day: Financial markets appear to be taking the view that the race may well already be run, which given the twists and turns seen already in this campaign may well be extremely far sighted, or dangerously premature. With more polls due out later today we can expect to see further volatility unfold in the event of a move either way. As we look ahead to another choppy day European markets look set to pause for breath today, opening mixed after the FTSE100 enjoyed its best one day gain since August last year, surging over 3% yesterday. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot on the agenda today too to keep us occupied and maybe distract from the referendum battle, including appearances by two top central bankers. The German constitutional court is ruling on the legality of one of the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key measures to fight the financial crisis, its OMT (outright monetary transactions) programme. OMT allows the ECB to buy up bonds issued by eurozone countries who struggled to borrow in the markets. The ruling could come at 9am BST. At 9.30am, we get the latest UK public finances. Economists believe it will show that Britain borrowed around \u00c2\u00a37.5bn to balance the books in May. Then at 10am, the ZEW index of German investor confidence is released. It may show Brexit fears hitting the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy. At 2pm, ECB chief Mario Draghi will testify to the European Parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic and monetary affair committee, in Brussels. And at 3pm, Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen testifies to the Senate banking panel, in Washington DC. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the main action through the day....",

GW Pantheon Economics, the City firm, have just predicted that the Remain campaign are in a better position than the polls show. They believe that the opinion polls are wrong, when they suggest the result is close, and that the markets are right to predict a Remain victory. Chief economist Samuel Tombs says: Polls suggest Brexit is a coin toss, but they usually miss the last minute surge in status quo support. The self-reported likelihood to vote of younger people, who typically back Remain, has shot up. Europhile areas of Britain have seen bigger rises in voter registrations than Eurosceptic areas. One factor is that polling companies think young people are relativels unlikely to vote. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a false assumption, Samuel reckons: Polls by ORB have shown that the proportion of 18-to-24 year olds reporting that they will definitely vote rose to 51% last week, from 29% at the start of June. The same trend was observed among 25-to-34 year olds. Just time for some thoughts from Jack McIntyre, a portfolio manager at Brandywine Global (part of asset management firm Legg Mason). I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m betting Brexit will be more similar to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Y2K\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd than a Lehman moment. The wildcard will be if it is a fairly tight outcome, so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure if a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd vote will solve the underlying EU problems. Clearly, it highlights that a big, vast part of the U.K. populous will still show discontent and frustration. My view has been that the Brexit referendum was really a symptom of the broader disease. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the disease? That we are in a prolonged period of sustained, low economic growth. Incomes have been stagnant for years, which means there is a lot of pent up frustration with the U.K. electorate. This also explains the support for Donald Trump as the next leader of the US, among those who feel they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not getting a fair deal. In this period of challenged growth, politicians and the general populous are pointing the finger at other entities to explain why growth, and therefore incomes, have has been challenged. Opinium\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website has crashed, under the weight of interest for details about tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poll. The closing auction for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s City trading session lasted rather longer than usual, as the London Stock Exchange matched up the last trades and tidied up loose ends. And when it finally ended, the FTSE 100 is up just 34 points today, or 0.5%, at 6261. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a two-week high.....but it could have been better. Going into the auction, the index was up 76 points and heading for a seven-week high, before a flurry of late sell orders dragged it down. Financial stocks led the rises, led by investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, suggesting that investors are expecting the Remain side to win tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote. Tony Cross, analyst at Trustnet, says: There can be little doubting the way that sentiment has swung round \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in the region of \u00c2\u00a3100bn has been added to London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue chip equities since those lows last Thursday, and the market is pricing in less than a 25% chance of the Leave camp now winning. The pound has fallen back, after Opinium reported that Leave have taken a small lead: It dropped half a cent when the results hit the wires, and is now up just 0.3 of a cent at $1.4674. Breaking: Opinium have just released their latest opinion poll. And it shows that the Leave campaign have a slender lead. They give 45% to the Leave campaign, and 44% to Remain. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a slight move to Leave, compared to the last Opinium poll putting the two sides neck-and-neck. City traders may be tempted to head home for a rest, before the inevitable drama of Thursday night and Friday. But with an opinion poll due soon, they might want to hang on..... The FTSE 100 is creeping higher, now up 72 points today at 6299 -- still a two-week high. My colleague Fiona Walsh has spied people stocking up on foreign currency ahead of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote, confirming what the Post Office have said today. A couple more photos of people queueing at foreign exchange dealers in London have also arrived in our system: Bond trading giant Pimco has predicted that sterling could hit a 30-year low against the US dollar, if Britain votes to leave the European Union. Mike Amey, PIMCO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of sterling portfolios, told a forum organised by Reuters that the pound could fall as far $1.30 (from $1.47 today). Amey also reckons there is a 60% chance that Britain would remain in the EU. If that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen, he believes the Bank of England would cut interest rates to zero. BBC personal finance correspondent Simon Gompertz has found a queue to buy foreign currency in London today: That photo was taken at lunchtime; often a busy time in the City. But there does appear to be quite a rush for dollars and euros.... Some Brits are racing to the high street to stock up on foreign currency, in case the pound plunges following Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum. The Post Office reports that currency sales this week are 74% higher than a year ago, suggesting that talk of sterling crashing has worried the public. My colleague Rupert Jones has the details: The Post Office said branch sales were up by 48.8% on the same period a year ago, while online purchases had increased by 381%.... A surge in transactions was also reported by FairFX, which specialises in prepaid currency cards that can be loaded with money in advance and allow people to lock into a rate now. It said many people heading to Europe or the US in the coming weeks were buying now to guarantee their exchange rate ahead of the referendum result. FairFX said the amounts being loaded on to US dollar cards, plus orders of dollar banknotes, were up almost 300% this week compared with the start of last week. It has also seen a 100%-plus increase in euro cards being loaded over the same period. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story: DING DING. Shares on Wall Street are inching higher at the start of trading, as traders watch events across the Atlantic closely. The Dow Jones industrial average is up 34 points, or 0.2%, in the first few minutes of action, with investors remaining cautious. The stock market is staging a small rally, perhaps a sign of confidence about tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum. The FTSE 100 has now risen by 57 points, or 0.9%, to 6284. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a two-week high, taking us back to the times before polls showed Leave gathering support. Financial stocks, such as Standard Chartered and RSA Insurance, are leading the rally, as are mining giants like Rio Tinto (who are usually hit by economic worries) The pound is also holding onto its earlier gains; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now up 0.4 cents at $1.4683. Mihir Kapadia, CEO at Sun Global Investments, says the City is anticipating that the British public will vote to stay in the EU. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122With the EU referendum now only a day away, markets are braced for the impact. Polls are very close at the moment, global stocks and the pound continued to rise today, while safe haven assets continue to slip \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an indication that investors, at least, are optimistic of a Remain vote come Friday morning. But if they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re wrong, we could see massive volatility on Friday. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains: The sharp readjustment out of safe havens in favour of risky assets including the British pound in the last few days means markets may be underestimating the fallout from a Brexit. Even if betting and financial markets are proven correct and the UK votes against Brexit, the potential for political fallout in the aftermath is a downside risk. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got a point..... UBS has raised the stakes ahead of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote by predicting that share prices could plunge by 20% if the Leave campaign win. Analysts at the Swiss bank have predicted that a Brexit victory would sent the FTSE 100 plunging to 4,900 points, wiping \u00c2\u00a3350bn off the index. That level hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been seen since late 2011, when the Greek and Italian government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s were collapsing under the strain of the eurozone debt crisis. However, a Remain win could send the FTSE 100 back up to 6800, UBS reckon. That would be a one-year high. More here: Theme of the day..... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state agents are gearing up for a busy Friday, whichever way the vote goes. Guy Gittins, sales director at London agent Chestertons, said the firm had five or six sales ready to exchange after the vote. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They are waiting to go through if the result goes the right way for the buyer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s circumstances.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd . It is not just buyers who are sitting tight - a branch of Jackson-Stops &amp; Staff reports that a \u00c2\u00a31.4m property in the Midlands has been photographed and is ready to market, but may only be formally put up for sale if the UK votes to remain. If the country votes to remain Gittins predicts the central London property market will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153back to business as usual\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The backlog of the last five months of indecision will come back to the market and there will be good trading towards the end of the year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd If the UK opts to leave, and the value of the pound drops \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There will be [overseas] buyers who suddenly see a fall in the price of property \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 we expect the same as in 2008, when the rest of the world was in meltdown and the London market continued to do well as investors looked for a safe haven.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Peter Wetherell of Mayfair agency Wetherell said a leave vote could lead to a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexit bubble\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He points out that a weaker pound will boost the buying power of foreign investors. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the value of Sterling plummets post-Brexit then it will create a short-term buying opportunity for US dollar and Euro based property investors. For overseas buyers, a big drop in the value of Sterling will effectively offset the Stamp Duty and tax adjustments and make Prime London property a lucrative investment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Dollar based Middle East and Asian investors in particular will look at short-term buying opportunities in Central London and look at acquiring residential property priced up to \u00c2\u00a36m.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound is creeping higher as lunchtime approaches. It is now up 0.2% against the US dollar, at $1.4678. It has already gained a whole 4% in the last few days, as investors became more confident that Britain would remain in the EU. Online bookmaker Betfair has now taken \u00c2\u00a345m on the referendum, giving an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcimplied probability\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of 76% that Britain will stay in the EU. Spokesperson Naomi Totten says it is the biggest political event in its history, with punters now wondering how big the victory margin will be: Tuesday night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debate saw very little significant movement in the odds, despite \u00c2\u00a31m being traded during and immediately after. Attention is now being drawn to the margin of victory for Remain, with between 50.01% and 55% the favourite on the vote percentage mark. There had been a surge of betting on Leave in early June, as polls showed the mood shifting. But this has reversed in the last week or so.  The current market calm will be spectacularly broken, once the results of the EU referendum becomes clear. Dean Turner, economist at UBS Wealth Management, says: Last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debate has had little bearing on the markets today, which appear pensive ahead of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote. Sterling, the FTSE 100 and the gilt market are all flat, levelling off from some of the cautiously optimistic rallies earlier in the week. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Polls released later today have the potential to move market expectations either way, but the reluctance of investors to move unambiguously in one direction is a reflection of how tight polling has been. Once the result starts to become clear on Friday, we expect that markets will move quickly.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here are some highlights of last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU debate, by the way, in case you missed it: Another sign that the City is on edge: A year ago, everyone was panicking about the prospect of Greece leaving the eurozone. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the same feeling of panic this time; Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Maxime Sbaihi wonders why..... With the pound and the Footsie 100 both flat, you might think that there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much going on today. But traders aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t out enjoying the sun (even if they could find it). Instead, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re sitting anxiously at their desks, wondering what drama lies ahead. Two days ago, the markets were soaring after a flurry of opinion polls suggest a late swing to Remain. That has now petered out, though. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says nervousness is rife: With less than 24 hours left until the UK hits the polling booth, there is a tangible feeling of uncertainty and anxiety permeating through financial markets this morning, with the bullish sentiment that started the week is short supply. One in three German firms believes a Brexit would hurt them, according to a survey just released by the Munich-based IFO thinktank. IFO found that 38% of companies believe they would suffer if Britain left the EU, while 62% believe it makes no difference and 1% believe it would be positive. Brexit jitters are especially common among Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest companies, IFO says: Large companies with 500+ employees were particularly anxious about the referendum outcome and 53% expect a Brexit to negatively impact their operations. For manufacturers in the export business, the figure is 41%, which is slightly higher than the overall average. More here. Trading is very muted in the City today, says Mark Priest, head of index and equity market making at ETX Capital: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The recent poll-inspired surge looks like it has run its course and trading is going pretty sideways for now. Any last minute shifts in polls could radically change things but while the result is too close to call investors seem unwilling to take any big decisions until after the vote.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Finland government is concerned that it could be dragged back into recession by a Brexit vote. A finance ministry official told a press conference in Helsinki that: It [a recession] is possible. But we could fall into that territory also without Brexit. The growth is not that strong, other external shocks could have that impact, too.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Finland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy has already endured a rocky few years due to the eurozone debt crisis, the impact of sanctions in neighbouring Russia, the downturn in the paper industry, and the demise of once-mighty Nokia. Its membership of the eurozone meant it couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t devalue its currency; instead it has embarked on a austerity programme that hit wages, pushed up unemployment, and placed serious strains on its coalition government. The pound is having a nervous morning. Sterling has been bobbing against the US dollar, and is currently flat at $1.4654. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also down 0.3% against the euro, to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.2997. It feels like investors are keeping on the sidelines until the referendum is over. Ana Thaker, market economist at PhillipCapital UK, says there could be more drama today: There will be last ditch attempts by both sides to persuade the undecided ahead of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote so volatility will be rife with Sterling bearing the brunt of it and equity markets look likely to be risk-off until the results are announced. Many traders will be poised for the last few opinion polls: Iain Duncan-Smith, a leading Leave campaigner, also dismisses economic worries about Brexit. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on Bloomberg TV now, saying that German industry, for example, would want to access UK customers. The EU is mired in an economic mess and needs access to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, says Duncan-Smith, arguing that the UK could cut a decent trade deal with Europe. Pro-Brexit economist John Longworth has rejected the concerns of the business chiefs who are pushing for a Remain victory. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, Longworth argued that businesses would thrive away from Brussels red tape. He believes Britain could cut trade deals with other countries, pointing out that China manages to export huge amounts of goods to Europe without joining the single market. Longworth, who resigned as director general of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) after expressing support for Brexit, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need trade arrangements to trade with the world, but they oil the wheels\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He also criticised Europe for imposing tariffs, which push up the cost of food and clothing from outside the EU. Financial jobs are likely to shift from the UK to Germany and France if the Leave campaign win. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial services commissioner, Jonathan Hill (a Brit appointed by David Cameron). Hill told German business newspaper Handelsblatt that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve visited London, Manchester and other British financial centres in the past weeks and warned of the consequences of an exit from the EU. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Then it could happen that banks and investment funds shift activities and jobs to Frankfurt and Paris.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Traders in London are anxious this morning, as the final day before voting gets underway. The FTSE 100 is basically flat, lagging behind the rest of Europe. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services says investors are posed for the next developments in the referendum race, including new opinion polls: On the Brexit referendum polling front, there are are online polls due from YouGov, Opinum and TNS, along with a ComRes phone poll, all of which will underline that the pool of floating/undecided voters remains high, and should therefore be treated with enormous circumspection Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime minister has urged Britain to remain in the EU and help tackle the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic, social and security problems Writing in The Guardian, Matteo Renzi, the centre-left reformist PM, said the UK must not make \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the wrong choice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by embracing isolationism. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: Contra spem, as the ancient Romans used to say: meaning \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to hope against hope\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, to dare to dream. I am reminded of this exhortation when thinking of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum, a vote which offers a clear choice either to stay in, as we hope is the outcome, or to leave Europe. In my mind\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eye, like all of you, I can see the smiling face of the MP Jo Cox, her life given over to great causes, the photograph with her little son peering at the sunlight through a glade of trees; her senseless death. I can see also the strength and dignity of a democracy that can be divided \u00e2\u20ac\u201c bitterly so \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on everything, but which nevertheless can stand united and strong when faced with hatred, with the unthinkable, with the absurd. Seen from Italy, a vote to leave Europe would not be a disaster, a tragedy or the end of the world for you in the UK. It would be worse, because it would be the wrong choice. It would be a mistake for which you the voters primarily would pay the price. Because who really wants Britain to be small and isolated? Wondering how the stock market would respond to a Leave victory? Swiss bank Credit Suisse has told its clients today that it would slash its year-end forecasts for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s benchmark FTSE 100 equity index by 6%, if Britain voted to leave the European Union this week. It currently expects the blue-chip index to reach 6,600 by the end of December, but it would cut that to 6,200 if a Brexit occurred. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite a big drop. However, the FTSE 100 is currently trading around 6233. So Credit Suisse are definitely not predicting a full-blown meltdown. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum is just one day away, and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really nothing else on the financial world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agenda. Last night, UK TV viewers were transfixed by England vs Sri Lanka Spain vs Croatia at Euro 2016 a special debate between the Leave and Remain campaigners, which saw both side trade blows ahead of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote [here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a full round-up]. A snap YouGov poll for the Times found 39% thought leave had won it, over 34% for remain (with 17% on the fence). The same group were just a smidgen more likely to vote for remain: 41% to 40%. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still awfully tight. And this morning, almost 1,300 business leaders haves signed a letter recommending a Remain vote, as EU membership is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good for business and good for British jobs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd . The letter is packed with big names, including Michael Bloomberg and Sir Richard Branson, plus the bosses of half the FTSE 100 (including the chairman of Barclays and BAE Systems and Standard Life, and the CEOs of BT, Burberry and WPP) They claim that Brexit would damage the UK economy, especially if it meant leaving the single market. They write: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Britain leaving the EU would mean uncertainty for our firms, less trade with Europe and fewer jobs... Smaller businesses and the people they employ are particularly vulnerable to any economic shock which could follow.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Some of them, such as Branson, have made their pro-EU views known before. But other names on the list are new entrants to the debate. The letter is online here (behind a paywall, alas): British business \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbenefits massively from EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Will it make a difference? It could possibly sway waverers, worried that their jobs could be hit by the economic shock caused by Brexit. But pro-Leave supporters may conclude that these are the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcelite\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 who have done terribly well out of the status quo, and are just fretting that their next bonus cheque is at risk. Also coming up today.... The economic calendar is very quiet, but at 3pm we do get the latest EU consumer confidence report. And the head of the US central bank, Janet Yellen, is testifying to Congress again. Yesterday she warned that the EU vote could trigger a wave of uncertainty across Europe. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also keep an eye on Spain, where voters return to the polls on Sunday in a general election. And also on Hanover, where Volkswagen is holding its AGM. Last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s emissions scandal should come up.....",

                "bodyText":"So the FTSE has closed up at the highest level since 21 April, at 6,338.1. The pound hit a six-month high against the dollar, rising above $1. 48 for the first time in 2016. Sterling is currently up 0.7% at $1.4807. It is also up 0.1% against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.3030. In the US, Wall Street is also making strong gains. Dow Jones: +1% at 17,958 S&amp;P 500: +1% at 2,107 Nasdaq: +1.1% at 4,451 That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it for today. Our main referendum blog is still running and covering all the key political developments: Thank you for joining us today. AM The FTSE 100 has staged a late rally as trading comes to a close for the day. Earlier in the day it was up by more than 100 points, but the majority of the gains were lost as investor nerves picked up - leaving the FTSE up just 18 points at one point. The FTSE has closed for the day at 6,338.1, up 77 points or 1.2%. Here is how things look at the close elsewhere in Europe: Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +1.9% at 10,257.03 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +2% at 4,465.9 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: +2.1% at 8,885.3 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: +3.7% at 17,966.17 Andy Scott, economist at HiFX, has a good take on the pound: After clocking up an impressive rally of nearly 2% on Thursday - hitting a 6-month high against the US dollar as the polls showed a late swing to a Remain vote - sterling reversed course sharply this afternoon. GBP/USD fell 200 points from its high to $1.4750 as traders took profits on the earlier rally, positioning themselves cautiously ahead of a still uncertain outcome. Leading into this evening, we expect liquidity to fall further as banks reign in FX activity, especially in GBP transactions with no one wanting to get their fingers burnt by the expected big moves that are possible in either direction. We expect some initial reaction in Sterling to the exit polls after 10pm, with the main excitement likely to be in the early hours of Friday morning once we starting getting the results in. The pound is up 0.5% against the dollar at $1.4777. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up 0.07% against the euro at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.3024. Latest on the markets: Europe: FTSE 100: +0.6% at 6,301 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: +1.1% at 10,185 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +1.1% at 4,428 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: +1.2% at 8,806 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: +2.7% at 17,798 Wall Street: Dow Jones: +0.9% at 17,946 S&amp;P 500: +0.7% at 2,101 Nasdaq: +1% at 4,447 Brits have been rushing to buy their holiday money according to No.1 Currency. The foreign exchange firm said business jumped by 70% on Wednesday, with queues forming at some of its 102 high street stores, and online sales up 300%. Simon Phillips, retail director at No.1 Currency: Demand has rocketed for all foreign currencies, but euros and dollars are proving especially popular. Our stores came close to running out of the most popular currencies on Wednesday, and as high demand continues today we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve dramatically increased stock levels to cope with the surge in demand during the final hours before the result is announced. So it appears that investors are feeling a little less bold this afternoon, with referendum jitters creeping back in. Connor Campbell of Spredex has a view: Things have calmed down somewhat since that midday frenzy, the European indices looking increasing nervy as closing time creeps closer. The indices receded from their midday peaks, instead returning to the calmer trading seen earlier in the morning. So, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost it. One imagines that regardless of the result tomorrow with be a far more hectic day of trading, be it caused by a post-Brexit plunge or a relieved wave of investors pouring back in to buy up the pound et al. UK investors are losing some enthusiasm now. The FTSE 100 is up 18 points or 0.3% at 6,278 - smaller gains than we saw earlier in the day when the FTSE was up more than 100 points at 6,371 at one point. The pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gains against the dollar have also slowed, with sterling up 0.7% at $1.4810. It had hit a high of $1.4948 at one point on Thursday morning. More positive news on the US economy... this time from the manufacturing sector. The headline index on Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153flash\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd manufacturing PMI survey rose to a three-month of high of 51.4 in June, from 50.7 in May (where anything above 50 indicates expansion). Growth in exports was the main driver of growth. It was better than expected, with economists forecasting 50.8 for the headline index combing output, new orders and employment. Output in the sector grew modestly, and new business increased at an accelerated rate, boosted by the fastest pace in export sales since September 2014. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit responded with caution to the better-than-expected PMI: The flash PMI for June brought welcome news of improved performance of manufacturing, but the sector still looks to have acted as a drag on the economy in the second quarter, leaving the economy reliant on the service sector and consumers in particular to drive growth. Any improvement could be largely traced to better export sales, in turn linked to the weakening of the dollar compared to earlier in the year. Domestic demand was again worryingly weak, especially from business customers, meaning overall growth of order books remained subdued. US markets are up in early trading, echoing the upbeat sentiment in Europe. Dow Jones: +0.6% at 17,892 S&amp;P 500: +0.6% at 2,099 Nasdaq: +0.8% at 4,872 Away from the markets, US jobless claims fell more sharply than expected last week according to figures from the Labor Department. The number of new claims for unemployment benefits fell to 259,000 in the week ending 18 June, from 277,000 a week earlier. It was the biggest drop since February and close to a 43-year low touched in March. Economists polled by Reuters were expecting a smaller drop to 270,000. Wall Street is expected to open higher: On a lighter note, a horse named Brexit is taking to the turf at the Newbury racecourse tonight, at 6.10pm. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unlikely to triumph, with Betfair offering 12-1 odds on Brexit galloping home first. I mentioned earlier that the cost of insuring against the pound either plunging or soaring overnight had soared. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still true. But, the cost of insuring against wild swings over the next week has fallen. That suggests investors are less worried about a sterling crisis kicking off tomorrow. Amid today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally, some analysts are urging traders not to get carried away. Not a single vote has been counted yet. Peter Rosenstreich, head of market strategy Swissquote Bank, says investors need to trade very carefully, and keep an eye on the North East city of Sunderland... One of the earlier constituencies to declare a result should be Sunderland, viewed as a Brexit bellwether. Should Sunderland result in a close result or an outright majority vote to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, then it is assumed that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd vote will triumph. By 05:00am BST, 80% of authorities are expected to have made their respective declarations, providing a clearer view of the outcome. Foreign exchange group UKForex has seen a 100% increase in consumers making transfers from the pound into other currencies, in the last 24 hours. The majority are transferring from sterling to euros. William Shepherd, global head of treasury at UK Forex, says some customers are concerned that the cost of buying a European property could rocket if the pound drops tomorrow. Shepherd explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the UK opts to leave, the pound could fall as much as 20%. Consumers could lose up to \u00c2\u00a31,398 on a \u00c2\u00a310,000 transfer, compared to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd David Cheetham of City firm XTB.com says the financial markets appear to have discounted the chance of Brexit over the last few days: The price movements so far this week in financial markets suggest that a victory in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum for the leave camp has been given a very low probability, with the pound touching its highest level of the year against the US dollar this morning whilst the surge in the FTSE of late continues almost unabated. Rather than heeding caution and remaining on the sidelines until this potentially major event risk has passed, traders appear to be betting on remain prevailing and are positioning accordingly. Even the oil price is up this morning, as investors show more confidence about the global economy. Brent crude is up 1.7%, back over $50 per barrel at $50.71. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest news story on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market moves, by Katie Allen: Another opinion poll just flashed up, also giving Remain the majority of support. Populous reports that 55% of people surveyed want to stay in the EU, while 45% want to leave. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the biggest gap recorded in the final flurry of polls before today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote, as polling expert Mike Smithson explains: The City isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t waiting for the EU referendum result before piling into the pound. Over at City firm ETX Capital, traders are getting ready for a referendum all-nighter. Joe Rundle, head of trading, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whatever the result, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be a sleepless night for our traders as the results come in slowly on Friday morning. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be fully staffed overnight to cope with the increased trading and volatility. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an incredible opportunity for traders to make big bets on the fortunes of the pound and other markets affected by the referendum such as the FTSE. A word of warning, however, as there could be some potentially wild gyrations in prices, particularly in sterling. Some banks are warning that they might fail to execute orders on their electronic trading platforms. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve drawn up plans to deal with any increased volatility based on our positive experience of the Swiss franc turmoil last year, when the Swiss National Bank unpegged the currency from the euro. Wowzers, the pound has now broken through $1.49 for the first time since the end of last December. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a gain of two whole cents today. Breaking: Ipsos MORI, the polling company, has just released its final opinion poll on the referendum. And it shows that 52% of those surveyed wanted to stay in the European Union, against 48% who favour Leaving. IMPORTANTLY, this is not an exit poll. That pushed the pound up to a new six-month high, of $1.488. The poll was conducted for the Evening Standard, who say: The four-point gap is nail-bitingly close - especially with heavy rain threatening to dampen turnout in London which is a key target area for Remain. Moreover, the research discloses that 12 per cent of people confess they might change their minds in the few hours left before they cast their vote, indicating how the historic decision has torn the country. The higher shares rise today, the more they could fall tomorrow if Leave win. FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga says: With the EU referendum polling commencing on Thursday, market volatility may be set to amplify to untold levels as speculation heightens over the United Kingdom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future in the European Union. Although stock markets were offered a lifeline this week amid the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bremain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd optimism, most major stocks could be poised to decline lower if risk aversion and a potential \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd encourages investors to scatter away from riskier assets. Jeremy Cook of currency trading firm World First flags up that currency trading is pretty light today. Many traders are keeping to the sidelines until the EU referendum result is known, to avoid being squashed by a fast-moving market. The pound is on a real tear this morning.... Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue-chip FTSE 100 index has just hit its highest level in two month, as traders continue to watch today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum unfold. The Footsie jumped by 110 points to 6371 points, a gain of 1.5%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its highest level since 21 April, before the EU referendum campaign came to the boil. The pound has just hit a new 2016 high too, up 1.5 cents at $1.4862. The rally is being led by mining companies, such as Glencore and Anglo American, who are particularly exposed to global economic demand. Financial stocks, including Royal Bank of Scotland and Prudential, are also among the top risers. Joshua Mahoney of City firm IG predicts more big swings before the day is out... For all the posturing and emotive discussions that have taken place across homes, workplaces, TV studios and social media, the time has come for talk to turn into actions. Amid restrictions to broadcasters, there is an eerie feeling in the city, with a nervous energy evident as we await the fate of the nation. Whatever the result, volatility is likely to be the name of the game. The latest eurozone economic data is in, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not terribly good news. Markit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest Purchasing Manager Index reports, which track activity across Europe, have come in weaker than expected. The composite PMI fell to 52.8, from 53.1 in May. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 17-month low, and closer to the 50-point mark showing stagnation. Markit blamed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rising political uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd; another sign that Brexit fears have hit economic growth. It suggests Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic recovery is weakening, as Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Markit, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A renewed fall in new business was behind the decline, with respondents highlighting the difficulty of securing work amid a fragile demand environment. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A flagging manufacturing sector was again the main source of weakness.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Once again, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nearest European neighbour was a laggard. The French PMI slid to 49.4 from 50.9 in May, meaning its private sector is probably contracting. After hitting its highest level of 2016 against the US dollar in early trading, the pound is now calmly bobbing around $1.477: Referendum day is always good for photos, to fill the time before the results come in. Our main EU referendum liveblog has a lot more: Sterling is also a little higher against the euro this morning, at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.3050 (up from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.3015 overnight). Although the pound has risen today, we should note that trading is pretty thin. And traders will be trading blind until after 10pm tonight, when the polls close and we get an on-the-day poll from YouGov. Yujiro Goto, currency strategist at Nomura, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If polls after the vote closes suggests that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Leave\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is in front, then we could see sterling drop. These are very challenging conditions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, says traders seem to be influenced by the odds on offer at the bookmakers: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Although most recent polls swayed toward the remain camp in the last couple of days, the lead is still very narrow, which doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t explain the surge in pound. However, the markets are being completely reliant on the predictions from the bookies, which strongly expect \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to win the referendum.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A little light music to guide you through the day.... European stock markets are mostly higher this morning, although there are no big moves. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a massive jump in the cost of insuring against sharp swings in the pound overnight. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sterling overnight implied volatility\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - which basically measures the cost of hedging the pound \u00e2\u20ac\u201c surged to levels not seen in many years (my data only goes back to 2008). It shows that investors are covering themselves against the pound rallying strongly, or plunging, over the next 24 hours, as referendum results come in. The pound has dipped back a little, as the rain pours down City trading floor windows. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still up around 0.5% today, though, at $1.4763. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re off ... trading has opened in London and the FTSE 100 is up just over 40 points, or 0.7%, at 6305 points. Tesco is highest FTSE 100 riser, up 2%, after better-than-expected sales growth of 0.3% for its core UK supermarkets chain. This is the first time in more than five years that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest retailer has managed to produce two consecutive quarters of sales growth. It has also announced the sale of its Harris + Hoole coffee chain. City traders may actually struggle to get to their desks on time, given the torrential rain and flooding problems in London and the South East. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hope they have understanding bosses. My colleague Alex Hern may need one... Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market had a decent enough day, closing more than one percent higher in the last session before Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial institutions have taken some pretty serious steps to protect themselves against volatile markets over the next few days. Our city editor Jill Treanor explains how investors will be setting up \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwar rooms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, ready to act as the referendum results start to come in.... Major banks are preparing for two days of unprecedented uncertainty by stuffing cash machines full of money, placing senior bankers on high alert in emergency war rooms around the City and switching off computer-driven \u00e2\u20ac\u0153black box\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd trading systems to avoid incurring huge losses in violent swings in shares, bonds and currency markets. With uncertainty about the precise moment the outcome of the EU referendumwill be known, dealing rooms are opening across the City on Thursday night and into Friday morning to allow trades to be executed for customers needing to respond to the results of the 382 polling areas as they start to be announced. Unlike a general election, no exit polls have been commissioned by broadcasters and the first results are expected at 12.30am on Friday and then throughout the night. It is possible the result may not be known by the scheduled opening of the stock market at 8am on Friday morning. Some banks have told investors that they will only conduct trading by taking verbal orders rather than through computers, while other banks are ready to override their algorithmic trading systems by closely monitoring them over night on Thursday.... Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a handy chart from the FT, showing how the pound has picked up: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest news story about the referendum: Sterling has hit its highest level against the US dollar this year, as traders in Asia watched events in the UK. The pound hit $1.4844 against the US dollar for the first time in 2016, and is currently hovering around $1.48 in early London trading. The move came after several opinion polls were released last night. ComRes for the Daily Mail and ITV News put remain on 48%, leave on 42%. Excluding undecided voters, it found remain leading leave by 54% to 46%. A YouGov gave remain a two-point cushion, ahead of leave by 51% to 49%. However, a TNS poll released on Wednesday gave the advantage to leave, on 43%, with remain on 41% and 16% not decided or not voting at all. And many analysts say that the race is simply too close to call. Some forecasters have suggested the pound could hit 30-year lows in the event of a Brexit vote. Kit Juckes of French bank Societe Generale explains how it could rock global markets: A decision to leave the EU is bad for global risk sentiment, good for the yen, and bad for sterling, the Euro and higher-beta currencies particularly central and Eastern European ones. On a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcLeave\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 decision, we expect the pound to fall to $1.30-$1.35 quickly and we look for an eventual fall to $1.20-$1.25 Good morning. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only one important item on the agendas of investors across the world today. Britain is heading to the polls after a lengthy, bitterly fought campaign to decide if she stays in the European Union, or should leave. Traders in the City are preparing for a lengthy shift - perhaps staying late into the night, or returning to the office early tomorrow morning. Friday is likely to be one of the most dramatic and volatile trading sessions in many years, especially if the public choose to leave the EU. Analysts have predicted that the pound could slump by 15%, while shares would probably suffer big losses. Voting has just begun, with pollsters saying that the result is hard to call - especially as around 10% voters are still undecided. Turnout could be crucial, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth noting that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently tipping it down in London (summer, eh?), causing flooding problems and traffic disruption: Not great weather for a trip to the polling booth: Also coming up today: Supermarket chain Tesco is reporting results, plus we get new eurozone manufacturing data this morning and US weekly jobless figures this afternoon. But really, the markets will be nervously waiting for the results of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote, in the early hours of tomorrow morning.",

Tesco had replaced a car service with a taxi contract and Lewis said the spending was within company policy. He added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have a way to go to reduce the cost of transporting colleagues around London when they are here on bank business.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Another shareholder, Michael Mason-Mahon, raised Lewis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s membership of the exclusive Wentworth golf club, which was listed among \u00c2\u00a310,000 worth of membership benefits in the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual report. After the meeting, Lewis explained it was a corporate membership used to entertain suppliers but that it had been cancelled after one year as it was not used regularly enough.</p> <p>The scrutiny of director\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay and benefits came as the retailer reported its second consecutive quarter of UK underlying sales growth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c its strongest run in more than five years. It also announced the disposal of the Harris + Hoole coffee chain to Caffe Nero.</p> <p>Lewis said the sale of the coffee brand was the end of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153second chapter\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of his turnaround and the company was now \u00e2\u20ac\u0153concentrating on improving the performance of the assets it had retained\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We sit here with no plans on our stocks for asset sales.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>The retailer said it had delivered a second quarter of positive like-for-like sales in the UK despite challenging market conditions.

                "bodyText":"The boss of Tesco has been forced to defend the taxi habit of its bank chief, Benny Higgins, at a stormy shareholder meeting that highlighted the disparity between executive and shopfloor pay. In May the Guardian revealed that Higgins spent more than \u00c2\u00a318,000 on London taxis in just eight months last year being driven to upmarket restaurants, private members\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 clubs and the supermarket\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s various head offices. Shareholder Danny Gazzi said he was pleased staff and executives had received bonuses for returning the company to profit, but added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is notable however that while [CEO] Dave Lewis is being awarded a 250% bonus, staff are receiving 5%.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lewis was paid \u00c2\u00a34.6m including a \u00c2\u00a33m bonus last year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The \u00c2\u00a318,000 claimed just on taxi expenses in eight months by Benny Higgins as chief executive of Tesco Bank is a troubling contrast with the salaries of those on the shop floor,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd added Gazzi who is also a supporter of ShareAction, which campaigns for the wider adoption of the voluntary UK living wage, as advocated by the Living Wage Foundation. Lewis told the meeting on Thursday that Higgins\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expense bill was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153large amount of money\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and had been reviewed in detail with the executive, who is in charge of the Edinburgh-based bank and regularly in London for business. Tesco had replaced a car service with a taxi contract and Lewis said the spending was within company policy. He added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have a way to go to reduce the cost of transporting colleagues around London when they are here on bank business.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Another shareholder, Michael Mason-Mahon, raised Lewis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s membership of the exclusive Wentworth golf club, which was listed among \u00c2\u00a310,000 worth of membership benefits in the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual report. After the meeting, Lewis explained it was a corporate membership used to entertain suppliers but that it had been cancelled after one year as it was not used regularly enough. The scrutiny of director\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay and benefits came as the retailer reported its second consecutive quarter of UK underlying sales growth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c its strongest run in more than five years. It also announced the disposal of the Harris + Hoole coffee chain to Caffe Nero. Lewis said the sale of the coffee brand was the end of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153second chapter\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of his turnaround and the company was now \u00e2\u20ac\u0153concentrating on improving the performance of the assets it had retained\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We sit here with no plans on our stocks for asset sales.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The retailer said it had delivered a second quarter of positive like-for-like sales in the UK despite challenging market conditions. Lewis said the upturn was down to lower everyday prices, fewer promotions and improved fresh food products. Sales at UK stores open a year or more rose 0.3% in the three months to 28 May, adding to an increase of 0.9% in the preceding quarter that showed the first signs of revival at Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ailing British business.

At 6,050, the FTSE 100 stands roughly midway between its highest point of the year (6,400) and its lowest (5,600). That is no consolation if your investments are concentrated in big banks (Barclays, Lloyds and RBS are down about 15%) or housebuilders (about 20%) but the FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s international spread has softened the blow.

                "bodyText":"The FTSE 100 index is down about 300 points, or 4.5%, at 10am. Sterling is 7% weaker against the dollar. And 10-year gilt yields have fallen from 1.3% to close to 1%, the biggest one-day drop since 2009. These are big moves but \u00e2\u20ac\u201c versus expectations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d call it a par score. Share prices and the pound had rallied strongly in the days before on the expectation of a vote for remain. A victory for leave \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a 10% chance, according to the bookmakers, as the polls closed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fail to provoke a strong market reaction. If this is as bad as it gets, it will not be an overnight disaster for most stock market investors. At 6,050, the FTSE 100 stands roughly midway between its highest point of the year (6,400) and its lowest (5,600). That is no consolation if your investments are concentrated in big banks (Barclays, Lloyds and RBS are down about 15%) or housebuilders (about 20%) but the FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s international spread has softened the blow. The share prices of the likes of GlaxoSmithKline, a defensive stock that earns the bulk of its revenues in dollars, are broadly level \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so far, at least. Do not, however, read much into the kneejerk reaction. One chief executive of a big bank said last week that a vote for Brexit would be viewed by markets as a vote against free trade and for protectionism.

US investors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and a few Europeans \u00e2\u20ac\u201c made the currency adjustment and saw a relative bargain. Alongside the miners of African gold and Mexican silver, the big Footsie risers were all defensive dollar earners \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the likes of microchip-maker Arm Holdings (up 6%) and pharmaceutical firm GlaxoSmithKline (up 4%).</p> <p>On the negative side of ledger, there was no afternoon rebound.

The latter was one reason why the FTSE 250 index of mid-sized companies, which is far more skewed to the UK, fell 7%.</p> <p>If a UK recession, however mild or brief, lies ahead, banks will see more loans turn sour while consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 appetite for fresh debt will shrink. Worse for the banks, the whiff of any medium-term rise in interest rates in the UK has disappeared. Thus the yield on 10-year government debt fell to a record low of 1.07% in the biggest one-day move since 2009. That is a hideous prospect for lenders who prefer long-term rates to be several percentage points above the cost of short-term funds \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that is how they make their money.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/24/a-rollercoaster-ride-for-city-traders-on-eu-referendum-night\">A rollercoaster ride for City traders on EU referendum night</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The fear of recession also undermined the housebuilding sector, where most stocks fell by a quarter.

So is the political career of the chancellor, George Osborne, author of all those housebuilder-friendly help to buy schemes.

                "bodyText":"This post-Brexit financial world will require a lot of untangling. The FTSE 100 index closed down only 200 points, which used to be seen as a bad, but far from catastrophic, event in the stock market. You would have got long odds on that outcome at 2am in morning, when Sunderland and Newcastle gave the first signs of the UK political earthquake in store, and even longer odds when the blue-chip index opened 500 points lower. Appearances can be deceptive, however. The FTSE 100 is a barometer only of itself, not the UK economy. It is stuffed with companies that make most of their profits in dollars, a currency that is suddenly 8% stronger against sterling. US investors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and a few Europeans \u00e2\u20ac\u201c made the currency adjustment and saw a relative bargain. Alongside the miners of African gold and Mexican silver, the big Footsie risers were all defensive dollar earners \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the likes of microchip-maker Arm Holdings (up 6%) and pharmaceutical firm GlaxoSmithKline (up 4%). On the negative side of ledger, there was no afternoon rebound. Big banks were all down 15-20% and their smaller brethren \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the likes of Virgin Money and Aldermore \u00e2\u20ac\u201c by up to 30%. The latter was one reason why the FTSE 250 index of mid-sized companies, which is far more skewed to the UK, fell 7%. If a UK recession, however mild or brief, lies ahead, banks will see more loans turn sour while consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 appetite for fresh debt will shrink. Worse for the banks, the whiff of any medium-term rise in interest rates in the UK has disappeared. Thus the yield on 10-year government debt fell to a record low of 1.07% in the biggest one-day move since 2009. That is a hideous prospect for lenders who prefer long-term rates to be several percentage points above the cost of short-term funds \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that is how they make their money. The fear of recession also undermined the housebuilding sector, where most stocks fell by a quarter. Mortgages may remain extraordinarily cheap in the new world, but confidence in house prices is suddenly anybody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guess. So is the political career of the chancellor, George Osborne, author of all those housebuilder-friendly help to buy schemes. Even ITV \u00e2\u20ac\u201c dependent on fickle advertisers pushing consumer goods \u00e2\u20ac\u201c shed a fifth of its value. What happens next? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy to imagine how financial waves from the upheaval in currency markets could spread around the world.

It said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The surprise vote in the UK to quit the EU has seen sharp falls in world financial markets. These reactions are out of line with any likely impact on the UK economy from the vote; markets are instead pricing in a high risk of a broader financial crisis engulfing the rest of the EU. This risk looks exaggerated to us.</p> <p> Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp drops in global stock markets and periphery bonds are hard to square with the likely long-term impact on the UK \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at worst a few percent of GDP in the long run in an economy that is only 3.5% of world output. Initial market reactions were of similar magnitude to the immediate aftermath of the Lehman Brothers failure in 2008. </p> <p>It appears markets are pricing in a moderate risk that the UK vote is a systemic event that leads to a political chain reaction in the rest of the EU that collapses the single currency area and/or leads to debt restructuring in the Eurozone \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcperipherals\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a re-run of the 2011-12 crisis. </p> <p>The possibility of such a chain reaction has probably gained credence in recent weeks with polls suggesting discontent with the EU in countries such as the Netherlands and Italy.

He said:</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is without doubt a far more important event in that Brexit signifies a structural break in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic and political models models, which we very much had in place since the second world war. It really does break the post-war settlement in many ways. The break in the political model is going to be more profound than the break in the economic model.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd<br></p> <p>Scotland is likely to hold a referendum within two years and he saw a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153high prospect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that it will break from the UK after 300 years, while the Good Friday agreement in Northern Ireland is also at risk.</p> <p>Rossi predicted a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mild recession\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by Christmas\u00e2\u20ac\u201c not as bad as during the financial crisis of 2009 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but one that would last until 2017.

The pound dropped to $1.38 after the vote to leave.<br></p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sterling will work its way towards the low $1.30s in the near future over the next few weeks and months.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Against the euro, he thinks that sterling \u00e2\u20ac\u201c currently at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.24 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c will fall through \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.20.</p> <p>He explained that the FTSE 100 index could actually rally if sterling continues to fall towards $1.30, as many constituents are non-sterling companies which report their revenues mainly in dollars.

A decent strand of buyers swept in when the UK index hit its earlier lows, helping to lift it back above 6200 despite a continued battering for its Barclays/RBS/Lloyds banking trio. The liquidity support promised by the Bank of England (and subsequently the ECB and Federal Reserve) appears to have been the main catalyst for the turnaround, especially given the fact that the afternoon was still littered with worrying news (namely the likelihood of a second independence referendum in Scotland).</p> <p>While the FTSE rose phoenix-like from the ashes of its earlier decline, the Eurozone indices weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite as lucky. The 5-6% drops by the DAX and CAC, while signalling a rebound from their respective morning nadirs, still are far worse than those seen in the UK and US (the Dow is down just over 2%), suggesting investors may not only be worried by the Brexit, but by the weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Spanish election.</p> <p>Even worse than the Eurozone was the pound. Sterling is still hovering around 31 year lows, at $1.37 against the dollar (dipping from $1.39 following Nicola Sturgeon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suggestion of a 2<sup>nd</sup> Scottish referendum) and $1.24 against the euro.

In terms of direct trade relationships, the U.K. accounts for only around 12.4% of Irish goods and 20% of Irish service exports, well below 50% levels observed when both countries joined the European Community in 1973.</p> <p>However, the sectors that serve the U.K. market are, on average, more labor intensive and any negative shocks could damage the mending Irish labor market. Other negative economic risks associated with a Brexit could include the weakening of the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial service sector, with which Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial service sector is closely linked, and the potential ripple effect stemming from lower demand from the rest of the EU.</p> <p>Furthermore, many aspects of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relationship with the EU, and therefore the U.K.-Irish relationship, would be unclear, increasing uncertainties related to trade and investment between the two countries.</p> <p>We do not believe the potential relocation of some U.K. businesses to Ireland would fully offset the overall negative impact of Brexit in the short to medium term.</p> <p>Nevertheless, we expect the Irish economy to stay resilient enough to withstand the negative impact of the Brexit. In our view, the pace of fiscal consolidation and reduction in general government debt may slow down somewhat, but the ratings will remain supported by Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong institutions, predictable policy making, and improving external balance sheet.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-576d3d7de4b030d83eb4a3da\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-24T14:06:44.102Z\">3.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The FTSE 100 is indeed now well off its worst levels, helped by the fact that a number of major companies have their earnings in dollars and should benefit from the plunge in the pound.</p> <p>The index is now off 1.9% at 6218 and is actually up 3.3% on the week, helped by the gains in the early part of the week when investors convinced themselves that the Remain side would win the referendum. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-576d3973e4b0be24d34f5ece\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-24T13:45:43.860Z\">2.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Could it happen.....?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PaulJKavanagh1/status/746337245070770177\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">FTSE 100 down just 2.5% from down 9%....and its about 25/1 to close up on the day.

Crude oil is priced in dollars, and once that figure is converted into today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lower sterling rate, the price must inevitably rise.</p> <p>Before the referendum, the crude price was $50 a barrel, and petrol was retailing at 112p a litre for unleaded. This morning the price of crude has moved little - it is up to $51, but the fall in sterling means that once translated into pounds, the price is likely to head towards 120p. It may make sense to fill up this morning. Note that fuel duty is 57.95p a litre for both petrol and diesel, and remains the biggest component of the price we pay. Motorists also pay 20% VAT on fuel.</p> <h2><strong>Mortgages</strong></h2> <p>All eyes will be on official Bank of England movements, with governor Mark Carney expected to speak after David Cameron sometime after 6am.</p> <p>A hike in interest rates to defend the pound will hit millions of households on tracker-style mortgages. For example, around 700,000 people are on Nationwide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2.5% standard variable rate. If base rate goes up by 0.5%, it will take the cost of a \u00c2\u00a3100,000 mortgage to \u00c2\u00a3474 from \u00c2\u00a3449.</p> <p>But it is just as possible that interest rates could fall to provide liquidity and restore order to markets.

                "bodyText":"It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost 24 hours since it first became clear that David Cameron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum had not gone as the PM had planned. That realisation has triggered one of the most dramatic, volatile and downright scary trading sessions in the last decade. New estimates tonight say Brexit has wiped out over two trillion dollars of value, worldwide: So, as City traders hit the pillow (or in some cases the gin bottle), we should also wrap up. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very brisk summary of the state of play. The British pound has suffered its biggest one-day selloff in recent history, as the shock news the the UK is heading out of the European Union sparked panic in the markets. Sterling suffered a jaw-dropping plunge in the early hours of Friday in London, from $1.50 against the US dollar to just $1.33. It closed at $1.368, after a day to forget for many FX traders. The London stock market suffered steep losses at the open, but recovered to finish down 199 points or minus 3.1%. Bank stocks suffered badly, while some housebuilders shed a quarter of their value amid forecasts of a UK recession. The morning stopped being dramatic, and was upgraded to historic, at 8.15am London time when the prime minister resigned, And that left central bankers (once again) to pick up the pieces. The Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve have all promised to flood market with new liquidity, if needed, to prevent the Brexit shock turning into a new financial crisis. But that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough to stop France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC sliding by 8%, or Wall Street suffering its biggest one-day fall in 10 months. Asia had already tumbled while results from across the UK had flooded in, with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei index experiencing its biggest fall since the Fukushima disaster of 2011. And then Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fired a warning shot at Britain, cutting its rating outlook to negative due to the economic problems caused by Brexit. Britain also faces a political crisis tonight, of course, plus pressure from Europe to actually start the exit process.. Saturday is going to be another dramatic day in the UK. Ditto Sunday. And then the markets reopen on Monday morning.... So until then, a very good night! The record 8%-ish slump in the pound on Friday has raised fears that UK inflation could spike (as imports will cost more). That would be bad news for poorer citizens, says the IPPR thinktank tonight. Using Treasury modelling of currency shocks, IPPR finds that a 2.3 percent increase in CPI will increase costs for the poorest households by 3.3 per cent, compared to a 1.6 per cent increase for the richest 10 percent of families. This chart shows how those with less money suffer more from rising living costs: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 15 short (?!) hours since London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets opened, in a massive wave of selling that briefly wiped 550 points off the FTSE 100. Our Jill Treanor and Simon Goodley were watching events unfold in the City, while we stared open-mouthed at our Reuters terminals in the news room. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s their report on the action: And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour of a truly wild day... On the dealing room of the financial trading firm IG, clients were calling in a state of near panic. One, who had a profitable position on Barclays shares when the market closed on Wednesday night, was now not only in the red but facing the indignity of being asked to deposit more cash into his account. Another told his dealer it was the end of the world. By 7am Chris Beauchamp, IG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief market analyst, was worrying about the effect on markets if the prime minister, David Cameron, did not hold on to his job until the afternoon. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sterling now will depend on the shape of the UK government at about 4pm and if Cameron is still there,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If he says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going it will be sold off again. The best thing he can do is hold the line here. We also have Spanish elections this weekend. To lose one government would be unfortunate. To lose two would be careless.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bild says Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision is a Black day for Europe: Bild had made a last-ditch attempt to sway UK voters, promising to reserve sun loungers for Brits, and even recognise Geoff Hurst\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcon-the-line\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 goal at the 1966 World Cup. To no avail. (anyway, it was definitely a goal, the Russian linesman said so) Merci, guys, I think we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need it..... Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also warns that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade with the rest of the world is probably going to suffer. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another reason for downgrading the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outlook to negative tonight. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s says: Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expects a negative impact on the economy unless the UK government manages to negotiate a trade deal that largely replicates its current access to the Single Market. However, at the moment there is substantial uncertainty over the type of trade agreement that could be achieved. Breaking news: Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, the credit rating agency, has just lowered the outlook on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating to negative from stable. It says that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic growth will be weaker, following the EU referendum vote. It also warns the the public finances will be weaker than previously forecast, meaning it will be harder to cut the deficit. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s says that the Brexit vote will herald a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153prolonged period of uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the UK, with negative implications for growth in the medium terms. And it also warns that the effectiveness of economic policymaking could be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsomewhat diminished\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by the decision. A negative outlook means there is a greater danger of a country being downgraded. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s three years since Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cut Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AAA rating. It currently has the UK on AA+, the second highest rating. This morning Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, the only firm that Britain still on triple-A, warned that it is likely to downgrade Britain. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dominic Rushe and Sam Thielman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report on Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff: DING DING. The closing bell has rung on Wall Street, leaving shares deep in the red. The Dow Jones index has slumped by 608 points, or nearly 3.4%, at 17,402. Almost every share lost ground, with financial stocks worst hit. The S&amp;P 500, the broadest index of US stocks, tumbled by 76 points or 3.6% to 2,037 points. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its biggest one-day fall in 10 months, since global markets were hit by fears ove the Chinese economy in August 2015. The Nasdaq has been thumped hard too: A wild day in the markets is nearly over.... America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former top central banker, Alan Greenspan, suggests the City could lose its preeminent place in the world economy: Trading in the British pound hit unprecented levels today, according to the FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Gregory Meyer: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re biased, I guess... but this is a great front page. More to come tonight, of course.... The Institute for International Finance have sent some nice charts, showing the slump in world markets today.... ...and showing how the British pound (GBP) is the worst performing currency today. The IIf says: The unexpected Brexit win by a solid margin (51.9% to 48.1%) has cascaded across international financial markets. The GBP has taken an unprecedented one-day hit, taking it down to levels against the dollar last seen in the mid-1980s. Other risk assets, including the euro, EM currencies, global equities (although less for the US), and most commodities (except for gold) have also fallen sharply amid elevated volatility. Financial markets need to get used to a lot more volatility, following Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to leave the EU. Peter Kenny, senior market analyst for Wall Street firm Global Markets Advisory Group, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This bleeds through the EU narrative in terms of its unity and its popularity,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kenny said the unease in the markets would likely keep the Fed from raising rates in the short term, and in the long term the consequences would be far-reaching. Right now, Kenny said, the IMF and other international banks have to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153play defense\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as they tries to calm down markets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Kenny pointed to the IMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conference call last week in which it played down the chance of market downturns across multiple regions. But the fact is that those markets will be uneasy for a long time to come. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[That volatility] is something the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to have to transition from thinking of as a variable to something it thinks of as a constant.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd No surprise what our friends at the Financial Times have splashed on, for tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s edition: There are some anxious faces on Wall Street today, as shares are hit by the Brexit shock: The economic turmoil which the UK referendum could trigger could make it very hard for the US central bank to raise interest rates this year. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s John Praveen, chief investment strategist of Prudential International Investments: Wall Street foreign exchange analyst Marc Chandler believes the pound will keep sliding in the weeks ahead: Barack Obama, president of the United States, has declared that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcspecial relationship\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 will survive the EU referendum result. He also argued that the Brexit vote is part of a broader picture, of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcongoing changes and challenges\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 raised by globalisation. Reuters has the story: U.S. President Barack Obama said on Friday that he had spoken with British Prime Minister David Cameron about Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to leave the European Union and that he was confident the United Kingdom was committed to an orderly transition. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relationship with the EU will change, one thing that will not change is special relationship that exists between our two nations,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Obama said in a speech at a global entrepreneurs conference at Stanford University. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That will endure. The EU will remain one of our indispensable partners.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd During the referendum campaign, President Obama warned that Britain will be at the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcback of the queue\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for a US trade deal, if it quit Europe. Voters didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t heed that warning, so now we must wait to see how negotiations play out. The Paris-based OECD economic thinktank had warned, repeatedly, against voting for Brexit - predicting that families would be hit in the pocket. But now the deed is done, it wants to help Britain through the difficult times ahead: OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurr\u00c3\u00ada says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote on the United Kingdom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s membership of the European Union has major consequences for the UK itself, the EU and the international community. While it is on the public record that this was not the OECD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recommended course of action, the focus must now shift to dealing with the outcome of this democratic process. The OECD will spare no efforts in supporting the Government of the United Kingdom to make the transition as smooth as possible and advance the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic and social agenda. The OECD also wants to support the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153European project\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as it faces the biggest crisis in its history: We will also help the European Union and the international community best address the consequences of such a decision and chart the way forward. The OECD believes that openness, integration and diversity will make our economies and societies stronger and fairer. Thus, we will continue to support the European project while further reflecting on how to strengthen well-being and inclusiveness, both within our countries and globally.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Stock markets across the Americas are deep in the red, from New York to Sao Paulo. The Dow Jones hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t managed to rally, and is down almost 600 points, or 3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is deeper, down 4%, with only three stocks rising. And the Dow, and the S&amp;P 500, are now negative for 2016. Sterling is still being buffeted in late trading in America, trading at a seven-year low. The pound is currently bobbing around $1.368 against the US dollar, a loss of 12 cents or 8% today. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its weakest level since the 2008-09 financial crisis. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a small recovery on the $1.33 we ploughed early this morning, when markets were first reeling from the Brexit news. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest one-day fall ever, and the third biggest slump for any currency in the last 40 years (as we covered at 2pm BST). This graph, from Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Eric Burroughs, shows the unprecedented scale of the selloff. Important point: Although the Footrsie \u00e2\u20ac\u0153only\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd fell by 4%, that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recognise the 8% tumble in the value of the pound. One reason shares rallied from their lowest point is that US investors were able to snap up stakes in top UK firms at bargain prices, due to the rallying dollar. Shares in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housebuilders slumped by more than a quarter today, as investors anticipated that the UK economy could be dragged into recession. Taylor Wimpey, Persimmon, and Barratt - three big UK building firms - were the worst-performing major companies in London Banking stocks, which also track Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic prospects - and fears of another financial crisis - also suffered heavy losses. Here are the biggest fallers on the blue-chip FTSE 100 inded, which helped to drag ti down by 199 points or 3.15% today. Some shares rallied though. Gold miner Randgold, and silver maker Fresnillo, both rallied - matching the jump in precious metals prices. And companies who trade with international markets, such as smartphone chip maker ARM and pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca, also rose Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown:, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a roller coaster day on the markets, containing shock, fear and opportunism. The Footsie started the day in full retreat, but subsequently recovered as investors sniffed a chance to pick up some cheap stocks. A significant number of FTSE 100 stocks ended the day in positive territory, predominantly those companies with lots of overseas earnings, which stand to benefit from a weaker pound. In the wake of the Brexit vote, European Council president Donald Tusk has sent a letter to council members ahead of meetings next week. And it will make uncomfortable reading for UK prime minister David Cameron. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: I have no doubt that due to the negative outcome of the UK referendum we will mostly need to devote our European Council to a discussion on its political consequences. It is my intention to ensure that we have sufficient space to debate both with Prime Minister Cameron, and then separately with the 27 Heads of State or Government. And after discussing the agenda for the rest of the meeting, Tusk writes: We will then move to dinner, where Prime Minister Cameron will explain the situation in the UK after the referendum, followed by a first exchange of views. This will mark the end of our meeting on Tuesday. And the following day, no invitation for Cameron: On Wednesday the 27 Heads of State or Government will meet informally to discuss the political and practical implications of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBrexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. First of all, we will discuss the so called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdivorce process\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as described in Art. 50 of the Treaty. And secondly, we will start a discussion on the future of the European Union with 27 Member States. With the uncertain future following the UK vote to leave the European Union, and an 8% fall in sterling against the dollar, investors sold off shares, with banks, housebuilders and airlines hard hit, but gold and silver miners in demand. Markets came off some of their worst levels, however, as central banks from the Bank of England to the Fed queued up to reassure that they would provide any liquidity that was needed. And the FTSE 100 outperformed European peers, with exporters in particular helped by the fall in the pound. In fact the UK index, down 3.15% on the day, is actually up 1.95% on the week, benefitting from its earlier gains when it appeared the Remain camp would win the day. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 3.15% or 199.41 points at 6138.69, but off its low of 5788.74 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 6.82% to 9557.16 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 8.04% lower at 4106.73 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB, as previously mentioned, fell 12.48% to 15,723.81 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended down 12.35% at 7787.7 In Greece, the Athens market lost 13.42% to 534.78 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 508 points or 2.82%, its worst daily performance (so far) since January. Among the falls in European markets, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB has slumped by 12.48%, its biggest one day decline since its records began in 1998. Fears that EU members like Italy may hold their own vote was part of the reason, along with a hefty fall in banking shares on renewed concerns about their balance sheets if Brexit leads to another economic downturn. The Brexit vote is not a Lehmans moment, according to Oxford Economics. It said: The surprise vote in the UK to quit the EU has seen sharp falls in world financial markets. These reactions are out of line with any likely impact on the UK economy from the vote; markets are instead pricing in a high risk of a broader financial crisis engulfing the rest of the EU. This risk looks exaggerated to us. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp drops in global stock markets and periphery bonds are hard to square with the likely long-term impact on the UK \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at worst a few percent of GDP in the long run in an economy that is only 3.5% of world output. Initial market reactions were of similar magnitude to the immediate aftermath of the Lehman Brothers failure in 2008. It appears markets are pricing in a moderate risk that the UK vote is a systemic event that leads to a political chain reaction in the rest of the EU that collapses the single currency area and/or leads to debt restructuring in the Eurozone \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcperipherals\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a re-run of the 2011-12 crisis. The possibility of such a chain reaction has probably gained credence in recent weeks with polls suggesting discontent with the EU in countries such as the Netherlands and Italy. In Italy, as well as a large debt stock there is also the issue of high bad debts at banks as a systemic risk factor. We think these market concerns are overdone. We do not see a high chance of a systemic crisis in the EU involving other countries exiting the EU quickly or a sovereign debt restructuring \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially as the ECB has the capacity to step in to prevent a runaway rise in peripheral bond spreads, as it did in 2012. We also think the EU could take steps to avoid break-up spreading including by concessions to member states on the migration issue. Is this good or bad news? IMF managing director Christine Lagarde has made some more comments about the Brexit vote, calling for clarity over the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negotiations on the terms on which it will leave the European Union. Speaking at an IMF lecture with China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central banker, she said she hoped for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as smooth as transition as possible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, according to Reuters. As European markets head into the close of trading, the FTSE 100 remains well off its worst levels although housebuilders, banks and airlines continue to nurse heavy losses. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG,said: The FTSE 100 has staged a remarkable recovery; from an open of cataclysmic proportions, the index has rallied by over 300 points. Of course the damage to individual shares has been immense, but even in some of the most heavily beaten-down names a recovery has taken place. Investors are, in theory, supposed to relish the chance to buy up their favourite shares at knock-down prices, and they got such a chance today. Only time will tell if this has been a spectacular buying opportunity, or the first act in a new and volatile bear market. Other markets have been hit hard too, with the eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major indices taking it particularly badly. If it comes down to it, many of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest firms will look compelling if sterling remains weak, while a falling dollar, thanks to yet another dramatic reassessment of the outlook for Fed policy, could boost commodity prices and provide another tailwind for UK stocks. However, we have likely not seen the end of the rush to safe havens, as the UK and its erstwhile EU partners begin their prep for a long period of negotiation. US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has now commented on the Brexit vote, and cites the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153special relationship\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd between the two countries. She said: We respect the choice the people of the United Kingdom have made. Our first task has to be to make sure that the economic uncertainty created by these events does not hurt working families here in America. We also have to make clear America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steadfast commitment to the special relationship with Britain and the transatlantic alliance with Europe. More from Dominic Rossi, global chief investment officer at Fidelity International. In a conference call, he said he was asked by a client this morning how Brexit compared with the ERM debacle of 1992. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is without doubt a far more important event in that Brexit signifies a structural break in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic and political models models, which we very much had in place since the second world war. It really does break the post-war settlement in many ways. The break in the political model is going to be more profound than the break in the economic model.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Scotland is likely to hold a referendum within two years and he saw a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153high prospect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that it will break from the UK after 300 years, while the Good Friday agreement in Northern Ireland is also at risk. Rossi predicted a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mild recession\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by Christmas\u00e2\u20ac\u201c not as bad as during the financial crisis of 2009 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but one that would last until 2017. He reckons UK growth will start slowing over the summer and that the economy will fall into recession \u00e2\u20ac\u201c defined as two or more consecutive quarters of contraction \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in the autumn. Turning to markets, Rossi think the $1.40 level against the dollar that sterling has held over 30 years could switch from being a floor to a ceiling. The pound dropped to $1.38 after the vote to leave. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sterling will work its way towards the low $1.30s in the near future over the next few weeks and months.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Against the euro, he thinks that sterling \u00e2\u20ac\u201c currently at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.24 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c will fall through \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.20. He explained that the FTSE 100 index could actually rally if sterling continues to fall towards $1.30, as many constituents are non-sterling companies which report their revenues mainly in dollars. [Something we are already seeing] \u00e2\u20ac\u0153European stocks are reflecting some economic impact from Brexit but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think eurozone will enter a recession \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the UK will have the privilege of that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexit was a black swan event and there is a potential flock of black swans flying over Europe with the political calendar,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said \u00e2\u20ac\u201c referring to upcoming elections in Spain on Sunday and Germany and France next year. Turning to UK interest rates, Rossi does not expect rate cuts any time soon. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t surprised that Mark Carney didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cut rates today. It is going to be very difficult for him to do so with sterling weak.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd [as this pushes up inflation] \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He will want to be confident that sterling has bottomed before he does so because there will be a one-time inflationary impact. That might not be until third or fourth quarter.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What is really important is that those Brexit forces don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t themselves fragment.. If that were all to splinter then I think the currency markets would take a very dim view. We really do need now political leadership. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I would not be surprised at all if the first thing that the new prime minister does is call a general election.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back with the US, and the Securities and Exchange Commission issued this statement after Wall Street opened: The U.S. equity markets opened normally for trading this morning. We are continuing to closely monitor the markets and have been in regular communication with financial institutions, exchanges, and market utilities, as well as our financial regulatory counterparts. The FTSE 100 is off its worst levels following the promise from central banks to provide liquidity when necessary, says Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex: There isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much to explain the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rather remarkable recovery. A decent strand of buyers swept in when the UK index hit its earlier lows, helping to lift it back above 6200 despite a continued battering for its Barclays/RBS/Lloyds banking trio. The liquidity support promised by the Bank of England (and subsequently the ECB and Federal Reserve) appears to have been the main catalyst for the turnaround, especially given the fact that the afternoon was still littered with worrying news (namely the likelihood of a second independence referendum in Scotland). While the FTSE rose phoenix-like from the ashes of its earlier decline, the Eurozone indices weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite as lucky. The 5-6% drops by the DAX and CAC, while signalling a rebound from their respective morning nadirs, still are far worse than those seen in the UK and US (the Dow is down just over 2%), suggesting investors may not only be worried by the Brexit, but by the weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Spanish election. Even worse than the Eurozone was the pound. Sterling is still hovering around 31 year lows, at $1.37 against the dollar (dipping from $1.39 following Nicola Sturgeon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suggestion of a 2nd Scottish referendum) and $1.24 against the euro. It is understandable that the pound has been the instrument that has struggled the most to reduce its losses, though it does have the prospect of a wave of central bank rank cuts to potentially look forward to. By mid afternoon, trading volumes for the FTSE 100 reached \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20.5bn, around twice the recent daily average, according to equity exchange Bats Europe. Its full statistics show: More reaction to the Brexit vote from across the Atlantic, this time from Treasury secretary Jacob Lew, and another statement designed to reassure: The people of the United Kingdom have spoken and we respect their decision. We will work closely with both London and Brussels and our international partners to ensure continued economic stability, security, and prosperity in Europe and beyond. We continue to monitor developments in financial markets. I have been in regular contact in recent weeks with my counterparts and financial market participants in the UK, EU and globally and we are continuing to consult closely. The UK and other policymakers have the tools necessary to support financial stability, which is key to economic growth. The vote for Brexit will not immediately affect the Republic of Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating, said ratings agency S&amp;P: S&amp;P Global Ratings said today that the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote to leave the European Union does not immediately affect the sovereign credit rating on the Republic of Ireland (A+/Stable/A-1). We believe that the effect of an exit of the U.K. from the European Union (Brexit) on the Irish economy would likely be negative, at least in the short to medium term, but of uncertain magnitude and mixed across sectors. In terms of direct trade relationships, the U.K. accounts for only around 12.4% of Irish goods and 20% of Irish service exports, well below 50% levels observed when both countries joined the European Community in 1973. However, the sectors that serve the U.K. market are, on average, more labor intensive and any negative shocks could damage the mending Irish labor market. Other negative economic risks associated with a Brexit could include the weakening of the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial service sector, with which Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial service sector is closely linked, and the potential ripple effect stemming from lower demand from the rest of the EU. Furthermore, many aspects of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relationship with the EU, and therefore the U.K.-Irish relationship, would be unclear, increasing uncertainties related to trade and investment between the two countries. We do not believe the potential relocation of some U.K. businesses to Ireland would fully offset the overall negative impact of Brexit in the short to medium term. Nevertheless, we expect the Irish economy to stay resilient enough to withstand the negative impact of the Brexit. In our view, the pace of fiscal consolidation and reduction in general government debt may slow down somewhat, but the ratings will remain supported by Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong institutions, predictable policy making, and improving external balance sheet. The FTSE 100 is indeed now well off its worst levels, helped by the fact that a number of major companies have their earnings in dollars and should benefit from the plunge in the pound. The index is now off 1.9% at 6218 and is actually up 3.3% on the week, helped by the gains in the early part of the week when investors convinced themselves that the Remain side would win the referendum. Could it happen.....? Wall Street is joining the global selloff, as the shockwaves from Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote reach the other side of the Atlantic. The Dow Jones industrial average has tumbled by 505 points in the first few minutes, a plunge of 2.8%. That looks like it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest intraday fall since January. That takes the Dow down to 17,503, in a wave of panicky selling as US traders digest the shock news from the UK. They have to absorb the fact that Britain has voted to leave the EU, the resignation of prime minister David Cameron, the slump in the pound to a 31-year low, and very deep losses across Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market. Not forgetting the promises of emergency liquidity, if needed, from the Bank of England, the ECB and the Federal Reserve. Tech stocks are being hit hard, sending the Nasdaq index down almost 4%: At least one currency dealer in the City has profited from the Leave vote. ACE-FX, which has branches in Canary Wharf and London Bridge has spent the day telling customers that it sold all its currency yesterday and has nothing left in its vaults. Only customers who pre-ordered currency were allowed to complete transactions.Lines of disappointed people, mainly tourists keen to buy cheaper pounds, were turned away. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US president Obama on Brexit: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full G7 statement referred to by George Osborne earlier: We, G7 Ministers and Governors, respect the intention expressed today by the people of the United Kingdom to exit from the European Union. We are monitoring market developments following the outcome of the referendum on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s membership of the EU. We affirm our assessment that the UK economy and financial sector remain resilient and are confident that the UK authorities are well-positioned to address the consequences of the referendum outcome. We recognize that excessive volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates can have adverse implications for economic and financial stability. G7 central banks have taken steps to ensure adequate liquidity and to support the functioning of markets. We stand ready to use the established liquidity instruments to that end. We will continue to consult closely on market movements and financial stability, and cooperate as appropriate. We remain united and continue to maintain our solidarity as G7. Private investors are seeing the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s falls as a buying opportunity according to investment manager Hargreaves Lansdown. Som 80% of the trades through its share dealing service this morning were purchases, compared to around 60% on an average day. Laith Khalaf, Hargreaves Lansdon senior analyst said: Private investors are clearly seeing today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market fall as a buying opportunity, and are out in force bargain-hunting. The most popular stocks are also those which have seen their prices hit hardest this morning, namely the banks and house builders. We know that private investors have been sitting on the sidelines until after the referendum, and early indications are there may be some buying activity now the market has dropped. The US Federal Reserve is the latest central bank after the Bank of England and European Central Bank to try and reassure it is ready to act. In a statement it said: The Federal Reserve is carefully monitoring developments in global financial markets, in cooperation with other central banks, following the results of the U.K. referendum on membership in the European Union. The Federal Reserve is prepared to provide dollar liquidity through its existing swap lines with central banks, as necessary, to address pressures in global funding markets, which could have adverse implications for the U.S. economy. It is not so long ago that the US central bank was expected to raise interest rates again after its hike in December. That is now unlikely to happen in the immediate future. Indeed, could there even be a cut? Morgan Stanley is denying that it is moving 2,000 staff out of the City, as the BBC is reporting. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The BBC story is totally false\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a Morgan Stanley spokesman said . The BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ben Thompson is reporting that US investment bank Morgan Stanley has begun the process of moving some staff out of the City, to Ireland and Germany. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking into it now. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s certainly plausible; last week, Morgan Stanley said it could relocate 1,000 workers out of the UK if the Leave campaign won yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum. Nice chart from the FT, showing how today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sterling plunge is the third-worst currency selloff in the last 40 years. It is only beaten by the shock decision to lift Switzerland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency peg 18 months ago, and the turmoil caused to Japan by the 1973 oil crisis. US markets are set to open soon and at the moment it looks bad. Dow Jones Industrial futures - an indication of which way the market will go - are down 2.64% or 468 points. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not as bad as the drops we saw during the financial crisis - which were often twice that or more - but there are other signs of worry. Oil is down, Brent crude is off 4.9% at $48.45, suggesting worries about a global slowdown. And gold - favourite investment of worried investors - is up 5.2% at $1,328. The chancellor has also pledged to do all he can to implement the public\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision. In practice, though, David Cameron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation casts a huge shadow over Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own career, after six years as Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance chief. Breaking: The head of the International Monetary Fund has urged Britain and Europe to co-operate, following last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seismic referendum result. Christine Lagarde, managing director of the IMF, also backed the decision by the central banks of Britain and the eurozone to promise massive liquidity injections, if needed (as covered this morning) She says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We take note of the decision by the people of the United Kingdom. We urge the authorities in the U.K. and Europe to work collaboratively to ensure a smooth transition to a new economic relationship between the U.K. and the EU, including by clarifying the procedures and broad objectives that will guide the process. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We strongly support commitments of the Bank of England and the ECB to supply liquidity to the banking system and curtail excess financial volatility. We will continue to monitor developments closely and stand ready to support our members as needed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd World finance ministers and central bank chiefs have been briefed on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to leave the European Union. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chancellor of the exchequer (at the time of writing, anyway) who says: UK holiday firm Thomas Cook has halted web sales of foreign currencies, after being swamped with demand for euros from anxious Brits. The company has also imposed a \u00c2\u00a31,000 limit on currency sales at its shops, due to unprecedented demand after a record-breaking fall for the pound overnight. A spokeswoman told Reuters that:. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have temporarily suspended our travel money website following unprecedented customer demand for foreign currency overnight and this morning. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The demand for the euro has been building and we have had to just restrict it for now. We have enough currency to fulfil our standing orders but we have had to restrict new orders.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Earlier this week, there were queues outside FX dealers in London as people tried to protect themselves against a sterling crash. They now look quite prescient, given the pound has slumped from $1.50 to $1.37 in the last 14 hours. Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has confirmed it is reviewing the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top-rated AAA credit rating, which means they are considering cutting it. The rating agency fears that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth performance, external funding, and the public balance sheet are all going to suffer. And it warns that it could easily cut the rating by at least one notch, due to the economic problems Brexit will cause. S&amp;P says: A vote to leave would, in our view, deter investment in the economy, decrease official demand for sterling reserves, and put the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial services sector at a competitive disadvantage compared with other global financial centres. As mentioned earlier, S&amp;P is the only one of the Big Three agencies to have kept a AAA rating on UK government debt. Stephanie Flanders, chief market strategist for Europe at JP Morgan Asset Management, said that while the vote to leave was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153seismic change for the UK\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it was unlikely to prove a threat to the world economy. She told a conference call this lunchtime that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think Brexit puts the global recovery at risk.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However there were wider political consequences, she said, pointing to elections in France and Germany next year and in Spain on Sunday. She singled out France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s far-right leader, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Marine Le Pen will feel strengthened by this.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This is true.... Flanders estimated that it would reduce UK economic growth by 1.5% between now and 2017, and there could even be a quarter of contraction by the end of the year. She said that while the government was likely to loosen fiscal policy in the short term to counter weaker economic growth, there could be more austerity in store in future years to balance the books. Turning to the housing market, she said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The assumption that this is not going to be good for the London property market as a whole is a safe bet.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Finance ministers and central bank chiefs from the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top advanced economies are have held a conference call to discuss Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to German finance ministry spokesman Martin J\u00c3\u00a4ger, who told reporters: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A teleconference of the G7 ministers and central bank governors is underway at this minute. At the end of this teleconference, there may be a statement.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain is almost certain to fall into recession, even if central banks act to prevent market mayhem. So argue Jan Straatman and Salman Ahmed of Lombard Odier Investment Managers, who write: Focusing on the Bank of England, the central bank is in a very tricky situation. The sharp macro imbalances facing the UK economy - the twin deficits - will continue to play out in the form of sustained pressure on sterling. Indeed, to protect the currency and the country from a balance of payment crisis, we think a sustained QE programme is unlikely to be the correct policy response. A recession is a near certainty and we expect inflation to rise sharply on the back of the weaker currency. They also predict further wild swings in the markets, following the prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation this morning which has left Boris Johnson as the front-runner to replace him. Sterling is at the centre of the storm, with a nearly 10% hit against the US dollar since Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close. Not surprisingly, traditional safe havens such as government bonds in advanced economies, the Japanese yen and gold are rallying as investors take flight to safety. In terms of pure politics, the turmoil for the UK and the European Union has just started. David Cameron announced his resignation but we expect the coming weeks and the upcoming Conservative leadership election to be tumultuous for markets and sterling. Over in Australia, people are discovering that they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exchange money into, or out of, British pounds. Commonwealth Bank, Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest bank, has told customers that sterling transfers aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t currently available, while it assesses the aftermath of the Brexit poll. And some National Bank of Australia customers are finding problems transferring money into sterling, or US dollars. European bank shares have been roundly routed this morning, as investors predict weaker growth and new economic uncertainty: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum has hit commodity prices, sending the oil price sliding and could also hurt efforts to rescue South Wales\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 steel industry. Brent crude, sourced from the North Sea, has tumbled by 5% today to $48.38 per barrel. That reflects fears that Brexit will weaken the global economy. Sebastien Marlier, senior commodities editor at the Economist Intelligence Unit, believes oil will continue to weaken: Uncertainty about the UK, EU and global economy will initially translate into weaker commodity prices. The recent upward trend in oil prices will reverse, with the price of crude falling quickly back below US$40/barrel on weaker sentiment. Most commodities will follow suit. Gold will be an outlier, however, and will continue its upward trend amid investor flight to safety. Significantly for the UK, there is also a risk that the coming period of volatility could undermine negotiations to save Tata\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Port Talbot steelworks. After the initial shock of Brexit wears off, fundamentals should gradually reassert their influence over the oil and commodities markets, with prices rising again as demand and supply come closer to balance. However, Brexit will lead to slightly slower European and global economic growth in the medium term. This will translate into a more gradual increase in oil demand and, in turn, the oil price. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new mayor is already taking steps to be closely involved in the Brexit talks: Over at City stockbroker Panmure Gordon, which also saw a return to 1980s-style vocal trading earlier today, the mood has calmed a tad. The most audible voice now belongs to a television presenter, rather than traders yelling buy and sell orders to each other (as during the dramatic market open at 8am) Now the reality of Brexit is sinking in, brokers here are finding that American clients see an investment opportunity and many of them have been buying London-listed shares. Their dollars go a bit further than they did. However, that is not to be confused with US investors thinking that the UK has made a sensible choice. Nick Hiley, head of sales at Panmure Gordon, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153UK investors often make the error of thinking our assets are priced in sterling. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not. [The rest of the world views them as being] priced in dollars. In dollars the market is off much more. The damage is considerable.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Right now, the FTSE 100 is down 300 points or 4.8%, a loss of \u00c2\u00a377bn. But the market is also worth 8% less than yesterday, due to the slump in the pound. The pound has dropped by two cents in the last few minutes, after Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, floated the prospect of a second independence referendum. Sturgeon is holding a press conference right now. She says that another referendum is now very likely, and that Scotland shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be taken out of the EU against its will. This has knocked the pound back to $1.367, from $1.39 at 11am BST. The US stock market is expected to fall by over 2.5% when New York traders gets their teeth into Brexit, in three hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. House prices are a popular conversation point at British dinner parties, school gates and cafes at the best of times. So this morning, many people are wondering what the EU referendum means for the property market. And the early verdict is that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to dampen demand, and push prices down. Jan Crosby, head of housing at KPMG UK, predicts at least six months of uncertainty -- and longer in London. He expects prices to take a 5% hit, but more in the capital. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As we enter a new phase of uncertainty following the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote to leave the EU, it is very likely people will put big decisions on hold, and one of the biggest decisions people ever make is a house purchase. This means we can expect short term transaction volumes to decrease and to stay deflated for some time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c perhaps until next spring. While we may not notice much of a change over summer, given the traditional hiatus in the housing market, the usual pick up in autumn may not materialise. Richard Donnell, insight director at property consultancy Hometrack, also expects demand for new houses to slide: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The immediate impact is likely to be a fall in housing turnover and a rapid deceleration in house price growth as buyers adopt a wait and see the short-term impact on financial markets and the economy at large. David Cameron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation means Britain is now gripped by a political crisis, as well as an economic one. Dominic Rossi, global CIO of Equities at Fidelity International, believes the political shock will be more serious. But he also believes Britain will fall back into recession, at a time of growing risk worldwide. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153From an economic point of view, we can expect lower growth in the UK and across Europe, and that is now being discounted in equity markets. We also expect a mild recession in the UK over the course of this year and into next year. However, what matters more is that political risk premia will now rise around the world and this implies lower valuations. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s result will set off a domino effect of political risk. Whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the US election later this year or the French election next year, investors are going to be far more cautious. Jonathan Hill, the British European Commissioner, could become an early casualty of the referendum. Hill is currently responsibly for financial stability, financial services and capital markets union. But not for much longer, if some MEPs get their way. The Brexit vote is already causing problems for some holidaymakers in Greece, according to this tweet from the island of Kos. Hot on the heels of the Bank of England, the European Central Bank has promised to provide extra liquidity to protect the financial world. In a brief statement, the ECB said it was closely monitoring financial markets and is in close contact with other central banks. It says: The ECB stands ready to provide additional liquidity, if needed, in euro and foreign currencies. The ECB has prepared for this contingency in close contact with the banks that it supervises and considers that the euro area banking system is resilient in terms of capital and liquidity. The ECB will continue to fulfil its responsibilities to ensure price stability and financial stability in the euro area. There were rumours last week that central banks could launch co-ordinated action to calm the markets after a Brexit victory. Central banks are expected to use \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcswap lines\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to share currency with each other so that, for example, a British bank isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t short of euros. Not every City boss is weeping about the referendum result. Howard Shore, executive chairman of stockbroking firm Shore Capital Group, argues that the British people made the right decision. We now have a fantastic opportunity to deregulate the economy and better compete on a global stage in the 21st century. Shore also argues that Europe shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t punish the UK for its decision: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The closeness of the result should encourage EU leaders to think pragmatically, arriving at a solution where Britain is out of the political union, but retains the ties that are of mutual benefit; and creates a two speed Europe for those wanting to stay out of the Eurozone and its inevitable move towards closer political union. As has been said many times, the Germans have no appetite to exclude us from the single market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c only yesterday its industry chief, Markus Kerber, noted the foolishness of imposing trade barriers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Despite today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff the FTSE 100 is basically flat for the week (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently down 300 points, or 4.8%) Over at another City trading firm, XTB, there is scepticism that the optimism of many clients is going to end well. David Cheetham, the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market analyst, says that clients are trying to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pick a bottom\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - a City term for buying shares at their cheapest point. But he fears that the selloff will intensify. He tells Simon Goodley that: We are going to have a long period of uncertainty which is not conducive to strong financial markets. I feel we will retest lows\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The pound is the worst-performing asset today: Fitch Ratings, the Paris based agency, says that decision to leave the EU is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153credit negative for most sectors in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, due to weaker medium-term growth and investment prospects and uncertainty about future trade arrangements. Alex White, regional director for Europe at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said he was still digesting the implications of the vote, but had these initial thoughts: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty disastrous. You tend to get a little bit of an overreaction [in markets] and then a small correction but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not going back to anything like the status quo for a long time. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I expect you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbuyers remorse\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 very quickly. People will feel this. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see it in their pension statements.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd White added that the statements from the Prime Minister and from Mark Carney struck the right tone. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Both of them did a pretty good job. Cameron made the best of a bad situation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rating agency Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has issued a report on Brexit, warning that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic and financial performance will suffer from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a prolonged period of policy uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It warns that investment flows into Britain will be his by the heightened uncertainty; which means lower growth. That will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153credit negative for the UK sovereign and other UK debt issuers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s adds - in other words, the UK could be downgraded. IG has a trading desk that deals solely with European clients. Do they think the UK has gone mad? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Pretty much, yes,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd one trader tells me. IAG, the parent company of British Airways, has become the first FTSE 100 company to warn today that the EU referendum will hit its earnings. It has issued a short statement to the City, saying it no longer expects to hit its profit forecasts for 2016. International Consolidated Airlines Group, S.A. (IAG) believes that the vote to leave the European Union will not have a long term material impact on its business. In the short term, however, in the run up to the UK referendum during June, IAG experienced a weaker than expected trading environment. Following the outcome of the referendum, and given current market volatility, while IAG continues to expect a significant increase in operating profit this year, it no longer expects to generate an absolute operating profit increase similar to 2015. IAG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are now down 20%, making it one of the worst-performing members of the FTSE 100. Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement underlines that all the contingency plans that were drawn up ahead of the vote are having to be rolled out. The governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempt at reassurance, the soothing statements from the high street banks and the decisions by banks to try to do more voice trading rather than relying on computers are all part of that strategy. Lloyds Banking Group have also tried to sound reassuring, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are no changes in the products or services offered to customers, either in the UK or overseas. Customers can continue to use our banking and insurance services as they did before. Customer deposits in the UK continue to be protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme; and the Prudential Regulation Authority and Financial Conduct Authority remain our primary regulators. Malcolm Barr, economist at JP Morgan, has predicted Scotland would seek another independence referendum before the UK completes its EU exit, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely that Scotland will vote to leave.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Speaking to investors, Barr added that Northern Ireland was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153going to be troublesome to manage\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with Sinn Fein already talking about a referendum (although that is unlikely to happen). In the EU, the vote to leave \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is going to energise populist parties\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but JP Morgan does not anticipate referenda on EU membership elsewhere. European finance ministers are meeting today and there could be an emergency EU summer this weekend or early next week. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The initial signs are not particularly conciliatory... Out is out and there won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be any special favours for the UK.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Barr added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153An emergency budget is possible but certainly won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any of the character that Mr Osborne described.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd His colleague Allan Monks believes the Bank of England will cut interest rates by 50 basis points [to zero] by the August meeting, with a 25bps cut in July \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a distinct possibility\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He said the Bank would weigh up the potential inflation shock resulting from the sharp drop in sterling against the damage to economic growth. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There will be an inflation move up close to 3% by the end of next year on the basis of what sterling has done this morning, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enough to stop them from easing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Monks noted that the UK would retain access to the single market for the time being, but uncertainty will rise further, so \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we expect that to create further delays in firms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 investment and hiring decisions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He is predicting that UK growth will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153slow to a crawl\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in coming quarters, with growth likely to be 1% lower over the coming year, while Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate is likely to rise by half a percentage point to 5.5% next year. Paul Meggyesi, currency strategist at JP Morgan, said the pound had further to fall. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not convinced we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already seen the lows in sterling.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The sterling-dollar rate could go below $1.30 over the next week or so, he said. After 90 minutes of noisy drama, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s noticeably quieter now at Cantor Fitzgerald. The lull before the US market open? Bank shares, though, are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153still getting hammered\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all about waiting for the US investors to wake up.. Property firms are the biggest fallers, though, which suggests investors are expecting a housing downturn. We might never find out who saw them, but there is plenty of speculation in the City that hedge funds commissioned exit polls yesterday that got things even more wrong than the opinion polls and the betting markets. One trader says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sterling was so strong last night that it suggests that somebody had very strong data that the vote was going to be Remain. Some hedge fund has probably paid about half a million for it and the data was absolutely terrible.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Every cloud, and all that. While Carney was speaking, IG traders were yelling across desks to check if they can make trades. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I want to sell 22,000 [shares]\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd screams one. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yeah, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll trade that,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd replies a colleague. And some clients think today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff is a buying opportunity. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost all been buying,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says one trader. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Clients think things have been oversold. There is very little selling.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The stock market has now clawed back half of its losses, following Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to provide \u00c2\u00a3250bn of funds to calm the situation. The FTSE 100 is now down 274 points, or 4.3%, at 6065 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still a very large fall, that wipes out around \u00c2\u00a370bn. Mark Carney concluded his statement by underlining how the Bank of England is prepared to act. The governor said: A few months ago, the Bank judged that the risks around the referendum were the most significant, near-term domestic risks to financial stability. To mitigate them, the Bank of England has put in place extensive contingency plans.These begin with ensuring that the core of our financial system is well-capitalised, liquid and strong. This resilience is backed up by the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liquidity facilities in sterling and foreign currencies.All these resources will support orderly market functioning in the face of any short-term volatility. The Bank will continue to consult and cooperate with all relevant domestic and international authorities to ensure that the UK financial system can absorb any stresses and can concentrate on serving the real economy. And he finished by telling the public that the future is in their hands.... That economy will adjust to new trading relationships that will be put in place over time.It is these public and private decisions that will determine the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term economic prospects. The best contribution of the Bank of England to this process is to continue to pursue relentlessly our responsibilities for monetary and financial stability. These are unchanged. We have taken all the necessary steps to prepare for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s events.In the future we will not hesitate to take any additional measures required to meet our responsibilities as the United Kingdom moves forward. Bank of England governor Mark Carney is giving a statement now. He says there will inevitably be a period of uncertainty following the decision to leave the European Union. But there will be no immediate change to our relationship with the EU. It will take some times for the UK to establish new relationships with the rest of the world. So some market and economic volatility can be expected, but we are well prepared for this, says Carney. He says he has been in close contact with chancellor George Osborne through the night, and this morning. UK banks are more resilient than before the 2008 crisis, Carney says, and are forced to carry 10 times as much capital. The Bank of England will not hesitate to take additional measures as required to address any market volatility, says the governor And Carney says the BOE will make \u00c2\u00a3250bn of additional funds available through its normal market operations to stability markets, as needed. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pledge to pump huge liquidity into the banking system, if necessary, to prevent the wheels of the City grinding to a half. Striking a reassuring tone, Carney says the Bank will consider what additional measures may be needed over the next few weeks [so he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not announcing any emergency measures right now]. And governor Carney concludes by repeating that the BoE \u00e2\u20ac\u0153will not hesitate to take any further measures, as required.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And with that, he heads back into the Bank. European stock markets are deeply in the red: Massive amounts of shares are changing hands in the City. Almost 463.9m trades flowed through the London stock market in the first 30 minutes, the sort of volume you might see by after lunchtime on a normalish day. Predictions of massive losses across Europe are proving accurate. The French CAC is the worst casualty, tumbling by 8.5% in early trading in Paris. And Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX is close behind, down 8%. Prime minister David Cameron has announced that he will resign as prime minister, following the referendum. He expects a new leader to be in place before the Conservative Party conference, this autumn. Speaking outside Downing Street, Cameron says: He says he is very proud of what he has done as prime minister. He says he has always thought you have to confront big decisions, not duck them. He formed a coalition, delivered a referendum in Scotland and gave the public a referendum on Europe. He fought the referendum with head and heart. The referendum was not about him, he says. But the British people have decided to follow another path. So they need a new prime minister. Cameron says he will resign as prime minister. He will do what he can to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153steady the ship\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He says he is not announcing a timetable today, but a new prime minister should be in place by the start of the Conservative conference. He says he thinks the new prime minister should decide when to trigger the article 50 renegotiation process. So he will not trigger it himself. Our main EU referendum liveblog has full details and reaction: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Take another blood pressure pill,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says one Cantor Fitzgerald trader, as the volume of shares traded in London rises fast. Stocks are again going into auctions because of the rapid movements in the share prices. No one appears to have time to stop to listen to Cameron, whose voice can be heard across the dealing room. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Barclays down 28%!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd yells one IG trader. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s buzzing here. IG increased the margin clients had to deposit in their accounts in the weeks running up to the vote. Clients will therefore be able to fund losses of around 10% before being asked for more funds. That means if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re long of the FTSE you are (just) OK. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re long of the banks, credit card details please. Shares in Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland have both fallen by 25%. At Cantor Fitzgerald, there are shouts that David Cameron is rumoured to be about to resign and lots of calling out of share prices as they start to open. Trading floors are usually a lot quieter than most people think (more than 95% of trades here are online) but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s different today. IG traders shouting across the floor, like it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1986 or something. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Quite a hubbub for us,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdsays one. Very old school. As the market opens, traders are expecting huge volumes in most shares, but some sectors look more vulnerable than others. One trader says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Anything to do with buy to let property is a short\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This is the biggest plunge for the blue-chip Footsie index since the 2008 financial crisis. But shares are coming back a little bit -- the FTSE 100 is now \u00e2\u20ac\u0153only\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd down 400 points, or 6.4%. These are the top fallers on the FTSE 100 right now, as wild selling sweeps the City trading floors More than \u00c2\u00a3120bn has been wiped off the FTSE 100 at the start of trading. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an absolute rout! The FTSE 100 has shed 527 points, or over 8%, in a massive selloff.... Some shares have lost a third of their value. Housebuilders Taylor Wimpey and Persimmon have plunged by 40% And some shares have still not opened.... There are some big moves already. Supermarket chain Morrisons is down 9%, Royal Mail (floated a few years ago) are down almost 7%. Mining group BHP Billiton has lost 6%. But half the FTSE 100 hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually opened, as market makers struggle to match buy and sell orders. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets are open, and shares are tumbling. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to take several minutes before we know the full damage.... The mood on the Cantor Fitzgerald floor is that continental European stocks could get hit harder than those in the UK. Also echoing the feeling that the market was caught wrong way, expecting a Remain vote and for the pound not to weaken.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdGet your tin hats on,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says one trader, minutes before the market opens. The general view on the IG trading floor is that the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement says nothing (The Bank may take that as a compliment). Traders are looking forward to hearing what other central banks say - plus a view from the boss. As one puts it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What do [Mario] Draghi and [Angela] Merkel say?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The chief executive of Barclays, Jes Staley, has issued a statement on the referendum result: This is a significant decision and there will be many questions asked in the coming days and weeks about what happens next. The answers are complex but our position is not: we will not break our stride in delivering the Barclays of the future. We have stood in service of our customers and clients for over 325 years. We have been here for them through equally profound changes before. And no matter what has been laid before us, we have been here to help them achieve their ambitions. That does not change today. And through the uncertainty of the months ahead, be in no doubt that we are ready to do whatever it takes to uphold that promise. The strategy we announced on 1 March, 2016 was not conditional on the UK remaining in the EU. We are a transatlantic consumer, corporate and investment bank, anchored in the UK and the US. That remains the core of our strength and the Barclays of the future. Back at Cantor Fitzgerald in the City, traders are bracing for the selloff in half an hour: All eyes are on the German Dax, as well as the FTSE 100, with both being called down almost 10%. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sterling is steady at $1.36\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says one trader. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Who ever thought it would be $1.48 and $1.36 on the same day,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd his colleague observes, amid scores of screens showing the state of play in the markets. John McDonnell MP, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow chancellor, has commented on the market mayhem: People will be waking up this morning to turmoil in the markets and the pound crashing, and fearing the emergency budget the Chancellor threatened to hike their taxes and cut public services. The Government must now take steps to stabilise the economy, and to protect jobs, pensions and wages. Labour will not allow any instability to be paid for by the working people of this country? European stock markets could suffer even deeper falls than London, when trading begins in 40 minutes. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX is currently expected to plunge by around 1,000 points at the open, a fall of around 10%. Bank shares are likely to suffer dramatic losses. David Cameron is due to give a statement at 8am, just as the markets open (so that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be fun). Chris Beachamp, chief market analyst at IG, says the PM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next move is crucial. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sterling now will depend on the shape of the UK government at about 4pm and if Cameron is still there. If he says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going it will be sold off again. The best thing he can do is hold the line here. We also have Spanish elections this weekend. To lose one government would be unfortunate. To lose two would be careless.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd At the Canary Wharf dealing floor at Cantor Fitzgerald they are preparing for the stock market to open at 8am. One trader tells me he is expecting there to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extended auctions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when the stock market opens. (These occur when share prices move more than 5%). Newsflash: A statement from the Bank of England: The Bank of England is monitoring developments closely. It has undertaken extensive contingency planning and is working closely with HM Treasury, other domestic authorities and overseas central banks. The Bank of England will take all necessary steps to meet its responsibilities for monetary and financial stability. Listening to traders talking to clients, it becomes very clear what a shock the result is to many in the City. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just overheard a conversation with one IG client who had a profitable position on the shares of one major high street bank. Well, it was profitable when the market closed last night. The conversation now involved various scenarios of the shares crashing - plus talk of the client providing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more margin\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ie, put some more cash into your account sunshine. Tesco has suspended its currency service for holidaymakers amid the market turmoil. Visitors to its holiday money site are greeted with a screen saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are sorry... the online ordering service is currently not available.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Holidaymakers who queued outside exchange bureaux yesterday to buy their euros ahead of going abroad this summer will be counting their blessings (as explained earlier). If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just tuning in, you need to know that: The British pound has been absolutely hammered by the news that Britain has voted to leave the EU. Sterling has suffered its biggest ever drop, and is currently hovering around $1.36, down 8.5%. European stock markets are going to plunge in an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares is expected to fall by over 500 points, which would wipe around 8% off Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest companies. Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets have already slumped, with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei plunging by 8%. The London Stock Exchange has told Reuters that they plan to open at 8am, as usual. On Monday, chancellor George Osborne refused to rule out suspending trading if the Leave campaign won the referendum. Shares in two major banks, HSBC and Standard Chartered, have both tumbled by almost 10% in Hong Kong (where they are dual listed). That gives you an idea of what to expect in London at 8am.... Britain is likely to lose its final triple-A credit rating, following the referendum vote. S&amp;P, which is the only Big Three agency to maintain Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AAA rating, has indicated that a downgrade is now inevitable. Moritz Kraemer, chief ratings officer for S&amp;P, told the Financial Times that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We think that a AAA-rating is untenable under the circumstances.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Fitch both downgraded the UK in early 2013. The City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading floors will be a sea of red today, and a sea of discarded pizza boxes too: Gold, the traditional safe haven in times of market turmoil, has soared in value overnight. Bullion has jumped by 22% in sterling terms in a dramatic indication of worldwide panic over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit from the EU. At 10pm last night gold was trading at $1,256.50 an ounce, but it started to accelerate swiftly as early results from the referendum began to feed through. This morning it is trading at $1,336. 66, a jump of 6.3% in dollar terms, but much more in sterling terms once the fall in the pound is taken into account. Adrian Ash, head of research at BullionVault.com said the surge in the gold price was the fastest move against the pound in history. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The surging gold price clearly shows the panic sweeping financial markets. Gold jumped 22% against the Pound overnight, its fastest ever move, leaping to new 3-year highs above \u00c2\u00a31000 per ounce. This scene will be playing out across the City, and Canary Wharf, as analysts and investors ponder how to react to events. The referendum result is emblazoned on electronic screens in Canary Wharf, for the benefit of any traders who slept through the drama of the last few hours. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market rout is going to create money-making (and losing) opportunities. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People might see this as an opportunity. Maybe the FTSE will be seen as a buy to some. Others will say let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s go with the flow. Things tend to get worse, rather than better, at first. It is going to be a day of crazy volumes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also Gallows humour in the City. One client to IG trader: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Well, that proves Trump can win, doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As if we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have enough to worry about.... The Remain side warned during the campaign that Brexit could push Britain into recession. Piers Hillier, chief investment officer at Royal London Asset Management, believes this will now happen: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOn the back of this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s result we expect the UK will fall into a recession. Unfortunately I see unstable market conditions lasting for between three and five years whilst new trade agreements are drawn up.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIt is our view that the UK Government will be left with no choice but to stimulate the economy through fiscal and monetary means, flooding the system with liquidity if necessary.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 The City and markets are often viewed as if they are prophets who can make money out of predicting what is coming next, but it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look as though too many anticipated Brexit. One IG trader has just told me his clients were buying sterling right up to midnight. That changed when we got the news from Sunderland, before 1am. High street banks have been in touch with their regulator at the Bank of England through the night. One senior retail banker tells me: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Everybody is braced for a roller coaster day\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The BoE is expected to ensure that liquidity isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a problem.The banks have had a year to plan for the referendum, and have contingency plans in place. Holidays Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overnight collapse to little more than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.20 against the euro means it is now worth nearly 15% less than the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.42 rate enjoyed by holidaymakers last summer. In terms of spending, that means a family who last year got through \u00c2\u00a3500 while on holiday will this year need to find \u00c2\u00a375 more. As for freedom to travel, Britons will in all probability be able to enjoy visa-free travel to EU countries for the foreseeable future. Petrol Get ready for the cost of petrol to rise in the next few days. Crude oil is priced in dollars, and once that figure is converted into today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lower sterling rate, the price must inevitably rise. Before the referendum, the crude price was $50 a barrel, and petrol was retailing at 112p a litre for unleaded. This morning the price of crude has moved little - it is up to $51, but the fall in sterling means that once translated into pounds, the price is likely to head towards 120p. It may make sense to fill up this morning. Note that fuel duty is 57.95p a litre for both petrol and diesel, and remains the biggest component of the price we pay. Motorists also pay 20% VAT on fuel. Mortgages All eyes will be on official Bank of England movements, with governor Mark Carney expected to speak after David Cameron sometime after 6am. A hike in interest rates to defend the pound will hit millions of households on tracker-style mortgages. For example, around 700,000 people are on Nationwide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2.5% standard variable rate. If base rate goes up by 0.5%, it will take the cost of a \u00c2\u00a3100,000 mortgage to \u00c2\u00a3474 from \u00c2\u00a3449. But it is just as possible that interest rates could fall to provide liquidity and restore order to markets. A cut to zero from 0.5% would see repayments fall to \u00c2\u00a3436 a month. Each half-point change in rates adds or subtracts around \u00c2\u00a325 a month to most people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s repayment mortgages. People with interest-only mortgages see steeper changes - around \u00c2\u00a342 extra a month for every 0.5% rate rise. The pound has slumped by over 6% against the euro, to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.22, in a wave of selling. It was worth \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.30 yesterday. That means one euro is worth 81.5p, up from 76p on Thursday. Trevor Charsley at AFEX, a foreign exchange firm, says: What we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing now is the market reacting with complete shock and bewilderment as the results unfold. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest news story about the unfolding panic in world financial markets. Global bank HSBC has predicted that the pound will fall to $1.20 by the end of the year. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a real sense of shock on the IG trading floor this morning. A trader here tells me: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A lot of people are long equities [they have been betting on shares rising] which is fairly natural. There is going to be a lot of pain here.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd IG is calling the FTSE 100 to open down by around 7%. There has also been a flight to safety, with gold up 5%. Bitcoin is soaring too. And Boris Johnson is now even money on Betfair to be next PM. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is going to suffer a huge selloff when trading begins in two hours time. The futures market is indicating that the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares will plunge by over 554 points, or nearly 9%. That would wipe almost \u00c2\u00a3150bn off the Footsie, which contains many of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest companies - and major international firms too. European stock markets are also expected to suffer massive losses too, and Wall Street will surely follow suit when New York wakes up. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expecting to hear from Bank of England governor Mark Carney this morning, once prime minister David Cameron has responded to the referendum result. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, Taro Aso has said he is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very concerned about the world economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after Japan and other Asian markets suffered a day of turmoil in reaction to the Brexit vote. Aso declined to say if financial authorities would intervene in currency markets after the dollar and pound plummeted against the yen, and the Nikkei 225 benchmark index shed more than 7% by early afternoon local time. Trading in Nikkei futures was briefly halted as global equity markets plunged on rising fears that Britain would leave the EU. Asian stock markets have already been routed, as traders watched events unfold in Britain with mounting panic. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei has slumped by 7.6%, or around 1,200 points, in the biggest one-day rout since March 2011 (when the Fukushima earthquake struck). Other markets are also deep in the red. Nick Robinson, co-founder of World First, has seen a few currency moves in his time, And he reckons the slump in the pound is huge. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a major economic event and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the world has woken up to what the potential consequences might be\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He acknowledges no one really knows those consequences but points to the possible impact on Europe and global confidence. Separately I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m hearing that across the City there has been 30 times the average daily volume in dollar/sterling - and that is before London properly wakes up The sun is rising over the City and the dealing floor is filling up at World First, where dealers are scrutinising screens and trying to come to terms with Brexit. It is getting louder too. Sterling is at $1.3460 - \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the minds of one of the dealers here, despite the fact it has plummeted from $1.50 since the polls closed. It all about getting ready for clients who want to trade. There is also some humour: even the Zimbabwean dollar is up against the pound. Another trader remarks he wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t born the last time the pound - at 31 year lows - traded at these levels. A huge wave of selling has driven the pound down to its lowest level since 1985. Sterling has slumped by 15 cents, or more than 10%, to $1.33 against the US dollar. An astonishing slump. The crash began in the early hours of this morning, once referendum results showed that Leave were winning more votes than the City had expected. This is the biggest one-day plunge ever. It even dwarfs the sterling crash on Black Wednesday in 1992, when Britain left the ERM. Good morning. Financial markets around the globe are plunging after the British people rocked Europe by voting to leave the European Union. After a night of wild drama, the Out campaign appears to have secured a decisive victory in the EU referendum. With most areas declared, Leave have around 52% of the vote, sending Britain into political uncertainty and the EU into its biggest crisis ever. The pound has already plunged to a 30-year low. And London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is expected to tumble very, very sharply at 8am when trading begins. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the financial action, on what could be one of the most dramatic days in the City in decades.",

                "bodyText":"Bank of England governor Mark Carney is expected to abandon plans to fly to Portugal for a summit of central bankers, amid fears of further turmoil when markets open on Monday. With expectations that the FTSE 100 index could open almost 3% lower on Monday, the governor was weighing up whether to stick to his plans to attend the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual summit in Portugal on Wednesday. Carney, who was quick to make a public statement on Friday after the Brexit vote sent shock waves through financial markets, seems unlikely to carry on with his schedule to attend the last day of the three-day meeting in Portugal which starts on Monday. At one point on Friday morning as the result became clear, sterling dived to 30-year lows and the FTSE 100 was off almost 8%, although by the end of the week the stock market ended where it had started. Even so, an analyst at Dow Jones indices had calculated that the $2tn (\u00c2\u00a31.4tn) wiped off global markets on Friday was the worse on record, surpassing the losses on 29 September 2008 during the height of the banking crisis. Carney was in Basel, Switzerland, for a meeting of central bank governors over the weekend, where he was expected to have discussed the implications of the historic vote on 23 June. The Bank, which declined to comment on the governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s travel plans, will on Tuesday offer the third and last of its emergency funding deals to offer cash to the banking system, which Carney had announced ahead of the 23 June referendum. The first two special loan facilities had a low uptake \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00c2\u00a32.4bn and \u00c2\u00a3370m respectively. Carney will this week also chair a pre-scheduled meeting of the financial policy committee, set up in the wake of the banking crisis to weigh up the risks in the financial system. The meeting takes place at a time when volatility in the markets is high and anxiety about the future of the City is swirling. Across the British financial services industry, up to 100,000 financial jobs could be on the line, according to a report for the lobby group CityUK by PricewaterhouseCoopers ahead of the referendum. Banks are known to be making plans to move some jobs to EU areas if the City loses the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153passporting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd arrangement that allows its banks, hedge funds and law firms to operate across Europe. HSBC would move 1,000 roles to France, while JP Morgan has said 4,000 jobs could be lost after Brexit. Rumours have swept through the City about how quickly any contingency plans would be implemented, with financial centres in Dublin, Paris, Frankfurt and Luxembourg all cited as potential beneficiaries. The chief executive of Deutsche Bank \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which employs 11,000 in the City \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has played down the long-term impact. John Cryan, who is British, told Handelsblatt: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The financial centre won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t die but it will get weaker.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The high street banks are also affected with their shares tumbling on Friday and the government abandoning any further efforts to cut its stakes in bailed out Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland. Diane Coyle, professor of economics at Manchester University, said markets would be watching for signs that uncertainty was spilling over into the real economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is the worry that uncertainty will feed through into decisions to hold off investment, higher prices of imported goods, falling house prices and the higher costs of a summer holiday abroad to stifle consumer spending. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These are things that can feed on themselves and cause a deeper recession.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She added that an uncertain outcome to the Spanish elections on Sunday could trigger further volatility in financial markets.",

                "bodyText":"Brexit is important for Australian policymakers. Whichever side wins the 2 July federal election will need to have policy pragmatism to deal with the potential fallout. With the British people electing to permanently destroy their wealth, incomes and living standards by voting to leave the European Union, global economic risks have intensified. One only has to witness the savage reaction in financial markets as it became apparent the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Leave\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd vote was winning. There were several trillion dollars of value lost to global stock markets, the yield on government bonds fell to never-before-seen levels and currency markets went into meltdown, with the British pound dropping more than 10% to reach its lowest level since 1985. Australia will not be immune from the fallout from the Brexit vote. Like the experience throughout the world, Australian share prices have already fallen sharply and government bond yields have dropped to historic lows. While it is clearly early days for markets, commodity prices have also dropped sharply. For the already fragile nature of the domestic economy, Brexit is presenting very real downside risks. For policymakers and the markets, some effects from the Brexit vote will be obvious. The Reserve Bank of Australia will need to continue its strategy of cutting interest rates, and the Australian dollar is likely to fall as it acts as a safely valve to cushion Australia from weaker global growth and low commodity prices. That is the easy part of the analysis. The role for fiscal policy is unclear. Whichever side wins the 2 July election, the news is probably stark. The so-called incoming government briefing documents from Treasury and the Department of Finance will deliver some unwelcome news on those risks to the economy and budget. For the term of the current Coalition government, nothing has been done to improve the structural position of the budget. The Treasury frustration is palpable. The desirability of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reloading\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the budget to give a war chest of funds to fight any future global economic risks has been an issue that Treasury hounded former treasurer Joe Hockey and then his successor, Scott Morrison, to address. Alas, nothing was done. Yet in the months and years ahead, there may be a need to consider fiscal stimulus if some of the worst-case scenarios from Brexit come to pass. A Brexit-inspired crisis would open a legitimate debate concerning the budget deficit versus protecting economic growth. As was evident during the banking and financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, the shrewd, pragmatic and well-targeted use of fiscal policy stimulus from the government saw the economy avoid recession and capped the unemployment rate at a remarkably low 5.9%. It was a masterclass of policy that saw Labor treasurer Wayne Swan awarded Euromoney magazine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best treasurer prize in 2011. It also saw Fitch Ratings upgrade Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating to AAA, which meant for the first time ever, Australia had the coveted top credit rating with a stable outlook from all three major credit rating agencies. The fiscal stimulus also extended the period the Australian economy had gone without a recession. Now, Australia can boast that it has been 25 years since the last recession, a feat without precedent. Australian policymakers should be on standby to use fiscal policy as the fallout from Brexit becomes clearer, with the aim an extension of the 25 years without recession. There must be doubts about the ability of a returned Coalition government to do the right thing, given it opposed some of the stimulus measures during the GFC and has argued in more recent years that a return to budget surplus is a policy priority regardless of the state of the business cycle. We have seen what misguided fiscal policy has meant for countries in the Eurozone \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a deeper recession and higher unemployment. It is to be hoped that if the fallout from Brexit causes global economic dislocation, Australian policymakers will follow the policy approach used during the GFC and not stick with a crazed obsession with the budget balance.

                "bodyText":"The FTSE and sterling may be falling but there are some winners emerging in the fallout from the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to leave the EU. Gold investors, hedge funds, multinational corporations and property-buying oligarchs all stand to gain. Gold The price of gold usually rises in times of economic crisis because bullion is seen as a safe-haven asset. Gold dipped as low as $1,255 in the lead-up to the EU referendum, when a remain win was widely predicted. In the aftermath of the leave vote it has risen nearly 6%in dollar terms, to $1,329 as of noon on Monday. That spells good news for gold miners, who suddenly find that every ounce they produce is worth more. Shares in Randgold Resources have risen more than 24%, from \u00c2\u00a364.38 the night before the poll to \u00c2\u00a379.80 on Monday afternoon. Fellow gold miner Fresnillo is up 21% over the same period to \u00c2\u00a315. Dollar earners and defensive stocks Any company that earns more money in dollars \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or euros for that matter \u00e2\u20ac\u201c than it does in pounds, stands to gain. This means that huge global multinational companies such as Unilever and Reckitt Benckiser are relatively protected from the turmoil. The two firms have seen stock market rises of 4.5% and 3% respectively since Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close. Drinks companies also stand to gain, with Diageo selling huge volumes of Scotch and Guinness to overseas buyers. It has gained 5% since the vote. Pharmaceuticals companies are among the biggest dollar earners and this is reflected in their share prices. GlaxoSmithKline has risen 5% since Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close, while AstraZeneca has climbed nearly 7%. Pharmaceuticals are also doing well because they are seen as defensive stocks, places to put your money in times of turmoil. The economy may suffer, but people will still spend money on medicine. The same is true of tobacco, and there have been rises for British American Tobacco, up more than 4%, and Imperial Brands, 3.5% higher. They also earn a large proportion of their earnings in dollars. Utility companies, also seen as defensive stocks, were in demand, with National Grid 2% higher and United Utilities 1.5% higher. Exporters and luxury brands Much like the multinational dollar earners, smaller UK firms that rely on exports should benefit in the short-term. The weakness of the pound makes it far cheaper for other countries to buy British goods. In the luxury market, this helps the likes of Mulberry, as the falling pound makes posh handbags cheaper for foreign fashionistas in the near future. The upmarket brand initially watched its shares fall after the vote but recovered 3.5% on Monday against a falling market. Private firms with an export-heavy order book should also do well, although this will not become evident until they publish financial results over the next few years. Brompton Bicycles, which earns 80% of its money overseas, is one such firm. However, Prof Nigel Driffield of Warwick Business School points out that exporters may find the benefit of the weak pound cancelled out in the longer term. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some argue that with the likely devaluation of sterling following Brexit, small UK exporters may be better able to export, not just to the EU but to the rest of the world. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This, however, depends on whether the devaluation also increases their costs, given that 50% of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exports rely on imported components.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Foreign oligarchs Eurozone buyers have gained a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac50,900 discount on the average London house pricefollowing the EU referendum result, according to analysis from the London estate agents Stirling Ackroyd. Dollars buyers will find UK property much cheaper so the capital\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s homes are looking like an even better bet for wealthy people from overseas looking to stash their cash in property.

Several major hedge funds, including Odey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, were known to be backing Brexit before the vote. Overseas investment funds Investment trusts that help UK investors put their money into foreign assets have done well, as people shift their cash away from assets exposed to the British economy. JP Morgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s emerging markets, Asian and Chinese investment trusts were all on the rise on Monday, while its US small company fund performed best, up by 3.7%. There were also rises for funds such as the Templeton Emerging Markets investment trust and Middlefield Canadian Income. Tourist hotspots With the pound lower, the UK instantly becomes a more desirable destination for tourists who traditionally find it expensive. That could spell short-term benefits for B&amp;B owners, hoteliers and restaurateurs in tourist hot-spots. However, a weaker British economy could depress domestic tourism at the same time. Stock investors aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly banking on an uplift for the major listed hoteliers, with IHG, Premier Inn owner Whitbread and Restaurant Group all trading lower.",

Against the euro, the pound was down 2.4% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.19.</p> <p>Speaking at the World Economic Forum in China, Nouriel Roubini, economist at New York University, described Brexit as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a major significant financial shock\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that would create \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a whole bunch of economic, financial, political and also geopolitical uncertainties\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>By the end of trading, the FTSE 100 index was down 2.6%, or 156.5 points, and below 6,000. The FTSE 250, the next tier of companies and more closely tied to the UK economy, was down 7%, coming on top of a 7% fall on Friday. </p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been another dramatic day of trading on the UK stock market,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at the financial firm Hargreaves Lansdown. </p> <p>Companies likely to be impacted by a Brexit-induced recession were hit hard. In two days, about \u00c2\u00a340bn has been wiped off the value of banking stocks and \u00c2\u00a38bn off housebuilders. At one point, shares in the bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland plunged 25%, while housebuilders such as Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey have lost more than 40% in just two trading days.</p> <p>Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said while Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement had been measured his comments \u00e2\u20ac\u0153were unable to prevent the feeling that UK politics remains in a state of paralysis, with no clear contingencies in place to deal with the fallout of a leave vote\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.</p> <p>The biggest faller in the FTSE 100 was short-haul airline easyjet, which plunged by 22% <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/27/foxtons-and-easyjet-issue-profits-warnings-eu-referendum\">after warning that wary consumers would now rethink their travel plans</a>. Exchange rate movements, the carrier added, would add \u00c2\u00a325m to costs.</p> <p>Another profit warning came from the London-focused estate agent Foxtons. Its shares dived 25% after it said Brexit would hit sales for the rest of the year. Shares in so-called challenger banks such as Virgin Money were also pummelled. </p> <p>Osborne spoke after it emerged that the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/26/market-turmoil-fears-likely-to-force-mark-carney-to-abandon-ecb-meeting\">cancelled a trip to Portugal</a> to remain in the UK to oversee any response from Threadneedle Street. </p> <p>The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial policy committee, set in the aftermath of the financial crisis to look for threats to stability, will meet on Tuesday, when the Bank of England will again offer emergency loans to banks as part of its Brexit planning.</p> <p>The fallout from the vote is being felt around the world. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main index fell 4%, extending Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record losses of 12.5%. In Germany and France there were losses of 3%. At the time of the London close, on Wall Street the main share indices were all down more than 1%.</p> <p>The chancellor may have taken some comfort from the fall in yields on 10-year government bonds. Yields on these gilts, which move inversely to prices, fell below 1% for the first time. This fall in gilt yields will keep government borrowing costs down and lead to lower mortgage rates. However, they also mean <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jun/27/annuities-hit-rates-fall-brexit\">pension companies have started cutting the amount paid to the newly retired</a>.</p> <p>Osborne refused to repeat his pre-vote warning of a Brexit recession, saying only that the economy would face \u00e2\u20ac\u0153adjustments\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But analysts started to cut their forecasts for UK growth.

                "bodyText":"The UK has been stripped of its last AAA rating as credit agency Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warned of the economic, fiscal and constitutional risks the country now faces as a result of the EU referendum result. The two-notch downgrade came with a warning that S&amp;P could slash its rating again. It described the result of the vote as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a seminal event\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lead to a less predictable stable and effective policy framework in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The agency added that the vote to remain in Scotland and Northern Ireland \u00e2\u20ac\u0153creates wider constitutional issues for the country as a whole\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That downgrade was swiftly followed by a cut to the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit score from rival agency Fitch. Intensifying the pressure on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s standing on international markets, Fitch cut the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rating to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAA+\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The UK had already lost its top rating with Fitch back in 2013. The agency had warned more recently that Brexit could prompt another cut and that it also risked sparking disharmony across the EU. S&amp;P was the last of the big three ratings agencies to have a blue-chip rating on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit-worthiness. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, which stripped the UK of its top notch rating amid the austerity cuts of 2013, said last week it might further cut its view of the UK. Rating agency moves have the potential to make it more expensive for the government to borrow. The moves form S&amp;P and Fitch came after another torrid day on the financial markets. The pound hit fresh 31-year lows and \u00c2\u00a340bn was wiped off the value of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest companies on Monday, despite efforts by George Osborne to quell investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 concerns about the economic and political ramifications of the Brexit vote. After three days of silence, the chancellor made a statement on Monday morning to try to calm the markets. However, sterling remained under sustained pressure on the foreign exchange markets as economists slashed their forecasts for UK economic growth. Wall Street was also weaker while continental bourses sold off sharply after Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record $2tn of losses on global stock markets. Expectations are mounting that the Bank of England will cut interest rates \u00e2\u20ac\u201c possibly to zero from their historic low 0.5% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to stimulate the economy, and yields on government bonds fell below 1% for the first time, which could spell cheaper mortgage rates. In a live broadcast just after 7am, as dealers in London braced for another day of turmoil, Osborne insisted: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our economy is about as strong as it could be to confront the challenge our country now faces.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But moderate losses on the FTSE 100quickly deepened and at one point sterling was down 3.5% against the dollar, at $1.3122, its lowest level since 1985. Against the euro, the pound was down 2.4% at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.19. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in China, Nouriel Roubini, economist at New York University, described Brexit as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a major significant financial shock\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that would create \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a whole bunch of economic, financial, political and also geopolitical uncertainties\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. By the end of trading, the FTSE 100 index was down 2.6%, or 156.5 points, and below 6,000. The FTSE 250, the next tier of companies and more closely tied to the UK economy, was down 7%, coming on top of a 7% fall on Friday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been another dramatic day of trading on the UK stock market,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at the financial firm Hargreaves Lansdown. Companies likely to be impacted by a Brexit-induced recession were hit hard. In two days, about \u00c2\u00a340bn has been wiped off the value of banking stocks and \u00c2\u00a38bn off housebuilders. At one point, shares in the bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland plunged 25%, while housebuilders such as Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey have lost more than 40% in just two trading days. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said while Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement had been measured his comments \u00e2\u20ac\u0153were unable to prevent the feeling that UK politics remains in a state of paralysis, with no clear contingencies in place to deal with the fallout of a leave vote\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The biggest faller in the FTSE 100 was short-haul airline easyjet, which plunged by 22% after warning that wary consumers would now rethink their travel plans. Exchange rate movements, the carrier added, would add \u00c2\u00a325m to costs. Another profit warning came from the London-focused estate agent Foxtons. Its shares dived 25% after it said Brexit would hit sales for the rest of the year. Shares in so-called challenger banks such as Virgin Money were also pummelled. Osborne spoke after it emerged that the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, had cancelled a trip to Portugal to remain in the UK to oversee any response from Threadneedle Street. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial policy committee, set in the aftermath of the financial crisis to look for threats to stability, will meet on Tuesday, when the Bank of England will again offer emergency loans to banks as part of its Brexit planning. The fallout from the vote is being felt around the world. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main index fell 4%, extending Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record losses of 12.5%. In Germany and France there were losses of 3%. At the time of the London close, on Wall Street the main share indices were all down more than 1%. The chancellor may have taken some comfort from the fall in yields on 10-year government bonds. Yields on these gilts, which move inversely to prices, fell below 1% for the first time. This fall in gilt yields will keep government borrowing costs down and lead to lower mortgage rates. However, they also mean pension companies have started cutting the amount paid to the newly retired. Osborne refused to repeat his pre-vote warning of a Brexit recession, saying only that the economy would face \u00e2\u20ac\u0153adjustments\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But analysts started to cut their forecasts for UK growth. Goldman Sachs, forecasts just 0.2% growth in 2017, down from 2% predicted previously. The consultancy Oxford Economics said interest rates could be slashed to 0% within weeks. Morgan Stanley analysts said European and UK stocks would fall up to 10% over the coming months and sterling would fall to between $1.25 and $1.30. Much of the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focus has been on the pound, particularly after the speculator George Soros, who made $1bn when sterling fell out of the exchange rate mechanism in 1992, had warned of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153black Friday\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the event of Brexit. His spokesman stressed that he had not bet against the pound last week. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153George Soros did not speculate against sterling while he was arguing for Britain to remain in the European Union,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the spokesman told Reuters. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, because of his generally bearish outlook on world markets, Mr Soros did profit from other investments.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd",

Lower immigration, and a fall in investment from overseas, will also hurt the economy, as could a weaker pound.</p> <p>Fitch adds that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future trade relationship with the EU is crucial:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Statements by UK and EU leaders will provide some guidance on the UK government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy objectives, the likelihood of achieving them and the timeframe for negotiation. However, Prime Minister David Cameron has indicated that negotiations with the EU will not begin in earnest until 4Q16, and the final position may well not be known for several years.</p> </blockquote> <p>And Fitch also fears that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit will be higher than previously expected, as weaker economic growth means lower tax revenues.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This implies that the general government debt ratio will continue rising over the forecast horizon, reaching 91% of GDP in 2017, compared with the debt ratio stabilising previously.</p> </blockquote> <p>And then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the political crisis raging in Westminster; Fitch says this is also bad for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit worthiness:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The outcome of the referendum has precipitated political upheaval, including the announced resignation of the Prime Minister, contributing to heightened uncertainty over government economic policies and diminished scope for policy implementation at the current conjuncture. </p> </blockquote> <p>And there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more.....</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Furthermore, the fact that a majority of voters in Scotland opted for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcRemain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 makes a second referendum on Scottish independence more probable in the short to medium term. The Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has indicated that a second referendum on Scottish independence is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153highly likely\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. A vote for independence would be negative for the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rating, as it would lead to a rise in the ratio of government debt/GDP, increase the size of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s external balance sheet and potentially generate uncertainty in the banking system, for example in the event of uncertainty over Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency arrangement.</p> </blockquote> <p>There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more here (if you can face it):</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FitchRatings/status/747521332078739457\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Fitch Downgrades the United Kingdom to &#39;AA&#39;; Outlook Negative <a href=\"https://t.co/mJBLc8agMj\">https://t.co/mJBLc8agMj</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/1B6J0hxhPs\">pic.twitter.com/1B6J0hxhPs</a></p>&mdash; Fitch Ratings (@FitchRatings) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FitchRatings/status/747521332078739457\">June 27, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5771876fe4b0be24d34f6805\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-27T20:08:09.280Z\">9.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FITCH DOWNGRADES UK</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating has just suffered a double blow, with the news that Fitch has also downgraded it to AA.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/dsmitheconomics/status/747521280832905217\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Now Fitch has downgraded the UK to AA too.

                "bodyText":"OK, time to wrap up for tonight. A quick reminder of the key points. Britain has lost its final gold-plated AAA rating, following Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to downgrade the country by two notches, to AA. S&amp;P warned that the Brexit vote will lead to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153less predictable, stable, and effective policy framework in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and hurt growth. Fitch, another major credit rating, has also downgraded Britain to AA tonight, from AA+. The moves came after another day of losses on the stock markets. The FTSE 100 index lost another 156 points, while medium-sized companies on the FTSE 250 fell by 6%. Banking shares suffered most, amid fears of a UK recession, with Royal Bank of Scotland plunging by 25% at one point. The pound hit a new 31-year low against the US dollar, despite chancellor George Osborne trying to calm the market panic over the EU referendum vote. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow with more live coverage of the market reaction to the ongoing Brexit crisis. Goodnight! Surely we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve suffered enough... Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Guardian front page focuses on the race to replace David Cameron as prime minister: Some more front pages to digest before the morning: The gloom gripping the City won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been helped by tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unmitigated shambles in the football: Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight sums it up: The credit rating of the UK economy may have been downgraded by 2 notches by Standard &amp; poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s this evening; the football team deserves to be cut to junk status. (PS: Well done Iceland) From New York, my colleague Sam Thielman reports on another bad day on Wall Street: US stock markets were rocked again on Monday by the aftershocks of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum decision to quit the European Union. Since the results became known on Thursday, the major US markets have suffered their biggest two-day fall in 10 months. Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dips came as the pound collapsed to its lowest point since 1985 and the UK lost its triple-A credit rating. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the day down 260 points, or 1.5%, the S&amp;P 500 dropped 1.8%, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq ended the day 2.5% down as the sell-off sparked by the Brexit vote in the UK continued to reverberate through the American market.... This is worth repeating... Fitch says it has downgraded Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating from AA+ to AA because the decision to leave the EU will have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a negative impact on the UK economy, public finances and political continuity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The rating agency warns that Britain faces an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153abrupt slowdown in short-term GDP growth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as businesses defer investment while tehy wonder how the Brexit vote will affect them. The agency says: Fitch has revised down its forecast for real GDP growth to 1.6% in 2016 (from 1.9%), 0.9% in 2017 and 0.9% in 2018 (both from 2.0% respectively), leaving the level of real GDP a cumulative 2.3% lower in 2018 than in its prior \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcRemain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 base case. Fitch also fears that medium-term growth will also likely be weaker, as Britain will find it harder to export to the EU. Lower immigration, and a fall in investment from overseas, will also hurt the economy, as could a weaker pound. Fitch adds that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future trade relationship with the EU is crucial: Statements by UK and EU leaders will provide some guidance on the UK government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy objectives, the likelihood of achieving them and the timeframe for negotiation. However, Prime Minister David Cameron has indicated that negotiations with the EU will not begin in earnest until 4Q16, and the final position may well not be known for several years. And Fitch also fears that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficit will be higher than previously expected, as weaker economic growth means lower tax revenues. This implies that the general government debt ratio will continue rising over the forecast horizon, reaching 91% of GDP in 2017, compared with the debt ratio stabilising previously. And then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the political crisis raging in Westminster; Fitch says this is also bad for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit worthiness: The outcome of the referendum has precipitated political upheaval, including the announced resignation of the Prime Minister, contributing to heightened uncertainty over government economic policies and diminished scope for policy implementation at the current conjuncture. And there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more..... Furthermore, the fact that a majority of voters in Scotland opted for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcRemain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 makes a second referendum on Scottish independence more probable in the short to medium term. The Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has indicated that a second referendum on Scottish independence is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153highly likely\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. A vote for independence would be negative for the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rating, as it would lead to a rise in the ratio of government debt/GDP, increase the size of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s external balance sheet and potentially generate uncertainty in the banking system, for example in the event of uncertainty over Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currency arrangement. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more here (if you can face it): Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating has just suffered a double blow, with the news that Fitch has also downgraded it to AA. More details to follow.... Take a deep breath, folks. Another day of market turmoil is over. Wall Street has closed, with the Dow Jones industrial average shedding 260 points, or 1.5%. Credit card firm American Express was the biggest faller on the Dow, down around 3.9%. Reuters reports that Wall Street has suffered its biggest two-day fall in 10 months, since the worries about China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowing economy. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit crisis is going to dominate tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s papers. The Financial Times\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 front page has just landed, focusing on the heavy losses on the stock markets and the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drop to a 31-year low. The FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economics editor, Chris Giles, says S&amp;P\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downgrade is a cause for serious concern: Shares are still falling in New York, with 30 minutes trading today. Financial stocks are among the big fallers, as in Europe today. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a really dramatic day in the financial world; here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our updated news story: The scale of S&amp;P\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downgrade tonight is unprecedented, says Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Jamie McGeever, showing the full impact of Brexit. Back in 2012, the LabourList website gathered together George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s various warnings about the need to keep the AAA rating. For example, in 2009, he declared: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have argued it with my opponents in difficult economic times, when I warned them last autumn that the cupboard was bare and the discretionary borrowing had to stop \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and now Britain faces the humiliating possibility of losing its international credit rating. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full list: Some things George Osborne has said about the AAA credit rating All good clean fun. But in the chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defense, he did warn the public not to vote for Brexit.... S&amp;P held back the downgrade until the London stock market had closed, so the City hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t had chance to react yet. But over in New York, shares are falling deeper into the red on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average has now shed 306 points, a fall of 1.75% today, on top of the 611 points shed during Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tumble. Former Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown fears that Britain will eventually have to pay more to borrow, due to S&amp;P\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downgrade: A lower credit rating would only affect the cost of new debt, of course, not the existing borrowing. Britain lost her top-notch credit rating almost exactly 12 hours after chancellor George Osborne claimed that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy was in decent shape to face the uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote. Here are the key reasons why S&amp;P took this historic move: In the nationwide referendum on the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s membership of the European Union (EU), the majority of the electorate voted to leave the EU. In our opinion, this outcome is a seminal event, and will lead to a less predictable, stable, and effective policy framework in the U.K. We have reassessed our view of the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s institutional assessment and now no longer consider it a strength in our assessment of the rating The downgrade also reflects the risks of a marked deterioration of external financing conditions in light of the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extremely elevated level of gross external financing requirements The vote for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Scotland and Northern Ireland also creates wider constitutional issues for the country as a whole. Consequently, we are lowering our long-term sovereign credit ratings on the U.K. by two notches to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAAA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The negative outlook reflects the risk to economic prospects, fiscal and external performance, and the role of sterling as a reserve currency, as well as risks to the constitutional and economic integrity of the U.K. if there is another referendum on Scottish independence. Corporate governance expert Lucy Marcus points out that some UK companies could now face higher borrowing costs, following S&amp;P\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because a company can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a higher credit rating than its own country [because sovereign states, and their central banks, are the lenders of last resort, in times of crisis] S&amp;P\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two-notch downgrade comes hot on the heels of Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, which downgraded the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outlook to negative on Friday night. Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Luke Baker points out that the agencies are moving with unusual speed: Losing the Triple-A credit rating might not have any immediate impact on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to borrow. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because worried investors have been keen to buy UK government bonds since the Brexit crisis erupted, driving borrowing costs down to record lows. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a humiliating moment for the government, which put \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrepairing the public finances\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 at the heart of its strategy (not always successfully). Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Fitch both downgraded the UK in 2013. S&amp;P maintained the AAA through the eurozone debt crisis, but has now lost the faith. S&amp;P is also concerned that the future of the United Kingdom itself is at risk. It says that the majority votes to remain within the EU from Scotland and Northern Ireland create \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wider constitutional issues for the country as a whole.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd S&amp;P really hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t held back -- this is a TWO-NOTCH downgrade, from AAA to AA, completely bypassing the AA+ rating. NEWSFLASH: Britain has just lost its last triple-A credit rating. Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has downgraded the UK to AA, with a negative outlook, following the EU referendum decision. S&amp;P blames the Brexit vote, saying it has weakened the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153predictability, stability and effectiveness\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of policymaking in the UK. It also believes that growth will be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsignificantly lower\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 between 2016 and 2019, with growth averaging just 1.1% per year. S&amp;P says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In our opinion, this outcome is a seminal event, and will lead to a less predictable, stable, and effective policy framework in the U.K. We have reassessed our view of the U.K.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s institutional assessment and now no longer consider it a strength in our assessment of the rating.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd S&amp;P also warns that foreign firms are less likely to invest in the UK, while sterling could also lose its role as a global reserve currency. Reaction to follow...... George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is well-positioned to ride out the crisis has been roundly dismissed by a former chief economist of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. The FT has the details: John Llewellyn, founder of Llewellyn consulting and a former chief economist of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, said the UK was heading into recession at a time when its economy was not fixed and the BoE appeared to be the only functioning authority. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are more worried \u00e2\u20ac\u201d for the UK, though importantly not for the world \u00e2\u20ac\u201d than we were in 2008 or any other post-World War Two crisis,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The scale of all this will start to unfold in coming weeks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Llewellyn is also worried about Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctwin deficit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 problem (the annual borrowing requirement, and the gap between imports and exports). Click on this tweet for more.... The FTSE 250 index, made up of 250 UK firms not big enough for the Footsie 100, has been through a torrid two days: The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc250 is seen as a better gauge of the domestic UK economy. So this is Not Good.... Speaking of Hargreaves Lansdown..... Banks and house builders have suffered particularly badly from the post-referendum selloff. Financial services group Hargreaves Lansdown says: Around \u00c2\u00a340 billion has been wiped off the value of banking stocks in the last two days, with over \u00c2\u00a38 billion wiped off house builders, representing around 18% and 37% of their total market capitalisation respectively. The effect of calming words from UK chancellor George Osborne early on Monday morning did not last very long, with investors bailing out of shares once again in the wake of the shock vote for the UK to leave the European Union, and the subsequent political chaos at the top of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two main parties. The FTSE 100 has now lost nearly \u00c2\u00a3100bn in the two trading days since the result of the vote, falling another 2.55% on Monday, while the more domestically focused FTSE 250 slumped nearly 7% during the day and hit its lowest level since 2014. The 250 is down 14% in two trading days. The pound has also been pummelled, falling to new 31 year lows against the dollar and dropping more than 2.4% against the euro. Airline shares fell after a warning from easyJet, banks were sliding across Europe on worries about the effect on their balance sheets of the possible economic fallout from Brexit, with the European banking index down 7.6%, while UK housebuilders were also undermined by the vote. But with investors seeking havens, gold and silver were in demand, with precious metal miners Randgold Resources and Fresnillo leading the risers in the FTSE 100. Dollar earning UK-listed companies such as AstraZeneca and Diageo also bucked the falling trend. The yield on UK ten year gilts fell below 1% for the first time, another sign of investors seeking secure homes for their cash. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: The pound and UK stocks have taken a hammering for a second consecutive trading day today, as investor sentiment continues to wane on the largely unknown consequences of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit result. As the pound continues to suffer, investors are fast seeking havens, yet with the Swiss (who intervened on Friday) and Japanese (who likely will in July) central banks likely to devalue, the US dollar index has surged to a three month high. What we really need is some form of decisive action, as financial markets seek reassurance that things will be OK. What we look likely to get is two months of political infighting, followed by another 20 months of uncertainty as the new leader somehow attempts to secure a deal which appeals to the many facets of the leave campaign. This will all take time and in the meanwhile, investors and businesses are left to ponder what the potential impact will be of this monumental decision. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 156.49 points or 2.55% to 5982.20 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 3.02% to 9268.66 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 1.86% at 4030.28 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 3.94% to 15,103.58 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 1.83% lower at 7645.5 In Greece, the Athens market lost 2.89% to 519.33 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 273 points or 1.58%. Ryan Sweet, director of real-time economics at Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Analytics, has been talking about the effect of Brexit on the US economy, writes Dominic Rushe: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit has created a significant amount of uncertainty and has unsettled financial markets. The three major channels are financial markets, confidence and trade. Financial markets pose the most significant and immediate threat to the US economy. US equities are likely going to have a rough few days.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expects the Brexit news to shave 0.1 of a percentage point off US GDP growth over the course of the next year but it shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have an appreciable impact on jobs or the unemployment rate. Over the long-term Sweet said a Brexit shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be significant drag on the US economy. We knew Friday was a turbulent day in the markets, and here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some data from Hargreaves Lansdown to back it up. The investment group said visits to its website on Friday surged to 636,061, up 50% on the previous highest daily record. It said investors spent the equivalent of 17 and a half year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s normal activity on its website in one day. And the majority of the deal were buys (possibly not looking so good today but hey, long term). The FTSE 100 has finished 156.49 points or 2.55% lower at 5982.20. However this is only the lowest level since 16 June, given the market bounce ahead of the referendum when everyone believed the Remain camp would win the day. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a useful little guide to some possible Brexit effects, courtesy of Open Europe: Another stab at where markets and sterling may go from here, from Morgan Stanley. In a weekend note (ie before today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s falls) it said: Our foreign exchange strategists believe that the pound will ultimately fall to \u00c2\u00a21.25-1.30. Our equity strategists believe that European and UK stocks may need to correct a further 7-10% over the next several months. While these adjustments may seem harsh in light of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s moves, we think they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re consistent with the uncertainty this vote has created. \u00c2\u00a21.25-1.30 for the pound would only begin to make the currency look cheap on a trade-weighted basis. A further 7-10% fall in UK and European stocks would simply bring forward multiples down to the long-run average. Both seem reasonable in light of increased uncertainty. The FTSE 250 may be slumping faster than the top 100 index, but this is not the full picture. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: The FTSE250 has borne the brunt of the sell-off in the UK market, dropping below its February lows, due to its heavier exposure to the UK economy, having fallen over 2,000 points in the last two days. In order to give some perspective though over a five year time frame the picture does look somewhat different, with the FTSE100 only up 6% in that period, while the FTSE250 is still up over 30%, well above levels seen in back in 2011 when it was trading around the 10,500 level. Elsewhere the banks are under pressure, and not just in the UK where Royal Bank of Scotland is currently down 15% and Barclays 17% lower. Hewson again: Deutsche Bank has once again hit new record lows while Italian banks have also remained under pressure, with Unicredit, Monti Dei Paschi and Popolare all down heavily at new all-time lows, as concerns about the huge amount of non-performing loans prompt new concerns about their solvency. Reports that the Italian government is weighing up measures that could add up to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac40bn into Italian lenders haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been enough to support the share prices, probably down to the fact that these banks have non-performing loans in excess of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac300bn. Spanish banks have also slid back despite initially opening higher after the weekend election saw Mariano Rajoy once again fall short of an overall majority, though his party did increase the number of seats from the vote in December. Cameron says the clear vote for Brexit must be respected. The Bank of England and Treasury will not hesitate to take further measures to stabilise financial markets if required, he says. David Cameron, who announced his decision to quit as UK prime minister in the wake of the referendum vote, is making a statement in the Commons on the vote. Follow it in our politics live blog from here. Over in the US, the latest service sector survey has come in weaker than expected. The provisional Markit service sector PMI for June was steady at 51.3 compared to May, but lower than the 52 level expected by analysts. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the difference between the FTSE 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses and its losses in dollar terms: Despite the turbulence in the markets since the referendum result, the City fears there could be more to come until the current situation is resolved. Russell Clifton, managing director of sales trading at broker Panmure Gordon said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is a perfect storm of uncertainty. Speaking to dealing desks, most of them are skewed to the sell side.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Not only is there the Brexit fallout, leaving the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two major parties in the midst of a leadership crisis, there is also the US election looming later in the year and the advent of summer, when trading volumes are thinner and market movements potentially more volatile as a result. Clifton also pointed out that since the financial crisis, banks propriety desks - big players in the market - have been far more cautious, with the result that buyers are fewer and liquidity in the market is less than it was. So far the FTSE 100 - down 2.3% at the moment after Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening fall - is outperforming the mid-cap FTSE 250 which has dropped 6.6%. The leading index is receiving some support from dollar earners and the fact it is a more global based index, whereas the FTSE 250 is predominantly domestic UK companies. Meanwhile Panmure Gordon chief economist Simon French suggested: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you want a clue where the market may go, in 2008 [financial crisis] there were six or seven days with more than 7% movements in dollar terms.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Alternatively sterling, which has been pummelled along with stock markets, could benefit from recovering its position as a currency haven. Despite talk of UK interest rate cuts adding to the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slide, French does not believe Mark Carney will cut borrowing costs further: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see the advantage in a rate cut since it will put more downward pressure on the pound.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Another Brexit profit warning, this time from recruitment group InterQuest. It said: In light of the uncertainty in the run up to the EU referendum, the company has experienced variable trading with clients delaying hiring decisions. The result of the referendum is now expected to prolong this period of uncertainty and, whilst it is too early to predict the longer term impact, the company expects trading conditions in the wider recruitment sector to remain challenging for at least the remainder of the current financial year. The company is somewhat protected from wider recruitment trends due to its focus on hard to find niche candidates in rapidly growing sectors in the new digital economy, but as a result of the wider market conditions, the company now expects that group net fee income and EBIT for the current financial year will be materially below market expectations. Its shares have slumped 28% to 78p. Time for a quick recap. Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial markets are being buffeted by fresh fears following Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to vote to leave the EU last Thursday. The pound has been driven down to a new 31-year low, hitting $1.3152 against the US dollar for the first time since 1985. The selloff was relentless, despite finance minister George Osborne telling the media at 7am London time that the UK economy could ride out the current storm. The London stock market has also been driven down by worries about the UK economy, and the relentless political infighting at Westminster. The FTSE 100 is currently down 119 points at 6019, which means it has lost over \u00c2\u00a380bn since the start of trading on Friday. The FTSE 250 index, which contains smaller companies, has shed 6% as investors raced to ditch stocks again. Bank shares are being hit very hard, with one fund manager saying there is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccapitulation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the financial sector. Royal Bank of Scotland fell 25% at one stage, meaning taxpayers had lost \u00c2\u00a38m on their stake. Barclays is down 15%. Some smaller banks, such as Virgin Money, have lost a quarter of their value today. Housebuilders and estate agents have been hit hard, too, after Foxtons issued a profit warning. Some building firms have lost 40% of their value since the referendum. While shares slumped, the prices of safe-haven government debt have hit record highs. That has driven down the interest rate on UK 10-year gilts to below 1% for the first time ever. City economists are gloomy today, with some forecasting a UK recession due to the uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote. Policymakers are scrambling to react to the unfolding drama in the markets. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has pulled out of a conference in Portugal, a move swiftly copied by US central bank chief Janet Yellen. Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s predecessor, Lord Mervyn King, has heavily criticised the UK government for its tactics during the referendum. He told the BBC that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you say to someone \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcyou\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re an idiot if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree with me\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not likely to bring them in your direction, Chancellor George Osborne has ditched one of his pre-referendum threats, to hold an emergency punishment budget. Osborne tried to sound reassuring this morning, saying: I said we had to fix the roof so that we were prepared for whatever the future held. Thank goodness we did. As a result, our economy is about as strong as it could be to confront the challenge our country now faces.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, the markets don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem terribly calm today.... The Dow is still falling.... Over in New York, the US stock market is falling at the start of trading. The Dow Jones index dropped by 148 points, or 0.85%, at the open, with Brexit still on everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mind. That follows big losses on Friday, when the Dow shed almost 600 points: Readers may have spent the weekend glued to the political crisis in Westminster, watching Euro 2016, or braving bouts of bad weather (we had hailstones in Oxford) to go shopping or tend the garden. But City economists didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have time for fun. They were locked away, slashing their UK growth forecasts, following the Brexit vote. Emily Cadman of the FT has helpfully rounded up the details: Phillip Shaw, chief UK economist at Investec, said he believed the economy would enter \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a period of near stagnation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding that a recession was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153realistic possibility\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Citi, which has yet to formally change its forecasts, warned that downgrades were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153likely\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Goldman Sachs is now expecting annual growth of just 0.2 per cent in 2017, down from 2 per cent before the referendum. George Buckley, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank, said he expected Brexit to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153focus minds\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest rate setting committee on the long-term impact of slower growth \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and a possible recession \u00e2\u20ac\u201d rather than a short-term rise in inflation. More here: City economists slash UK growth forecasts Larry Hatheway, chief economist at Swiss fund manager GAM, says investors are worrying that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy could soon start shrinking. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Against the backdrop of an already slowing UK economy, Brexit anxiety could precipitate a large enough reduction in consumer and business spending to tip the UK economy into recession.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to vote to Leave the European Union has forced investors to tear up some long-held beliefs. That includes the idea that major advanced European economies are safer than developing markets. Julian Mayo, Co-CIO of Charlemagne Capital, a fund manager, says the investors can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153with a straight face that emerging market assets are riskier. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The historical position that political risk is significantly higher in emerging markets (EM) than developed markets (DM) is comprehensively and possibly irreversibly blown out of the water, with implications for the relative pricing of assets. Even if we manage a reasonable renegotiation with angry Europeans, the vote gives massive encouragement for disaffected groups both in the EU and beyond, including separatist movements. Whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sturgeon, Le Pen, divisions in Spain and Italy, renewed stress within the Eurozone or the increasing possibility of a Trump win, pricing of risk across DM should surely rise. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Treasury secretary Jack Lew has urged investors to remain calm following the Brexit vote. In a CNBC interview, Lew said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there is an orderliness in the market reaction\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum. He argued that banks are in a better position to handle the fallout than in 2008 (when many had to be bailed out), but warned that there will be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153long period of change\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd now, as new headwinds hit the global economy. Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market is suffering a major selloff today. The Dublin bourse has shed 7.7% today, making it the worst-performing eurozone market. Mervyn King, who steered the Bank of England through the last financial crisis, has criticised the government for trying to scare the public during the election campaign. He was speaking to the BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Laura Kuenssberg: The FTSE 100 index has now shed 130 points today, on top of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 199 point losses. That means the index has lost \u00c2\u00a385bn since the referendum result, in a blow to small investors and pension funds. Investors are hammering the pound and the stock market because they have no real idea what the next plot twist in the astounding Brexit drama might be. Joshua Mahoney of spread-betting firm IG explains: For all of the statements of intent on both sides pre-referendum, it seems that much of it holds little basis in reality. First Farage admitted that the \u00c2\u00a3350 million weekly NHS funding claim was a mistake and now Osborne has stepped back from his pledge to impose an immediate emergency budget. The name of the game now is stability and for that reason Osborne is crucial despite his previous support for the remain camp. Amid all the calls for Corbyn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head and the clamour for the new PM role, financial markets are trying to ascertain what this will truly mean for the UK, the European Union and global stability. Many traders have concluded that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing industry is heading into a downturn, sending shares in builders and estate agents slumping (not helped by Foxton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit warning today) Ouch. The pound just hit $1.316, a new post-1985 low. Chris Saint, senior currency analyst at Hargeaves Lansdown, has warned that the pound could suffer large losses in the weeks ahead: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sea of red for sterling again this morning as investor sentiment continues to sour after the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote to leave the EU. The pound has slipped below \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.20 against the euro this morning for the first time in more than two years. It has also fallen to fresh lows under $1.32 against the US dollar \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the lowest level since 1985. Exchange rates will inevitably remain very volatile in the coming days and weeks as currency markets digest the far-reaching implications of the referendum result. Further significant losses for sterling aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t out of the question, especially if incoming data confirms the UK economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slowdown and lifts the likelihood of further Bank of England stimulus to support growth. This tweet from the FT shows how smaller UK companies have been hit extra-hard by Brexit. The purple line shows the FTSE 250 index, which has dropped more sharply than the FTSE 100 (which includes multinational companies who will benefit from the weak pound). Shares are hitting fresh lows after another wild morning in the markets. The FTSE 100 index of major blue-chip companies is now down 100 points, a loss of 1.6%. That follows a 199-point tumble on Friday. Easyjet has lost a fifth of its value, followed by Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays (both down over 15%), and building firms such as Taylor Wimpey, Persimmon and Barratt. And there are bigger losses among smaller UK companies. The FTSE 250 index, of medium-sized firms, has slid by 5% today. Small \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcchallenger\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 banks are being absolutely hammered, due to fears that the UK could be dragged into recession. Shawbrook, Onesavings and Virgin Money are all down over 20%. Royal Bank of Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are worth watching closely amid all the market turmoil, as the taxpayer still holds a big stake. Our City editor, Jill Treanor, explains: At their current level of 170p, the share are back at levels they last traded at during February 2009, when the banking crisis was in full swing. The break even price for the taxpayer is 502p, and the only stake sold by the government in August 2015 was at 330p. With any hopes of a further sell off of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stakes off the cards, analyst at Deutsche Bank said RBS was the most afffected by Brexit of all the big UK banks. The analysts point out that the sale of the 300-odd branches to be branded Williams &amp; Glyn - demanded by the EU at the time of the bailout - will be further delayed. And regulators are unlikely to sanction any distribution to shareholders. Bloomberg are reporting that Janet Yellen, head of the US Federal Reserve, is no longer appearing at a conference in Portugal this week. Yellen had been due to appear at the European Central Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sintra forum, alongside Mark Carney, Bank of England governor. Carney pulled out over the weekend, to focus on events in London. It may not be the biggest issue to come out of a Brexit, but some in the market are pondering how Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote will affect Sports Direct, the embattled sports goods retailer that operates a controversial warehouse in Derbyshire that is largely staffed by immigrant labour from eastern Europe. The most pressing issue for the company, seems to be the price of sterling, so today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selloff won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help. The group issued a statement on Friday stating that the currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153likely to impact purchases for which the company is currently not hedged for the FY17 period and beyond\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In plain English, that means it buys much of its stock from Asia and that is now going to cost it a lot more. This morning, the investment bank Goldman Sachs has downgraded the retailer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares to a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sell\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, reasoning: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We expect the combination of a demanding European apparel demand environment (notably in the UK post the EU referendum), gross margin pressure (currency driven) and elevated opex growth due to a one-off wage bill increase to drive a lower EPS base in FY17 and FY18 (FY16- 18E EPS 36.05p/30.78p/32.45p), despite the European football event this summer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. So that means investors being told to sell the sports chain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares by Goldman Sachs, which is an adviser to, er, Sports Direct. Brits should brace for higher inflation, unless the pound gets its breath back and recovers. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tumble in the pound, and the plunge in UK borrowing costs, indicate that investors expect interest rates to be cut to record lows. City analyst Louise Cooper says: The move in sterling cannot be purely viewed as a negative dire message - \u00e2\u20ac\u0153loss of faith in UK blah blah\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but also a realisation that interest rates will be cut by the Bank of England. Rate cuts tend to drive currencies lower. It is particularly dramatic as at the end of last year, Sterling was pricing in a rate increase. The pound has hit a two-year low against the euro, at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.2017. BOOM! The pound just hit a new 31-year low against the US dollar, as Brexit fears continue to grip the financial markets. Sterling slumped over 4 cents to $1.3220, a level last seen in 1985, beating last Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s low. George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to calm the markets are not preventing investors from piling out the pound. Investors are nervous because they have no idea when the UK might formally begin the process of exiting the European Union. Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, explains: The Prime Minister has stated that he intends to leave the task of triggering Article 50 to his successor and we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect him to go back on that at the European Council summit this week. That leaves sterling with no more visible means of support than it had on Friday. Historic times..... RBS and Barclays weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only major companies to be BRIEFLY suspended this morning: Important point. There are reports that trading in shares in Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland have been suspended due to the market panic. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not strictly correct. Both shares were temporary suspended, after triggering automatic pauses due to high volatility. But right now, RBS and Barclays shares are still changing hands -- down 14% and 10% respectively. The pound is continuing to lose ground..... After two hours of trading, the FTSE 100 index is down 71 points, or 1.1%, at 6067 points. Although that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chunky fall, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still higher than during the wild selloff on Friday morning. If trading ended now, it would be a one-week low. Sterling is weakening.... now down 3.5 cents, or 2.5%, at $1.3331 this morning. European banking shares are being pummelled hard by Brexit worries. The overall European banks index has shed 5.7% this morning, with Royal Bank of Scotland plunging by 15% and Barclays down 10%. Laura Foll, fund manager at Hendersons Global Investors, told Sky News that: There are a huge variety of worries, which is why we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing a bit of capitulation in financials. If the economy slows, interest rates will come down, which means further pressure on bank profit margins, she explains. And if the economy enters recession, banks could start to take losses on their loans. Signs of angst in the markets... The Osborn relief may be fading fast.... the FTSE 100 index is now down 80 points at 6060, its lowest point of the day. In another historic development, the interest rate on UK 10-year bonds has fallen to just 1%, for the first time ever. That means that worried investors are piling into \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsafe haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 government debt, in case the Brexit crisis worsens further. [The interest rate, or yield, on government bonds fall when prices rise] Cheap borrowing costs are usually a good thing; in this case, though, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign of how anxious the financial market are. My colleague Katie Allen says that the chancellor covered the right ground this morning, by insisting that the UK economy could survive the Brexit storm. However, the relief may not last for long.... In a classic British understatement, the chancellor opined: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It will not be plain sailing in the days ahead.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He also rowed back on the emergency budget he had threatened in the event of a leave vote. Now Osborne is saying the Treasury response to Brexit will not come until the autumn when the fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, has had a chance to assess the economy and a new prime minister is in place. In short, Osborne ticked a lot of boxes. So far the pound has steadied and theFTSE 100 is not down as sharply as it might have been. But the UK is facing a political crisis and an unprecedented process of untangling from the EU. The chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s soothing words are unlikely to provide anything but a short-term tonic to nervous households, businesses and investors. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our news story about George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to reassure the financial world today: It begins... George Osborne has sought to reassure financial markets by insisting Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is in a strong position to adjust to life outside the European Union. Breaking his silence in a statement at the Treasury, the chancellor said he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153did not resile\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from the dire predictions made during the referendum campaign that Brexit could plunge Britain into recession and cost hundreds of thousands of jobs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is inevitable, after Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote, that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is going to have to adjust to the new situation we find ourselves in,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. But in a phrase reminiscent of Gordon Brown\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s language in the early days of the 2008 crisis, he repeatedly insisted that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fundamentals\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the British economy were strong. Click here for more Sterling is also losing ground against the euro this morning, in another blow to UK holidaymakers. The pound has dropped 1.2%, or one and a half eurocents, to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.212. Back on referendum day, it was worth \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.30. City firms are scrambling to slash their forecasts for the pound, following the referendum result. Goldman Sachs now expects sterling to still be around $1.32 in three month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time, not $1.47 as previously expected. Bank of America Merrill Lynch now expects the pound to be worth just $1.30 at the end of 2016, compared to $1.59 before. Ana Thaker, market economist at PhillipCapital UK, thinks the chancellor has helped to stop a sterling rout - for the moment, anyway. She writes: Notably, the currency remained steady following George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech this morning that reassured markets that the Treasury had engaged with global central banks and financial institutions to arrange contingency plans. Moves in Sterling remains subject to any guidance from the government as to what the next stages may be with strong downside risk. Big fallers on the FTSE 250 this morning include many significant UK companies, such as challenger bank Virgin Money (-9%), recruitment firm Hays (-9%), engineering firm Balfour Beatty (-8%), online supermarket group Ocado (-7.9%) and building group Redrow (-7.7%). Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ed Conway agrees that the markets are calmed than feared. However, the FTSE 250 index \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which contains smaller UK firms \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is down 2% this morning. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a video clip of George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech, for those who missed it 90 minutes ago George Osborne has managed to reassure the City by joining those arguing for a delay before starting the formal process of leaving the EU. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explains: It seems that George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appearance this morning, his first since before the referendum results were announced, has somewhat calmed investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 fears, the Chancellor joining many of his Tory colleagues in claiming there is no rush to trigger the dreaded Article 50 despite increasing pressure from Europe. European stock markets are also calmer this morning, after George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appearance: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s never nice to see a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price tumble. But some people might make an exception for Foxtons, the notoriously aggressive London estate agent. Its shares have plunged by 20% this morning, after warning that Brexit uncertainty will hurt its profits. Foxtons floated on the stock market at 230p per share. They are now worth just 109p. Budget airline easyJet is leading the fallers on the stock market this morning, down 8% after its profit warning. But mining companies are rallying, along with UK companies who earn most of their money abroad (such as consumer goods group Unilever and pharmaceuticals firm Shire). Here are the main risers and fallers: The pound has recovered some of its early losses following Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement, but is still down against the US dollar. It is now trading around $1.345, a fall of 1.7% this morning - from $1.339 before the chancellor spoke. Shares in London are falling at the start of trading. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a smaller selloff than feared last night. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index has lost 40 points in first few minutes of trading, a fall of 0.6%. Housebuilders and banks are leading the fallers. Building firm Berkeley group has lost 8%, while Royal Bank of Scotland is down almost 6%. That takes the Footsie down to 6100 points. Overnight, the futures market had predicted that the FTSE 100 would fall by 2.8%. So perhaps George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appearance this morning has calmed the situation a little. British airline easyJet has also warned that profits will miss expectations. It blamed strike action by French air traffic controllers, runway and congestion issues at Gatwick airport and severe weather, as well as Brexit uncertainty. London estate agent Foxtons has issued a profits warning, after counting the cost of the Brexit vote. The company has warned the City that the uncertainty it was already suffering, due to the EU referendum, will continue for at least the next six months. Foxtons had been hoping that the market would pick up in the second half of this year. But Nic Budden, Foxton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO, has now told shareholders that conditions won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t improve for a while. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whilst we had a strong start to the year, we said in our Q1 update that we expected the first half to be challenging ahead of the EU referendum. Since then recent sales volumes have been slow as uncertainty and higher stamp duty has led many buyers and sellers to sit on their hands. The result of the referendum has increased uncertainty and is likely to mean that these trends continue for at least the remainder of the year. Tweet of the morning.... Aengus Collins of the Economist Intelligence Unit wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reassured by the chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments: City economist Sam Tombs disputes Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that the UK economy is in good shape to handle Brexit: Duncan Weldon of the Resolution Foundation says that Osborne is relying on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank to fight the crisis. Chancellor George Osborne is speaking now, outlining the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response to the Brexit crisis. He warns that it is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153inevitable that the UK economy will have to adjust\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but claims that the economy is as strong as it could be to face the challenges ahead. My colleague Heather Stewart is watching at the Treasury. Osborne says he favours delaying triggering Article 50 -- to start the process of leaving the EU \u00e2\u20ac\u201c until it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear what the terms would be. That might alarm EU leaders, who want Britain to exit the building sharpish. But it might calm the City, as it gives some breathing space for the political crisis raging in Britain to calm down. And he also indicates that there will NOT be an emergency \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpunishment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 budget to tackle the consequences of Brexit. Instead, action will be taken in the autumn (when a new prime minister will have been chosen). That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a u-turn from Osborne, who had threatened tax rises if Brits defied the government and voted to leave the EU. Q: Will there be a recession, chancellor, as you warned before the referendum? Osborne ducks the question, saying only that there will be an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcadjustment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122..... Our politics liveblog has full details: Sterling has begun the week with a serious bout of Monday morning blues. Heavy selling in Asia has pushed the pound down by almost three cents, or 2%, against the US dollar, to $1.3394 this morning. And there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no relief from City traders, who have now returned to their desks. The pound is now only 1.5 cents away a new 31-year low. Remember, it was trading around $1.45 in the run-up to the referendum. Kit Juckes, foreign affairs expert at Societe Generale, explains why the pound is so weak: With recriminations, two main parties in turmoil and nothing but questions and uncertainty as far as the eye can see. I see no reason to buy the dip. Investors are expecting shares in London to fall sharply at the start of trading, at 8am BST. IG, the spread-betting firm, is predicting that Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main stock markets will fall by around 2%: Good morning. After three of the most dramatic days of British political drama in living memory, the financial world is bracing for more turmoil this week. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to vote to leave the EU has left investors in a state of shock, and likely to send shares sliding across Europe again. Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp selloff, which wiped $2trillion off global markets, looks like the start of months of upheaval. Both UK major political parties are in a state of crisis \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with the Conservatives looking for a new prime minister, and some senior opposition Labour party members trying to force leader Jeremy Corbyn out. http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/corbyn-to-hold-crisis-talks-as-labour-mps-try-to-force-him-out So with uncertainty everywhere we look, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little reason for traders to pile into the pound either. So sterling could well head back towards 31-year lows this morning. Overnight, Chinese premier Li Keqiang has warned that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote to leave the European Union has increased uncertainly in the global economy. In London, chancellor George Osborne is about to deliver an emergency statement outlining the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response to the referendum vote. Mark Carney, Bank of England governor, has been due to attend an event in Portugal today. But that trip is off, with Carney staying in London - presumably to co-ordinate the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response to the crisis. The prospect of a new financial crisis is already alarming policymakers around the globe. Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF, has pointed out that markets were wrongfooted by the Brexit vote. But she also argues that the Bank of England et al have done the right thing: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But there was no panic and the central bankers did the job that they were prepared to do just in case, which was to put a lot of liquidity on the markets.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top finance official, Jack Lew, is due to give his take on the crisis later today. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tracking all the financial action through the day.....",

It said:</p> <blockquote> <p>The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to leave the European Union will be disruptive for US global banks with significant operations in the UK and will weigh on their profitability in the short to medium term, Fitch Ratings says.

Resolution planning for US global systemically important banks was constructive for their Brexit contingency planning because of the requirement to rationalize and understand their global legal entity structure and activities.<br></p> <p>Restructuring operations will depend on license status in various jurisdictions, as well as establishing operational scale, potentially reallocating capital and relocating where trades and clients are booked. Relocation of staff is likely to follow; for example, ahead of the referendum, JP Morgan had announced that as many as 4,000 of its UK roles could be shifted out of the country.<br></p> <p>Management will have to decide where to focus its European operations, depending on language requirements, staff expertise and incentives offered by these countries.

It is unlikely to have any immediate implications for Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereign rating in the near term, but a medium-term rating impact would be possible if the economic dislocation of Brexit were to prove severe.</p> <p>Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is highly exposed to Brexit. According to the Central Statistics Office (CSO), the UK accounted for 12.6% of Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total goods exports in January-April 2016, and 24% of total goods imports. The UK also accounted for 20% of total services exports in 2014. Total goods and services exports to the UK are equivalent to around 17% of GDP. There could be significant sector-specific fall out. For example, the UK accounts for 49% of Irish agricultural exports.</p> <p>A UK slowdown, sterling depreciation and potential future trade barriers between Ireland and the UK would weigh on Irish exports, economic growth and employment; although the full impact will only become clear as EU-UK negotiations develop. We think the most important near-term impact will be through reduced domestic confidence.</p> <p>In the medium term, Ireland could gain from a shift of some foreign direct investment from the UK to the EU or from international businesses relocating from the UK, but this is highly uncertain.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Fitch also warns that political tensions between the Republic and Northern Ireland could rise (on Saturday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/26/northern-ireland-republic-peace-brexit-border\">Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Martin McGuinness, deputy first minister for Northern Ireland, called for a poll on reunification</a>)</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Brexit would represent a symbolic moving apart of the UK and Ireland that could weaken confidence in the peace process in Northern Ireland and potentially impair cross-border relations and trade.</p> <p>Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minority government, which was formed in May after February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inconclusive election, has outlined its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcContingency Framework\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that will guide its policy response. This identifies priorities including UK-EU negotiations, UK-Irish relations, trade and investment, and Northern Ireland. It remains to be seen how effective this will be, and some domestic political uncertainty persists given the relatively loose agreement between Fine Gael and Fianna Fail.</p> <p>Lower economic growth would reduce the tax intake, reducing the medium-term fiscal space that the government identified in its recent Summer Economic Statement. Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commitment to fiscal consolidation during and after its EU-IMF programme leads us to think an increase in fiscal risks would be met with a policy response to continue meeting fiscal targets and limiting the impact on public debt dynamics.</p> <p>Our upgrade of Ireland to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcA-\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in February reflected the marked fall in government debt to 93.8% of GDP in 2015 from 120% in 2013 driven by strong and broad-based growth and fiscal consolidation.

                "bodyText":"The volatility suffered by stock markets in recent days is unlikely to ease in the near future. The day saw a rebound following the sharp declines which came in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote, but the City is reluctant to bet too strongly on where markets go from here. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: It would be premature to call the bottom of the market, prices are still adjusting to the post-Brexit world, and it would be foolhardy to rule out further price swings. The bounce in the Footsie does show there are buyers out there who are swooping in when prices fall sufficiently, but markets neither go up, or down, in a straight line, and things may yet have to get worse before they get better. Valuations on the UK stock market look in the middle of their historical range, which suggests it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reasonable time to put money in the market if you are a long term investor. But given the current volatility, you need to be willing to stomach further price falls, if you are dipping a toe in. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 2.64% or 158.19 points at 6140.39 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax added 1.93% to 9447.28 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed 2.61% higher at 4088.85 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB rose 3.3% to 15601.62 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 2.48% at 7835.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 3.72% to 538.65 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 148 points or 0.87%. As for the pound, it is now up 0.9% at $1.3342 after climbing as high as $1.3418. Against the euro it is 0.68% higher at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.2075. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close up for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. ECB president Mario Draghi has said Brexit could reduce European GDP by up to 0.5 percentage points, according to a document seen by Bloomberg. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full Reuters report on the meeting between business leaders and government minister Sajid Javid: Britain appears a long way from developing a clear plan on the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future trading relationship with the European Union, the head of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said on Tuesday after a meeting with government. CBI Director-General Carolyn Fairbairn said some firms were putting investment on hold after Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote to leave the EU last week, and that they needed a clearer sense of what the government intended to do. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s incredibly early days. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think anybody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coming out of these meetings feeling great, but they are coming out with a sense of resolve,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she told reporters. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a long way off having a plan and leadership and that is still where we will be continuing to make (the point) that this is what businesses need,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she added. Fairbairn said businesses expressed very high levels of real and genuine concern to business minister Sajid Javid, who had called the meeting, and that the government also needed to address the fears of EU migrants employed in Britain. At the meeting between business leaders and the government, there were high levels of real concern following the Brexit vote according to the CBI. Reuters reports the CBI saying that the government needed to develop a plan on the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading relationship with the EU very quickly. Businesses also wanted the government to get on with major infrastructure projects which are already underway. There were also concerns about rising prices, housing, and the insecurity being felt by migrant workers in the UK. The CBI director general said a number of firms had put investment on hold, said Reuters, and said the meeting did not feel great but there was a sense of resolve. After two days of panic leading shares have regained a little of the lost ground. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Today has seen a welcome reprieve from the incessant fear and risk aversion that has dominated financial markets since Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unexpected referendum result. The question on everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lips is whether we have seen an end to the selling, with many seeing current prices as an opportunity to buy their favourite firms at a temporary discount. [But] this selloff is unlikely to be over and perhaps the only thing that will truly raise risk appetite for good will be a faint glimmer of hope that we could see a second referendum. Despite the binary nature of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum result, far from providing a definitive answer to the markets, we now find ourselves in the eye of a political and economic storm. We have moved from a position of security and stability, to one where we do not even know who will lead the two main political parties in a year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. David Cameron may have said that there is no way to go back on the referendum result, but Jeremy Hunt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suggestion that he would hold a second referendum reminds us that crucially the decision is no longer Cameron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to make. UK business secretary Sajid Javid says maintaining single market access will be his number one priority in negotiations with the EU. He says British access to the single market may not take the same form as other non-EU countries. He says the UK economy remains strong and over the past few days investors have reaffirmed their commitment to the UK. Javid also said that a package of support for a potential buyer of the Port Talbot steel works was still available. US banks with significant UK operations are likely to act sooner rather than later to shift their operations, according to ratings agency Fitch. It said: The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to leave the European Union will be disruptive for US global banks with significant operations in the UK and will weigh on their profitability in the short to medium term, Fitch Ratings says. However, the impact is likely to be moderate as we believe they will be able to operate through other EU legal entities. US global banks are likely to start strategically implementing parts of their contingency plans rather than wait for trade and service arrangements to be agreed. Resolution planning for US global systemically important banks was constructive for their Brexit contingency planning because of the requirement to rationalize and understand their global legal entity structure and activities. Restructuring operations will depend on license status in various jurisdictions, as well as establishing operational scale, potentially reallocating capital and relocating where trades and clients are booked. Relocation of staff is likely to follow; for example, ahead of the referendum, JP Morgan had announced that as many as 4,000 of its UK roles could be shifted out of the country. Management will have to decide where to focus its European operations, depending on language requirements, staff expertise and incentives offered by these countries. Flexible labor laws will be important for US firms, so this may favor countries like Ireland and the Netherlands, rather than Germany and France. After cutting the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating from AAA to AA, Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has said it had no plans to downgrade any other EU country in the wake of the Brexit vote. But it said it would decide whether any UK bank ratings should be cut in the coming weeks. Reuters reports: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This does not lead to mechanical changes (in bank ratings),\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd S&amp;P banking sector analyst Giles Edwards said on a webcast. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But equally this (Brexit scenario) was not our base case... where we see a need to change ratings we will do so in the coming weeks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd On other EU sovereign ratings, S&amp;P\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global sovereign chief Moritz Kraemer said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have no intention of downgrading any other EU sovereign.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd S&amp;P chopped the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating by two notches to AA and kept it on a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnegative outlook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on Monday in the wake of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote to leave the European Union. It was the first time it had ever made such a deep cut to a top-rated sovereign. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a link to video of Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras arriving earlier at the European Council, warning the Brexit vote was a wake up call for Europe: More Brexit fallout. Siemens is putting new wind power investment plans in the UK on hold due to uncertainty caused by last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote, the Germany energy company has told the Guardian. Arthur Neslen reports: A \u00c2\u00a3310m manufacturing hub in Hull that employs 1,000 people will not be affected by the decision, and should still begin producing blades and assembling turbines next year. But Siemens, one of the few firms to openly back a Remain vote, will not be making new investments until the future of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relationship with Europe becomes clearer. Juergen Maier, the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK CEO, said that an existing blueprint to export offshore wind turbine machinery from the Hull hub was now up in the air. Sign up to our EU referendum morning briefing Read more He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Those plans were only beginning to happen and I expect that they will stall until we can work out exactly what the [new government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] plan is, how we can participate in EU research programmes, and until all the issues around tariffs and trade have been sorted out.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The full report is here: After higher than forecast US GDP figures, comes a better than expected consumer confidence number. According to the conference board, the consumer confidence index came in at 98 in June, compared to 92.4 in the previous month and an expected 93.3. (This was before the outcome of the UK referendum of course.) But there was a weaker manufacturing survey from the Richmond Federal Reserve: Earlier UK chancellor George Osborne suggested taxes would have to go up to address the economic damage caused by Brexit. So what taxes would they be? VAT could be one, according to tax specialists at Eversheds. The law firms partner Ben Jones said: If tax rises are required, ironically VAT (the only real European tax and a prerequisite for EU membership) could be the tax most likely to increase. VAT is a huge source of tax revenue and relatively easy to increase, both practically and politically. Indeed, during the financial crisis of 2008 and after, VAT was increased from 17.5% to 20% as part of measures to tackle the fiscal deficit. Increases to income taxes, national insurance contributions or business taxes would most likely be far more publically unpopular and politically undesirable. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Greek prime minister on the lesson from Brexit as he arrives at the European Council: Back with the European parliament: In tandem with other global markets, which have recovered a small part of the hefty declines seen in the wake of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote, the US has moved higher in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average - down almost 900 points since the referendum outcome - has gained 144 points or 0.8% as bargain hunters dip their toes into the market. The S&amp;P 500 has opened up 0.7% and Nasdaq 1.1%. Representatives of several industries are due to meet business minister Sajid Javid MP this afternoon for a summit on the potential impact of the Brexit vote on UK firms, writes Rob Davies. Food and Drink Federation director general Ian Wright will warn Javid that the industry faces a huge staffing shortfall if EU citizens are blocked from working in the UK. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK food industry has almost 100,000 workers from the rest of the EU. We have an emerging gap of up to a further 130,000 workers as our ageing staff retire over the next decade,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said in a prepared statement. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While we as an industry continue to take many steps to develop home-grown talent through ambitious graduate and apprenticeship programmes, EU workers also provide a highly valued solution to our skills gap. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK food industry benefits from bringing in skilled labour from the EU and we urgently need assurances from UK Government that EU nationals working in the UK will be granted leave to remain. UK Government must now develop a new migration policy that ensures food and drink manufacturers have continued access to the workers we will need to address a looming skills gap and the drive for future innovation to support our UK competitive advantage.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a video of Richard Branson discussing his Brexit concerns on Good Morning Britain: Lloyds Banking Group is the latest to try and reassure on the consequences of Brexit, following rival Royal Bank of Scotland earlier. Lloyds chief executive Antonio Horta Osorio has written to staff telling them the bank had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153robust plans in place for either outcome\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, according to Reuters. He said its strategy would remain unchanged and its low risk lending approach and historic brands put it in a position of strength to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153weather turbulence in our sector and the wider market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pound is accelerating higher. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now gained almost two cents to $1.341, a jump of 1.5% today. Shares in London are also pushing higher, as the City recovers some poise following two days of Brexit panic. The FTSE 100 index is now up 175 points, or almost 3%, at 6157. That means it has clawed back ALL of Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. Investors are piling back into financial stocks, perhaps reassured that banks only took \u00c2\u00a33bn in liquidity from the Bank of England this morning Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: The main change from yesterday to today seems to be the performance of the banks. Accepting around \u00c2\u00a33 billion in a Bank of England liquidity auction this morning, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking sector is looking a bit rosier after having the colour completely drain from its face at the start of the week. Barclay, Lloyds and RBS are the key stocks here; the trio suffered the most in the aftermath of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit announcement, diving up to 30% in the last 2 days of trading. Today, however, they have risen anywhere between 4% and 6%; a long way off from recapturing all of their losses, but a start nevertheless. But given the political turmoil in the UK, and the uncertainty over when (or indeed ever?) Britain will trigger Article 50, there may be more volatility ahead.... Newsflash from America: The US economy grew faster than expected in the first three months of this year, in some much-needed good news. US GDP grew at an annual rate of 1.1%, a little faster than expected, and means a quarterly rate of almost 0.3%, It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up from a previous forecast of just 0.8% annualised growth (or 0.2% quarter on quarter). Over in Brussels, European leaders are gathering for a summit dominated by Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit bombshell. Prime minister David Cameron just arrived, telling reporters outside that he is seeking the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153closest possible relationship\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd between the UK and the EU. He also insists that the leaving process must be constructive; European countries are still our friends, our neighbours and our allies. Cameron was followed into the EU headquarters by Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, who had a scathing verdict on the UK: Our Politics liveblog will be tracking the action in Brussels: After two days of heavy falls, Wall Street is expected to rally today. Trading begins in 90 minutes. Ireland isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only European country which would suffer from Brexit. Fitch says that: The most exposed countries are Ireland, Malta, Belgium, the Netherlands, Cyprus and Luxembourg, all of whose exports of goods and services to the UK are at least 8% of GDP. And if Britain does well outside the EU, other member states could follow, Fitch adds... Brexit will create a precedent for a country leaving the EU and we believe it increases political risk in several ways. It could boost anti-EU or other populist political parties, and make EU leaders more reluctant to implement unpopular policies that would have long-term economic benefits. Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance minister, Michael Noonan, says he hopes that the Republic can avoid being hurt by Brexit..... Rating agency Fitch has issued a warning that the Republic of Ireland could be downgraded because of the economic cost of Britain leaving the EU. It warns that Ireland is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchighly exposed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to the UK economy, given the strong trade links, so any Brexit slowdown could have a serious impact. However, the Irish credit rating is probably safe in the short term, at least. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full statement: The UK vote to leave the European Union is negative for Ireland, raising risks to growth and creating uncertainty around future relations with Northern Ireland, Fitch Ratings says. It is unlikely to have any immediate implications for Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereign rating in the near term, but a medium-term rating impact would be possible if the economic dislocation of Brexit were to prove severe. Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is highly exposed to Brexit. According to the Central Statistics Office (CSO), the UK accounted for 12.6% of Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total goods exports in January-April 2016, and 24% of total goods imports. The UK also accounted for 20% of total services exports in 2014. Total goods and services exports to the UK are equivalent to around 17% of GDP. There could be significant sector-specific fall out. For example, the UK accounts for 49% of Irish agricultural exports. A UK slowdown, sterling depreciation and potential future trade barriers between Ireland and the UK would weigh on Irish exports, economic growth and employment; although the full impact will only become clear as EU-UK negotiations develop. We think the most important near-term impact will be through reduced domestic confidence. In the medium term, Ireland could gain from a shift of some foreign direct investment from the UK to the EU or from international businesses relocating from the UK, but this is highly uncertain. Fitch also warns that political tensions between the Republic and Northern Ireland could rise (on Saturday, Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Martin McGuinness, deputy first minister for Northern Ireland, called for a poll on reunification) Brexit would represent a symbolic moving apart of the UK and Ireland that could weaken confidence in the peace process in Northern Ireland and potentially impair cross-border relations and trade. Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minority government, which was formed in May after February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inconclusive election, has outlined its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcContingency Framework\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that will guide its policy response. This identifies priorities including UK-EU negotiations, UK-Irish relations, trade and investment, and Northern Ireland. It remains to be seen how effective this will be, and some domestic political uncertainty persists given the relatively loose agreement between Fine Gael and Fianna Fail. Lower economic growth would reduce the tax intake, reducing the medium-term fiscal space that the government identified in its recent Summer Economic Statement. Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commitment to fiscal consolidation during and after its EU-IMF programme leads us to think an increase in fiscal risks would be met with a policy response to continue meeting fiscal targets and limiting the impact on public debt dynamics. Our upgrade of Ireland to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcA-\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in February reflected the marked fall in government debt to 93.8% of GDP in 2015 from 120% in 2013 driven by strong and broad-based growth and fiscal consolidation. While negative, Brexit is unlikely to undermine the progress that Ireland has made in these areas. Fitch expects debt/GDP to fall in the medium term, helped in part by lower nominal interest rates. The pound is clinging onto its early gains this morning, as stability returns to the City. Sterling is still up around 1.1 cents today, at $1.3334 against the US dollar. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still close to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 31-year low, and a long way from the pre-referendum levels: Caxton FX analyst Nicholas Laser-Ebisch warns that sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t over: Today will see the very first EU summit where leaders of all of the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 28 member states will meet in Brussels for a first exchange about the British referendum and the consequences involved. We can expect the pound to remain under pressure for the time being as markets come to terms with the result of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum vote. Stephen King, HSBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, also sees the pound falling: Newsflash: UK banks have taken \u00c2\u00a33bn of liquidity from the Bank of England in a special auction. That money is meant to help them handle the repercussions of the Brexit vote last week. This is the third such auction - last week, banks only took \u00c2\u00a3370m, and the previous week they took \u00c2\u00a32.4bn. If there were massive stresses in the City now, presumably banks would have asked for rather more money. The BoE says that it received bids for over \u00c2\u00a36bn, but banks were offering relatively low-quality assets as collateral, so many bids were turned down. Virgin tycoon Sir Richard Branson has warned that Chinese business partners are already pulling investment from the UK after the EU referendum. Speaking to The Guardian, he warned that last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s historic vote will cost \u00e2\u20ac\u0153thousands of jobs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Branson told my colleague Rob Davies that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I met with a group of Chinese businessmen yesterday morning who have invested heavily in England and who are now going to stop investing and withdraw investments they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already made.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m afraid that based on misinformation, people voted for Brexit, which is basically voting for a way of shooting themselves in the foot. The last 2 days has been absolute pandemonium worldwide in the markets, the pound crashing, the stock markets crashing, and we are heading rapidly towards a recession again. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just too sad, so so sad. Branson also laid into the Leave campaign for misleading voters during the referendum campaign, saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153thousands and thousands\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of workers will pay the price. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Businesspeople do not want politicians to completely and utterly wreck the hard work they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done for years and years and that is effectively what happened. Thousands and thousands of jobs will be lost as a result of this. Thousands of jobs that would have been created will be lost and the knock-on effect will be so dire. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The sad thing is I really think Brexiters were misled and did not realise. People said it was scaremongering. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t scaremongering and the last 48 hours have proved that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As mentioned at 8.50am, Branson is pushing for a second referendum vote. Branson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Virgin Money challenger bank has been badly hit by the referendum result, with shares tumbling by 40% since Friday morning. The boss of Royal Bank of Scotland has written to staff, warning that the EU referendum decision has created \u00e2\u20ac\u0153short, medium and longterm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd economic uncertainties, according to Reuters. New Zealand-born Ross McEwan told staff that RBS was well-prepared, and also urged them to support diversity in the workplace: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As someone born outside the UK, I see one of this country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest strengths as its openness to the rest of the world, and the people of it. As a major employer and backer of the economy we have a duty to ensure that we reflect that.. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The diversity of those who make up this bank at every level is key to our success. In uncertain times I want to ensure that everyone understands that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shares in RBS have risen by 3% this morning, but are still down by roughly a quarter since the referendum polls closed. At 180p, they are far from the 502p level where the taxpayer would sell its 72% stake without making a loss. George Osborne has also ruled himself out of becoming the next prime minister. There has been speculation that he could back Leave campaigner Boris Johnson, perhaps in return for becoming foreign secretary. Home secretary Theresa May is also seen as a frontrunner, though. Chancellor George Osborne has predicted more market turbulence, as Britain faces up to life outside the European Union. Speaking on Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today programme this morning, he said: We are in a prolonged period of economic adjustment \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it will not be as economically rosy as life inside the EU. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very clear that the country is going to be poorer as a result of what is happening to the economy. Osborne also warned that Britain faces higher taxes, and lower spending, to address the economic damage caused by the Brexit vote. Our Politics Liveblog has full details: Two major British companies, engine maker Rolls-Royce and the insurer Legal &amp; General, have tried to shareholders that the UK referendum result won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sink their operations. Rolls-Royce told the City this morning that its outlook is unchanged, while L&amp;G argues that the long-term trends in insurance are unchanged.... Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial newspaper, Handelsblatt, is predicting a surge of banking jobs into Frankfurt from the City. Online grocer Ocado has warned that the recent slump in sterling is likely to sent supermarket prices soaring. Chief executive Tim Steiner said the weaker pound may lead to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153inflationary pressure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but also told shareholders that he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe Brexit will cause a sudden crash in the UK retail market. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, predicts that inflation will hit 3% next year, over the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because it will cost more to import goods from abroad. Kit Juckes, currency expert at French bank Societe Generale, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed by the pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s small rally this morning (to $1.335 from $1.32 last night) He is still worried about the political vacuum in Britain: Markets are bouncing, and can bounce further but the clouds on the horizon are dark, and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re real. Sterling can bounce to $1.35 for example- but the UK has no Government and no plan for the future. Billionaire businessman Sir Richard Branson has called for a second EU referendum this morning. Speaking on ITV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Good Morning Britain, he also revealed that his Virgin Money operation has abandoned a deal, since Britain voted for Brexit.... Is a second referendum possible? Well, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not unprecedented in European politics. And this morning, government minister Jeremy Hunt suggested that the next Prime Minister must be allowed to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153negotiate a deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with Brussels and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153put it to the British people\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by either calling a general election or having another referendum. However, Brexit supporters are unlikely to welcome the idea of a rerun... One rally doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean the Brexit crisis is over, remember.... It may seem curious that shares in London are rising, hours after Britain lost its AAA credit rating. But Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, reckons S&amp;P\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downgrade may actually be encouraging investors back into the market. It still seems as if we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a long way from the dust settling, but the FTSE-100 is starting Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s session with a triple digit bounce. Yes we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen three ratings downgrades for the UK overnight, but taking a glass-half-full perspective, this also means that just a little of the uncertainty is starting to ebb away. Some stocks have taken a while to clear the auction, but this is a case of bargain hunters clamouring to get in. And there could be bargains on the table, if you think Brexit won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cause economic mayhem. Take housebuilder Persimmon, for example. Its shares are up 7% at \u00c2\u00a314.07. Last Thursday, they cost \u00c2\u00a321 each.... The French and German stock markets are also up by around 2% this morning, matching the recovery in London. European stock markets are rallying at the start of trading, after two days of big falls. In London, the FTSE 100 has jumped by 125 points, or around 2%, to 6,109 - recovering some of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. Every share has risen, led by builders \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who endured the brunt of the Brexit backlash. Mike van Dulken and Augustin Eden at Accendo Markets reckon that the markets may be calming down, pointing to the small recovery in the pound overnight. Sterling is strengthening for the first time since Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprise referendum result on hopes policymakers are working to limit the economic fallout Over in Asia, governments are considering whether to launch new stimulus packages to protect their firms from the consequences of Brexit. From Toyko, Justin McCurry explains: Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy minister, Nobuteru Ishihara, said on Tuesday that stimulus measures were likely to include assistance for small businesses. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are concerns about lessening the impact of the British referendum on Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s small and medium-sized companies,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ishihara said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Taking steps to provide liquidity to small firms could be a big factor in economic stimulus steps that we compile.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Brexit shock has left UK companies worried about losing sales from overseas clients. Our North of England editor, Helen Pidd, flags up that one small business is already seeing demand dry up: After two days of intense pummelling, the British pound is clambering off the mat this morning. Sterling has gained almost one cent against the US dollar so far today, to $1.3303. Yesterday it hit a 30-year low of $1.3118, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a small recovery (given the pound was worth $1.45 last week). Global stock markets have suffered their biggest two-day rout ever, thanks to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock decision to vote to leave the EU. Yesterday, $930bn was wiped off the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets, in a fresh bout of selling. That followed the rout on Friday, which destroyed $2.03 trillion of value. Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, explains that American investors are increasingly worried about the crisis, and its impact on their economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Friday was seen as a U.K. \u00e2\u20ac\u201c E.U. problem, with the U.S suffering some damage on the side lines \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global declines paint a more involved U.S. participation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The bottom-line is we may still be in the knee-jerk reaction phase, but continued deterioration can feed on itself.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd S&amp;P\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Global Broad Market index, known as the BMI, has fallen almost 6.9% since Thursday night, its biggest loss in cash terms ever. The scale of the loses shows how unprepared investors were for the Leave campaign\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprise victory in the early hours of Friday morning. In Britain, the FTSE 100 has fallen by over 5% over the last two days, with bank shares sliding to their lowest levels since the 2008 financial crisis. America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s S&amp;P 500 index, the broadest stock index, has lost 5.37% -- in its worst two-day decline since last August. Good morning. Like the average England football fan this morning, the financial markets are in a gloomy and dejected mood. The shock of seeing the UK vote to leave the European Union last week continues to reverberate around the global economy, with economists fearing that global growth will take a hit. Last night, Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Fitch both downgraded Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating to AA, two notches below the top AAA rating, warning that growth will be significantly weaker than previously expected. That only adds to worries about the UK economy, which have sent shares in banks and building companies reeling since Friday morning. After two days of heavy falls, European stock markets are expected to claw back some losses this morning. The FTSE 100 is predicted to rise by around 1%. But investors should be cautious in the current climate; there is just too much uncertainty around The Bank of England is doing its bit to stem the crisis. Later today it will offer UK banks the chance to stock up on liquidity to help them through the Brexit crisis, in a special liquidity auction. That will show how worried the City is about financial conditions. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be a busy day in politics too, with David Cameron slinking off to Brussels to face fellow leaders for the first time since his referendum gamble backfired - taking his career with it. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll leave behind a cabinet full of scheming ministers, wondering who might become the next prime minister. But the opposition Labour party is doing its best to match the Tories in the shambles stakes, with scores of MPs trying to dislodge their leader. Jeremy Corbyn is gripping his seat tightly, though, and promising to go nowhere. Our Politics Liveblog will have all the action in Westminster and Brussels:",

This compares with an annual growth rate of 4.7% in May. It has been fairly stable over the past 12 months at between 3% and 6%.</p> <p>The data gives a snapshot of the housing market immediately before the EU referendum. </p> <p>Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Following the referendum, demand likely will weaken as unemployment begins to edge up and confidence falls. Meanwhile, banks soon will reflect the recent increase in funding costs in their mortgage rates. Prices in London look particularly vulnerable, given that job insecurity has increased in the City and banks will be thinking twice about high loan-to-income lending.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Foxtons, the London-focused estate agent, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/27/foxtons-and-easyjet-issue-profits-warnings-eu-referendum\">issued a profit warning</a> this week. It believes the vote to leave the EU will limit property sales in the capital for the rest of the year.</p> <p>Jonathan Hopper, the managing director of buying agents Garrington Property Finders, said the brisk pace in June was likely to be the high water mark for the property market for some time. The data<strong> </strong>showed a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153functioning market with decent price growth but limited supply \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a languid calm before the storm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he added.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unfortunately this data is about as much use in predicting the future course of the property market as sun-dappled photos of the summer of 1914. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a historical record of a lost age before Europe changed for ever. The referendum result has since plunged the property market into a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard reset\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, especially in the higher price brackets,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hopper said.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153While we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be sure how much things will slow, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inevitable that more nervous investors will sit on their hands while the opportunists circle. Prime central London, where most property purchases are discretionary, is the most exposed to such confidence-sapping doubts.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f346adee466fa84bdf7a83267626b8d76dbd7579\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f346adee466fa84bdf7a83267626b8d76dbd7579/0_0_420_200/420.jpg\" alt=\"Figures from the Nationwide house price index.\" width=\"420\" height=\"200\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Figures from the Nationwide house price index.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nationwide</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hopper, along with some analysts, expects a soft landing rather than a housing crash. <br></p> <p>Nationwide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, Robert Gardner, said it was too hard to predict what would happen in London, where increased uncertainty after the vote to leave the EU could put buyers off, while the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jun/24/house-price-fall-could-follow-brexit-say-experts\">sharp drop in the pound</a> would attract overseas investors, leading to a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexit bubble\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.<br></p> <p>Charlie Campbell, an analyst at Liberum Capital, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153London might be more resilient than we all first thought.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Gardner noted that landlords and overseas buyers play a larger role in the capital than elsewhere, and that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/mar/31/buy-to-let-investors-complete-stamp-duty-rise\">recent stamp duty changes</a> and forthcoming alterations to the tax deductibility of landlords\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expenses would affect investor demand.</p> <p>Turning to the UK as a whole, he said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Even if demand does soften a little, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be underlying demand.

                "bodyText":"Growth in UK house prices picked up in June, but agents and analysts are warning that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to leave the EU will affect demand and prices in the coming months. The average price of a property rose by 5.1% from a year ago to \u00c2\u00a3204,968, according to Nationwide building society (pdf). This compares with an annual growth rate of 4.7% in May. It has been fairly stable over the past 12 months at between 3% and 6%. The data gives a snapshot of the housing market immediately before the EU referendum. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Following the referendum, demand likely will weaken as unemployment begins to edge up and confidence falls. Meanwhile, banks soon will reflect the recent increase in funding costs in their mortgage rates. Prices in London look particularly vulnerable, given that job insecurity has increased in the City and banks will be thinking twice about high loan-to-income lending.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Foxtons, the London-focused estate agent, issued a profit warning this week. It believes the vote to leave the EU will limit property sales in the capital for the rest of the year. Jonathan Hopper, the managing director of buying agents Garrington Property Finders, said the brisk pace in June was likely to be the high water mark for the property market for some time. The data showed a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153functioning market with decent price growth but limited supply \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a languid calm before the storm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he added. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unfortunately this data is about as much use in predicting the future course of the property market as sun-dappled photos of the summer of 1914. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a historical record of a lost age before Europe changed for ever. The referendum result has since plunged the property market into a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard reset\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, especially in the higher price brackets,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hopper said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be sure how much things will slow, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inevitable that more nervous investors will sit on their hands while the opportunists circle. Prime central London, where most property purchases are discretionary, is the most exposed to such confidence-sapping doubts.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hopper, along with some analysts, expects a soft landing rather than a housing crash. Nationwide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, Robert Gardner, said it was too hard to predict what would happen in London, where increased uncertainty after the vote to leave the EU could put buyers off, while the sharp drop in the pound would attract overseas investors, leading to a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexit bubble\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Charlie Campbell, an analyst at Liberum Capital, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153London might be more resilient than we all first thought.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Gardner noted that landlords and overseas buyers play a larger role in the capital than elsewhere, and that recent stamp duty changes and forthcoming alterations to the tax deductibility of landlords\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expenses would affect investor demand. Turning to the UK as a whole, he said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Even if demand does soften a little, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be underlying demand. There are so few properties on the market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Data from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors suggests stock on estate agents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 books is nearly at the lowest level in 30 years, as construction of new homes has been slow, unable to keep up with demand. The area around London again had the strongest rate of annual price growth of 12.4% in the second quarter, up from 12.2% in the first quarter. Despite a slowdown, London was still the second strongest region, with prices rising by 9.9% to an all-time high of \u00c2\u00a3472,384 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 54% above pre-financial crisis levels. Northern England was the only area where house prices fell in the second quarter, replacing Northern Ireland as the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s least expensive region. Prices in the north of England are now 9% below their pre-crisis peak. Following the surge in house buying in March before the introduction of stamp duty on second homes, Gardner said, it would be hard to assess \u00e2\u20ac\u0153how much of the likely fallback in transactions in the quarters ahead is because buyers brought forward purchases to avoid additional stamp duty liabilities, and how much is due to increased economic uncertainty following the referendum result. Gauging the likely impact on house prices will be even more difficult\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.",

Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s list of top risers is somewhat more diverse than yesterday, with miners enjoying healthy gains, although once again UK-focused names like house builders and insurers predominate.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5773ea24e4b03b1c80766792\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/simonbowers\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-29T15:34:19.543Z\">4.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Elsewhere a whistleblower who leaked details of corporate tax deals was found guilty of theft, writes Simon Bowers:</p> <blockquote> <p>A former employee of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/pricewaterhousecoopers\">PricewaterhouseCoopers</a> has been convicted of theft after a court in Luxembourg found he was behind an unprecedented leak of controversial tax deals privately granted to many of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest corporations.</p> <p>A judge in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/luxembourg\">Luxembourg</a> told Antoine Deltour he would avoid jail but must receive a 12-month suspended sentence and a fine of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1,500 (\u00c2\u00a31200).

                "bodyText":"It was not just the FTSE 100 which moved sharply higher for the second day running. As bargain hunters returned after the recent hefty falls, markets across Europe and in the US recorded big gains despite talk of possible recession following the Brexit vote. Analysts said buyers had also moved back into the market as they realised that despite the referendum, the UK would not trigger Article 50, setting the exit from the EU in motion, for months, given the political turmoil in the country. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 3.58% or 219.67 at 6360 regaining all its losses and more since the Brexit vote The FTSE 250, more focused on the UK domestic economy, ended 3.22% higher at 16,002.90 but is still down 7.6% since Thursday Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax rose 1.75% to 9612.27 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed up 2.6% at 4195.32 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB added 2.21% to 15,946.93 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended up 3.45% at 8105.3 In Greece, the Athens market edged up 0.6% at 541.88 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 227 points or 1.3%. Meanwhile the pound has added 1% to $1.348 and 0.75% to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.214. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading index is up 219.67 points at 6360.06, above the 6338 level it closed at on Thursday before the referendum polls closed. In fact it is the highest closing level for the index since 21 April this year. And the 3.58% gain looks like the biggest one day rise since October 2011. The FTSE 250 has finished 3.22% better at 16,002.90. The FTSE 100 has closed up 3.58% and has regained all its losses and more since the referendum. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said: The contrarian nature of markets has never been more apparent than in the past few days. We could all understand the selloff seen on Friday and then again at the beginning of this week, but the storming rally on the FTSE 100, which has seen the index rally over 7% from Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s low, is much harder to explain, other than via the usual combination of short-covering and bargain hunting. The market has certainly been quite sanguine in its assessment of the situation, noting that, technically, nothing has really changed in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relationship with the EU, and that even negotiations about negotiations have yet to start. It is safe to say that, of all the post Brexit outcomes discussed across the City over the past few months, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbuying frenzy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 was not one that was viewed as very likely. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s list of top risers is somewhat more diverse than yesterday, with miners enjoying healthy gains, although once again UK-focused names like house builders and insurers predominate. Elsewhere a whistleblower who leaked details of corporate tax deals was found guilty of theft, writes Simon Bowers: A former employee of PricewaterhouseCoopers has been convicted of theft after a court in Luxembourg found he was behind an unprecedented leak of controversial tax deals privately granted to many of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest corporations. A judge in Luxembourg told Antoine Deltour he would avoid jail but must receive a 12-month suspended sentence and a fine of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1,500 (\u00c2\u00a31200). He found Deltour guilty on charges including theft and violating Luxembourg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strict professional secrecy laws. In 2014, Deltour won widespread praise for helping bring to light hundreds of controversial tax deals granted in previous years by the Luxembourg tax office. The revelations helped lay bare the tax arrangements of companies including Burberry, Pepsi, Ikea, Heinz, Shire Pharmaceuticals and others. The full story is here: The Bank of England has announced that governor Mark Carney will give a speech there on Thursday at 4pm. There are no details as to what he might say, a week after the referendum, but there is of course speculation: Some snippets about Brexit and its fallout from the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Vitor Constancio at the central banks forum, and he thinks things could get quite bad: Markets continue to move higher, and could get a further boost after the US Federal Reserve releases its latest annual bank stress tests later (see here), says Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex: Against the odds this post-Brexit rebound has carried through to a second day; not only that but, if analysts are correct, the markets may well receive a boost this evening in the form of the Federal Reserve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bank stress test results. If the US banking sector proves its resilience in the face of the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s imaginary scenarios it may reassure investors that the institutions can deal with the fallout of Britain leaving the EU, therefore extending the rebound into Thursday. If the report uncovers too many weaknesses, however, the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent gains may be undermined. More signs of a slowing US housing market. The National Association of Realtors index for pending home sales - contracts to buy previously owned homes - fell 3.7% to 110.8 in May. Analysts had expected a fall of 1.1%, according to Reuters. The index is 0.2% lower than in May 2015, declining year on year for the first time in almost two years. Lawrence Yun, the association\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, said: With demand holding firm this spring and homes selling even faster than a year ago, the notable increase in closings in recent months took a dent out of what was available for sale in May and ultimately dragged down contract activity. Realtors are acknowledging with increasing frequency lately that buyers continue to be frustrated by the tense competition and lack of affordable homes for sale in their market. Yun said the fallout from the Brexit vote provided headwinds but also opportunities: In the short term, volatility in the financial markets could very likely lead to even lower mortgage rates and increased demand from foreign buyers looking for a safer place to invest their cash. On the other hand, any prolonged market angst and further economic uncertainty overseas could negatively impact our economy and end up tempering the overall appetite for homebuying. Over at the ECB Forum in Portugal a number of central bankers, including ex-ECB head Jean-Claude Trichet and former Bank of England MPC member and deputy governor Charles Bean, are discussing Brexit: There may be warnings of a UK recession, and concerns that market volatility will continue for some time, but investors are still keen to push shares higher. In the US, Wall Street has followed the lead of other global markets and opened sharply higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 145 points or 0.85%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.7% better and Nasdaq 0.8% better. The FTSE 100 is still around 2% higher although off its best levels, while Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax is up 1.7% and France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac up almost 2.5%. Stock markets are staging a remarkable rally today, as investors manage to put aside worries about Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit crisis. The FTSE 100 index is up 135 right now, a gain of 2.2%. That means it is positive for 2016 again, and only around 60 points below last Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure, when Britain headed to the polls. The top riser right now is building firm Taylor Wimpey (+7%), followed by a clutch of other builders, plus mining companies and major exporters. The pound is also gaining ground, up 1.5 cents today at $1.35. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s around 4 cents higher than Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 31-year low, but still 10 cents below pre-referendum levels. The rally comes despite a tidal wave of warnings about Brexit, and signals from Brussels that negotiations over Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s withdrawal will be tough. For example: Fitch has predicted Britain will suffer a slump in investment A credit insurer has warned of a spike in insolvencies The Economist Intelligence Unit, and Pantheon Economics, have both warned of a UK recession in 2017 Claims that Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are renting office space in Frankfurt, ready to move jobs from the City, have been denied Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s refusal to pull the trigger on Article 50, to leave the EU, has left Europe in the dark. But it also - paradoxically - seems to be reassuring the City, and sparking some bargain-hunting in the markets. But Adam Jepsen, founder of Financial Spreads, reckons more market volatility is likely. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Any investors who think the markets have calmed down should think again. It is far more likely that we are in the eye of the storm,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Especially when politicians are still grappling with how to handle the Brexit vote.... The FT is reporting that the Bank of England had a little chat with the bosses of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest banks today. Apparently... BoE officials gave the bosses of big British banks a supportive message about the amount of liquidity in the system, while pressing them to keep lending to consumers and companies to avoid a repeat of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153credit crunch\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that hit after Lehman Brothers failed in 2008, according to a person briefed on the meeting. Over in Brussels, Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras is making a new push against Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s austerity measures: This week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s summit was a rare treat for Tsipras; the Brexit issue means it was one of the few gatherings where Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt crisis wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mind. A nice bit of history here: The Brexit uncertainty has also driven investors to buy more government debt, as it is a standard \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsafe haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 during times of crisis. That forced prices higher, meaning that the yield on 10-year government bonds has hit a fresh record low - at under 0.6%. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a ridiculously cheap level; good news for governments running deficits, but an alarming sign that markets expect little growth and weak inflation for a while. Chris Giles, the FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economics editor, has just published an impassioned plea to Leave campaigner Boris Johnson to stop dithering, for the sake of the country. He warns that Britain is sinking into recession while the man who helped win the referendum, and who now hopes to become prime minister, wonders what to do next. In the Brexit void, the Boris bust gains momentum Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: Boris Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Vote Leave lieutenants blame their vanquished foes for the absence of a plan. It sounds like a joke, because it is a sick joke. Officials in government cannot plan what to do next until they have a policy to follow. That is how Britain works, Mr Johnson. Officials advise, politicians decide. The man who hopes to head the government within weeks has not decided his policy for leaving the EU. He is even less prepared to enter Number 10 than Gordon Brown was. Of course, we all know why Mr Johnson has not stated what sort of Brexit he favours because any choice he makes will be a betrayal. He could choose to retain membership of the European single market, keeping Britain a member of the European Economic Area while ditching its EU membership. That would betray those with legitimate concerns about immigration, and the xenophobes. He could prioritise the strict control of movement of people. That would betray his beloved London and the young. Or he could dither and betray the whole country as it sinks into recession. The time has passed when you can be all things to all people, Mr Johnson. To govern is to choose and your choice is who you betray... More here: US shares are expected to rise when Wall Street opens, in an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being called the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBrelief rally\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 -- but investors should remember to be cautious, given these warnings of a UK recession.... Could another European Union member \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdo a Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and hold a referendum? Mujtaba Rahman, analyst at Eurasia Group, reckons not - even though Brexit has given populist parties a lift (Marine Le Pen was particularly chuffed yesterday). He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s produced a map, showing where the EU will be a hot topic. Rahman writes: Despite the noise, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe there is an immediate risk of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccopy-cat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 referendum taking place in another EU member on the heels of the UK vote. Even if we are wrong, it would very unlikely pass. But in a handful of countries, populist Eurosceptic parties have gained sufficient momentum to ensure EU membership and referenda will be a prominent feature of the domestic political debate, particularly around elections (France, Denmark and Italy). Directly or indirectly, this will influence government policy. Only in the Netherlands and Austria is there a concrete risk of referenda over EU or euro membership, though even in these states, we view it as something of a remote possibility. But... We would change our mind if there was a major escalation of migrant inflows and/or a major new economic downturn affecting sovereign debt markets to the point it triggers the need for more bailouts. JP Morgan have also issued an interesting note on Brexit. It predicts that David Cameron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s successor will ask MPs to vote on whether to Trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, and implement the result of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum. They also expect that Britain will struggle to get many concessions out of the EU during the negotiations, and will end up with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccurtailed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 access to Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s markets. The note (which Ed Conway has tweet) also predicts that Scotland will break away from the UK, and implement a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnew currency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Here are a couple of charts from Fitch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest report on Brexit: Fitch, the rating agency, has issued another dire warning about the impact of the EU referendum on the UK economy. In a new report, Fitch predicts a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153large investment shock\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as businesses struggle with the implications of the Brexit vote. Fitch warn: Businesses are facing a surge in uncertainty on three separate fronts - the future of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trading relationship with the EU, the shape of the regulatory framework, and domestic political uncertainty, including the future status of Scotland. This uncertainty will prompt firms to delay investment and hiring decisions, while elevated financial market volatility will further damage business confidence. And this means that the UK economy will be much weaker than expected. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the key points: We expect investment to fall by 5% in 2017 and by 2018 for it to be 15% lower than previously expected in Fitch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s May 2016 Global Economic Outlook (GEO). Overall spending by UK residents will see a mild decline in 2017. The sharp fall in the value of sterling will provide some offset to the demand shock, with exports likely to benefit somewhat in the near term. Imports look likely to decline as investment contracts and foreign products become more expensive, resulting in expenditure switching to domestically produced goods and services and higher inflation. UK GDP growth is expected to fall to around 1% in both 2017 and 2018. This is a downward revision of 1 percentage point in each year from the May 2016 GEO. Fitch point out that the long-term effects are harder to predict, partly because no-one knows what relationship the UK will have with the European Union. But they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect much of a Brexit dividend: In addition to less favourable access to the European Single Market, reductions in trade openness and inward foreign direct investment could harm productivity performance, while reduced immigration would slow labour supply and potential GDP. These negatives will likely outweigh any GDP gains from deregulation outside the EU or the redirection of EU budget transfers. They also predict that the Bank of England will cut interest rates by 25 basis points (from 0.5% to 0.25%) later this year, while the Federal Reserve will resist raising borrowing costs until the end of this year. The BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reaction to Brexit is quite hard to call -- do they slash rates to fight the recession, or hike them to bolster the pound? The Economist Intelligence Unit are also predicting that Britain will slide into recession next year. Goldman Sachs have also responded to the report that it has \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpre-rented\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 office space in Frankfurt: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have not made any changes to our real estate requirements in Frankfurt as a result of the referendum result. As we have already communicated to our employees, there is no immediate change to the way we conduct our business or where we conduct our business.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy will fall into recession next year, according to Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics: Morgan Stanley has denied that it has rented office space in the German financial capital (as bankers heard this morning). A spokesman tells us: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Morgan Stanley does not have pre-let office space in Frankfurt, or anywhere else.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Economic confidence across the eurozone has taken a dip, even before the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum result. The eurozone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headline economic sentiment measure has fallen to 104.4 in June, from 104.6 in May. That may suggest that growth is slowing; bad news for a region facing months of uncertainty. Atradius, which provides credit insurance, has predicted that the Brexit vote will wipe out some businesses. In a new report, it predicts: Insolvencies are expected to rise in the short-term, especially in Ireland, the Netherlands and Belgium, due to close trade and investment ties. Insolvencies in the UK predicted to increase by 4% Insolvencies also forecast to rise 3.5% in Ireland, 2.5% in Belgium and 2% in Netherlands Corporates operating in the transport equipment, food, textiles, electrical equipment and chemicals sectors are most exposed due to close trade linkages. Brexit could trim 1% to 3% off UK GDP by 2018 Uncertainly will persist in coming years which will continue to be reflected in financial markets and business sentiment. Borrowing would become more expensive for UK firms. European countries will feel short and long-term economic impacts The Brexit crisis is looming over UK bankers as they gathers for a conference in London. City minister Harriet Baldwin told the British Banking Association\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s event that London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial sector will survive: But Justin Bisseker, analyst at Schroders, has predicted that the UK economy will suffer badly from Brexit. Katherine Griffiths, banking editor at The Times, flags up that some investment banks have already made exit plans: Analysts at Credit Suisse are speculating that last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote may not be the end of the matter.... Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally is a surprise \u00e2\u20ac\u201c some in the City had expected heavy losses after the Brexit vote. A disconnect is appearing between the pessimistic mood that is permeating the media and the insatiable optimism that seems to be driving yet another day of gains in the FTSE100. For many, the widespread selling that dominated the financial markets in the immediate wake of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum result was expected to persist, providing one of the deepest corrections for years. It appears that investors are eagerly buying shares because they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect Britain to trigger Article 50 soon. Mahoney adds: However, there is a confidence within the City that perhaps the implications to this vote may not be as immediate nor far reaching as many initially thought, providing opportunities for bargain hunters to grab shares at a discount. EU leaders will chivy Britain along to do the deed, but they may have to wait until a new prime minister is installed. Shares in London are climbing steadily this morning. The FTSE index has now gained 120 points, or almost 2%, to 6260. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only 78-points shy of its closing level last Thursday, when the City expected the Remain campaign to win. Housebuilding firms are up, with Persimmon gaining 5% and Barratt Development up 3.5%. Financial stocks are also rallying; Prudential has jumped 5%, while Barclays is 3% higher. However, both sectors are still *sharply* lower than last week.... The FTSE 250 index, which includes smaller UK companies, has risen by 1.5%. Shawbrook, a new \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcchallenger bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 which tumbled yesterday after admitting making some loans that it shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, are up 23%. So, is the Brexit wobble over? Not according to Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, who says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Stocks and the pound are continuing to firm but the post-Brexit reality will bite sooner or later. What we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing in the FTSE is hope in Britain being able to ride it out by remaining part of the single market. This looks like wishful thinking. The line from the chief leavers seems to be that Britain can have its cake and eat it by maintaining access to the common market without the free movement of people. Unfortunately this looks like an impossible circle to square as the EU is not prepared to offer this kind of special relationship - Switzerland risks wrecking its bilateral trade deals with the EU if it implements a binding 2014 referendum blocking free movement. Greene King, the pub chain, has warned that consumer spending will probably suffer as Britain falls deeper into Brexit uncertainty. CEO Rooney Anand has told the City that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The increasingly uncertain trading environment is likely to weigh on consumer sentiment in the near term.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd On the upside, Greene King might benefit from Remain voters drowning their sorrows... Just in: British consumer credit has expanded at the fastest annual pace since 2005 in May, in the run-up to last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum. Also, lenders approved more mortgages than expected, in another sign that consumers had remained pretty confident - before the Brexit bombshell landed. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s according to new Bank of England data, which shows: Mortgage approvals for house purchases numbered 67,042 in May, up from 66,205 in April. Consumer credit rose 9.9 percent compared with a year ago, the biggest annual increase since November 2005 and up from 9.6 percent in April. Telegraph business editor Ben Wright explains why Brexit could be such bad news for the City, and thus the rest of the UK: The recent stabilisation in the value of the pound is unlikely to last, warns currency expert Jane Foley of Rabobank. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, she warns that the current Brexit uncertainty is bad for investment and bad for UK businesses, and thus not great news for the national currency. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have political uncertainty and probably recession - that isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t something that sterling should celebrate.... Sterling faces a huge amount of volatility, and we possibly haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen the lows yet.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd On Monday, the pound hit a 31-year low around $1.312, and is now hovering around $1.34. Finland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former finance minister, Alex Stubb, has experienced plenty of European rough-and-tumble . He reckons Brexit is currently in the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcchaos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 phase, but will eventually move forwards... But how many crises can Europe handle, asks Aengus Collins of the Economist Intelligence Unit.... Mario Monti, the former European commissioner (and one-time technocratic Italian PM), has warned the UK it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get access to the single market without accepting the free movement of people: Our Politics liveblog is tracking the fallout from last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU summit meeting, and the race to become Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next prime minister. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also following Jeremy Corbyn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempt to not become Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next former leader, after losing a vote of confidence last night. The UK car industry is hoping that Britain retains access to the European single market. A new report shows that the industry enjoyed a record year, partly due to the ability to sell vehicles without tariffs across the EU. Life is continuing in Brussels without the UK today, as the other 27 leaders sit down sans Cameron. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unclear whether today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally is a dead-cat bounce or a genuine recovery, says Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets, a City trading firm. European stock markets are a sea of green this morning, as shares rally across the continent: In the City. shares are rallying at the start of trading, as we predicted. In London, the FTSE 100 index has jumped by 110 points, or 1.8%, to 6251. That means the blue-chip index is only 100 points below its level on Thursday night, before the EU referendum polls closed. Banks and mining companies are among the top risers, as investors regain some optimism after last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit shock. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, says: London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE-100 is once again surging higher in early trade, as the air of panic that gripped global markets in the wake of that Brexit vote continues to ebb. UK house price inflation has picked up this month, according to Nationwide. It reports that prices rose 0.2% between June and May, raising the average property price to \u00c2\u00a3204,968. That means prices were 5.1% higher than a year ago. However, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to wait a few months to discover what the Brexit vote means for prices. As Jonathan Hopper, managing director of the buying agents Garrington Property Finders, puts it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nationwide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s June data gives a snapshot of the housing market immediately before the Brexit referendum. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It shows a functioning market with decent price growth but limited supply \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a languid calm before the storm. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unfortunately this data is about as much use in predicting the future course of the property market as sun-dappled photos of the summer of 1914. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a historical record of a lost age before Europe changed forever. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime minister has urged his central bank to ensure ample funds are available to help Japanese companies ride out the Brexit shock. Shinzo Abe told the Bank of Japan that it must do everything in its power to prevent any credit squeeze, as: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A sense of uncertainty and worry about risks remain in the markets.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Many Japanese companies have operations in the UK, such as carmaker Nissan, which runs Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest car factory in Sunderland. A majority of voters in Sunderland put their cross in the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcLeave the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 box last week, and some are now wondering about the consequences.... The pound is also looking quite stable this morning, hovering around the $1.335 mark in early London trading. But Nordea analyst Aurelija Augulyte reckons sterling is poised to move sharply soon, either higher or lower. Good morning. Global stock markets are shaking off the worst of the Brexit panic today, despite massive uncertainty over the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political and economic future. Yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally, which saw the FTSE 100 jump 2.6%, is likely to continue this morning. City firm IG are predicting another 1% jump, which would take the blue-chip index close to its levels before referendum day. Asian markets have already rallied overnight, with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei closing 1.5% higher. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a curious rally, given Britain is wallowing in an unprecedented political crisis. Conservatives MPs are racing to find a new leader, while their Labour counterparts are trying the damnest to ditch their current one. Oh, and we also need a new football manager. But investors may be relieved that the financial world hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t descended into mass panic over the last five days. They may also be hoping that central bankers will do whatever it takes to prevent chaos breaking out. So, an odd limbo has set in, since it became clear that Britain wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t immediately trigger Brexit by activating Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. Meanwhile, UK companies are still chewing through the implications of the Brexit vote - which could be very severe if Britain loses access to the single markets. Last night, European leaders held a farewell dinner with David Cameron, where the UK PM blamed unrestricted migration for his failure to win last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be meeting again this morning to discuss the way ahead; Cameron, though, has headed home....

The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 235.31 points, or 1.3%, to 17,929.99, only 90 points below its high before the UK referendum. The S&amp;P 500 climbed 28.09 points, or 1.4%, to 2,098.86, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 63.43 points, or 1.3%, to 4,842.67. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back later with the close of Wall Street. But otherwise, thanks for reading and during another highly dramatic day that is best summed up by this tweet: Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to take action to support the UK economy has been welcomed on Wall Street, where the Brexit crisis is being closely watched. The main US stock indices are all up around 1% this afternoon. Newsflash: Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has downgraded the European Union\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit rating from AA+ to AA, the third-highest rating. The move comes three days after S&amp;P stripped the UK of its final triple-A rating. S&amp;P took the move following Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote, saying that it will lessen the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal flexibility and weaken political cohesion in the region. The agency says: We think that, going forward, revenue forecasting, long-term capital planning, and adjustments to key financial buffers of the EU will be subject to greater uncertainty. It also predicts that wealthier EU members will have to pay a larger share into the EU budget, to cover the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lost contributions. The downgrade is mainly symbolic -- most EU borrowing is conducted by member states, of course. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a signal that Europe is going to be harmed by the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure. The FTSE 250 index of medium-sized UK firms has also rallied today. It is up 1.7%, which still leaves it below its pre-referendum level. Record low interest rates is particularly bad news for savers. Most savers tend to be older people. More older people voted to leave the European Union than remain in it. So, intentionally or not, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to cover some of the cost of the crisis: Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Gerard Lyons, one of the economists who campaigned for Britain to leave the UK: Amid the chaos of UK politics, Mark Carney has emerged as one policymaker with a clear strategy to tackle the crisis. Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, says: British politics may have deteriorated from House of Cards to Monty Python this week, but Mark Carney did an admirable job of communicating that the BoE is one institution with a post-Brexit plan. Aside from a big hint towards future rate cuts, no policy measures were announced today, but that was not the point of the speech. Carney was out to reassure markets that there was no impending financial crisis, even though the UK economy is facing huge uncertainty. He performed exceptionally well in this regard, and refused to be drawn into Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s escalating political turmoil. The first negative-yielding gilt has appeared in the UK following Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech today (as flagged a few minute ago). A gilt maturing in March 2018 traded at -0.003%, as expectations for further easing from the Bank increased. According to Mitul Patel, head of interest rates at Henderson Global Investors: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The market now expects interest rates to fall to close to 0%, and whilst Carney has previously stated a dislike of negative interest rates, nothing can be taken off the table.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He added that interest rates \u00e2\u20ac\u0153are unlikely to go up for several years following the EU referendum result.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Katie Allen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s story on Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech, for anyone just tuning in: The Bank of England is likely to have to cut interest rates over the coming months to cushion the blow to the economy from the Brexit vote, its governor, Mark Carney, has said. Carney used a speech a week after Britain voted to leave the EU to reassure business leaders and investors that the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contingency plans were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153working well\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that it was considering more measures to safeguard financial stability. He gave the strongest indication yet that the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reaction to the market turmoil and uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote would be to cut interest rates from the current record low of 0.5%, perhaps as soon as July. The pound tumbled by 1.5\u00c2\u00a2 to $1.326 against the US dollar following Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech on the prospect of a new stimulus package, as traders anticipated a cut in rates. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nine-member monetary policy committee faces a tradeoff between stabilising inflation, which could be stoked by a weaker pound, and shoring up growth and jobs, Carney said. But he erred on the side of supporting growth with lower borrowing costs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In my view, and I am not prejudging the views of the other independent MPC members, the economic outlook has deteriorated and some monetary policy easing will likely be required over the summer,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carney said in the speech to bankers and business leaders. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The committee will make an initial assessment on 14 July and a full assessment complete with a new forecast will follow in the August inflation report. In August, we will also discuss further the range of instruments at our disposal.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Investors are also diving into UK government debt, which is a sign they expect weak growth and ultra-low interest raters. They are now paying MORE than the face value of two-year UK bonds, which means the interest rate on those bond is now negative. More reaction to the governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech: Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, reckons the BoE will cut rates at its August meeting (rather than next week) The Bank will update its forecasts and make a full assessment of the economic picture in its August Inflation Report. This probably leaves August as the likeliest date for a rate cut, though swap markets are pricing in a July cut as more likely than not (a 57% probability), and a 73% chance of a rate cut by August. He also explains that Carney and colleagues will be worried that the weak pound will push inflation higher, but they might ignore that and ease monetary policy anyway..... Carney and his MPC colleagues could face a delicate balancing act over the coming months, balancing higher inflation caused by the weaker pound with the need to stimulate growth. If history is anything to go by, growth will be the priority \u00e2\u20ac\u201c remember the Bank was willing to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclook through\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 elevated inflation in the first phase of the financial crisis and cut rates to their current lows. The prospect of UK interest rates being cut to fresh record lows has wiped two cents off the pound, which is now trading at $1.322. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only one cent above Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 31-year low. Caxton FX analyst Nicholas Laser-Ebisch says Carney didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give traders any reasons to buy sterling: Sterling dropped by more than 1% across the board as Carney admitted that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153some monetary policy easing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was likely required as a response to the Brexit vote, acknowledging the risk that taking action would have, both on individuals and businesses. Market participants were watching this impromptu press conference for signs of reassurance, but the BOE governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech inspired no confidence. The weak pound drove up the share price of companies with large overseas operations -- as the dollars and euros they earn will be worth more. So, the top risers on the FTSE 100 included drinks firm Diageo, and mining groups Antofagasta and Anglo American. Alarmingly, though, banks shares fell again today. A rate cut would make it even harder for them to make a profit. Building companies are also still under pressure, with Berkeley Homes and Barratt both among the top fallers. Traders are still calculating that the Brexit vote is bad for the demand in the housing sector. Savings rates had been falling anyway, even though the Bank of England base rate has been static at 0.5% since 2009, and now it seems almost inevitable that they will continue to plummet to new lows. According to financial website Moneyfacts.co.uk, the average easy-access cash Isa rate has fallen by 0.11% in six months to just 0.98%, the first time on record it has fallen below 1%. In May the website recorded 18 savings rate rises and 156 cuts. Spokeswoman Charlotte Nelson says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a good time to be a saver in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The link between the base rate and savings rates has already been cut - though that does not mean banks and building societies will not reduce rates if and when the base rate is cut to, say, 0.25% or zero. Nelson said that if there was a base rate cut, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it gives cause for them to cut rates, and makes it almost acceptable to do so. On 1 June Nationwide became the latest big-name provider to cut rates on many of its accounts. As to what savers should do, one way of achieving a secure income is to opt for a fixed-rate savings bond. But some may feel that the rates on these are paltry: even bonds on sale today that involve locking your money away for five years are only paying an average of 2.05% - down from 2.1% on the day of the referendum, 23 June. New one and two-year fixed-rate bonds are paying an average of 1.17% and 1.41% respectively. If you are on a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctracker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 deal, then the impact of a Bank of England rate cut is instant. For example, Nationwide building society has just under 600,000 people on its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbase mortgage rate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 which is 2% above Bank of England base rate. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is no floor, so if the Bank Rate was cut then the rate would reduce\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says a spokeswoman. Someone with a \u00c2\u00a3150,000 Nationwide mortgage would see their repayments cut from \u00c2\u00a3673 a month to \u00c2\u00a3654 if Carney cuts base rates to 0.25. If he slashes them to zero, then the mortgage costs drops to \u00c2\u00a3636. The impact is even bigger if the borrower has an interest-only mortgage, although these have largely disappeared since the credit crunch. They would see the cost of servicing a \u00c2\u00a3150,000 loan drop from \u00c2\u00a3313 a month to \u00c2\u00a3281 at base rate of 0.25%, dropping to \u00c2\u00a3250 once rates hit zero. Anyone on a fixed-rate mortgage will see no change. But in the coming week banks and building societies are expected to line up cheaper deals reflecting the new money market rates, with plenty more sub-2% fixes available, even for those with a relatively low deposit. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jeff Black was impressed by Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance: Jamie McGeever of Reuters points out the UK faces huge challenges: Anna Stupnytska, global economist at Fidelity International, says Carney had a clear message: And the FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sarah O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Conner sums up Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key message: The prospect of more monetary stimulus has acted like Class A catnip in the City. Shares have soared, as soon as Mark Carney hinted that the Bank of England will ease monetary policy this summer - probably by cutting interest rates or through a new QE programme. The FTSE 100 index has hit its highest level since last August, up 144 points at 6504: There is a proviso - the slump in the pound means that the FTSE 100 is worth rather less in dollar terms. But still, it shows that investor are expecting the BoE to take significant action this summer: Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says: The FTSE has broken to the highest level since August 2015 today, with the UK 10 year yield hitting an alltime low after comments from Mark Carney provided a new dovish bias upon monetary policy going forward However.... Mark Carney has delivered a somewhat downbeat assessment of UK economic hopes today, with the BoE governor stating that we are likely to see some form of easing over the summer. The worries that had impacted investment decisions prior to the vote are now likely to intensify and whilst Carney said he was willing to act, the ability of monetary policy to fix these problems are of course limited. UKIP leader Nigel Farage has criticised Mark Carney.... ...and been slapped down by the US economics editor of The Economist.... ...and others: Finally, another question about Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clashes with the Leave campaign. Governor Carney patiently explains that he was doing his job by pointing out the risks in leaving the EU. Britain is now prepared, so the task of adjusting to Brexit will be easier. And he insists that he is not planning to leave the Bank. Carney declines to say whether he agrees with his predecessor, Lord King, that the Remain campaign\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic warnings were over the top. Carney insists that the Bank has a range of options on the table (or in its monetary toolkit). So, it has cut interest rates and boosted quantitative easing (buying bonds with new money) in the past, but it it might do something different this time.... Q: Did the Bank of England intervene in the markets last Friday to calm the crisis? Carney says there were some \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pretty big moves\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the currency, as should be expected. The markets functioned well, and there was no liquidity shortage - so the pound moved on investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 views. And when markets are functioning well, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to get in the way. So, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a no. Q: Is a recession likely? We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to wait until the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new economic forecasts in early August. Q: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech is quite unprecedented, so does it show the scale of the economic crisis? Carney says the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remit has changed in recent years, giving it a broader remit. It now holds responsibility for monetary stability, and financial security (unlike during the credit crunch) Also, standards of transparency have changed - the public, businesses and the media all expect a rapid response. The Bank can meet in an afternoon, and take decisions, if needed. Q: How can the Bank protect the UK economy during the shambles playing out in politics? Carney declines to describe British politics as a shambles. But when there is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153policy uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the Bank can adjust and fine-tune its policies to try and anticipate the impact. Onto questions Q: Could you work with Brexit campaigners who have criticised your conduct during the EU referendum campaign, if one became the next chancellor? Carney says that his concerns about leaving the EU were shared by all policymakers at the Bank of England. All those individuals are committed to discharging their responsibilities. This is a professional, technocratic institution, and we will continue to do our jobs. Carney is on good form. He now tells us about a weathervane in the Bank of England which was installed in 1805, to help the BoE handle the economy. When the wind blew from the east, ships could come up the Thames, so merchants would need credit to buy goods. When it came from the west, credit should be withdrawn. Carney calls it a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Regency-era forecasting model\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that helped the bank provide stability. Today, the economy is more complex, and our forecasting models are a little less reliable.... There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no argument, though, that the winds have changed -- and this time, the Bank cannot fully offset the consequences. We face a trade-off between stabilising inflation on the one hand and avoiding undue volatility in output and employment on the other, says Carney. So.... although he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not pre-judging the view of his fellow policymakers, the economic outlook has deteriorated and some monetary policy easing will likely be required over the summer. Carney now explains how uncertainty will hurt the economy. There is a danger that UK households could defer consumption (ie, delay buying new things) and firms delay investment -- which would push unemployment higher. There are also risks of adverse spillovers to the global economy. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a risk that supply growth will be lower over the next three years, he adds. Quick explainer - the pound has fallen, because traders are anticipating that the Bank could cut interest rates to fresh record lows (meaning you get even less for holding your money in sterling). This time, the financial system will dampen the aftershock of recent events, rather than amplifying them, Carney pledges. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll hold you to that, Mark.... Mark Carney is now outlining the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to fight the uncertainty created by Brexit. He says that the BoE has already taken steps to bolster the capital held by commercial banks, after the 2008 crisis showed that they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t carrying enough. Banks have raised over \u00c2\u00a3130bn of capital, and have large amounts of liquid assets, he says. Then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an announcement: Carney says the Bank will run weekly auctions to pump new liquidity into the financial system until September, to avoid a credit crunch. It usually runs these auctions monthly. The pound has tumbled by one and a half cents, to $1.326 against the US dollar, on the prospect of a new stimulus package. Carney is warning that the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s previous fears of a Brexit slowdown are now its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153central forecast\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The Bank of England will likely have to cut interest rates over coming months to cushion the blow to the economy from the Brexit vote, says Katie Allen (who has attended the lock-in at the Bank). She writes: Carney is using a speech just a week after Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s historic vote to leave the EU to reassure business leaders and investors that the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contingency plans were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153working well\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that it was considering more measures to safeguard financial stability. He will give the strongest indication yet that the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reaction to the market turmoil and uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote will be to cut interest rates from the current record low of 0.5%, perhaps as soon as next month. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nine-member monetary policy committee (MPC) faces a trade-off between stabilising inflation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which could be stoked by a weaker pound - and shoring up growth and jobs, Carney said. But he erred on the side of supporting growth with lower borrowing costs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In my view, and I am not pre-judging the views of the other independent MPC members, the economic outlook has deteriorated and some monetary policy easing will likely be required over the summer,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carney said in the speech to bankers and business leaders. Carney reiterates that the Bank of England is prepared to take action to protect the UK economy from the impact of leaving the EU. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only so much that monetary policy can do. People ask basic questions at these times, Carney continues. Will inflation go up, will other people lose their jobs? Will I lose mine? This prompts a bout of giggling in the room, given the speculation that Brexit campaigners may want to drive Carney back to Canada. Here comes Mark Carney, bank on time. The governor begins by saying that while the result of last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum is clear, its implications are not. This country can handle change, he continues, It has one of the most flexible economies in the world, and world class infrastructure. Its people are admired around the world over for their strength in adversity. So the question is not whether the UK can adjust, but how quickly and how well. But.... the decision to leave the UK is a major regime shift, he continues. Financial reporters are locked in the Bank of England until 4pm, so we should get a flurry of news very soon.... I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m guessing grey. Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech should be streamed on the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website (although it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s struggling to load right now). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also been carried on the UK news channels, such as Sky. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jeff Black has flagged up the nightmare scenario for the City..... Newsflash from Washington: The International Monetary Fund has warned that uncertainty over the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future is likely to dampen near-term growth; in Britain, Europe and the world economy. The IMF will include this effect in its next economic forecasts, on July 19th. Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, believes Carney needs to be straight with the British people about the consequences of Brexit. He worries that some investors are too complacent, which is why the FTSE 100 index is now higher than before the vote. The FSTE 100 continues to pump, jacked up on frenzied bargain buyers piling into the index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largely overseas-focused companies and defensive stocks. HSBC has confirmed it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t move its headquarters outside of London and its stocks is up 1% today \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to above pre-Brexit levels. To level things out Carney really needs to play it cautious and once again stress the downside risks and concerns about the UK economy longer term from Brexit. I missed this earlier, but apparently Mark Carney declined a pay rise this year. Reuters has the details, from the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual report: Canadian Carney, who earns a basic salary of \u00c2\u00a3480,000 ($645,000) a year and has a \u00c2\u00a3250,000 annual housing allowance, has been a central figure in the response fromBritish authorities to leaving the European Union. The Bank declined to comment on Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reasons for rejecting a pay rise. Median gross earnings for full-time British employees stood at \u00c2\u00a327,600 for the year ending in April 2015. Brexit campaigners could have the knives out for Mark Carney, after he angered them during the referendum campaign by warning of the economic risks of Leaving the EU. Journalist Ben Chu suggests that Boris Johnson would have supported the governor, but other Brexiters might have other plans..... Carney is currently on a five-year contract that expires in summer 2018, but he could possibly ask to extend it for three years [governors typically serve eight-year terms] Economists, journalists and camera crews are massing at the Bank of England as attention turns to Mark Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upcoming speech about life after the EU referendum. After a week of stomach-churning political changes, the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governor will aim to reassure the public, and investors at home and abroad, that the Brexit vote won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cause a new crisis. Carney is due to speak at 4pm UK time and should take questions afterwards. Last Friday, he was quick to address the nation after the referendum result, saying the UK economy was in good shape to ride out the situation. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re hoping for more details about the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to protect jobs and ward off a recession. City experts are pleased that the BoE is taking an approach to the crisis. Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank, told Bloomberg: I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ever remember being invited to any briefings from the Bank of England at the height of the credit crunch in 2008-09, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite refreshing that the BoE is being so open. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very good that someone is being proactive, because there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been pretty much radio silence from the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcVote Leave\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 leadership since Friday. The BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kevin Peachey reckons Carney will strike a reassuring tone: The independent economist Shaun Richards wonders whether Carney might announce a new offer of cheap credit to encourage bank lending: The US stock market has opened, and the main indices are creeping higher ... Senior staff at Lloyds Banking Group have given their company a vote of confidence by snapping up tens of thousands of Lloyds shares each. The bank has told the City that 19 board members and top managers bought shares this week. They moved after seeing them fall from 72p to about 55p after the Brexit vote. Lloyds shares are down 3% at 53p today, so they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not in profit quite yet ... The Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual report is out. In it, the Bank admits that it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know the impact of the Brexit vote on its balance sheet, saying: The United Kingdom held a referendum on 23 June on whether or not to remain a member of the European Union. As a result of the decision to leave the EU, the Bank continues to consider the implications of this decision on its strategy, business plan and balance sheet. A reasonable estimate of the impact on the balance sheet cannot be made at this time due to volatility preventing use of appropriate market pricing. It also shows that the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governor, Mark Carney, received almost \u00c2\u00a3880,000 last year in pay, pension and benefits. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an old cliche that markets hate uncertainty. Some investors deny that this is true: at least, those with the nerve to take big bets at times of wild volatility. But the dramatic shakeup of British politics has brought some clarity \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Boris Johnson certainly won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be the next prime minister. Ken Odeluga, a market analyst at City Index, reckons this \u00e2\u20ac\u0153surprising increase in certainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd could reassure the City in the short term. However, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still no indication that leaving the EU will be easy. He says: EU negotiations might now begin sooner than expected, if signs of a push to elect a Conservative leader as early as September prove accurate. If EU/UK horse trading does kick off early, uncertainty could be reduced even further. (Almost regardless of how favourable or unfavourable the outcome is deemed to be). However, the latest twists and turns of the Brexit saga have done little to improve the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to assess the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prospect of extracting the best possible deal with the EU. On that basis, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still difficult to believe that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrisky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 assets like stocks and sterling will be able to hold their newly regained poise for much longer. Especially if signs of stability do not emerge in Westminster soon. Investors are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unsure about almost everything\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Kit Juckes of Societe Generale. The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBrexit, what Brexit?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 recovery in risk sentiment is just about continuing in emerging markets and equities, but the pound, euro, and Australian and New Zealand dollars have run out of puff overnight. Investors everywhere are a bit unsure what the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure from the EU will look like and what it means, a mindset that may now last a while. We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect many fireworks on Wall Street today. The US stock market is expected to open flattish, matching the mood in Europe. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Boris bounce\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t last too long ... The pound is pushing a little higher after Boris Johnson stunned British politics by announcing that he will not run to be the next Conservative Party leader and prime minister. So, after leading the campaign to leave the EU, Boris won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be dealing with the consequences. Instead, it looks like a choice between Theresa May \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who is still the odds-on favourite \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and Michael Gove. The FTSE 100, however, is dipping back to its opening levels having hit a two-month high this morning, as traders digest a morning of remarkable news. The FTSE 250 index, made up mainly of UK companies, remains a better gauge of the UK economy than the multinational firms on the FTSE 100. Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, explains why: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The FTSE 100 has rallied to its pre-Brexit levels and is holding on to most of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big gains this morning. However, the UK-focused FTSE 250 remains down 8% and this speaks volumes about the split between UK and international companies. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The blue chip index is stuffed full with big international firms and it is these companies propelling the rise. The heavy weighting towards these groups is very misleading.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Connor Campbell of SpreadEx agrees that the political machinations playing out in Westminster have helped calm the markets. Gains in the commodity sector seem to be driving the FTSE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise, though losses in the banking and property sectors are preventing it from matching the growth seen on Tuesday and Wednesday. The UK index was likely aided by the semblance of order returning to the Tory party, with Theresa May (who has so far provided the most thorough Brexit outline) the frontrunner for PM, followed by Michael Gove, who plunged a knife into the back of former heir apparent Boris Johnson with his own leadership announcement this morning. European stock markets are also enjoying a Brexit bounceback this morning: Bank shares are lagging, though. The news that Santander and Deutsche Bank failed US bank stress tests last night isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helping the sector. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE 100 has hit a new two-month high as City investors remain calm about the Brexit crisis \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and watch another remarkable day of political drama. The blue-chip index is now up 35 points, or 0.6%, at 6397. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the highest level since 20 April, having recovered its referendum losses yesterday. Importantly, though, this is all measured in sterling \u00e2\u20ac\u201c shares are still down in dollars and euros. Banks and building firms remain under pressure and the FTSE 250 index, which contains more UK companies, is slightly down today. Nonetheless, the Brexit panic does seem to have abated, especially after Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s entry into the Tory leadership contest; she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now the frontrunner at Betfair, while support for Boris Johnson ebbs away after Michael Gove\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sensational move into the race this morning. Investors may be reassured that May laid out a clear plan to deal with the Brexit vote. She also pledged not to hit Britain with an emergency budget and criticised George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbalanced budget\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rule, saying: While it is absolutely vital that the government continues with its intention to reduce public spending and reduce the budget deficit, we should no longer seek to produce a budget surplus by the end of the parliament. As predicted earlier, Brexit has been top of the agenda at TheCityUK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual conference in London this morning. John MacFarlane, the chairman of Barclays, urged politicians to show leadership to tackle the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153self-inflicted wound\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the UK economy. HSBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman, Douglas Flint, argued that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contingency planning worked well: And the UK head of accountancy firm Deloitte, David Sproul, tried to sound upbeat ... A gobbet of eurozone economic news: The inflation rate has risen to 0.1%, from -0.1% in May. As usual, energy prices were a drag on prices, but food, industrial goods and services prices all rose. That will please the European Central Bank in its battle to fight deflation, although the Brexit shock has already changed the landscape.... Back in Westminster, Theresa May is launching her pitch to be Conservative leader, and the next prime minister. Investors need to pay attention, as the Home Secretary is now the odds-on favourite (following Michael Gove\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempt to torpedo Boris Johnson this morning). May has said that: Last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EU referendum is irreversible; the will of the people must be respected. May wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t trigger Article 50 before the end of this year (which means she would trigger it) She doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcemergency budget\u00e2\u20ac\u2122; fiscal issues should be tackled in an autumn statement as usual. She also suggests that the target of a budget surplus by 2020 could be ditched, if necessary. Our Politics Liveblog has full details. We also have new current account figures for the UK, and they paint an alarming picture. The gap between the amount of goods, services and investment coming into the UK, and going out, was an eye-watering \u00c2\u00a332.593bn in January-March. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 6.9% of GDP, and only slightly better than the \u00c2\u00a333.963bn recorded in October-December 2015. Newsflash: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy suffered a deeper plunge after the 2008 financial crisis than previously thought. The Office for National Statistics has revised its data, and concluded that UK GDP shrank by 6.3%, not 6.1% as first thought. They also confirmed that the UK GDP grew by 0.4% in the last quarter. Big breaking news in the UK: Michael Gove, one of the key Leave campaigners, has announced that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s running for the leadership of the Conservative Party. And he has also launched a potentially devastating attack on Boris Johnson, saying the ex-Mayor of London lacks the leadership to be prime minister. Our Politics Liveblog has full coverage: Billionaire investors-turned-philanthropist George Soros has warned European politicians that the Brexit vote is a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchuge shock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to their economy. Speaking in Brussels this morning, Soros warned that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum has unleashed a new crisis on Europe. He predicted that the continental banking system will be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcseverely tested\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, at a time when it hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recovered from the eurozone debt crisis. Soros cautioned EU leaders to heed the concerns of UK voters, and not to punish them for last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote. He repeated his call for Germany to drop its opposition to collective eurozone borrowing. And he urged leaders to take advantage of record low borrowing costs, and Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top-ranked AAA credit rating. The refugee crisis poses an existential threat to Europe. It is the height of irresponsibility to allow the EU to disintegate without utilising all its resources. Throughout history, governments have issued bonds in response to national emergencies. When should the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s triple-A rating be put to use, if not when the EU is in mortal danger? Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a video clip: Ripples from the Brexit vote have reached Singapore. Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third-biggest lender has temporarily stopped issuing loans on London properties, due to uncertainty over the EU referendum vote. European stock markets are dropping back in early trading, after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprising surge. The main indices are all in the red. The FTSE 100 has dropped by 0.7%, after jumping 3.5% yesterday. In London, Royal Bank of Scotland is leading the selloff, down 5%. Building firms are also dropping back, with Berkeley Group down 3.5%. The pound is also in a state of torpor this morning, hovering around the $1.34 mark. Sterling has struggled to make much recovery after Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record plunge, and hit a 31-year low of $1.31 in Monday. Bank shares have been pummelled since the referendum result, including Virgin Money\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s which at one point had lost 30% of its value. The bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boss Jayne-Anne Gadhia has told BBC Radio 4 Today programme that sentiment should improve. She said regulators had made banks stronger, well capitalised and highly liquid since the 2008 crisis. And she also played down the impact of low interest rates on banks saying a strong economy was more important. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People should not panic,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said, and keep moving home, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Post-Brexit we should all get together and have confidence about the future.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A rallying cry? Sir Richard Branson who owns a stake in the bank has been calling for action, and told the Guardian on Tuesday that Chinese investors are pulling out of investment. When the going gets tough, you need a tough central banker to step in. So Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, is going to do his best to prevent last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote triggering a financial crisis. Carney will give a speech at 4pm BST today, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expecting him to reassure investors and the public that the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contingency measures are working. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also be quizzed by reporters about the impact of the EU referendum on the UK economy, and its implications for growth and monetary policy. Analysts at Royal Bank of Canada say Carney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech will be closely watched in the City, and beyond: In the UK the main event for markets is likely to be a hastily scheduled speech by Governor Carney with the title \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Uncertainty, the economy and policy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This will be at 4pm BST. Given the title of the speech we would anticipate getting some clues on whether our expectation of prompt rate cuts and a QE extension is what the Governor has in mind. Good morning. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an eerie calm in the financial markets this morning. After a week of wild, referendum-fuelled moves, traders are taking a breather while they wonder how the Brexit saga will play out. Shares are dipping in early trading, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no repeat of the recent volatility (yet, anyway) Yesterday, the dear old FTSE 100 shrugged off its fears and surged by 219 points, or 3.5%. That means it has clawed back all its losses since the referendum result rocked Europe... ... however, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not as simple as that. The Footsie is priced in sterling, which is still close to its 31-year lows. So price the index in dollars, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still way down. The real drama today will be in Westminster, not the City, with nominations for the Conservative party leadership closing at noon, and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn facing a leadership challenge from Angela Eagle. But European markets will still be gripped by the unfolding consequences of the Brexit vote, which could hurt growth and harm companies across the region. Banks are under particular pressure, especially in Italy, due to fears of a flurry of bad debts if the economy turns sour. They also face the prospect of record low interest rates for even longer, eating into profitability. Also coming up today: Senior financial figures are gathering at a conference organised by TheCityUK - Brexit will surely be high on the agenda... At 9.30am BST, we get the final estimate of UK growth in the last quarter. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably confirm that the economy expanded by 0.4% in January-March \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all history now. The latest Eurozone inflation figures are due at 10am BST, which may show that prices were flat last month.",
