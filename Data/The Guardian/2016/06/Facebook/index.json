It could widen further if Britain were to leave the single market, and be unable to sell services to the EU.</p> <p>And that would send the pound sliding hard, probably driving inflation sharply higher. </p> <p>Barings, who warn that Brexit would be likely to be highly damaging to the UK economy, explain:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Practically, the mechanism through which capital flows will need to be attracted into the UK has to be through a cheaper sterling. </p> <p>There has not been an exact match for this event in the past, but previous times of stress have seen sterling depreciate by 15% to 20% on a trade-weighted basis. Research we have seen suggests that sterling could have to weaken by 25% to 30% in the event of Brexit, to continue to attract capital flows, slow imports and boost exports for the UK economy.</p> <p>However, sterling would not be alone. We would also expect the euro to decline in the uncertain aftermath of a vote in favour of Brexit, although sterling would be likely to be the weaker of the two.</p> <p>Of course, such profound currency depreciation would also have consequences for the UK economy.

LinkedIn is one of the best new business/sales tools in the world of B2B and in many ways competes head on with Salesforce. When Microsoft integrates LinkedIn with its CRM suite, Dynamics, what you have is a hugely powerful tool that is truly differentiated and one that poses a real threat to Salesforce. ... If anyone is going to be feeling unnerved by the deal, it\u2019s Salesforce. We should expect to see some sort of announcement from then in the months ahead.

The fact we are not seeing any degree of volatility in the latest polls, which all point to a healthy lead for the leave campaign is making investors risk averse. And here is the latest ICM poll, showing the Leave campaign further in the lead. Tom Clarke reports: Support for leaving the EU is strengthening, with both phone and online surveys reporting a six-point lead, according to a new pair of Guardian/ICM polls. Leave now enjoys a 53%-47% advantage once \u201cdon\u2019t knows\u201d are excluded, according to the research conducted over the weekend compared with a 52%-48% split reported by ICM a fortnight ago. The pound is down around 0.18% at $1.4221 following the poll news. It took 14 years for LinkedIn to grow into a business worth $26bn to Microsoft, and my colleague Sean Farrell has taken a look at the company\u2019s history: The $26bn deal for Microsoft to buy LinkedIn has done little to support stock markets, which are more concerned with a global slowdown and the consequences of the UK voting to leave the European Union. With talk of the latest ICM poll showing a lead for the Leave camp, markets have slumped once again. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell to its lowest level since March 10, down 70.79 points or 1.16% to 6044.97 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.8% to 9657.44 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.85% lower at 4227.02 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 64 points or 0.36%. The pound, having slumped earlier and then recovered, has now slipped back again against the dollar, down marginally on the day from $1.4252 at $1.4240. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said: Microsoft has clearly found another use for some of its cash, and while LinkedIn may have faded from view as the market focusses on the triumphs of Facebook and the travails of Twitter, the social network\u2019s database offers a tantalising way to expand Microsoft\u2019s reach once more. The use of debt rather than stock will reassure those that worry this is another sign of a market top, and will have the added benefit of raising the prospect of a buyer for Twitter. In an email to LinkedIn employees, chief executive Jeff Weiner says the Microsoft deal is best for the company: No matter what you\u2019re feeling now, give yourself some time to process the news. You might feel a sense of excitement, fear, sadness, or some combination of all of those emotions. Every member of the exec team has experienced the same, but we\u2019ve had months to process. Regardless of the ups and downs, we\u2019ve come out the other side knowing beyond a shadow of a doubt, this is the best thing for our company. He continues: Some of you may be asking \u201cWhy Microsoft?\u201d Long before [Microsoft boss} Satya [Nadella] and I first sat down to talk about how we could work together, I had publicly shared my thoughts on how impressive his efforts were to rapidly transition Microsoft\u2019s strategy and culture. After all, it\u2019s extremely rare to see a company of that scope and scale move so quickly to make fundamental changes. The Microsoft that has evolved under Satya\u2019s leadership is a more agile, innovative, open and purpose-driven company. It was that latter point that first had me thinking we could make this work, but it was his thoughts on how we\u2019d do it that got me truly excited about the prospect.... Essentially, we\u2019re both trying to do the same thing but coming at it from two different places: For LinkedIn, it\u2019s the professional network, and for Microsoft, the professional cloud. [On the structure of the deal] I had no idea what Satya was going to propose, but knew how difficult acquisition integrations could be if not established the right way from the start. Long story short, Satya had me at \u201cindependence.\u201d In other words, his vision was to operate LinkedIn as a fully independent entity within Microsoft, a model used with great success by companies like YouTube, Instagram and WhatsApp. Meanwhile back in the foreign exchange market, sterling has recovered all its losses ahead of the forthcoming ICM poll. Despite the excitement about the $26bn deal for Microsoft to buy LinkedIn, the overall US market has failed to move into positive territory. With worries about a global slowdown and the impact of a vote by the UK to leave the EU, the Dow Jones Industrial average has dipped 0.02%, Nasdaq is down 0.12% and the S&amp;P 500 is 0.13% lower. With Twitter shares up on speculation it could be the next to be snapped up after LinkedIn, some believe a deal could make sense. Saxo Bank head of equity Peter Garnry thinks Google could buy the business by the year end. Twitter has 350 millions users, but it has been a problem for the company to grow its user base, he said. Nevertheless Twitter has managed to increase its cash flow profitability over the last 4-5 quarters and on a cashflow basis the company is improving rapidly. He said it had been difficult for Google to create a social media space stronghold and for that reason he thought Twitter would be a good fit for Google. This deal even beats that $19bn which Facebook splashed out on WhatsApp in February 2014..... Microsoft is getting the cash for this deal though issuing new debt, rather than tapping its own cash pile. Why would it do that? Because it\u2019s more tax efficient; Microsoft won\u2019t have to repatriate any of the cash currently held offshore back into the US (where it would face higher taxes). [Oxfam singled out Microsoft in a report condemning tax havens back in April] Here\u2019s Alex Hern\u2019s news story on the Microsoft-LinkedIn deal: And here\u2019s a flavour: If the deal with Microsoft goes through as planned, Jeff Weiner, who joined LinkedIn in 2008 as the company\u2019s president before becoming chief executive later that year, will stay on in his current role, reporting directly to Microsoft boss Satya Nadella. In a statement, Nadella hinted at the competitive advantage he expects the network to provide for Microsoft. He said LinkedIn would pair well with the company\u2019s business-focused software such as Office and customer relationship manager Dynamics. Over on Wall Street, LinkedIn shares have jumped by 47% to $193 in early trading. That\u2019s close to the $196 per shares which Microsoft is paying, suggesting the deal is expected to pass. Microsoft\u2019s shares have fallen by 4% \u2013 as explained earlier, that\u2019s a typical reaction when a company announces a significant acquisition. And this really is a significant deal, as the BBC\u2019s Rory Cellan-Jones explains: Social media is buzzing with reaction to Microsoft\u2019s $26bn cash splurge acquisition: LinkedIn gives Microsoft a serious presence in the business social networking business, says mobile analyst Ben Wood of CCS Insight: Shares in Twitter are rallying in early trading; perhaps on speculation that it could now be snapped up. This is Satya Nadella\u2019s biggest deal since he replaced Steve Ballmer as Microsoft\u2019s CEO in February 2014. Nadella says he\u2019s been thinking about buying LinkedIn for a while, and he\u2019ll need to persuade analysts that it really makes sense, given the huge price tag. It also dwarfs MS\u2019s other recent deals - buying Nokia\u2019s mobile phone business for $7bn in 2013, and online telephony firm Skype for $8.5bn in 2011. The Nokia deal hasn\u2019t been a great success, given Microsoft laid off 1,850 staff at its smartphone business last month. The Economist\u2019s Stanley Pignal is hoping that the deluge of LinkedIn notifications might now ease... Augustin Eden at City firm Accendo Markets (who doesn\u2019t sound like a great fan of LinkedIn) explains why Microsoft\u2019s shares are likely to suffer today: Shares in professional networking/dating/narcissism website LinkedIn are called to open around 40% higher at the US open after confirmation it has welcomed a mammoth takeover approach from Microsoft constituting a nigh on 50% premium over Friday\u2019s share price close. Shares in Microsoft were understandably suspended from trading in the lead-up to this bit of news, given that the traditional reaction to such an announcement often involves a shareholder exodus from the predator. With this deal lightening Microsoft\u2019s coffers to the tune of $26bn, make that an exodus of biblical proportions. Today\u2019s announcement is full of cheerful quotes justifying the deal. Here\u2019s a selection: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella: \u201cThe LinkedIn team has grown a fantastic business centered on connecting the world\u2019s professionals. Together we can accelerate the growth of LinkedIn, as well as Microsoft Office 365 and Dynamics as we seek to empower every person and organization on the planet.\u201d LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner: Just as we have changed the way the world connects to opportunity, this relationship with Microsoft, and the combination of their cloud and LinkedIn\u2019s network, now gives us a chance to also change the way the world works. LinkedIn chairman Reid Hoffmann Today is a re-founding moment for LinkedIn. I see incredible opportunity for our members and customers and look forward to supporting this new and combined business. I fully support this transaction and the Board\u2019s decision to pursue it, and will vote my shares in accordance with their recommendation on it. LinkedIn shareholders will be celebrating tonight.... Guys, there\u2019s only one joke about this deal...and it\u2019s been done. Many times.... Tech analyst Amir Mizroch explains the motivation behind the deal: Microsoft and LinkedIn have released a short video about the deal. In it, MS CEO Satya Nadella talks about his \u201cgreat admiration for LinkedIn\u201d.... and explained that his vision is to combine LinkedIn\u2019s productivity and communication tools with Microsoft\u2019s professional network. Cue uplifting talk about \u201cenhancing\u201d people\u2019s professional lives and \u201cempowering\u201d them to do better - either in their current job or the next one.... He\u2019s been tweeting that message too: Shares in Microsoft have slid by 5% in pre-market trading, as investors react to the news it\u2019s paying $26bn for LinkedIn. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Dennis Berman argues that LinkedIn has capitulated, by selling out to Microsoft. Walking away with $26bn (or \u00a318.5bn) ) is one heck of a capitulation, though.... This deal values each of LinkedIn\u2019s 433 million users at $60 each, points out Reuters\u2019 Peter Thal Larsen: Some users may be worth less.... Microsoft has swooped on LinkedIn four months after the company shocked Wall Street by missing its revenue forecasts. Back in February, LinkedIn revealed that its online ad revenue growth had slowed to 20% in the fourth quarter from 56% a year earlier. Financial analysts raced to downgrade LinkedIn, warning that the company\u2019s period of rapid growth was over. For example: RBC analysts said they had thought LinkedIn was on the cusp of \u201cfundamentally positive\u201d change. \u201cWe were wrong,\u201d they said in a client note. That helped to send LinkedIn\u2019s shares down around 40%, and laying the ground for Microsoft to strike a deal. Some big breaking news in the tech sector - Microsoft, the software giant, is buying business social network site LinkedIn for more than $26bn. The deal, just announced, values LinkedIn at $196 per share - or almost 50% above Friday night\u2019s close of $131. Here\u2019s the announcement. The deal comes five years after LinkedIn floated at $45 per share. But they were trading at $270 in 2015. More to follow..... While we wait for ICM to deliver their poll, let\u2019s hear a few words from George Osborne. The chancellor has just been interviewed by Bloomberg, and urged business leaders to back the Remain campaign. Osborne argues: \u201cPeople who are concerned or businesses who are concerned or investors who are concerned about the prospect of Britain leaving the EU should speak up. This is not the moment for businesses to sit it out.\u201d Some firms have already piled into the fray. Telecoms group BT has already written to its staff, explaining why it believes Britian should stay in the EU. But Sir James Dyson, the billionaire inventor, is backing the Leave campaign, and slamming warnings that Britain would be locked out of international markets. The US stock market is expected to dip when trading begins in 90 minutes time. That follows today\u2019s losses in Europe, and the big selloff in Asia overnight. ICM would like everyone to relax until they have finished working on their poll with, ummm, my colleague Tom Clark.... Hmmmm. No sign of that ICM Referendum poll yet. And its website has just crashed under the weight of web traffic looking for it.... City traders are bracing for fresh volatility, as polling company ICM is expected to release a new survey at 12.30pm BST. Another sign of European Brexit fears: Barings are also worried that Brussels would not cut Britain a generous deal if the public vote to leave the EU. They write: Post-Brexit concessions to the UK would send the wrong signal to other EU countries where nationalistic movements are growing. This could result in a political chain-reaction that could easily trigger a series of national referendums in numerous member countries. In terms of financial commitments, if the UK leaves the EU, it would save around \u00a310 billion in net contributions. The government would, however, be likely to need to step in to help sectors and regions which would stop receiving European structural funds, and which could be disproportionately affected by tariffs on trade. It is also not yet known what level of payment would be required to permit the UK business sector to access the 500 million people living in the EU. How badly could the pound be hit by a victory for Brexit campaigners? Well...economists at Barings Asset Management predict this morning that sterling could slump by a fifth! They point out that Britain is running a huge current account deficit, due to importing far more than it exports. It could widen further if Britain were to leave the single market, and be unable to sell services to the EU. And that would send the pound sliding hard, probably driving inflation sharply higher. Barings, who warn that Brexit would be likely to be highly damaging to the UK economy, explain: Practically, the mechanism through which capital flows will need to be attracted into the UK has to be through a cheaper sterling. There has not been an exact match for this event in the past, but previous times of stress have seen sterling depreciate by 15% to 20% on a trade-weighted basis. Research we have seen suggests that sterling could have to weaken by 25% to 30% in the event of Brexit, to continue to attract capital flows, slow imports and boost exports for the UK economy. However, sterling would not be alone. We would also expect the euro to decline in the uncertain aftermath of a vote in favour of Brexit, although sterling would be likely to be the weaker of the two. Of course, such profound currency depreciation would also have consequences for the UK economy. It would be highly inflationary. In turn, this would present the Bank of England with a particular dilemma; whether to raise interest rates to control inflation and risk slowing the UK economy, or do nothing, look through and see inflation rise by as much as 4% or 5%. Ironically, the London stock markets is suffering less of a selloff than the rest of Europe today. The FTSE is currently down 31 points, or 0.5%, while French stock are down a whopping 1.4%. And that\u2019s because analysts believe British companies will benefit from a weaker pound. It would make exporters more competitive, and boost earnings in foreign currencies. Pharmaceutical giant Glaxo and tobacco firms BAT and Imperial are thus among the risers today. Deutsche Bank analysts are advising buying London stocks, rather than the German equivalent. In the case of a Leave vote in the UK referendum (a scenario to which bookmakers\u2019 odds attribute a 30% probability), we expect UK equities to outperform the European market, given the likely depreciation of the pound in such a scenario as well as the market\u2019s defensive sector structure. However.... UK companies won\u2019t benefit if the Bank of England is forced to hike interest rates to prevent a sterling crisis. Brexit fears have rippled as far as Prague. The Czech Republic\u2019s main stock market has fallen 2% today, to its lowest level in seven years. And next week\u2019s EU referendum is, apparently, partly to blame. Analysts at Pekao, a Polish bank, told clients that: \u201cHigh probability of Brexit (Britain leaving the European Union) remains the biggest short-term risk.\u201d The pound is hitting fresh two-month lows, as investors react to the tightening of the EU referendum race. Sterling is now down one cent against the US dollar at $1.4137, and more than eurocent against the euro at \u20ac1.254. And with stock markets still in the red, Joshua Mahony of firm IG says investors are worrying about Brexit, China\u2019s slowing economy and the possibility of US interest rate rises this year, Even if we manage to navigate the near term threats of a Brexit and a likely US rate hike, the continued slowdown in China will provide a remains a significant ongoing risk to global demand. It is clear that in a week which is relatively light on economic data, the focus will remain on the risk of a Brexit, which could destabilise not only the future of England, but also the European project as a whole. Reuters\u2019 Jemima Kelly flags up the latest odds: In another sign of global anxiety, Fitch has just cut the outlook on Japan\u2019s credit rating to negative, from stable. Fitch left Japan\u2019s rating at A (only the sixth-highest level), but warned that it is losing faith in its government\u2019s commitment to fiscal consolidation. Tokyo has just postponed plans to raise the sales tax, and could be forced into launching another stimulus package to spur growth. City firm ETX Capital believes there is a growing chance that Britain votes to leave the EU, given the latest polling. Joe Rundle, their head of trading, explains: Momentum is behind the Vote Leave camp as polls seem to show more support for Brexit than at any point in the campaign so far. We\u2019ve seen heavy selling and shortened our Brexit market price from over 80% - implying a one-in-five chance of Britain leaving the EU \u2013 to 66%, which indicates a one-in-three chance of Brexit. Betfair, the online gambling company, also reports that more money is being wagered on Brexit. It now estimates there is a 34% chance of the Leave campaign winning, based on betting patterns. Investors have also been dizzied by the flurry of opinion polls, which have shown the vote is tight: The cost of insuring against the pound tumbling against the euro over the next month has hit a record high this morning. Reuters explains: Euro/sterling one-month implied volatility, derived from an option that covers the June 23 referendum date and its aftermath, hit 26.3% according to Reuters data, exceeding the previous record of around 25% hit during the global financial crisis in 2008. The equivalent sterling/dollar one-month implied volatility also rocketed to 28.1%, close to its 2008 peak of around 29%. UK chip-maker ARM is the biggest faller in London this morning, along with financial stocks and miners. ARM is being hit by fears that a global downturn would hurt demand for its semiconductors, helping to drag the FTSE 100 down to a three-week low. UK banks are suffering from concerns over the EU vote, as Conner Campbell of SpreadEx explains: The markets got off to a dreadful start this Monday.... A healthy dose of drag from the Brexit-fearing banking stocks (especially Barclays and Lloyds) is adding to the FTSE 100\u2019s losses. With the referendum growing ever closer the pound is all set for an ugly week and a half, something immediately in evidence this morning. Cable [\u00a3/$] collapsed by another half a percent, leaving sterling at its lowest point against the dollar in 2 months, with a similar pattern occurring against the euro and a whole basket of currencies. This chart shows how the London stock market has dropped back to its recent lows: The London stock market is now at its lowest level since May 20. The FTSE 100 has lost 200 points since last Wednesday; today\u2019s selloff, plus the heavy losses on Thursday and Friday, have wiped out the gains of the last three weeks. As feared, European markets are falling at the start of trading. London\u2019s FTSE 100 has already shed 43 points, or 0.7%. There are deeper losses across the channel, with the French CAC down 1% and Germany\u2019s DAX losing 1.2%. Brexit is obviously a factor, as is new data showing Chinese investment growth hitting a 10-year low. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says that \u201crisk aversion\u201d is rife this morning: Investors continue to fret over global growth with China weekend data failing to inspire and the IMF sounding the alarm (again) over a Chinese corporate debt bubble. Anxiety persists about the risks of a UK vote to leave the EU (Brexiety?) and traders prepare themselves for a hat-trick of central bank updates this week - from the US Federal Reserve (Wednesday), the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England (both on Thursday). The pound is sliding against other major currencies this morning, as worries about a possible Brexit take hold. Sterling hit a two-month low against the US dollar in early trading, losing 0.5% or 0.7 of a cent to $1.4182, a drop of 0.7 of a cent. This adds to Friday\u2019s tumble, which wiped two cents off the pound. Sterling has also hit a six-week low against the euro, at \u20ac1.2592, as traders bail out of sterling. Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman, reckons the pound may drop further this week: \u201cAhead of the referendum, many look for sterling to underperform and the yen and Swiss franc to outperform,\u201d \u201cThe euro and central and eastern European currencies are vulnerable, while risk assets, in general, are expected to weaken on a Brexit victory,.\u201d Asian stock markets have already suffered chunky losses overnight, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei tumbling by 3.5%. Worries over the global economy, and Britain\u2019s EU referendum, also sent China\u2019s stock market down 2% and wiped almost 1% off the Australia market. Analysts at RBS Capital Markets say: The market opened in Asia in the same spirit as it closed on Friday: equity markets were under heavy pressure losing more than 2% across the board Money has poured into the Japanese yen, as investors flee shares and the pound in favour of safe-haven assets. That has hit Japan\u2019s exporters, who are already vulnerable to a slowdown in global growth. And investors expect more swings this week. Here\u2019s our latest story on the markets: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Hold onto your hats. Investors are starting the week in gloomy mood, which means we\u2019re going to see fresh falls on the European stock markets when trading begins. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares is expected to shed 1%, or 61 points, when the markets open. That adds to Friday\u2019s 116-point tumble, which wiped out around \u00a317bn of value. With Britain\u2019s EU referendum just 10 days away, traders are increasingly jump about the prospect of a Brexit. That\u2019s weighing on the pound, which is losing ground this morning as opinion polls show the race is still very close. The markets are also anxious about the state of the global economy, which looks bruised even without the shock of a Brexit. America\u2019s central bank, the Federal Reserve, meets to set interest rates this week. Few traders expect a hike at this meeting, but they are nervous that the Fed could still raise rates too quickly. Kit Juckes, currency expert at French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, explains why the City is so jittery: If the global economy does not slide towards recession, the Fed will eventually raise rates (timidly). That\u2019s the best-case scenario, one in which oil-sensitive currencies can gain, but China-sensitive ones will struggle. The risk is that growth slows more sharply in China, causing capital to take fright. Pity the currencies of nations with big current account deficits then [such as the UK]. There are other dangers lurking too, like the UK referendum, the US presidential election and rising anti-European sentiment into the 2017 elections. So, lots to worry about today.....",
