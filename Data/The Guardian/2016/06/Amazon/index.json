Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Bloomberg have helpfully captured the testimony from Unite about the Victorian workhouse conditions at Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse: Despite Mike Ashley\u2019s admissions of failings, he\u2019s still guilty of growing rich from treating humans like battery hens, writes my colleague Aditya Chakrabortty: If we learned one thing from Sports Direct owner Mike Ashley today, it is that he\u2019s not Santa Claus. He enjoyed repeating this message to MPs. Instead, he\u2019s a hardworking billionaire who just can\u2019t keep on top of everything in his company. Employees on wages that were effectively illegally low? True enough. Temp workers offered permanent jobs in return for sexual favours? No worse than what happens at Sainsbury\u2019s. Docking pay for anyone turning up a minute late? If it happened to one of Ashley\u2019s kids he wouldn\u2019t be too impressed. On he went, in a mealy-mouthed exculpation for utterly immoral behaviour. You wouldn\u2019t have thought, listening to the human bulldozer that he ran a warehouse ruled by fear. Where workers were expected to walk 20 miles a day and blared at over a tannoy. Where men too scared to call in sick instead went in and suffered a stroke. Where ambulances were called out to deal with births and miscarriages \u2013 including a woman who gave birth in the loos. All this happened at one of the key sites of the Ashley business \u2013 but to listen to the man, it was all down to overzealous managers and, besides, he couldn\u2019t be expected to keep an eye on every part of operations..... Here\u2019s Aditya\u2019s full take: Piers Hillier, chief investment officer at Royal London Asset Management, has issued a statement explaining his company\u2019s concerns. \u201cToday\u2019s select committee hearing has highlighted that significant corporate governance failings amongst the management of Sports Direct still exist and are yet to be addressed. We firmly believe that, over the long term, shareholder value is intrinsically linked to corporate governance and companies ignore this at their peril. \u201cIn our view, the long list of corporate governance failings at Sports Direct, highlighted at today\u2019s hearing, are a contributing factor in its fall from the FTSE 100. \u201cMr. Ashley frequently suggested at the hearing today that he has no oversight or knowledge of large parts of the company\u2019s business; this is extremely concerning for investors. It is critical that these issues are addressed and the likelihood of this being achieved will be greatly increased by strengthening independent oversight on the board.\u201d Royal London\u2019s stake in Sports Direct is worth \u00a33.85m, or around 0.2% of the company (not 0.0.2% as I wrote earlier, sorry) Sports Direct shares have been climbing this morning, and are now up 5%. That may show relief that Ashley didn\u2019t reveal fresh trading problems, or optimism that he might beef up the company\u2019s management. Other retailers are also rising, though, after a report showed spending rose in May. City AM have rounded up the best quotes from Mike Ashley\u2019s appearance: On being the boss: \u201cI can\u2019t be responsible for everything that goes on at Sports Direct. I can\u2019t be.\u201d On giving it his all: \u201cI can only do my best but my best might not be good enough.\u201d On corporate bonding: \u201cI dunno what you call it. Fun day? Corporate day? We call its Sports Direct day.\u201d \u201cThe value of Sports Direct is its people.\u201d On BHS: \u201cI can\u2019t resist it: 100 per cent I wanted to buy BHS.\u201d On ignoring PR people: \u201cI won\u2019t listen to them because I can\u2019t be house trained\u201d On why he gets up in the morning: \u201cI didn\u2019t build Sports Direct, Sports Direct built me.\u201d On whether or not he is Santa: \u201cI\u2019m not Father Christmas, I\u2019m not saying I\u2019ll make the world wonderful.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m Santa Claus.\u201d On answering questions from MPs: \u201cI\u2019m one human being! So stop it Paul! Let\u2019s keep things positive!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s been positive so far, stop making it negative.\u201d On women in the workplace: \u201cWhat do you call it...sexual...within the office? Harassment!\u201d On ending sexual harassment: \u201cSimple as that fellas. Not just fellas. Girls. Sorry.\u201d On sexual harassment at Sainsbury\u2019s: \u201cAre you sure it\u2019s not happening Sainsbury\u2019s? I think it probably is.\u201d On managers creeping on women: \u201cThey\u2019re repugnant, they\u2019re disgusting\u201d And here are some video clips: At least one City shareholder isn\u2019t impressed by Mike Ashley\u2019s admissions: They hold less than 0.2% of Sports Direct, though, compared to Ashley\u2019s 55%. City journalists have grumbled for years that Mike Ashley has failed to communicate with the press, in a way that isn\u2019t acceptable for the founder of a major company. But he has made some amends today, with a performance that few observers will forget. Crucially, Ashley has confirmed that standards at his company fell far below acceptable standards, as the Guardian exposed last year. In a significant admission, he said that the company failed to pay its workers the minimum wage, due to forcing them to queue for 15 minutes for intrusive security checks at Shirebrook. That\u2019s a breach of the law. Ashley also revealed that the company is being investigated by HMRC about this, and developing a deal to give staff backpay. He insisted, repeatedly, that he\u2019s been unpleasantly surprised to learn how staff have suffered at Shirebrook. For example, he\u2019d be unhappy if his own children were fined for being a minute late, as many staff have been. And he even conceded that too many agency staff were employed on zero-hours contracts -- another long-overdue admission. But although Ashley admitted that the buck stops with him, there were plenty of excuses too. He claimed that the boom in internet shopping had been a complete surprise, meaning Sports Direct obviously had to take on an army of agency workers. However, it\u2019s 21 years since Jeff Bezos founded Amazon. A retailer of Ashley\u2019s undoubted nous had plenty of warning that customers might perhaps choose to buy their Sports Direct socks online. And other companies have managed to embrace 21st century work patterns without creating Victorian workhouse conditions (as Unite put it). Ashley tried to set expectations, declaring: \u201cI\u2019m not Father Christmas, I\u2019m not saying I\u2019ll make the world wonderful. And at one point, he argued that the six-strikes-and-you\u2019re-out system could work, if \u201cexecuted correctly\u201d. But he also conceded that some parts of the system weren\u2019t fair - but haven\u2019t yet been fixed. That should have been a key issue for Ashley\u2019s precious internal review to address - given reports that staff are afraid to take time off work, or penalised for wearing the wrong clothes. Ashley argued that it\u2019s impossible for him to know \u201cevery single thing that happens in Sports Direct.\u201d, but he was worryingly vague about how Sports Direct had allowed the situation to deteriorate so much. His open admissions seemed to fox the committee, especially when Ashley freely conceded that Sports Direct has probably outgrown him. Ashley seemed to genuinely believe that he\u2019s better qualified than the unions to monitor workers\u2019 welfare - even though a staff member gave birth in the toilets because she was scared to take time off work. If Ashley was truly serious about fixing this situation, surely he would do more than agree to see Unite at his annual AGM. And the allegations that female workers were called \u2018fresh meat\u2019, and offered a permanent position in return for sexual favours, need to be fully investigated. The session ended with the remarkable scenes of Ashley ignoring his PR man and declaring his desire to rescue BHS from collapse. All terribly entertaining - but a cynic might wonder if this revelation might take our attention off Shirebrook. Full coverage of the session with Mike Ashley starts here. And coverage of the evidence from Unite, and from the agencies who supply Sports Direct, start here. Ashley has left the building.... Committee chair Iain Wright tries to get Ashley to agree to some concrete points. Q: Will you commit to a review of senior management at Sports Direct? Ashley suggests that he\u2019s got no problem with an independent review, but defends his decision to hold his own inquiry first. Wright then turns to some off-piste issues -- panicking Ashley that he might get asked about his freshly relegated Newcastle United. But no..... Instead, Wright turns to another retail crisis- the collapse of BHS. Q: Do you think Sir Philip Green [head of Arcadia] has done anything wrong? PR man Keith Bishop tries to earn his fee by telling the committee that Ashley won\u2019t comment. Q: Did you want to buy BHS? That\u2019s another unfair question, Bishop replies. Fair enough, Wright replies... and starts to thank Ashley for coming. But Ashley can\u2019t keep his mouth shut..... blurting out: I can\u2019t resist it. Yes, 100% I wanted to buy BHS. And he explains that he always thought there was real logic in fitting the two companies together. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m a saint.... it\u2019s because we could have made a successful business. [Background: BHS went into liquidation last week, putting 11,000 jobs on the line]. Wright asks if Ashley will reveal what happened one day. You\u2019ll find out a lot eventually, Ashley grins back. And that is the end of a remarkable session. Q: Do you admit that there have been aspects of business at Sports Direct that have made workers more exposed to exploitation? Ashley tries to dodge this question.... returning to his point about the security queues were too long. And then he insists that the review of working practice is ongoing -- It will carry on when I\u2019m in the grave. Q: Will you commit to meeting with Unite about their concerns? Mike Ashley looks highly reluctant to hold a special meeting with the union. Instead, let\u2019s have a meeting at our AGM in September. Everyone\u2019s welcome, he claims -- surprising journalists who were banned from last year\u2019s gig. Q: Why wait until September? You could meet Unite now. Ashley suggest the union is concerned about furthering its interests, not the workers. He then admits that he \u201csaid hello to them last year\u201d at the AGM \u2013 [hardly a wide-ranging discussion of the situation] Q: Could you sign up to a 10-point list of improvements, asks Iain Wright MP (clearly keen to get some commitments out of his witness). Ashley suggests that he might.... Q: Do you have confidence in the agencies you have used? Yes....but I\u2019ve also been surprised by the mistakes that have been made, such as the queues to get through security. Q: Well, who\u2019s to blame and who has the ultimate responsibility? Ultimate responsibility is mine, Ashley replies. I build this company. And then he repeats that Sports Direct may have now outgrown his ability to run it. This really isn\u2019t a typical performance from a top UK boss. Ashley is now arguing that he can\u2019t just wave a magic wand to fix everything that\u2019s gone wrong. But he\u2019s committed to fixing it - as long as MPs have a \u201creasonable expectation\u201d of what can be achieved. The committee look stunned.... Paul Blomfield MP tries to nail Ashley down - is it fair that temporary workers employed through Transline aren\u2019t able to take work elsewhere? If it\u2019s true, then it\u2019s clearly unreasonable, Ashley replies. You can answer your own question. Q: So why did you allow it? I don\u2019t take all the decisions, an impassioned Ashley hits back (and hits the table another two dozen times). Q: But aren\u2019t you negligent for not knowing the full details of how staff were employed? Let\u2019s say I had \u201cno idea\u201d, Ashley replies ruefully. That\u2019s not fair.... Ashley\u2019s mask of bonhomie is slipping -- he loses his cool with Paul Blomfield MP for questioning his claim that internet shopping forced Sports Direct to take on thousands of agency workers. You must accept that this was a phenomenon that we couldn\u2019t predict, and also accept that we\u2019ve made mistakes, says Ashley \u2013 giving his table a fearful thumping. Blomfield\u2019s point, though, is that other retailers have adjusted to e-commerce without such problems. Ashley says that agencies are experts at what they do that\u2019s why they use them. Really? I was hired after responding to an ad and then filling in a form, plus a very quick interview with somebody who only spoke broken English. The clincher was being asked if I could turn up at 5am the next day. I could, so I was in. [And that led to the investigation that exposed the conditions at Sports Direct] MPs are pushing Ashley to promise to take on more permanent staff. He argues that Sports Direct can\u2019t suddenly hire an army of permanent staff -- and he claims it was \u201cphysically impossible\u201d to predict internet shopping. Q: Would you consider taking on more permanent staff, rather than using zero hours contracts? Why not, why not, replies Mike Ashley. Permanent staff can deliver a better service for a company after all. We have moved hundreds of staff from zero hours contracts onto permanent roles, he adds. Some reaction from a frankly stunned financial press: A classic Freudian slip from the Sports Direct boss. Asked if he\u2019d seek independent help in changing its management structure, Ashley says it\u2019s hard to create a process to create a better \u201cincome\u201d. I think he means outcome. But Ashley is a billionaire, so maybe it\u2019s the same thing. Q: Has Sports Direct outgrown your ability to manage it? Probably, a long time ago, Ashley freely agrees. Q: You compared it to a small boat turning into a supertanker. So perhaps you should consider hiring someone who knows how to steer it? Again, Ashley agrees, saying he\u2019s been shocked by the evidence he\u2019s heard today. Some of the things you\u2019ve said today have shown that it\u2019s definitely outgrown me, he adds. What about the allegations that temporary workers were offered a permanent job in return for sexual favours? That\u2019s clearly wrong, Ashley agrees. And then he suggests that it probably happens at Sainsbury\u2019s too! Another bizarre moment, as Ashley is asked if he\u2019s a kind person. His PR man, Keith Bishop, tries to answer but is brushed aside. Jonathan Reynolds MP says Ashley\u2019s open performance means he doesn\u2019t need to bring a PR executive in future. We\u2019ll halve your fee Keith, Ashley jokes. Ashley then concedes that it wasn\u2019t kind for a worker to be told that she was selfish for leaving work on time. Q: Are you being investigated by HMRC for paying less than the minimum wage? Yes, Ashley admits. Ashley defends using agencies to supply workers - saying they are the experts in this area. He\u2019s now blaming the boom in online shopping, which has meant Shirebrook needed more and more workers. He admits that the warehouse doesn\u2019t yet have the automation it needs (something we flagged up in our investigation). And he admits that the queues at security have been unacceptable. I\u2019ve never quite seen a performance from a CEO like this one. Ashley just told MPs that \u201cI\u2019ve not always been on my game, but if you judge that then you throw out the other 30 years when I was on my game.\u201d This makes him a tricky target to hit..... Ashley is promising progress on his independent review within 180 days.... There\u2019s some curious note-passing going on too.... Mike Ashley then explains that retail is unpredictable - it rains sometimes, don\u2019tya know. Working out how to supply stock across a whole retailer is an art. Q: So, is it correct that 80% of Sports Direct staff are on zero-hours contracts? Couldn\u2019t some move onto a permanent contract? Yup, Ashley grunts, and then gives his table another thumping. It\u2019s a reasonable idea, and he intends to make progress on it. Q: Are you happy that a Sports Direct worker was called selfish, for ending their shift on time? Mike Ashley has a think..... and asks if we\u2019re really sure that happened. Q: We\u2019ve got the evidence here... Oh well, in that case it\u2019s clearly wrong. Asked about pay, Ashley says 80% of directly employed staff in stores are on some kind of bonus structure. Q: Are you happy with the six strikes policy at the warehouse? Yes, if it\u2019s implemented fairly, says Ashley. There\u2019s then a brief moment of levity, as the chairman Iain Wright says Ashley sounds like a government minister (pledging an ongoing review). The committee ask Ashley about reports of Sports Direct staff getting drunk in the local city centre I can\u2019t stop people drinking, Ashley replies... What would you do about it, he asks? He\u2019s reminded that the MPs are asking the questions.... Q: Why were so many ambulances called to Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse? It\u2019s excessive, Ashley replies. But he suggests that staff have been overhasty - calling 999 when they could have just given the worker a glass of water. Q: I don\u2019t think calling an ambulance when a worker gives birth in the toilets is excessive... Ashley is silenced (briefly....) Q: Are you aware that a worker was promised sexual favours in return for a permanent position? I\u2019m 100% unaware of that, Ashley insists. We\u2019ve waited a long time for Ashley\u2019s hearing -- six long months since the Guardian exposed the situation at Shirebrook. But it\u2019s been worth the wait. Q: Could MPs drop in unannounced at Shirebrook? 100%, 24-7, Ashley replies. Anyone here is free to do it. I\u2019m telling you, you\u2019ll find things wrong, he adds - but things are getting better. Q: Are workers now getting paid overtime for working late? (the Guardian exposed that it didn\u2019t happen) Not yet, Ashley says. Q: And are you still haranguing workers over the tannoy system? Thumping the table again, Ashley claims this is a bit of a myth. We do use the tannoy, but to tell staff where to go - like an airport, directing passengers to their gate. If we are abusing it, we deserve the cane. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s within the committee\u2019s remit.... The committee now turn to the various offences that can get a worker Struck Out. Q: Why do you dock workers 15 minutes pay if they are one minute late? And in another major concession. Ashley acknowledges that the policy of docking workers 15 minutes of pay if they are one minute late is unfair. The Guardian\u2019s undercover reporters tested this. It also brings workers below the National Minimum Wage. Q: So who set it up? I don\u2019t know, Ashley replies. And furthermore, he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s fair. If it happened to one of my kids, I wouldn\u2019t be very impressed, he adds. A jaw-dropping moment. MPs are now asking why Sports Direct can\u2019t search workers BEFORE they check out. This is an obvious point - and almost certainly would have been done if it was that simple. But it\u2019s not as easy as that because of the current layout of the warehouse. Mike Ashley is now explaining that he knows his workers closely - he regularly eats with them in the staff canteen to find what\u2019s going on. Q: But does that mean you\u2019re the right person to investigate the allegations against the company? For as long I\u2019m at Sports Direct, the review into working practices will go on. And it will be totally independent, he replies. Ashley is now thumping the table, insisting that the review will be successful.  Q: Would you work with the Unite union to discuss the problems they\u2019ve heard? I can do a better job for the workers than Unite, Ashley declares. If you\u2019re just tuning in, Unite officials told MPs of a \u201cculture of fear\u201d at Shirebrook, which led one worker to give birth in the toilets because she was afraid to take time off. In 21st century Britain. Oh, the perils of business success.... The committee are keen to find what oversight Ashley has over Sports Direct. Waving his hands and miming typing, Ashley is explaining that the company creates thousands of reports. Staff should alert me when there are red flags and problems, not when things are running smoothly. Q: Transline [one of the agencies supplying staff] just told us that they only got 45 replies to a survey (out of 2000). Are you surprised? Ashley looks highly unsurprised - people say they want to give feedback, but they rarely take it up. That\u2019s why he prefers to talk to people on the shop floor. Q: What is the culture at Sports Direct? Miek Ashley pauses... then says it is a \u201chard-working culture\u201d, which should come with high rewards. He than concedes that he can\u2019t know absolutely everything that\u2019s going on all the time across the company which he has built. It\u2019s a truly global business, I can\u2019t keep track of all the companies we\u2019ve got across the world... it\u2019s just too big. Mike Ashley has now admitted that the searches revealed by the Guardian mean he was breaking the law by paying workers less than the minimum wage. This is a major concession and should mean sanctions from HMRC. The company said in December: \u201cSports Direct believes it\u2019s in compliance with minimum wage regulations and takes its responsibilities extremely seriously.\u201d Iain Wright MP asks about the Guardian\u2019s revelation that workers have been paid below the minimum wage as they were searched in their own time. Q: Do you accept that the company was effectively paying below the minimum wage? At that specific time.. yes, Mike Ashley admits. Q: And have you addressed it? I hope so, yes, Ashley replies. But I\u2019m not there all the time, he adds. Q: So are workers now being paid for those searches? No, Ashley replies. But the process is much faster, so \u201cliterally hundreds of people\u201d can walk through the security line each minute. Q: Have you discovered things that you\u2019re not happy with? Ashley admits that some things have come as \u201ca bit of an unpleasant surprise\u201d, and he cites the bottlenecks at the Shirehouse warehouse which have been addressed (he says). First question... Q: What\u2019s the status of the review into working practices at Sports Direct? It\u2019s an ongoing progress, says Mike Ashley. Q: When will it be completed? Never. Q: Why not, asks chairman Iain Wright? Because it\u2019s an ongoing process. Q: Are you the best person to conduct it? Ashley concedes that he doesn\u2019t have full expertise on the whole issue, but he believes he could make the most difference. Q: Who have you spoken to? All sorts of people across the operation Q: Have you spoken to the Trade Unions? No, says Ashley, but then he corrects himself and says he did have one discussion. He expects to hear from again at the company\u2019s AGM. Q: Is that the only time you speak to the unions? Yes. Mike Ashley has arrived, wearing a Newcastle United tie. His PR man, Keith Bishop, is here too. Reminder, you can watch it live here. And that\u2019s the end of the second mini-session. I can safely say that MPs were not impressed with what they heard from the two companies who supply staff to Sports Direct. Next up, Mike Ashley! More guffawing, as Transline\u2019s Jennifer Hardy claims that a face-to-face survey of agency workers at Shirebrook was \u201canonymous\u201d. Sports Direct workers aren\u2019t impressed with the agency\u2019s performance: (bit=but) Transline\u2019s Jennifer Hardy reveals that 45 staff, out of 2,000, responded to a survey about work conditions. She argues that this may show that people are happy. MPs, though, suggest it is because people are scared. Transline just said its office in warehouse has an \u201copen door policy\u201d. That\u2019s not quite how the workers view it - or I remember it. This from my piece in December: \u201cThe result seems to be a workforce afraid of the sack \u2013 but also afraid to quit and seek a job elsewhere. \u2018People won\u2019t leave because they don\u2019t think they will find anything else. Most of the Polish people who work there don\u2019t speak a word of English,\u2019 says one eastern European worker Everyone\u2019s afraid of the [employment agency] office. As soon as you go into the office you think they are probably going to sack you\u2019.\u201d Q: Do you believe that staff have been mistreated at Sports Direct\u2019s factory, asks Richard Fuller MP? I don\u2019t believe that, replies Andy Sweeney, CEO of Best Connection Group. He claims that the Unite union has misrepresented the situation at Shirebrook. He wants MPs to visit the site to see for themselves. Q: have you used the phrase \u201cNew Meat\u201d? No, Sweeney replies. It\u2019s used to describe new female workers at the factory, Fuller explains..... Q: Have you heard of people being hit, or being called selfish for finishing their shift on time? No. Committee chairman Iain Wright just brandished this table at the agency executives; it shows the various \u2018strikes\u2019 that workers can suffer. Offences include \u201chorseplay\u201d, \u201cgoing AWOL\u201d or \u201cusing a mobile phone\u201d. Six strikes and a worker is out. Q: Who set the strikes policy? Chris Birkby says Transline inherited the strikes policy when they began supplying workers to Sports Direct. Iain Wright MP points out that the policy means a worker could be dismissed if they asked for time off to visit family overseas. Transline\u2019s Jennifer Hardy argues that the policy protects workers  . Wearing headphones is banned, to stop someone being run over by a vehicle in the factory. The agencies are struggling to give any convincing reasons why a 336-hours-per-year contract is better than a zero hour\u2019s one. A zinger of a question from Iain Wright. After Jennifer Hardy, Transline\u2019s finance director, takes a sip of water, he asks if it\u2019s right that a Sports Direct worker would get a \u201cstrike\u201d for asking for a drink out of the designated area. Hardy agrees that this isn\u2019t right, but also suggests that employees don\u2019t want workers getting drinks all the time. Q: What have you done to improve conditions at Sports Direct? Transline\u2019s Chris Birkby says they have work to reduce queuing time to clock out, and started holding HR surgeries. We held a recent anonymous survey, and 96% of staff were satisfied, or above, he says. Transline\u2019s claim that it voluntarily withdrew from Gangmaster Licensing Authority process may surprise the GLA itself. According to the GLA, it\u2019s parent company, Qualitycourse, lost the licence after \u201c refusing to provide sufficient details relating to its travel and expenses scheme.\u201d The GLA said in a statement in 2014 that: For obstructing the inspection process, the GLA decided that the named Principal Authority on the licence, Colin Beasley, and other named directors of Qualitycourse had failed the \u2018fit and proper\u2019 person test. This is a critical requirement for a GLA licence. Another issue uncovered included workers not being paid for attending induction sessions, which failed another standard. Not exactly an \u201cadmin error\u201d..... Here\u2019s an example of the form which agency workers are handed, to sign up for a prepaid debit cards on their wages. Q: Do you feel a duty of care to the staff at Sports Direct? Yes, absolutely, the Transline representatives reply, Q: But we\u2019ve heard that the Gangmasters Licensing Authority has barred you from providing labour to the food industry. Transline\u2019s Jennifer Hardy says the company voluntarily withdrew from the application process. Q: Amanda Milling MP asks about the insurance which some agency workers are paying. Best Connection\u2019s Andy Sweeney says this insurance is optional. When the panel talks about a \u201c336 contract\u201d - they mean a contract that guarantees 336 hours over a 12-month period. This is equivalent to 1.4 hours a day, assuming a five-day week. So the distinction between 336 contracts and zero hour contracts is effectively meaningless. Q: Why are some workers being paid on pre-paid cards? (with those steep fees which Unite are so concerned about) Chris Birkby, Managing Director of agency group Transline, says the cards are optional. He defends them, saying they let workers get their wages quickly, and avoid being hit by high charges elsewhere. It\u2019s there to help workers, he insists. Andy Sweeney of Best Connection (the other agency firm engaged at Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse) says his firm doesn\u2019t offer these cards. Q: Where do the fees go? Birkby says some goes to Contis, the company which supplies the cards. But there is also a fee to Transline. Q: Why are agency workers on contracts only guaranteeing 336 hours per year? That\u2019s that\u2019s the minimum requirement set by HMRC. The committee are now hearing from the two agencies who provide workers to Sports Direct. Jennifer Hardy, Finance Director, Transline has just confirmed that Sports Direct sets the wage rates inside the warehouse. Mike Ashley had previously said that Sports Direct pays the agencies a fee and they take their cut, implying that he had nothing to do with the rates of pay. Some instant reaction from the committee: Here\u2019s our news story about the revelation that Sports Direct is going to compensate its staff, for effectively paying below the minimum wage: Q: What needs to be done to fix these problems? Steven Turner singles out the pernicious impact of zero hours contracts. New Zealand have outlawed zero hours contracts - and the companies who used them have managed to move onto rosters. He also wants the Gangmasters licensing authority given more authority to control agencies. And that\u2019s the end of the hearing. The Health and Safety executive needs to take a closer took at Sports Direct, and other warehouses, Turner adds. Q: Is Sports Direct willfully causing these problems, or is it a managerial misunderstanding? Turner says it\u2019s a \u201cdetermined business model\u201d, set by the top. There is no need to employ workers through these agencies, with on zero hours contracts or short-term contracts. If you cut out the agencies, you could pay staff more. Sports Direct has a \u201ccontempt for human rights\u201d, Turner continues, as he continues to lambast Mike Ashley for the problems at Shirebrook. Q: Who do you blame for the culture at Sports Direct? Unite\u2019s Steven Turner pins the blame firmly on Mike Ashley. It comes from the top, he says. There is \u201carrogance and contempt\u201d at the top of the company. We\u2019ve seen it described as a workhouse, not a warehouse. Staff call it a gulag. Q: What is the culture within Sports Direct? There is a culture of fear, says Luke Primarolo. People are scared. People are scared because they are working under a system when they know they could lose their employment at any moment. And he cites the \u201cstrikes\u201d which the Guardian exposed last year - such as taking a day off for a sick child or spending too long in the toilet. Six strikes and you\u2019re out. This is making people ill, Primarolo insists, and making workers a danger to themselves and others. He says there have been 110 ambulance call outs, 38 times when workers complained of chest pains. Unite have also found there were five instances of births, miscarriages of pregnancy issues, including one workers who have birth in the Sports Direct toilets. Q: Surely you\u2019re not saying you\u2019d get a strike for giving birth? You can get a strike for being ill too much. One of the Guardian\u2019s undercover journalists was offered one of these cards when he gained a job in the warehouse. Workers issued with these prepaid cards are being charged \u00a310 per month, just for the privilege of getting paid, Turner says. Q: So are they being paid less than the minimum wage? Staff are signing up to a service when they get these cards, Turner explains, so it not a deduction from their gross pay. But in reality, he argues, that is what happens. Q: How common is the prepayment debit card which Sports Direct uses to pay some staff? Turner says he has never come across such a thing before. And he explains that they are offered to workers from overseas, who don\u2019t have a UK bank account. Then he explains how it works...... They are charged to get the card, plus a \u00a310 per month management fee. Then charged 75p to use it in an ATM machine, and 10p when they get a text message confirming they\u2019ve used it. Turner says the company issuing the card charges a \u00a32 per month management fee, so who is getting the \u00a38?..... Q: Have conditions changed at Sports Direct since last December? (when the Guardian exposed the issues at Shirebrook)? Turner says that there have been no significant changes, although some improvements have been made. However, the 20p per hour pay increase announced recently have addressed the minimum wage issue. Jonathan Reynolds MP asks about allegations that workers at Shirebrook are being coerced into sexual relationships. Has anything been done about it? Turner says not. Unite have written to the agencies, and only received a curt reply from one. Turner is explaining that Sports Direct\u2019s short-hours contract given to agency staff is effectively a zero hours contract. It only guarantees 336 hours per year - so workers hit that limit and find they have no guarantee of extra work. Workers have been employed at Shirebrook for four or even six years, but are still on these contracts, even though the warehouse is open 364 days a year. Turner insists: There is no legitimacy for employing workers in a precarious way... either in the workforce or the retail space. Dignity and respect and justice is vital....and it\u2019s being denied to workers in this warehouse. Q: What\u2019s different about Sports Direct that attracts such criticism? Turner says it is the company\u2019s business model, which he fears is being exported across other industries. Primarolo adds that effective backstops need to be put in place to prevent Sports Direct\u2019s practices spreading. Q: Have workers received backpay for having received less than the minimum wage (due to the searches after their shift)? Not yet, Turner says, but there have been discussions with the company and HMRC over a proposed deal. That\u2019s an important issue -- as HMRC have the powers to intervene if a company is not following the law Steven Turner says that Unite has statutory recognition at Shirebrook, but only represents around 200 workers. There\u2019s no recognition for the thousands of agency workers. He adds that there\u2019s not been any agreement on pay for several years, the only discussions have related to the minimum wage issue. Luke Primarolo says there is no statutory recognition with SPD\u2019s retail workers. Chairman Iain Wright asks what input Unite have had into Mike Ashley\u2019s review of working practices. No input, Turner replies. The hearing is underway. First up.... Steven Turner, assistant general secretary of the Unite Union, and regional Unite officer Luke Primarolo. You can watch it here, or on Parliament Live. The press pack locked outside the hearing are getting restless, particularly Buzzfeed\u2019s Simon Neville: There\u2019s a small demonstration outside parliament against working practices at Mike Ashley\u2019s company: The committee are hearing from Sports Direct staff in a private session, according to The Times\u2019s Deirdre Hipwell: And that means reporters aren\u2019t allowed in yet. We should be underway shortly... Today\u2019s hearing will be broadcast live on the internet: Business, Innovation and Skills Committee: Working practices at Sports Direct (right-click to open in a new tab) Crowds are gathering at the House of Commons, with 30 minutes until the hearing begins. Reminder: Ashley is the headline act, at 11am, after MPs have heard from unions and recruitment firms (here\u2019s the agenda) My colleague Graham Ruddick points out that Mike Ashley has reinforcements at today\u2019s hearing: Last Friday, Ashley surprised the committee by announcing that he couldn\u2019t attend today\u2019s meeting as his lawyer wasn\u2019t free. He then changed his mind on Sunday and said he would turn up, perhaps stung by Iain Wright\u2019s suggestion that he had something to hide... Are grim working practices a price worth paying? That\u2019s not a question we\u2019d usually ask. But according to Jeremy Baker, retail analyst and affiliate professor at Europe Business School, workers at the bottom of the jobs ladder can\u2019t expect to be treated well until they\u2019ve \u201cworked their way up\u201d and proved they deserve better. He told the Today Programme that the BIS committee must realise there is a \u201cglobal labour force out there\u201d; people willing to be exploited in return for a wage. We can\u2019t just shouldn\u2019t push for \u201cdecency and middle-class values\u201d without seeing the cost in a global economy, he declares. Host John Humphrys gamely argues that everyone deserves to be treated with dignity, as listeners tweet their disapproval: BIS committee chairman Iain Wright isn\u2019t impressed either, asking if we really want a Victorian world where the mill owner occasionally throws some coins down for his staff to scrabble over? Iain Wright, chairman of the Business, Innovation and Skills committee, says he wants Mike Ashley to answer the allegations against his company. He told Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme that: Essentially we want to ask Mr Ashley are working conditions getting better? Not Just at the factory warehouse Shirebrook, but at retail outlets up and down the country. Wright is also planning to press Ashley on the allegations that staff received below the minimum wage due to the 15 minute-long searches after their shifts. The committee are also looking into the wider issue of Britain\u2019s labour market, in an era of job insecurity and zero hours contracts. What is the balance between rights for the workers and rights for the boss? The Today Programme has also spoken to some shoppers at Sports Direct\u2019s Oxford Street. One admitted that he\u2019d heard staff were treated \u201creally, really poorly\u201d, but he still shops at Sports Direct as it is cheap. Another pointed out that customers never really know how workers at any retailer are treated behind the scenes. Our undercover reporters took these videos last December, showing conditions inside Shirebrook: In the spirit of helpfulness, we\u2019ve pulled together the 10 questions which MPs should ask Mike Ashley today. They include: Has Ashley concluded his internal review, what were its findings and will it be made public? What has Sports Direct done to improve working conditions? How many teachers and community leaders did Sports Direct speak to during the review? After the allegations emerged about warehouse workers being paid, in effect, below the national minimum wage, Sports Direct pledged \u00a310m towards a staff pay rise. Does the company accept, therefore, that compulsory unpaid searches on staff leaving the warehouse meant they were previously receiving pay that was in effect below the minimum wage? Is Sports Direct being investigated by HM Revenue &amp; Customs regarding the allegations that workers have been receiving pay that is effectively below the minimum wage? Has Sports Direct had any discussions with workers or their representatives about topping up wages with back pay? Ashley has said: \u201cNo Sports Direct employees are engaged in the Shirebrook warehouse on a zero-hours contract, and the main agencies have confirmed to us that none of their workers are engaged on a zero-hours contract.\u201d Can he disclose what guaranteed hours warehouse workers are entitled to? Does Sports Direct influence the hourly rates paid to agency workers? Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse is operational 24 hours a day and for 365 days a year. The facility always requires a substantial number of staff, so why are the vast majority of the workers employed on temporary contracts? Will Ashley reveal if any temporary staff have been dismissed after falling foul of a six-strikes-and-you-are-out system at Shirebrook? More details here: Mike Ashley appears to have admitted that there have been problems at the Shirebrook site, even before the hearing begins. The Daily Telegraph are reporting that Ashley has written to his 27,000 staff, saying it has been a \u201cdifficult year\u201d but pledging to defend Sports Direct\u2019s \u201cgood name\u201d today. Apparently, the letter also shows that chief executive Dave Forsey is foregoing his four year share bonus, worth as much as \u00a34m. \u201cDifficult\u201d is arguably an understatement. Sports Direct shares tumbled in December, as our investigation was immediately followed by poor trading figures. In January, SPD issued a profit warning, and in March shares slid again after Ashley told the Times that \u201cWe are in trouble, we are not trading very well\u201d. The company has also been ejected from the FTSE 100, after its value fell by around 40%. Sports Direct have issued a statement to the City, ahead of today\u2019s hearing. It confirms that executive deputy chairman Mike Ashley will answer questions about conditions at Shirebrook, and discuss the review of agency workers terms and conditions, prompted by our investigation. Ashley also pays tribute to his staff, saying: \u201cOn behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all of the people at Sports Direct for their hard work, commitment and amazing achievements over the years. I and the Board are proud of our people and what we stand for, and I know that we can move onwards and upwards for the benefit of all of our stakeholders.\u201d Good morning. Six months ago, the Guardian revealed that working conditions at Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, fell below the standards you might expect from one of our largest retailers. Two undercover reporters discovered that staff at Mike Ashley\u2019s operation were subjected to a regime of daily searches \u2013 after their shift had ended. That meant that some were effectively being paid below the legal minimum wage, as they were forced to roll up their trouser legs and show the top of their underwear in their own time, to prove they weren\u2019t stealing stock. Things weren\u2019t any better during the shifts, we learned. Workers would be regularly chivied by tannoy, as they trudged almost 20 miles per day around the site. We also heard that local parents were afraid to take time off work when their children were ill, and at risk of being fired if they broke some bizarre rules. No wonder unions talked about a culture of fear that left workers afraid to speak out, and calling it \u201cthe gulag\u201d As Simon Goodley and Jonathan Ashby reported last December: Mike Ashley, the publicity-shy tycoon, and his business have been widely criticised for the conditions at Shirebrook \u2013 known locally as \u201cthe gulag\u201d \u2013 where up to 5,000 staff clock in each day. It is hard to discern why the place is so maligned when you first arrive, but slowly the reason emerges. Step by step, minimum-wage workers are informed of what is expected of them for the headline rate of \u00a36.70 an hour (in reality, many receive less) \u2013 including being told they will walk almost 20 miles each day inside the warehouse as they pick products off the shelves. They can occasionally be harangued by name via tannoy if they don\u2019t move quickly enough \u2013 \u201cplease speed up with your order as soon as possible\u201d, the speaker system barks \u2013 while \u201ccrimes\u201d against the company \u2013 called \u201cstrikes\u201d and including \u201cerrors\u201d, \u201cexcessive/long toilet breaks\u201d, \u201ctime wasting\u201d, \u201cexcessive chatting\u201d, \u201chorseplay\u201d, \u201cwearing branded goods\u201d and \u201cusing a mobile phone in the warehouse\u201d \u2013 are punished. Six strikes in six months and you\u2019re out. The revelations sent shockwaves through the retail industry, prompting parliament to investigate exactly what is going on. After months of prevaricating, and speculation that he could be held in contempt of parliament if he didn\u2019t turn up, Ashley is now heading to Westminster for a showdown with the Business, Innovation and Skills committee. MPs will want to know how Ashey responded to our findings \u2013 he\u2019s been personally overseeing a review for months. The committee will also be hearing from unions, and from the agencies who supply shift workers to Sports Direct. Here\u2019s the agenda: At 10.00am Steven Turner, Assistant General Secretary, Unite Union Luke Primarolo, Regional Officer, Unite Union At 10.30am Chris Birkby, Managing Director, Transline Group Jennifer Hardy, Finance Director, Transline Group Andy Sweeney, CEO, The Best Connection Group Ltd At 11am Mike Ashley, Owner, Sports Direct Keith Bishop, Keith Bishop Associates We\u2019ll have rolling coverage and instant reaction and analysis to the hearing.",

The target is looking increasingly out of reach, but the broader ambition remains.<br></p> <p>You might therefore expect that Osborne would jump on these positive trade numbers, as a sign that his Long-Term Economic Plan is Working. But so far nothing.</p> <p>The Treasury says it is a matter for the Business department. But that doesn\u2019t explain the chancellor\u2019s silence on Wednesday, when official figures took everyone by surprise showing that industrial production grew at the fastest rate in almost four years in April.</p> <p>Larry Elliott, the Guardian\u2019s economics editor, has a theory about why Osborne remains tight-lipped. [Quick clue: EU referendum.]</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2016/jun/08/why-upbeat-uk-manufacturing-figures-have-silenced-osborne-increase-production-eu\">In Larry\u2019s words:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> In normal times, George Osborne would have been all over the good news from the manufacturing sector like a rash. The figures from UK industry were better \u2013 a lot better \u2013 than the City had been expecting and showed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/08/british-industrial-production-grows-fastest-pace-four-years-manufacturing\">fastest month-on-month increase in almost four years</a>.<br></p> <p>So where was the instant statement from the chancellor praising the strength of the economy and the success of the government\u2019s strategy? Sherlock Holmes would have had the answer.

Ryanair is to take on Airbnb \u2013 by launching the Ryanair Rooms service in October, offering everything from 5-star hotel rooms to hostels and spare rooms in private homes.

Chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs said: We see this as a natural progression towards Ryanair.com becoming the Amazon of air travel. Catching up on corporate news\u2026 Argos has reported its strongest sales performance in two years as it prepares for its sale to Sainsbury\u2019s, but also revealed it had set aside \u00a330m to compensate store card customers who were charged \u201cexcess fees\u201d on late payments. It\u2019s not a massive amount of money \u2013 at most \u201cdouble-digit pounds\u201d per customer. But it\u2019s a bit embarrassing, just before the sale of the business to Sainsbury\u2019s which is expected to go through in the autumn. George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: Given the pending takeover, the board of Sainsbury\u2019s will probably be shaking their heads at the news, though in the grander scheme of things the sum involved is not enough to derail the deal. On a brighter note, 4K televisions, computers and tablets sold well in the first quarter; washing machines and gardening equipment didn\u2019t. You can read the full story here. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown, has a take on the drop in 10-year UK bond yields to a record low. While all eyes have been on the EU referendum campaign, gilt yields have been slipping, fast. The US Federal Reserve is backing away from interest rate rises following wavering employment data, and in Europe the central bank is pumping billions of euros into the bond market every month in the form of quantitative easing, both of which have served to drive yields down. The low yield on government bonds paints a pretty pessimistic picture of the global economy, and suggests we are set for an extended period of low or negative inflation, and weak economic performance. The question though is whether one can really trust an indicator which has been so heavily distorted by central bank stimulus measures. Back at the Brussels Economic Forum, European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici and Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos have both identified Brexit as a potential crisis facing Europe. Moscovici: A year ago we were talking about Grexit, now we are talking about positive integration. There are several crises around... Brexit, hopefully it will be remain but we await that... The jobless claims will be a relief to those investors concerned by last week\u2019s shockingly weak payroll numbers. The non-farm payrolls showed just 38,000 jobs were added in the US in in May, compared with expectations of a 164,000 increase. It was the slowest rate of growth since September 2010. There were 264,000 jobless claims in the US last week, slightly down on the 268,000 a week earlier. It was a bigger-than-expected fall, with economists forecasting 27o,000 claims. It was also lower than the four-week average of 269,500. US markets are expected to open lower, as bond markets rally: Investors are selling shares and buying bonds, considered to be less risky assets at times of heightened uncertainty. Benchmark 10-year German bund yields have hit record lows, while Germany\u2019s DAX is the biggest faller among the major European equity markets. Draghi\u2019s rather gloomy comments earlier - when he appeared frustrated at the lack of progress on structural reforms by eurozone countries - is also weighing on investor sentiment. FTSE 100: -0.9% at 6,247 Germany\u2019s DAX: -1.3% at 10,084 France\u2019s CAC: -0.9% at 4,408 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.2% at 8,810 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.7% at 17,777 Pierre Moscovici, European Commissioner for economic and financial affairs, is speaking at the Brussels Economic Forum. He says that while he understands structural reforms have negative connotations in some countries and can be politically difficult to push through, \u201cwe need to stand firm\u201d. The way to tackle long-term unemployment and reduce social exclusion is through structural reforms, he says. Output growth will increasingly depend on our ability to improve productivity growth and investment. The key to this is investment in \u201chuman capital\u201d he says, partly through education and training. I want reform to mean progress. Rolls-Royce is one of the FTSE 100\u2019s biggest fallers, down 3.4% at 590.5p. The chief executive of the aircraft engine maker has apparently written to staff warning them that the company is falling behind on deliveries. Warren East urged his colleagues to work hard to ensure profit targets for this year are met, the FT reports. He wrote: [The] business remains in reasonable shape with opportunities and issues broadly balanced. Delivery issues mean there is a lot to do in the second half and hence a higher risk. East acknowledged times were tough for staff at Rolls-Royce, which issued issued a string of profit warnings and cut jobs. He told staff: Right now I do know that in many parts of the organisation that discomfort is very real indeed \u2026 For many at the moment \u2018transformation\u2019 is simply unpleasant. I appreciate that this is a difficult environment, difficult enough just to do the job, without people like me preaching about \u2018pace\u2019. If we really want to be the Rolls-Royce of our industry we must push through overdue changes we all know we have to make. Catching up on some corporate news, Amazon begins fresh food deliveries in parts of London today. Taking on Britain\u2019s supermarkets, Amazon Fresh will offer more than 130,000 groceries to homes in north and east London, including thousands of fresh produce, dairy and bakery items that the company has not previously sold in the UK. The service is available to Amazon Prime customers, who pay a subscription in return for fast delivery of goods. Ajay Kavan, vice-president of Amazon Fresh, said the key to the success of the service would be a combination of low prices, vast selection and fast delivery. The Guardian\u2019s Sarah Butler has the full story here. Low-income households are likely to shoulder a disproportionate share of the costs of Brexit if the UK votes to leave the EU in this month\u2019s referendum, a respected thinktank has warned. Under a worst-case scenario some low-income households could receive as much as \u00a35,542 per year less in tax credits and benefit payments in 2020, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. NIESR concludes that Brexit would knock government tax receipts and so force changes to tax and spending policies, assuming the government sticks to tough goals under George Osborne\u2019s fiscal charter to get the public finances into surplus. Angus Armstrong, one of the report authors, said: \u201cOur analysis combines the consensus of macroeconomic forecasts with the spirit of the government\u2019s fiscal charter. Based on these assumptions, our results show that a disproportionately large share of the costs of Brexit is likely to fall on low-income households.\u201d (Full story here.) We\u2019ve got more reaction to those better-than-expected UK trade figures. Not everyone is convinced that trade will make a positive contribution to GDP in the second quarter. David Kern, British Chambers of Commerce: While the fall in the trade deficit is welcome, it still remains unacceptably large and is likely to be a drag on UK growth in Q2. April\u2019s figures also highlight the need for the government to do more to support exporters, including improved access to finance for companies looking to break into new fast-growing economies. Martin Beck, EY ITEM Club: While export volumes were up 4.3% in the three months to April compared with the previous three months, import volumes were up by 4.6% over the same period. So as things stand net trade is likely to exert a drag on GDP growth in Q2, unless April\u2019s apparent export strength is sustained. The chances of this happening would appear to be relatively low. Global growth remains pretty subdued and sterling has regained a good chunk of its losses from earlier in the year, so the backdrop for exporters remains very challenging. George Soros, the billionaire investor who famously helped to force the pound out of the exchange rate mechanism on Black Wednesday in 1992, has been speaking about Brexit. He told the Wall Street Journal that a combination of Brexit, problems in Greece, and the migration crisis, could result in the a collapse of the European Union: If Britain leaves, it could unleash a general exodus, and the disintegration of the European Union will become practically unavoidable. Soros added however that the recent strength in the pound was a sign that momentum was behind the remain camp in the referendum debate. I\u2019m confident that as we get closer to the Brexit vote, the remain camp is getting stronger. Markets are not always right, but in this case I agree with them. Turning to other events, there has been more reaction to Wednesday\u2019s shock sessions on BHS, where MP\u2019s quizzed key members of the BHS team about the collapse of the high street retailer. Among other things, the former owner of BHS, Dominic Chappell, was accused of threatening to kill the retailer\u2019s chief executive, Darren Topp. When asked by BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme whether he was surprised by the testimony, Oliver Parry, head of corporate governance at the Institute of Directors got it spot on: \u201cAbsolutely. Who needs Agatha Christie when you have Mr Chappell and the BHS management team yesterday.\u201d Exports grew more than imports in April, triggering a surprise fall in the trade in goods deficit. The news should be a boost to George Osborne, who has long argued that the UK economy would do better to be more reliant on manufacturing and exports, and less reliant on debt-fuelled spending. Back in 2012, the chancellor boldly set a target of doubling UK exports to \u00a31 trillion . The target is looking increasingly out of reach, but the broader ambition remains. You might therefore expect that Osborne would jump on these positive trade numbers, as a sign that his Long-Term Economic Plan is Working. But so far nothing. The Treasury says it is a matter for the Business department. But that doesn\u2019t explain the chancellor\u2019s silence on Wednesday, when official figures took everyone by surprise showing that industrial production grew at the fastest rate in almost four years in April. Larry Elliott, the Guardian\u2019s economics editor, has a theory about why Osborne remains tight-lipped. [Quick clue: EU referendum.] In Larry\u2019s words: In normal times, George Osborne would have been all over the good news from the manufacturing sector like a rash. The figures from UK industry were better \u2013 a lot better \u2013 than the City had been expecting and showed the fastest month-on-month increase in almost four years. So where was the instant statement from the chancellor praising the strength of the economy and the success of the government\u2019s strategy? Sherlock Holmes would have had the answer. Osborne\u2019s unusual reticence was a classic case of the dog that doesn\u2019t bark. Put simply, good economic news doesn\u2019t really suit the chancellor at the present juncture. His narrative is that the risk of Britain leaving the European Union has left the economy trembling on the edge of the precipice and for that story to stick he needs signs that consumers and businesses are taking fright at the risk of Brexit. Unfortunately for Osborne, the recent data is not at all helpful. Better weather brought consumers out in their droves in May, according to the British Retail Consortium. Now the Office for National Statistics has reported that industrial production was up by 2% between March and April at a time when the markets had expected output to be flat. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, says the figures suggest trade could make a positive contribution to gross domestic product in the second quarter, after being a drag for a prolonged period. April\u2019s data suggests that net trade could actually make a positive contribution to UK GDP growth in the second quarter, having been a significant drag in the first quarter of 2016 and through the second half of 2015. It lifts hopes that UK exporters will increasingly be helped by the overall marked weakening of the pound over the coming months. UK exporters will also be hoping that eurozone activity can hold up after an improved 0.6% quarter-on-quarter GDP expansion in the first quarter. However, the global growth outlook is still pretty uncertain, with the UK referendum on EU membership reinforcing this. More on those trade figures, which were better than expected and showed a surprise fall in the deficit. Goods exports volumes increased by 11.2% - the biggest monthly rise since records began in 1998. At \u00a326.1bn, the total value of goods exported in April was not far off the record high set in June 2013. Exports of British-made goods to the EU rose by \u00a3900m in April, while exports of goods to countries outside the EU increased by \u00a31.3bn to a record \u00a314bn. Andrew Sentance, former policymaker at the Bank of England, considered the annual numbers: Britain\u2019s trade deficit with the rest of the world fell more than expected in April following a record jump in goods exports. The deficit fell to \u00a310.5bn from a downwardly revised \u00a310.6bn in March according to the figures from the Office for National Statistics. The drop in the deficit was driven by a \u00a32.2bn increase in exports, to \u00a326.1bn. Imports also increased, but by a lesser \u00a32bn to \u00a336.6bn. Benchmark 10-year gilt yields have fallen to record lows, part of a global bonds rally as investors dump shares. Government borrowing costs fell as yields dropped to 1.224%, the lowest on record and down three basis points on the day. German bond yields also fell to near record lows, with the 10-year bund yield down 1.3 basis points at 0.043%. All major markets are down in early trading: Connor Campbell, analyst at Spreadex, has this take: Despite Brent Crude hitting an 8-month high the European indices got off to a sluggish start this Thursday morning. The FTSE once again fell away from 6300 as the European session began, the index dragged down by chunky losses for the likes of Vodafone, Johnson Matthey and Berkeley Group Holdings. Matters weren\u2019t helped by last night\u2019s Chinese inflation figure, which unexpectedly fell to a 3 month low of 2.0%, something that has arguably muted the impact of Brent Crude\u2019s latest rise on the commodity sector. Draghi is talking about employment trends in the eurozone and warns unfavourable demographic trends will create challenges. Employment growth [is likely] to decelerate in the not-too-distant future because of the fall in the working age population. Even migration is unlikely to fully offset this natural population decline. He says there is room for productivity improvement in all countries, and that the challenge is first to raise productivity in firms and then get capital to those firms so that can grow. That would boost the eurozone economy, and jobs, the central bank says. Draghi finishes will a warning that eurozone leaders must press ahead with structural reforms \u201cwithout undue delay\u201d, or risk lasting economic damage. The cost of delaying reforms, he says, is too high, because it creates damaging uncertainty and holds back investment. There are many political reasons to delay structural reforms, but very few economic ones. And the cost of delay is too high. Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, has taken to the stage at the Brussels Economic Forum. The man tasked with setting monetary policy for the eurozone is laying out some of the measures the ECB has taken over recent years. He says bank balance sheets are not yet fully repaired. He reiterates that governments must do their bit to boost the eurozone economy. The ECB can\u2019t do it alone. Fiscal policies should work with and not against monetary policy. Draghi says doubts over the future of the euro need to be addressed because they are holding back progress in the region. Firms may understandably choose to defer or abandon investment plans. This has been clear in the past when the future of the euro area has been called into question. It can also effect the saving rate of firms and households, leading to higher precautionary [spending behaviour]. There is a critical need for clarity on the institutional make up of the euro area. Many proposals have been put forward to overcome the [shortcomings] of the euro area. Brent crude oil prices have been steadily rising since the beginning of the year... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Oil prices are climbing higher this morning, following larger than expected drawdowns in the US and disruptions to supply in Nigeria, where militant attacks have driven production in the country to a 20-year low. Brent crude is currently trading at $52.70 a barrel, up 0.4%. It is the highest since early October. CMC Markets\u2019 Michael Hewson says there is no sign that the upswing in oil prices is going to end any time soon: While oil inventories still remain at elevated levels continued supply disruptions in Nigeria, have sent output to a 20 year low and this is helping underpin prices. The third successive weekly draw in a row has also helped sustain the uptrend for oil prices which has been in place now for nearly five months. With the US dollar also on the weak side there appears to be little in the way to stop the upward momentum behind the move higher in the oil price. Also coming up today... We have UK trade data for April at 9.30. Economists are predicting the trade in goods deficit to be unchanged at \u00a311.2bn. Mario Draghi is speaking at the Brussels Economic Forum and is due to take the stage shortly. The National Institute for Economic and Social Research will give its verdict on what a UK exit from the European Union would mean for low income households in Britain. In the US, we have the weekly jobless claims data, which will provide the latest snapshot of the labour market following shockingly weak payroll numbers last week. (p.s. If you missed the dramatic events on Wednesday involving death threats and \u201cfingers in the till\u201d at the highest level of collapsed retailer BHS, catch up here.)",

It promises \u201ceverything you need for your weekly shop\u201d, from artisanal Stilton to tangy cheese Doritos, delivered to your door in a cool box.</p> <p>Some analysts are predicting the US online giant could grab up to 3% of the UK grocery market by 2020.

Pure online businesses Amazon and Ocado are expected to benefit the most from the change as the current market leader Tesco, which controls about 40% of the online grocery market, loses out.</p> <p>Amazon\u2019s service ambitions could also force the whole market to raise its game. That may be good news for shoppers, but is likely to put another dent in the profits of suffering supermarkets.</p> <p>Amazon is offering refunds as well as substitutions for items which are not in stock and a huge list of 130,000 products \u2013 something the main operators do not currently match. Ocado offers about 48,000 items, less than 40% of the range Amazon can boast, while Tesco has about 70,000.

It is going to make other players pull their services up when grocery online is already not very profitable, and profits are under pressure with price cuts.\u201d</p> <p>Its potential influence on service could be comparable to the impact of discounters Aldi and Lidl on prices. They now jointly hold about 10% of the UK market \u2013 less than 4 percentage points more than three years ago \u2013 yet in that time traditional supermarkets have been forced to slash prices to try to match the discounters on key items to prevent shoppers deserting them in droves.

In the UK, many fresh food items \u2013 more than 2,400 products including pies and pizzas as well as fruit, vegetables and meat \u2013 will be supplied by Morrisons.

Those wishing to use Amazon Fresh must be signed up to Amazon Prime at a cost of \u00a379 a year, and then pay \u00a36.99 a month for unlimited deliveries of orders worth more than \u00a340. That would take the annual cost of getting the groceries to \u00a3162.</p> <p>That compares to a 12-month anytime delivery pass costing just \u00a360 a year at Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco.
