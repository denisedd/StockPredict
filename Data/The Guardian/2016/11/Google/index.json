Why do I, as CEO of a Boston-based company which looks to commercialise the most exciting discoveries spinning out of leading American universities and government institutions shuttle across the Atlantic to tell our story to British and other European investors? What do we get out of being a FTSE250 company when we could trade on Nasdaq, the market so many regard as the natural venue for the biggest beasts of disruptive technology? For Allied Minds, the answer is that we chose London because it is largely UK investors who understand our model. Indeed the case for our London listing in June 2014 was overwhelming because our biggest shareholders, such as Woodford Investment Management and Invesco Perpetual, were already UK based. Typically, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very different mindset in the US where venture investors only really start to become interested after the startup is created and is well down the track to selling its products or services.

Second, he needs to continue to give voice to the calmer, more gracious version of himself that was on display in his election night acceptance speech. </p> <p>No-one should expect him to repudiate everything he said in the campaign about open borders and trade deals such as the Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement. But the third test for the President-Elect will be to demonstrate that he does not plan to tear up the parts of the Washington establishment that are actually working quite well \u00e2\u20ac\u201c notably, the US Federal Reserve.</p> </blockquote> <p>Flanders points out that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic plans will have major implications for the global economy:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The combination of looser fiscal policy and increased uncertainty over globalisation would be likely to mean a stronger dollar and potentially higher US inflation and higher interest rates. That is not a hugely helpful combination for the rest of the global economy, especially emerging markets. But that, too, is uncertain and could take time to materialise. In the meantime, my colleagues and I are not predicting a radically different path for the US economy following this result - or for US interest rates.</p> </blockquote> <p>And remember, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s success or failure won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be measured in stock prices or foreign exchange rate. Flanders says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is about the kind of country that America wants to be.</p> <p>At the heart of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appeal was a promise to make it a nation that works better for the mass of voters who feel they have been left behind by globalisation and by the global financial crisis.

Republicans have a once-in-a-career chance to enact their full agenda will little opposition. If infighting spoils those odds, heads will roll.

Indeed, the markets seem to have decided that President Trump will be a relatively normal President, even if candidate Trump was a deeply unusual candidate.

Real estate developers like building stuff after all, Republicans are pretty keen on cutting taxes and this will be a lot easier to get through Congress for a Republican President. This is what incoming Republican Presidents do \u00e2\u20ac\u201d they cut taxes in a meaningful way and many supposed deficit hawks use<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-12-04/laffer-curve-napkin-doodle-launched-supply-side-economics\">back of the napkin logic</a> to tell themselves \u00e2\u20ac\u0153these tax cuts will pay for themselves\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. (Actually they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t).</p> </blockquote> <p>But to simply assume that America gets higher economic demand, lower unemployment, a pick-up in inflation and a return to normal interest rates misses the big pictures, Weldon says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Implicit in that line of analysis are assumptions about the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reaction functions and about productivity growth that need to be questioned. And, crucially, it misses the biggest shift that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Presidency could bring about \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a rejection of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153globalisation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd/economic openness.</p> </blockquote> <p>And if productivity remains low, some economists fear that steady wage growth, solid corporate profits and moderate inflation is an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcimpossible trinity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to achieve.</p> <p>There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lots more here:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DuncanWeldon/status/796698770138419201\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Post: Political Economy &amp;

                "bodyText":"It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official! The Dow Jones industrial average has closed at a new alltime high, as Wall Street continues to assess the impact of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election victory. After another day of volatile trading in world markets, starting with big gains in Asia, the Dow ended the day up nearly 1.2% at 18,807 points. It was a rally driven by companies who, investors think, will do well under a Trump presidency. That means banks (assuming the new administration repeals the Dodd-Frank regulations), and industrial firms (who would profit from infrastructure sending). But tech firms kept falling, hit by fears that immigration curbs or protectionist trade police would hurt them. Bloomberg has a neat summary: Amazon.com Inc. fell 3.8 percent to lead the rout in technology. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. jumped 4.6 percent and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. climbed 4.3 percent. Drugmakers advanced, led by Pfizer Inc.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 4.3 percent rally. Caterpillar Inc. added 2.5 percent. Procter &amp; Gamble Co. plunged 3.5 percent. Government bond yields ended the day higher too, pushed up by expectations of higher inflation and extra US government borrowing. The Dow is pushing higher, after Donald Trump and Barack Obama have their first meeting since the election. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s their first face-to-face meeting ever, in fact, Trump told reporters as the two men sat side by side, looking perfectly polite and rather serious. Our US politics liveblog has full details. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: Obama said the number one priority was to ensure a smooth transition, so Trump could be a successful president. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If he succeeds, the country succeeds,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Obama said. Trump said he had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153respect for the president\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and said they talked about some wonderful things and some difficult things. Asked if he would seek the advice of the president, Trump said Obama was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very fine man.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And this latest sign of grown-up behaviour in Washington DC has pushed the Dow up by 1.05%, or 195 points, to 18,785, on track for a record close. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m taking a break now, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back with the Wall Street close... Capital Economics says investors are still in the dark about Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans: There is clearly still a large degree of uncertainty regarding the economic policies of the incoming Republican administration. However, investors appear to be concerned about the inflationary consequences if Mr Trump were to pursue protectionist policies alongside a sizeable fiscal expansion at a time when there is a limited degree of spare capacity in the economy. After three hours of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average is still on track to hit a record close. Pharmaceutical firms, banks and manufacturing companies are all leading the rally, on predictions that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll benefit from Trumponomics. But technology firms are dragging the index back, due to fears that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll suffer under the next presidency. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the story of how the Dow defied forecasts and spiked after Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory: A new burst of volatility has driven the pound up against the US dollar, triggering a late selloff in London. Sterling is now up 1% at $1.251, as the markets continue to be buffeted as investors come to terms with Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s success. A stronger pound will be welcomed by importers, but it makes a dent in the value of international companies who earn money abroad. So the FTSE 100 has just closed in the red, down 83 points at 6827. The smaller FTSE 250 index, which contains more UK focused companies, finished 0.4% higher though. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a funny day in the London stock market, even by recent standards. Bank shares have jumped, mirroring the rise in government bond yields (banks would welcome an end to ultra-low interest rates) Mining stocks are also up, following the surge in commodity prices -- America will need a lot more metal to implement Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new infrastructure plan. But utility stocks, tobacco firms and other defensive stocks have slid today, some by over 5%. The International Monetary Fund says it is looking forward to working with Donald Trump, and isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t prejudging him. Spokesman Gerry Rice told a press briefing in Washington that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too early to speculate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about whether Trump would hurt the global economy. Rice added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need to wait and see what the policies will actually be and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be making an assessment at that time.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd European stock markets are heading lower in late trading, as Trump-inspired volatility grips the City again. The S&amp;P tech stock index has shed 3%, and is on track for its worst day since the Brexit vote (via Reuters). Technology shares are suffering a Trump slump today, as investors calculate that Silicon Valley could suffer under the next president. Shares in Amazon, Netflix, Alphabet (Google) and Facebook have all fallen by at least 4%, and Apple and Microsoft are in the red too. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism of companies who sent manufacturing overseas and hire large numbers of skilled workers from abroad, using the H1-B visa, could be bad news for the tech sector. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also no fan of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, whose Washington Post was pretty scathing of Trump during the election campaign. Investors large and small will be relieved that Wall Street hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t crashed since Donald Trump pulled off one of the most surprising election results of the age. But obviously the market reaction plays second fiddle to the wider consequences of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s choice -- as the protests in New York, Chicago, Boston etc overnight show. Stephanie Flanders of JP Morgan says Trump needs to pass three tests, as the world watches him closely. The first will be for him to build a strong cabinet, with respected figures in key posts of Treasury Secretary and Secretary of State. Second, he needs to continue to give voice to the calmer, more gracious version of himself that was on display in his election night acceptance speech. No-one should expect him to repudiate everything he said in the campaign about open borders and trade deals such as the Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement. But the third test for the President-Elect will be to demonstrate that he does not plan to tear up the parts of the Washington establishment that are actually working quite well \u00e2\u20ac\u201c notably, the US Federal Reserve. Flanders points out that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic plans will have major implications for the global economy: The combination of looser fiscal policy and increased uncertainty over globalisation would be likely to mean a stronger dollar and potentially higher US inflation and higher interest rates. That is not a hugely helpful combination for the rest of the global economy, especially emerging markets. But that, too, is uncertain and could take time to materialise. In the meantime, my colleagues and I are not predicting a radically different path for the US economy following this result - or for US interest rates. And remember, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s success or failure won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be measured in stock prices or foreign exchange rate. Flanders says: This is about the kind of country that America wants to be. At the heart of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appeal was a promise to make it a nation that works better for the mass of voters who feel they have been left behind by globalisation and by the global financial crisis. For better or worse, that is the standard by which every developed country politician will increasingly be judged. Whether Mr Trump will actually deliver with on that promise is another matter.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s be honest, most analysts had predicted heavy losses if Trump won the presidential election. And most analysts were wrong. There are four pragmatic reasons to explain why stock markets have rallied since Trump won the presidential race, says Jim Cielinski of Columbia Threadneedle Investments. Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the President\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will not be the same thing as Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the candidate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Donald Trump shifted and flip-flopped on several key issues in recent months, and often tailored his message to fit the circumstances. As president, his ability to define himself as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153winner\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will require a different approach, and most of his pre-election proposals will be modified. The speed at which the Republicans were uniting was very apparent in the hours following the victory. There was much dissent even within the party, but a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clean-sweep\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd soothes the wounds. Republicans have a once-in-a-career chance to enact their full agenda will little opposition. If infighting spoils those odds, heads will roll. Adversaries within the party, such as Paul Ryan, recognise that their own careers will be cut short if they fail to mend the wounds and push the agenda forward. Expectations that the cabinet in a Trump presidency may hold unusual power, and that the markets must wait to assess who is appointed before jumping to conclusions. For the markets, the recognition that stimulative policy still carries with it expansionary benefits, irrespective of the presidential qualifications or likeability of the man putting the ideas forward. Banks stocks are rallying this morning, with JP Morgan up 4% and Goldman Sachs gaining 2%. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re benefitting from speculation that the Republicans could ditch Dodd-Frank, the legislation brought in to avoid a repeat of the financial crisis. Pharmaceutical stocks are up too, with Pfizer gaining 3.6%. Drug companies are boosted by Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defeat, as she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d promised to end price-gouging. And construction and infrastructure companies are benefitting from Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promise to rebuild American infrastructure. Caterpillar is up 2%. Boom! The Dow Jones industrial average has hit a new intraday record high, as the Trump bump reached New York. Shares have risen at the start of trading in Wall Street, adding to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally, and defying predictions that markets would slump if Republicans won the race for the White House. The Dow is up 115 points, or +0.6%, at 18709. And the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq has gained at least 0.5% too: Investors are still optimistic that Trump will deliver a growth-friendly fiscal stimulus scheme, despite the concerns flagged up earlier in this blog. Indeed, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a remarkable u-turn underway, as Wall Street hopes that the billionaire businessman can metamorphose into a responsible president. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx says it shows how fickle investors can be: Before yesterday morning Trump was toxic yet now, following a vulgarity-free victory speech and back-peddling comments about Janet Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position at the Fed, he is the biggest turn-on the market has seen in months. Never mind mere stagflation, the markets are being spooked by a new and scary-sounding beast. Trumpflation! The Financial Times has coined this term, to explain the big selloff in bond prices today. The fear is that bond investors might stampede for the exits if the new president drives up economic growth, inflation, and inflation expectations, with a debt-financed stimulus programme. Andrew Wilson, global co-head of fixed income at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Under a Trump presidency we are more likely to see fiscal expansion that drives growth and markets are reflecting that. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There was already latent inflationary pressures from the jobs market - Mr Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election has added fuel to that. Long term inflation expectations are rising and that explains why bond yields are rising and the yield curve is steepening.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And if everyone tries to sell at once, yields could spike alarmingly and cause a bond crash. Alan Greenspan, the former head of the Federal Reserve, fears America is entering an era of stagflation -- rising prices, but little real growth. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been speaking on CNBC: Greenspan also backed Donald Trump over one issue - the regulation of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking sector - saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d love to see Dodd-Frank disappear. Ouch! A nasty selloff is underway in the government bond market right now. The price of debt issued by countries such as the US, the UK and Germany is falling sharply, driving up the interest rates (or yield) on the debt. Investors appear to be betting that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic policies will drive up inflation, should he succeed in slashing tax rates and embark on that debt-fuelled programme of rebuilding America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s infrastructure. As FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga puts it: Pledges of massive U.S fiscal spending have heightened expectations of Trump implementing fiscal stimulus measures, including tax cuts which may bolster profit growth consequently boosting inflation. So, bond prices are a sea of electronic red ink, as investors are less keen to hold low-yielding government bonds in a world of higher inflation. Lower bond prices shows that governments must pay more to service their national debts. The UK 10-year gilt yield has jumped to 1.335%, from 1.25% last night. The US 10-year Treasury yield is up at 2.09%, from 2.06% The German 10-year bund yield has spiked to 0.29%, from 0.17% Longer-dated debt is also weakening: We should remember that bond yields have been driven down to record low levels in recent years, as central banks have hoovered them up through their quantitative easing schemes. So a return to normal levels wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a disaster. Except....a hefty bond selloff would suggest alarm in the markets, and inflict losses on those who have bought at the elevated levels recently. And that may explain why the FTSE 100 is now negative, and other European markets are lower as this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Trump Bump threatens to fizzle out. Investors may be taking a big risk by deciding that Donald Trump will become a new man once he crosses the seal in the Oval Office carpet. The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTrump bump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 has been based on a somewhat breezy assumption that the new president will successfully implement the debt-fuelled infrastructure programme that many experts support, while ignoring the chance that we actually enter an era of painful protectionism and trade wars. Duncan Weldon, head of research at Resolution Group in London, has just published a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmust-read\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 blog piece, analysing the impact of Trump. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flavour: The markets seem to have decided that [aggressive deficit-financed state spending] will indeed now happen \u00e2\u20ac\u201d stocks up, commodities up, bonds down. Indeed, the markets seem to have decided that President Trump will be a relatively normal President, even if candidate Trump was a deeply unusual candidate. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not so sure. To adapt a a phrase: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153demagogues can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Still, as a base case a meaningful fiscal easing seems likely. Real estate developers like building stuff after all, Republicans are pretty keen on cutting taxes and this will be a lot easier to get through Congress for a Republican President. This is what incoming Republican Presidents do \u00e2\u20ac\u201d they cut taxes in a meaningful way and many supposed deficit hawks useback of the napkin logic to tell themselves \u00e2\u20ac\u0153these tax cuts will pay for themselves\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. (Actually they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t). But to simply assume that America gets higher economic demand, lower unemployment, a pick-up in inflation and a return to normal interest rates misses the big pictures, Weldon says: Implicit in that line of analysis are assumptions about the Fed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reaction functions and about productivity growth that need to be questioned. And, crucially, it misses the biggest shift that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Presidency could bring about \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a rejection of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153globalisation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd/economic openness. And if productivity remains low, some economists fear that steady wage growth, solid corporate profits and moderate inflation is an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcimpossible trinity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to achieve. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lots more here: Hello.... the rally in European stocks is petering out. The FTSE 100 has now shed its early gains and is now down 6 points, having been up 50 points at the start. Not clear what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prompted this... Larry Summers, the former US Treasury secretary, is cautiously hopeful that the infrastructure plan proposed by Donald Trump could help the US economy. He just told Bloomberg TV that he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153welcomes and applauds\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to renew America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highways, bridges, airports schools and hospitals. It could boost job creation in the short tun, and expand the US economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capacity for growth in the medium term, believes Summers - who has often called for more fiscal spending to fight \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsecular stagnation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. But Summers also sounds deeply concerned, saying Trump needs to propose \u00e2\u20ac\u0153serious and concrete plans\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to address America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic concerns, and surround himself with responsible people with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153considerable experience\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He says calling China a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153currency manipulator\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is unwise, while repealing the NAFTA trade deal would do enormous economic damage. And Summers, who served under Bill Clinton, suggets Trump cannot be as divisive in government as he was in the campaign. Unless there is a clear sense that all Americans are welcomed and part of his vision of a prosperous America, and all nations are part of his vision o f a prosperous world, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be successful in creating the world we all want to see, Summers concludes. Demand for gold hit a record high yesterday, which tells you a couple of things. 1) There was a massive flight to safe-haven assets as the shock election result rocked Asian and European markets. 2) People are buying gold as a hedge against inflation (the price has risen by 0.3% today). Over in America, Donald Trump is preparing to visit the White House to meet president Obama, following a night of protests against his election victory. Our main liveblog is covering all the details: Catherine Mann, the chief economist at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, says Donald Trump needs to flesh out his economics plans, fast. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, Mann says Trump needs to set out policies to identify sources of growth in the US economy, and make sure the benefits are shared fairly between the American people. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what got him to the White House , the fact that the gains aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t widely shared. The deputy leader of Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governing CDU party, Michael Fuchs, hopes that president Trump will be more responsible than nominee Trump: The copper prices has hit its highest level since July 2015, up 5% today, thanks to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promise to rebuild America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s infrastructure. And shares in two mining companies, Antofagasta and Vedanta, have both soared by 14% as investors anticipate a new fiscal boost next year. Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, says copper is the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbig winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory (which won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be much comfort to those on the losing side). He adds: President elect Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to spend more than $500 billion on rebuilding America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122sroads, bridges and airports helped send construction and steel stocks sharply higher following his surprise election win. Tom Albanese, chief executive officer of Vedanta Resources, also anticipates a boost. He says (via Blooomberg): All that we see for President-elect Trump is that he will focus on building, he will focus on the infrastructure. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That is what the market is reacting to.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory is also driving up the shares of military and defence companies. BAE Systems have jumped by 6% this morning, adding to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spike following the election result. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign that the City expect Trump to deliver on his promise to boost spending on the US military (which he claimed had become depleted on president Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s watch). BAE is one of the biggest suppliers to the US department of defence, and makes armoured vehicles, ships, fighter jets and missiles. And if Trump weakens the ties between Nato members, then European countries may feel compelled to boost their own armies. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confirmation that inflation expectations are rising, via analyst Arne Petimezas of AFS Group: Predictions that Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies will drive US inflation higher are causing some dramatic moves in the financial markets today. The interest rate, or yield, on Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-year government bonds just jumped over 1.31%, up from 1.23% on Wednesday night. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the highest level since 24th June, the aftermath of the Brexit referendum. Other European government bond yields are also rising. Investors are betting that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax cuts and debt-fuelled spending plans, if enacted, would be inflationary. So they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeking a higher rate of return for holding government debt. The news overnight that Donald Trump doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to force Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen to resign has also cheered the markets. Yellen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first term expires in 2018, but there has been speculation that she might feel pressure to step down, given the attacks from Trump during the campaign. Jim McCaughan, boss of Principal Global Investors, has told Bloomberg TV that market confidence will improve if Yellen stays, adding: If she goes, who knows, because that depends on who comes in next. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign ministry spokesperson has been giving some more reaction to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory at a press conference in Beijing. Asked about Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vows to introduce a 45% tariff on Chinese imports, spokesperson Lu Kang noted that economic ties were blossoming with trade increasing from $2.5bn in 1970 to $560bn last year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Economic cooperation between China and the US is what has made our bilateral relations stable and has propelled our bilateral relation forward,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lu said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I hope US is able to view our economic trade relationship in an objective and unbiased manner and work with us so that we can move forward. I believe that if the US keeps the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest and its people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interests in mind, they will make the right decision\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Asked whether such protectionist measures would harm the US-China relationship the spokesperson said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I will not comment on speculation. As I said I believe that the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leaders will make their decision based on the fundamental interests of their people. The Dow Jones industrial average is on track to hit a new record high, when the US stock market opens in five hours. Last night, the Dow closed near to its highest levels, and the future market is predicting a fresh spike today. The prospect of tax reforms and a government spending boost are pushing shares up, says Jeremy Cook of currency trading firm World First. He says the intial Trump slump has swiftly transformed into the Trump jump: The shortening of the timeframe between decline and rebound could be down to many things but issues around full Republican control of the Presidency and the possibility that changes in tax reform, investment and regulation will come through quicker may help. Trump has also been called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcan inflation time-bomb\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 given his pledges to increase spending so we must now look at Fed policy through a new lens. Similarly, although he was elected yesterday he does not take the reins until January 20th. Well quite: Investors are hoping that taking on the presidency might provoke a change in Donald Trump. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says the market rally is based on: ...an reassessment of views about Trump and belief that a more Presidential individual is already replacing the highly divisive candidate character he merely portrayed in order to appeal to American frustration and win the populist vote. Markets are demonstrating an impressive ability to digest significant political change and move on, even quicker than we saw in the immediate aftermath of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit vote. Given some of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conduct during the election campaign (divisive comments about Muslims, Mexicans, those awful tape-recordings about women...), a transformation by Inauguration Day would be welcome. But is it realistic? Anyone who bought European shares during Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory speech yesterday morning has made a decent profit. The markets have now gained 4.6% since Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening tumble: European banks are also rallying, on speculation that the next president might unravel some of the regulations brought in since the 2008 crisis. During the campaign, Donald Trump promised to tear up Dodd-Frank -- the legislation brought in to protect consumers and prevent banks becoming too big to fail. Trump believes it is holding back the economy, and once told Fox News that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have to get rid of Dodd-Frank. The banks aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t loaning to people that need it. The regulators are running the banks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear what Trump would replace Dodd-Frank with; simply ditching the law could create the conditions that caused the credit crisis in the first place. Coper-producer Antofagasta is the top riser in London, with fellow miners Glencore and Anglo American close behind. Traders are betting that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s programme of cutting taxes, a new debt-funded infrastructure programme, would push up inflation and raise demand for commodities. European markets are open, and shares are rising, as predictions of a Trump slump are trampled in an early wave of buying. The FTSE 100 index has jumped by 49 points, or 0.7%, to 6960 in early trading. Mining stocks and financial companies are leading the way. The French CAC, German DAX, Spanish IBEX and Italian FTSE MIB have also gained around 0.7% to 0.9%. The City analysts who predicted markets would slump if Trump pulled off a shock win have some explaining to do today. The consensus view was that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sheer unpredictability, opposition to free trade, bombastic and often-shocking comments - plus the vague and uncosted nature of his proposals - would scare investors out of town. But instead, we got a knee-jerk selloff yesterday, followed very swiftly by a bounceback (which Asia just caught up with.) It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lesson to all of us about how markets react, as Kit Juckes of Societe Generale explains: Buy the rumour, sell the news or in this case, sell the rumour and buy the news. We were all told this when we first arrived in dealing rooms and it is used to explain why academics and non-market participants are so often confused by the reaction of markets to events. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure I can remember a better example of this maxim than the last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market reaction to changing speculation about the outcome of the US Presidential election, and then to what happened. The result is plenty of egg on the face of all sorts of people. Mine included. So instead, investors quickly began reassessing the implications of a Trump presidency, and a Republican-controlled Congress. Kit says: It is widely expected that President Trump will be able to enact tax cuts, particularly for corporations, that will be positive for growth and will boost inflation. It may not be that simple for Trump to get things done -- the Tea Party wing won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like the thought of a debt-fuelled stimulus plan, for starters. Good morning from London, where bleary-eyed traders have returned to their desks. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not expecting a repeat of the huge rally seen in Asia overnight - London had its Trump rally yesterday afternoon. But the markets are still expected to rise, as the City continues to defy expectations and take yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock election result in its stride. You might have thought that the sight of anti-Trump demonstrations at several major US cities overnight would alarm the markets. But right now, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re more interested in the next president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promise of a fiscal stimulus. Also, the graceful and mature way that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama reacted to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s win has also calmed nerves -- investors like a peaceful transfer of power. A huge recovery on Asia Pacific\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock markets as the region followed the lead of the US and Europe. Plenty of commentators have doubts about whether the upbeat impact of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory can be sustained across the region but the impact is overwhelmingly positive for now. Here are the main points of the day so far: Share markets had one of their best days for years. The Nikkei rose 6.72% thanks to a weaker yen while the ASX/S&amp;P200 in Australia was up 3.34%. South Korea, Hong Kong and China all up too Europe and the US due to open up The US dollar dipped slightly from Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highs to 105.2740 Japanese yen while US bond yields spiked amid expectation of Fed rate hike in December Trump won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t force Janet Yellen to quit, the WSJ reports China fixes the yuan at its lowest for six years while JP Morgan warns of possible trade shock S&amp;P affirms US AA+/A-1+ rating amid concern about Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinexperience\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Construction commodities surge with iron ore at 30-month high and copper at 16-month high Thanks for reading \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the indefatigable Graeme Wearden will take the reins from London in a moment. Oliver Holmes, our south-east Asia correspondent, has been looking at the impact of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s win on his business interests in the region. Oliver writes: Despite the global downturn, two companies in the Philippines and Indonesia that are linked to Trump saw their shares soar on news that he had been elected president. Shares in a Philippine firm building a 57-storey Trump Tower in Manila jumped by a massive 20%, from 1.22 to 1.47 US cents on the local stock market. The main index on the Philippine Stock Exchange fell, however, by 2.5%. In Indonesia, shares in a company controlled by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s local business partner, tycoon Hary Tanoesoedibjo, also surged by 23%. The Jakarta stock exchange dropped by 1.4% on Wednesday. Trump and Tanoesoedibjo plan to build a resort and a golf course in west Java, projects that many in Indonesia \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest Muslim-majority nation \u00e2\u20ac\u201d condemned last year when Trump called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States. A huge day for the Japanese stock market which soared 1,092.88 points to 17,344.42, a rise of 6.72%. There have been big moves in the bond markets in the past 24 hours as investors have dumped the safety of government paper in favour of equities and the dollar. Yields on US Treasury 10-year notes reversed an initial plunge to 1.716% and bolted to 2.09% overnight as the price of bonds dropped. The net rise of 21 basis points was the largest daily increase since July 2013, Reuters said. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also an expectation that the Fed will raise rates in December, with a possible US fiscal stimulus seeing the return of inflation and more rate rises. Imre Speizer, an economist at Westpac, said: An astonishing turnaround in risk appetite pushed equities and Treasury yields higher. Markets appeared to reassess the economic outlook under Trump, towards one of higher growth and higher inflation. Futures trading suggests Europe and the US will rejoin the party when the markets open later today. Spread better IG sees the FTSE100 up 0.5% at 6940 points, while the Dax in Germany will be up 0.68% at 10,715 points. The Dow Jones on Wall Street is set to open up around 60 points. The Nikkei has gone even better than the ASX today with a rise nearly 7%, helped by a drop in the yen as the US dollar received a Trump bump as we might now have to call it. But the authorities are still worried that they might have to act to keep the yen down in future. Hiroshi Watanabe, former vice finance minister for international affairs, told Reuters that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153if the yen spikes by 3 yen or more, Japan should not hesitate to intervene\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, regardless of US concerns about such action. If Japan hesitated to intervene out of deference (to Trump), it would not be able to act for the coming four years. Japan has not intervened in currency markets since Nov. 2011. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a good day for investors down under \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the best in fact since 2011, AAP reports. The ASX/S&amp;P200 has closed up 172.2 points, or 3.34%, at 5,328.8 points, adding $50bn to the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value, more than making up for yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. Mining and construction stocks led the way on hopes of a boom in the US. Surging iron ore prices also helped, soaring past the 2016 peak to $71 a tonne. Copper \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a key construction material \u00e2\u20ac\u201c also jumped 4% to a 16-month high, Reuters reported. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of commentary around today about Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade policies and what they will mean for the global economy. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already heard from JP Morgan and Saul Eslake. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Paul Bloxham from HSBC in Australia, speaking to Australian Associated Press. For Australia, the main negative impact seems likely to be the effect that reduced global trade could have on Asian growth, given Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high trade reliance. Continued strengthening of Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic ties to China should be a priority as it would help support local growth even in the face of rising global trade protectionism. But Standard Life, in a research note quoted by AAP, saw the possibility that Trump could moderate his campaign promises, which included putting tariffs of 45% on Chinese goods and 35% on Mexican goods, in order to avoid disruption. It is plausible that the new administration will not ramp up tariffs on Mexican and Chinese imports, content instead to bury the prospect of new trade agreements and make more use of enforcement clauses in existing agreements. Trump won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t force Janet Yellen to resign as chair of the Federal Reserve, according to an adviser, despite speculation that he might try to end her term prematurely. Judy Shelton, an economist and senior fellow at the Atlas Network and adviser to Trump on monetary policy, told the Wall Street Journal that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not urging her to resign at all\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. However, the Journal reports that Shelton did concede that Trump was minded to replace Yellen when she completes her first term in 2018. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s saying he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d want someone whose thinking is more in keeping with his own. Trump was openly critical of Yellen in one of the presidential debates in September, saying that interest rates had been kept too low and that asset bubbles created by loose monetary settings would eventually burst. JP Morgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team in Australia have been looking at what Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s win could mean for the global economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. They say that a US fiscal stimulus would have limited benefits for the rest of the world while trade barriers could mean trouble for trading partners. A US policy-induced trade shock will be negative for global growth. This leaves risks to global growth more asymmetric than was previously the case. Second, the distribution of risks to Chinese growth have shifted to the downside, given the increased probability of rising tensions in US-China trade relations and weaker Chinese export growth. A trade shock could in turn damage the US. A marked slowing in US growth might not be an issue, except that growth in the rest of the global economy doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look robust enough \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly given limited scope for additional policy support \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to provide much of a buffer. And even in the event that US growth slows on a trade shock, this will likely be more inflationary (via higher import prices) than would have otherwise been the case, meaning that the growth and inflation trade-off in the US becomes less favourable. And that means that interest rate cuts are back on the horizon in Australia. For the RBA, we think this underscores the risk that rates are likely to go lower in Australia. All else equal, domestic growth needs to be stronger to provide an offset to external shocks, should they occur. US billionaire Carl Icahn apparently cashed in on the stock market panic over Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election victory. The longtime Trump supporter told CNN Money that he left the Republican\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory party in Manhattan in the early hours of Wednesday to go home and buy \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a lot of stock\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the plunging overnight market. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m glad I did that. I guess that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what makes me happy today too ... I personally don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe that Trump is bad for the market necessarily. OK, the stock markets have proceeded magisterially today despite a background of major tectonic shifts in the financial landscape. Here are the main points: Asia Pacfic shares have bounced back up strongly and recovered Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nikkei is up 5.71% at 17,178.87 ASX/S&amp;P200 up 2.74% at 5,297.70, Kospi is at 1,995.75 (1.91%) Hong Kong is up 2% at 22,863.10. The US dollar has dipped against the yen at 105.3270 but still up strongly overnight. Aussie dollar is up at US76.61c S&amp;P has maintained the US on AA+ investment grade rating, warning that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inexperience creates uncertainty about policy settings Yuan fix at the lowest point since 2010 Reserve Bank of New Zealand has cut rates to 1.75%, a new record low Brent crude is down 7% amid warnings about global trade More on the implications for Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big emerging economies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and Australia. Saul Eslake, the independent economist, has warned about the implications for Asutralia if Trump were to start a trade war with China and undermine the Fed, pushing the US dollar down. [This would create] a great deal of uncertainty in our part of the world, about the geopolitical environment by making a less wholesome commitment to longstanding US alliances with countries like South Korea and Japan ... Those things, particulary a trade war with China, would be highly negative for Australia. Like every measure in the last 24 hours, the US dollar has been topsy-turvy. The chance of a Fed rate cut dropped to 30% on Wednesday but is now more than 80%, according to IG. The dollar index against major currencies recovered from 95.885 on Wednesday to around 98.448 on Thursday. But the longer-term outlook is uncertain as Trump pushes his protectionist agenda (see below). Tim Condon, an Singapore-based economist at ING, told Reuters: We expect a Trump Treasury to elevate the importance of the bilateral trade surplus with the US in identifying currency manipulators and intensify pressure on trade partners to allow currencies to appreciate. The yuan has been fixed today at 6.7885 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c its lowest point since September 2010. Bearing in mind that Trump labelled China a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153currency manipulator\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on his way to winning the presidency, the issue could prove to be a flashpoint between the two countries. China has pushed the value of its currency steadily downwards in the past year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very clumsily to begin with, sparking last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mini-stock market crash \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as it tries to export its way out of slowing economic growth. But everyone else has got the same idea (including Abe of course). The US dollar is holding its gains on Thursday and was sitting at 105.32 yen, up from below 102 on Wednesday. But for Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing recovery to work you expect that he will want it come down. The Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe is planning to meet the US president-elect in New York on 17 November, a Japanese government official has said. Reuters reports that the pair had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153talked by telephone and confirmed close cooperation between their two nations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It might be interesting to hear what they have to say to each other about trade and the economy. Like China, Japan has a lot to be worried about. Trump is an avowed opponent of the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal which would be a huge blow for Abe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to boost his country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s huge manufacturing sector. The commodities market is looking slightly different to stocks today. While equities are surging ahead, the price of oil has dropped amid concerns about the impact of Trump on global trade. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 20c at $45.07 a barrel at 0131 GMT on Thursday. The more widely traded Brent was at $46.29 per barrel, down 7% from the last close. Daniel Yergin, vice-chairman of the IHS Markit think tank, told Reuters: The outcome of the U.S. election adds to the challenges for the oil exporters because it will likely lead to weaker economic growth in an already fragile global economy. And that means additional pressure on oil demand. Gold meanwhile dipped overnight $1,278.25 an ounce as risk receded in the markets. It rose nearly 5% to $1,337.40 on Wednesday before tumbling back down as US markets reacted positively to the Trump win. Reuters reports that S&amp;P, the ratings agency, has affirmed the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investment-grade AA+/A-1+ sovereign rating on Wednesday while maintaining its stable outlook. It welcomed calls for unity from all sides of US politics in the wake of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s win but \u00e2\u20ac\u0153high general government debt and increased uncertainty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd meant there it could not restore the coveted AAA rating it removed in 2011. Its analysis feels like a good summary of market sentiment: Given Mr Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lack of experience in public office, and his win as a political outsider without an established policy track record, there is a degree of uncertainty over policy formulation and execution. However, there is a difference between campaign rhetoric and concrete policy proposals and execution once in office. We await further information on the formation of a cabinet and policy proposals, particularly once the president-elect assumes office. Alongside Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory, the Senate remains in Republican hands, as does the House of Representatives. Hence, the president-elect and the Republicans have a mandate for and ability to effect policy change more easily than with a more divided government in recent years. Trading has been underway for an hour now in Japan and Korea. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where the main indexes stand: Nikkei up 5.7% to 17,180 points Kospi in South Korea up 1.7% to 1,991 ASX/S&amp;P 200 in Australia up 2.88% to 5,305 points The yen, which gained so much during yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turmoil, fell sharply overnight as the US dollar recovered. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now at 105.6740, close to a four-month high. The pound and the euro are both down slightly against the greenback however, as the pattern from yesterday is reversed. Imre Speizer, an economist at Westpac in Australia, said: An astonishing turnaround in risk appetite pushed equities and Treasury yields higher. Markets appeared to reassess the economic outlook under Trump, towards one of higher growth and higher inflation. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t waited around to see what a Trump presidency might mean for US monetary policy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it cut its base rate 25 basis points to a record low of 1.75% this morning. The move was expected and is the third cut this year. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s driven partly by a need to get the NZ dollar down to help the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s huge dairy industry. Governor Graeme Wheeler said the rate-setters had met on Thursday to discuss whether the cut was still needed in the wake of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s win. They decided it was but pushed back on expectations of yet another reduction soon. He said: We think at this stage that we won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need another cut. The economy is doing well and you certainly wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to create excessive volatility in respect of interest rates and output in the exchange rate by surprising the market with interest rate adjustments. This is an interesting chart. Wednesday saw one of the biggest drops in volatility ever recorded as the markets quickly put their concerns behind them and went into risk-on mode. But as with Australia, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear where this is going. A Trump presidency promises a more aggressive US trading position which the markets have implicitly welcomed. But not everyone can be winners here, can they? China is the obvious loser in Asia if, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s say, Trump tries to force Apple to make its iPhones in the US instead of Shenzhen and Shangahi. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a snippet from Larry Elliott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s piece: Beijing would have two choices. It might take an emollient line, promising to increase direct investment into the US as a way of supporting Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempt to rebuild the American economy. More likely, though, China would adopt an aggressive, nationalistic stance. Beijing is not without economic weapons, since it has amassed a vast stock of US Treasury bonds in recent years, the proceeds of its trade surplus with America. Beijing could meet Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat with one of its own: to dump US assets. A tit-for-tat trade war, in which China puts tariffs on US exports, could not be ruled out either. But as Chris Weston from IG says in his morning note, these concerns appear for another day as markets focus on the upside: Like many I had been concerned market participants would be worried about Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relationship with the Federal Reserve and a number of their key trade partners (such as China and Japan), but again this concern is for another time it seems. The market in Japan has opened very strongly with the Nikkei rising more than 6%, reversing the huge losses of Wednesday. The Kospi in Seoul is also up. The Aussie dollar has risen this morning from overnight lows of below US76c as the markets yo-yoed around during US election night. The Aussie is trading at US76.50c this morning. But experts say it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to say where it will go from here given the mixed bag of signals out of a Trump win. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Greg McKenna writing at axitrader.com: I think if Trump delivers on his campaign promises then we face a more volatile global economic and geopolitical environment in the years ahead ... For the Aussie that means it benefits from the reflationary aspects of Trumponomics, but could suffer from the rise in US bonds, and likely Fed hike in December if Australian interest rate markets don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go with those moves higher. Huge lead from Australia this morning. The ASX/S&amp;P200 is up nearly 3% and resource and financial stocks have led the way. The iron ore producer Fortescue is the top riser at well over 10.6% but Macquarie and BHP have also shown big gains. My colleague Melissa Davey has just filed this report on the morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surge. Meanwhile, Chris Weston at IG in Melbourne has this: The combination of huge gains in materials, fiscals and energy should push the ASX 200 3.4%, which if it closes at that level would be the strongest gain since 6 October 2011 Hello and welcome to the markets live blog from Sydney. Well, that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t turn out quite how it was expected to \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on a number of levels. The surprise of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s win looked like leading to market meltdown across the world. But it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, thanks in part it seems to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conciliatory speech, proving that investors hate uncertainty more than anything. The promise of a smooth handover of power, a united Congress, tax cuts and a huge infrastructure spending boost was enough to turn red screens green. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how they finished in the US and Europe The Dow Jones up 1.4% to 18,590 points. The S&amp;P 500 up 1.1% to 21,163. The Nasdaq up 1.1% to 5,251. FTSE100 up 1% to 6,911.84 Dax up 1.56% to 10,646 In Australia the market has already taken that lead and opened up by nearly 3%. Can it be sustained? Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one informed verdict. Michael McCarthy at CMC Markets in Sydney, said: The stunning turn in sentiment suggests there is now a consensus building that much of the policy announced during the campaign was a sales pitch rather than a commitment to act. Investors ignored the potential for damage to international trade and growth prospects and focussed on Republican control of both houses of Congress as well as the White House. This offers the prospect of reform that could stimulate the US economy. However, last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s action may be as good as it gets for markets for some time. Policy uncertainty and populist agendas rarely lead to sustainable economic growth. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much to look at and talk about. But in the meantime start with our economics editor Larry Elliott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s examination of what a Trump win might mean for the global economy.",

                "body":"<p>The texts began arriving on customers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 phones over the weekend: Tesco Bank had spotted unusual activity on a significant number of current accounts, and was getting in touch with customers to alert them. But that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/08/tesco-bank-cyber-thieves-25m\" title=\"\">wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough to prevent \u00c2\u00a32.5m being siphoned out of about 9,000 accounts</a>, and transferred to criminals whose identities and locations remain a mystery.</p> <p>The damage to the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation may be significant \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but more significant still is that the attack is only the latest, and presently most visible, example of a rising tide of onslaughts against online banking, which seek to exploit any weak spot in web-facing computer systems and their users.</p> <p>The hackers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 motives are straightforward. As the wild west bank robber Willie Sutton explained when asked to explain his motivation: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where the money is.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>And experts warn that 2016, which has already seen an audacious attempt to steal \u00c2\u00a3763m ($951m) electronically from Bangladesh\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank in the spring, is the precursor for much worse to come.</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Because a lot of economies aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in good shape, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see more and more skilled computing people being out of work, and turning to the dark side where they work for criminals,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Ilia Kolochenko, chief executive of High-Tech Bridge, a web security company. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And at the same time you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a lot of companies trying to optimise their costs, and preferring to save money on the cyber side. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to predict how successful and how large the scale will be, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m pretty sure it will get worse.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>The Bangladesh attack occurred in February, when hackers broke into the Swift network, the international financial transfer information system, and told the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to make 32&#xa0;transactions totalling $951m to accounts around the world. Although only $101m, in two transactions, was paid out, a total of $63m has not been recovered. Swift has since warned banks to update their software.</p> <p>It is highly unlikely that the same group was behind the Tesco Bank attack; the amounts involved \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and number of accounts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are so different as to imply separate operations. However, this suggests that various gangs are trying to break into banks and accounts online. There have certainly been a number of online raids \u00e2\u20ac\u201c some involving big money. In 2013, online security company Kaspersky said that as much as $900m had been stolen from 100 banks after their internal systems were infected with malware.</p> <p>And in late 2015, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Crime Agency investigated the theft of \u00c2\u00a320m from several accounts, enabled by malware which had infiltrated customers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 PCs.</p> <p>There are suspicions that Tesco Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s security model was more vulnerable to compromise than it should have been: once logged in to a current account, a user could set up a transfer to a current account in another bank without having to get an SMS confirmation. The question, still unanswered, is how the accounts were targeted.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7a3444292752405ad86bd6f0a05a1a693094082c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a3444292752405ad86bd6f0a05a1a693094082c/0_42_1380_1724/800.jpg\" alt=\"Feezan Hameed, jailed for 11 years over thefts of \u00c2\u00a3113m from British banks.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Feezan Hameed, jailed for 11 years over thefts of \u00c2\u00a3113m from British banks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Metropolitan Police/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is possible that the hackers found a weakness in the back-office systems \u00e2\u20ac\u201c possibly from a current or former employee, suggests Kolochenko.</p> <p>Tesco Bank declined to discuss whether there are any patterns in the accounts that were targeted: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a criminal matter, and so we are constrained in what we can say,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a spokesman said. He declined to say whether any criminals had been identified or what lines of investigation were being pursued.</p> <p>Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), told MPs last week that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there are elements of this [attack] that look unprecedented\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but did not elucidate.</p> <p>What parts are unprecedented? The fraud was far from the largest conducted on a UK bank; in September, the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/21/feezan-hameed-fraud-gang-jailed-11-years-southwark-crown-court\" title=\"\">23-year-old head of a fraud ring, Feezan Hameed, was jailed for 11 years</a>, after his gang stole \u00c2\u00a3113m from British banks. They fooled people into thinking they were talking to their bank, and got them to hand over their internet details \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which he would then use to get access to their accounts. Only \u00c2\u00a347m has been recovered.</p> <p>So if the FCA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bailey is worried, it must be about the online nature and the scale of the attack \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not its value. And this is the concern: if criminals can compromise 9,000 accounts in a matter of hours during a weekend and siphon off an average of \u00c2\u00a3280 from each one before being spotted, what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to prevent it being done to an even greater number of accounts for greater amounts of money, and leaving banks to pick up the pieces? What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to stop it being done to any bank every night?</p> <p>The idea of banks building up a false sense of security before a disaster might sound familiar. Simon Moores, an independent consultant on security, likens the situation now to the US financial market in 2006/7, when complacency over the inherent risks of mortgage-based products was compounded by ratings agencies which had an interest in certifying sketchy financial instruments as safe. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jan/30/michael-lewis-the-big-short-interview\" title=\"\"><em>The Big Short</em></a>,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Moores says, referring to the film and book about the lead-up to the financial collapse, which was forecast by only a few. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The computer security industry is worth \u00c2\u00a330bn, but it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work any more. Having a box to protect your bank website or business doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. But nobody is prepared to accept the fact.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p> <p>Banks don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like discussing hacks; more than 100 banks are reckoned to have had up to $900m stolen in late 2013, according to security company Kaspersky. The hackers compromised internal computers and used video feeds for months to learn daily routines.</p> <p>Moores points out that 2015 was a record year for cyber-attacks globally \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only because 2016 hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t finished yet. Malware \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which tries to attack PCs or corporate systems \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is on the rise: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are now thought to be more than 500 million worms, Trojans and other viruses in circulation, and reportedly every day there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another 1.25 million \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpolymorphic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 threats [which change as they are copied between machines, making identification harder].\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f3460967f6331b319589b08b33e1512d40ef6528\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3460967f6331b319589b08b33e1512d40ef6528/0_139_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Federal Reserve Bank in New York, which was told to make 32 transactions totalling $951m for accounts around the world after hackers got into the transfer system.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Federal Reserve Bank in New York, which was told to make 32 transactions totalling $951m for accounts around the world after hackers got into the transfer system.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Gombert/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For banks, the attraction of online banking is clear: it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t require expensive offices in high streets, or the employment of thousands of tellers who might be vulnerable to criminals through blackmail or greed. Instead, it relies on computers, and a relatively small and highly trained (and well-paid) staff, while the customer-support function normally done by tellers can be outsourced to call centres that have little more access than ordinary customers to the banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 databases.</p> <p>For the customer, online banking should mean greater convenience \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it can be done anywhere and any time you can get an internet connection \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and reliability, since the challenges (such as passwords and memorable words or phrases) you face to log on successfully are more complex than a simple four-digit number at a cash machine.</p> <p>But for both, inserting a computer between the customer and the bank has opened up new risks from malware targeting web browsers, computers and mobile phones. Browsers, software and computers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c both the customers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and the banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c can have mysterious bugs which allow access to hackers and leave almost no trace; there is a constant need for bug-finding and updates to defeat them.</p> <p>Even while banks strengthen their software, though, the weak link can lie outside.

The group is reckoned to have gained access by buying access to PCs already infected by opportunistic hackers using weaknesses in Microsoft Office and Windows.</p> <p><strong>January 2015 </strong>Hackers acquire codes from Swift, the international financial network which enables transfers between banks, to get access to a bank in Ecuador, Banco del Austro, and transfer $12m out of it via Wells Fargo to banks in Hong Kong, Los Angeles and Dubai. The bank sues Wells Fargo but does not tell Swift, which <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/lawsuit-claims-another-global-banking-hack-1463695820\" title=\"\">only learns of the incident via a lawsuit in May 2016</a>.</p> <p><strong>April 2015</strong> Ryanair confirms that <a href=\"http://www.cbronline.com/news/cybersecurity/business/10-lessons-learnt-from-ryanairs-chinese-bank-hack-4566379\" title=\"\">\u00c2\u00a33.3m has been stolen from it</a> by a fraudulent transfer via a Chinese bank.

                "bodyText":"The texts began arriving on customers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 phones over the weekend: Tesco Bank had spotted unusual activity on a significant number of current accounts, and was getting in touch with customers to alert them. But that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough to prevent \u00c2\u00a32.5m being siphoned out of about 9,000 accounts, and transferred to criminals whose identities and locations remain a mystery. The damage to the bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation may be significant \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but more significant still is that the attack is only the latest, and presently most visible, example of a rising tide of onslaughts against online banking, which seek to exploit any weak spot in web-facing computer systems and their users. The hackers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 motives are straightforward. As the wild west bank robber Willie Sutton explained when asked to explain his motivation: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where the money is.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And experts warn that 2016, which has already seen an audacious attempt to steal \u00c2\u00a3763m ($951m) electronically from Bangladesh\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank in the spring, is the precursor for much worse to come. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Because a lot of economies aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in good shape, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see more and more skilled computing people being out of work, and turning to the dark side where they work for criminals,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Ilia Kolochenko, chief executive of High-Tech Bridge, a web security company. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And at the same time you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a lot of companies trying to optimise their costs, and preferring to save money on the cyber side. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to predict how successful and how large the scale will be, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m pretty sure it will get worse.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Bangladesh attack occurred in February, when hackers broke into the Swift network, the international financial transfer information system, and told the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to make 32 transactions totalling $951m to accounts around the world. Although only $101m, in two transactions, was paid out, a total of $63m has not been recovered. Swift has since warned banks to update their software. It is highly unlikely that the same group was behind the Tesco Bank attack; the amounts involved \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and number of accounts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are so different as to imply separate operations. However, this suggests that various gangs are trying to break into banks and accounts online. There have certainly been a number of online raids \u00e2\u20ac\u201c some involving big money. In 2013, online security company Kaspersky said that as much as $900m had been stolen from 100 banks after their internal systems were infected with malware. And in late 2015, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Crime Agency investigated the theft of \u00c2\u00a320m from several accounts, enabled by malware which had infiltrated customers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 PCs. There are suspicions that Tesco Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s security model was more vulnerable to compromise than it should have been: once logged in to a current account, a user could set up a transfer to a current account in another bank without having to get an SMS confirmation. The question, still unanswered, is how the accounts were targeted. It is possible that the hackers found a weakness in the back-office systems \u00e2\u20ac\u201c possibly from a current or former employee, suggests Kolochenko. Tesco Bank declined to discuss whether there are any patterns in the accounts that were targeted: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a criminal matter, and so we are constrained in what we can say,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a spokesman said. He declined to say whether any criminals had been identified or what lines of investigation were being pursued. Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), told MPs last week that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there are elements of this [attack] that look unprecedented\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but did not elucidate. What parts are unprecedented? The fraud was far from the largest conducted on a UK bank; in September, the23-year-old head of a fraud ring, Feezan Hameed, was jailed for 11 years, after his gang stole \u00c2\u00a3113m from British banks. They fooled people into thinking they were talking to their bank, and got them to hand over their internet details \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which he would then use to get access to their accounts. Only \u00c2\u00a347m has been recovered. So if the FCA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bailey is worried, it must be about the online nature and the scale of the attack \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not its value. And this is the concern: if criminals can compromise 9,000 accounts in a matter of hours during a weekend and siphon off an average of \u00c2\u00a3280 from each one before being spotted, what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to prevent it being done to an even greater number of accounts for greater amounts of money, and leaving banks to pick up the pieces? What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to stop it being done to any bank every night? The idea of banks building up a false sense of security before a disaster might sound familiar. Simon Moores, an independent consultant on security, likens the situation now to the US financial market in 2006/7, when complacency over the inherent risks of mortgage-based products was compounded by ratings agencies which had an interest in certifying sketchy financial instruments as safe. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just like The Big Short,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Moores says, referring to the film and book about the lead-up to the financial collapse, which was forecast by only a few. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The computer security industry is worth \u00c2\u00a330bn, but it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work any more. Having a box to protect your bank website or business doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. But nobody is prepared to accept the fact.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Banks don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like discussing hacks; more than 100 banks are reckoned to have had up to $900m stolen in late 2013, according to security company Kaspersky. The hackers compromised internal computers and used video feeds for months to learn daily routines. Moores points out that 2015 was a record year for cyber-attacks globally \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only because 2016 hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t finished yet. Malware \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which tries to attack PCs or corporate systems \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is on the rise: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are now thought to be more than 500 million worms, Trojans and other viruses in circulation, and reportedly every day there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another 1.25 million \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpolymorphic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 threats [which change as they are copied between machines, making identification harder].\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd For banks, the attraction of online banking is clear: it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t require expensive offices in high streets, or the employment of thousands of tellers who might be vulnerable to criminals through blackmail or greed. Instead, it relies on computers, and a relatively small and highly trained (and well-paid) staff, while the customer-support function normally done by tellers can be outsourced to call centres that have little more access than ordinary customers to the banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 databases. For the customer, online banking should mean greater convenience \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it can be done anywhere and any time you can get an internet connection \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and reliability, since the challenges (such as passwords and memorable words or phrases) you face to log on successfully are more complex than a simple four-digit number at a cash machine. But for both, inserting a computer between the customer and the bank has opened up new risks from malware targeting web browsers, computers and mobile phones. Browsers, software and computers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c both the customers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and the banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c can have mysterious bugs which allow access to hackers and leave almost no trace; there is a constant need for bug-finding and updates to defeat them. Even while banks strengthen their software, though, the weak link can lie outside. One of the biggest problems for online banking was the malware Zeus, which defeated many antivirus packages. First seen in 2007, it lurked in the background of Windows computers infected via email attachments or web pages and captured logon passwords and account numbers. By 2010, it had infected nearly 4m PCs. In April two men \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a 27-year-old Russian called Aleksandr Andreevich Panin and an Algerian accomplice, Hamza Bendelladj, were given prison sentences totalling more than 24 years for their role in creating and running a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153botnet\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of infected computers called SpyEye, which relied on Zeus and had stolen more than $100m from US banks and, by extension, their customers. By 2011, there were versions of Zeus that infected smartphones running on Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Android, putting banking apps at risk. So far though, banks appear to have managed to stay ahead in the arms race; the growth in the use of smartphones may actually have helped, because their security model is generally better than PCs, holding apps in deeper \u00e2\u20ac\u0153silos\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Customers have often borne the cost of the skirmishes, though. Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s computer security group, has clashed with the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial instutions for more than a decade, first over weaknesses in cash-machine security and more recently over banks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reluctance to accept the cost of online fraud, while they reap the profits of lower online overheads. Customers who have been defrauded often have to fight for their refunds, Anderson says. Many of those whose money was stolen by Hameed are still trying to get their money back, he points out. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As long as UK banks don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to bear the cost of fraud, they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have an incentive to improve their security,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. He notes that the Tesco case \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in which refunds were immediate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was a rare and welcome exception.

But here are some that we know of. 2013 As many as 100 banks worldwide are discovered to have been infiltrated by malware \u00e2\u20ac\u201c sent as email attachments to bank employees \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which sent back video and other data from internal networks. That helped hackers to steal a total of $900m, according to the Kaspersky Lab, which claims it had gone on for almost two years. Neither the amounts stolen nor the details have been confirmed. December 2014 About 730,000 login details for wealthy clients of Morgan Stanley are offered for sale online, after being stolen by an employee, 30-year-old Galen Marsh, between 2011 and 2014. Morgan Stanley says it found no evidence that customers lost any money. Marsh pleaded guilty in September 2015, receiving 36 months\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 probation. Morgan Stanley was fined $1m. Meanwhile, hackers in Russia and Ukraine break into the internal networks at financial institutions in their countries and infect ATMs with malware that would give them 50 times the amount they seemed to be taking out. The group is reckoned to have gained access by buying access to PCs already infected by opportunistic hackers using weaknesses in Microsoft Office and Windows. January 2015 Hackers acquire codes from Swift, the international financial network which enables transfers between banks, to get access to a bank in Ecuador, Banco del Austro, and transfer $12m out of it via Wells Fargo to banks in Hong Kong, Los Angeles and Dubai. The bank sues Wells Fargo but does not tell Swift, which only learns of the incident via a lawsuit in May 2016. April 2015 Ryanair confirms that \u00c2\u00a33.3m has been stolen from it by a fraudulent transfer via a Chinese bank. Neither the bank nor Ryanair offers any information about how the fraud happened. Late 2015 The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Crime Agency investigates a series of bank frauds enabled by malware called Dridex, which infects PCs and harvests online banking details from users. British accounts are reckoned to have had \u00c2\u00a320m taken from them and paid to accounts in eastern Europe. February 2016 $81m is stolen from Bangladesh\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank; investigators link the malware used to break into the systems to that used to penetrate Sony Pictures in 2014 by a hacking group called Lazarus.

May 2016 Swift says a Vietnamese bank has been hacked, but doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t disclose whether any money was lost, or which bank is involved. It urges its members, numbering more than 9,000, to keep their software up to date. June 2016 $10m is stolen from a bank in Ukraine after the Swift system is exploited using a method similar to that used against the Bangladesh central bank in February. November 2016 Tesco Bank says \u00c2\u00a32.5m has been stolen over the weekend of 5-6 November from the accounts of about 9,000 customers, out of a total of 136,000.

It said:</p> <blockquote> <p>The Italian economy is likely to achieve only slow growth of less than 1% of GDP per year over 2016-2018, say S&amp;P Global Ratings economists in a report published today (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153<a href=\"https://www.globalcreditportal.com/ratingsdirect/showArticlePage.do?sp_mid=75191&amp;sp_rid=2071633&amp;object_id=9865022&amp;rev_id=1&amp;elqTrackId=73388d9285554dad95048fb0523f625b&amp;elq=ff72ce07824e45c2bd22b179d4815176&amp;elqaid=75191&amp;elqat=1&amp;elqCampaignId=\">Only A Modest Recovery In Sight For Italy</a>\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd).</p> <p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect the Italian economy to return to its pre-crisis output peak before the middle of the next decade because productivity remains very depressed. <a href=\"https://www.globalcreditportal.com/ratingsdirect/entityPage.do?sp_mid=75191&amp;sp_rid=2071633&amp;entityId=107135&amp;elqTrackId=cd1e11bd9f4640f3ab243fd182183f9c&amp;elq=ff72ce07824e45c2bd22b179d4815176&amp;elqaid=75191&amp;elqat=1&amp;elqCampaignId=\">Italy</a> is the only European country not to have recorded any productivity gains since 2000,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Jean-Michel Six, Chief Economist for EMEA at S&amp;P Global Ratings.</p> <p>Despite a significant fall of the euro rate in 2014 and early 2015, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s real export performance has been lackluster and is lagging behind other eurozone countries. Italian real exports were 4% above their pre-crisis peak in the second quarter of 2016, which is still very modest compared to euro area partners that are 15%-25% above the pre-crisis peak. </p> <p>The lack of dynamism in productivity that could have lifted overall potential growth and boosted foreign competitiveness, remains Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major weakness, the report says.

                "bodyText":"With Wall Street falling back after several days of rises, investors were pausing for breath a week after Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock victory in the US election. The mixed picture from the UK employment data - jobless rate down, claimant count up - added to the uncertainty. But the pound held firm against the euro although it edged lower against a resurgent dollar. The US currency was boosted by the growing belief that the Federal Reserve is almost certain to raise interest rates next month, as well as the continuing expectation of a Trump spending boom. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: The mood across most equity markets remains subdued, with modest losses being posted. Investors are evidently still cautious about the new [American] administration, with the steady drip of news relating to appointments and the like keeping the market in check. About the only thing still surging is the US dollar. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 43.02 points or 0.63% at 6749.72 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dax dropped 0.66% to 10,663.87 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cac closed down 0.78% at 4501.14 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB fell 0.73% to 16,559.84 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ibex ended 0.56% lower at 8638.5 But in Greece, the Athens market added 2.44% to 592.26 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 73 points or 0.39%. On that note, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back tomorrow. Ahead of Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum next month, there is some unwelcome analysis from S&amp;P, which paints a fairly uninspiring picture of the prospects for the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. It said: The Italian economy is likely to achieve only slow growth of less than 1% of GDP per year over 2016-2018, say S&amp;P Global Ratings economists in a report published today (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Only A Modest Recovery In Sight For Italy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect the Italian economy to return to its pre-crisis output peak before the middle of the next decade because productivity remains very depressed. Italy is the only European country not to have recorded any productivity gains since 2000,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Jean-Michel Six, Chief Economist for EMEA at S&amp;P Global Ratings. Despite a significant fall of the euro rate in 2014 and early 2015, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s real export performance has been lackluster and is lagging behind other eurozone countries. Italian real exports were 4% above their pre-crisis peak in the second quarter of 2016, which is still very modest compared to euro area partners that are 15%-25% above the pre-crisis peak. The lack of dynamism in productivity that could have lifted overall potential growth and boosted foreign competitiveness, remains Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major weakness, the report says. Competitiveness has suffered from a misalignment between stagnating productivity and rising wages, leading to a gradual appreciation of unit labor costs and of the real effective exchange rate. Labor market reform and attempts to address the high rate of nonperforming loans have yet to make significant progress in lifting growth. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the short term, the uncertainty surrounding the referendum on the senate reform in early December is likely to weigh on the business climate, said Mr. Six. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Looking ahead, the slow improvement in the labor market will support a modest rise in household consumption, while we expect investment to pick up gradually, albeit remaining highly vulnerable to setbacks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Oil prices continue to be volatile, coming under pressure after more evidence of growing stockpiles but then recovering. After the American Petroleum Institute reported a higher than expected stock build last week, comes a similar tale from the US Energy Information Administration. The EIA said crude stocks rose by 5.27m barrels last week to 490.28m, compared to forecasts of a 1.5m increase. Gasoline and distillate stocks - which were both forecast to fall - also rose. But after falling further on these figures, crude recovered after Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy minister said he saw a big chance of Opec agreeing an output deal at its meeting at the end of the month. So Brent crude, which had fallen as low as $46.25 a barrel, is currently up 0.6% at $47.17. US president Barack Obama might be pushing for debt relief for Greece, but unsurprisingly Germany disagrees (which should make Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upcoming meeting with Angela Merkel interesting). Reuters reports: Germany on Wednesday opposed calls for debt relief for Greece after U.S. President Barack Obama offered support for such a mechanism for the recession-hit euro zone state during a trip to Athens. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble said late on Tuesday granting Greece debt relief would do it a disservice. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whoever says \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwe will relieve your debts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is doing Greece a disservice,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the finance ministry confirmed Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble as saying after the Passauer Neue Presse daily reported it. Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments were not made directly in response to Obama, a finance ministry spokesman added. Athens signed up to a third economic bailout package of up to 86 billion euros last year but wants long-term debt restructuring to exit its crisis. Germany, which has long said there is no immediate need for debt relief for Greece as it would discourage much-needed structural reforms, said it noted the comments from Obama, who flies to Berlin later on Wednesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have noted that President Obama has pointed to the importance of debt relief. The euro group agreed in May on a timetable on exactly that subject .. regarding measures for the short term, and later in 2018 for mid-term measures,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said government spokesman Steffen Seibert at a news conference. In May, euro zone governments offered Greece debt relief in 2018 but left key details to be decided later in a compromise between Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tough stance and the International Monetary Fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call for decisions immediately. A finance ministry spokesman said there was nothing new to say. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our position is unchanged. Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visit has not changed anything,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said at the government news conference. The prospect of higher US interest rates has brought an end to the rally which has seen leading US shares hit new heights. After rising for seven straight trading sessions in the run up and aftermath of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shock US presidential election victory, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 55 points or 0.3%. The S&amp;P 500 opened down 0.25% while Nasdaq was 0.4% lower. Back with the UK, and the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jon Cunliffe has said recent currency movements had made setting interest rates move difficult. Reuters reports: Sterling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp fall since Britain voted to leave the European Union has made it harder to set monetary policy, BoE Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe said on Wednesday. Cunliffe said he fully backed the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s neutral stance regarding its next move in interest rates, as announced earlier this month, and its latest quarterly set of forecasts which see a modest slowdown next year. The British economy probably still needed interest rates to be negative in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcreal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or inflation-adjusted terms, but the fall in sterling meant the BoE would not necessarily be able to stick to this, Cunliffe said in the text of a speech to be delivered at the University of Manchester. US industrial production figures have come in slightly worse than expected. It was unchanged in October compared to forecasts of a 0.2% increase. The September figure was revised down from a 0.1% rise to a 0.2% fall. On his final day in Greece, US president Barack Obama repeated his belief that debt relief was vital for the country. The Athens News Agency - Macedonian Press Agency reports: Speaking at the Stavros Niarchos Foundation on Wednesday, U.S. President Barack Obama once again highlighted the need for Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors to agree to debt relief, in accordance with the advice of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), noting that the country, and especially its young people, needed to see hope and a future. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The IMF has said that debt relief will be crucial to get Greece back to growth. They are right. It is important because if reforms here are to be sustained, people here need to see hope and they need to see progress.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Young people, in particular, needed to know there is a future, there is an education, and jobs that were worthy of their potential, he added. Obama also had time for a tour of the Acropolis: And then it was off. Next stop: Berlin. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IHS Markit on the UK employment data: Over in Europe, and the latest on the draft budgets put forward by member states. Reuters reports: Italy and five other countries are at risk of breaking European Union budget discipline rules with their 2017 draft budgets, the European Commission said in a statement on Wednesday. The five other countries are Belgium, Cyprus, Lithuania, Slovenia and Finland. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Draft Budgetary Plans of these Member States might result in a significant deviation from the adjustment paths toward the respective medium-term objective,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the Commission said. The medium-term objective is a budget balanced in structural terms, which means excluding one-off spending and revenue and the effects of the business cycle. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s structural deficit, which excludes one-off items and economic cycle swings in income and spending, has been rising every year since 2014 and is to jump to 2.2 percent in 2017 from 1.6 percent in 2016 and then further to 2.4 percent in 2018, according to Commission forecasts last week. This goes clearly against EU rules which say that countries have to cut their structural deficit by at least 0.5 percent of GDP every year until they reach balance or surplus. Italy says the higher structural deficit is due to extraordinary spending on migration and post-earthquake reconstruction. But the structural deficit indicator does not take into account such one-off items and the Commission called the explanation \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not constructive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. On Wednesday, European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs Pierre Moscovici sounded more accommodating. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The significant part of the deviation is due to the cost of the seismic activity in the country, very serious this year and to migration inflows,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Moscovici told a news conference. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will take that into account,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. The pound\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s renewed dip came after an early gain in the immediate aftermath of the UK unemployment figures. Chris Saint, Senior Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Currency Service, said: Sterling has drifted lower against the euro and US dollar during European trading hours this morning, finding itself back around the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.16 and US$1.24 levels by midday. There was some tentative support for the pound after today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK labour market figures, but the gains were short-lived...On the face of it the headline numbers suggest the jobs market has remained buoyant in the first few months since the EU referendum, although the data probably does little to alter the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future policy path at this stage as pay growth is still relatively contained. The stronger dollar has helped send the oil price lower, after a surge in crude on Tuesday. Talk of an informal meeting on Friday in Doha between oil producers to prepare plans for an output agreement later this month had sent crude soaring around 5% on Tuesday. But the dollar strength, along with news from the American Petroleum Institute that US crude stocks jumped by 3.6m barrels last week rather than showing the expected 1.5m rise, has send crude slipping lower again. Brent is down 1.13% at $46.42 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate is 1.2% lower at $45.23. The dollar continues to strengthen as the odds of a US interest rate rise next month continue to shorten. Federal Reserve board member James Bullard is the latest to back an increase, saying that unless there are any major shocks, rates will be hiked. Given how the market has reacted to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unexpected victory in the US election, it is hard to know what major shock would upset the market at this point. But Bullard, who was in London as a UBS banking conference, added that a single rate rise might be enough to move monetary policy to a neutral setting. So the dollar index - against a basket of currencies - has hit a 14 year high of 100.52, while the pound is down 0.17% to $1.2431. Naeem Aslam at Think Markets said: The strength in the dollar index does represent a risk for the emerging markets and it can also eat into corporate profit for the US firms. The current move is also massively backed by bets that the Fed is going to raise the interest rate and odds are standing at 94%. It is important to keep in mind that come in December, it is the tone of the Fed for the future trajectory of the interest rate hike which is going to impact the dollar. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our economics editor Larry Elliott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take on the figures: All things considered, the government will be happy with how the labour market performed in the first three months after the EU referendum. Unemployment has continued to fall and at 4.8% of the workforce is at its lowest level for 11 years. Employment has continued to rise and there are plenty of jobs to be had. Ministers would not have expected anything better than that in the turbulent post-Brexit weeks and would have feared a much worse outcome. That said, the tone of next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s autumn statement will be that big challenges for the economy remain, and there are hints of possible trouble ahead from the latest labour market data from the Office for National Statistics. UK unemployment falls to 11-year low Read more One warning sign is the 49,000 increase in the number of economically inactive people \u00e2\u20ac\u201c those who have dropped out of the workforce \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in the latest quarter. Another is the rise of almost 10,000 in the claimant count measure of unemployment in October. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our report on the UK jobs data. Phillip Inman writes: Unemployment dropped to its lowest level in 11 years in September in a further indication that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employers have largely shrugged off the June Brexit vote. In the first health check of the labour market covering the three months since the referendum, official figures show the unemployment rate was 4.8%, the lowest since September 2005 and down from 4.9% in August and 5.3% a year earlier. Employment remained at a record high of 74.5% and annual wages rises, excluding bonuses, also nudged higher to 2.4% from 2.3% in August and 2.1% in July, according to the Office for National Statistics. But the claimant count in October jumped by its highest number since May, and analysts warned that the rate at which employers were taking on new workers had slowed dramatically. The full story is here: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s army of self-employed workers has swelled by over 4.5% in the last 12 months, which is a concern given recent revelations about life in the Gig economy. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market report shows that the self-employment total jumped by 213,000 in the last 12 months to 4.79 million, or 15.1% of all workers. In contrast, the number of employees rose by 256,000 to 26.82 million. These self-employed workers don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enjoy the benefits of employed workers, such as sickness and holiday pay and the minimum wage -- as was highlighted by protests by Deliveroo drivers and the successful court case brought by two Uber drivers. And figures released last month show that self-employed people are actually receiving less than 15 years ago [their pay is not included in the earnings figures]. The government has asked Matthew Taylor, a former top advisor to Tony Blair, to investigate the whole issue. Mike Cherry, National Chairman at the Federation of Small Businesses, says Britain simply hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t kept pace with the rise in self-employment. These figures are another signal that more needs to be done to support the self-employed, including on developing a clear legal definition of self-employment and on issues like access to mortgages and income protection, and addressing the discrepancies between the self-employed and employees in the social security system, such as on maternity pay. FSB is pleased with the announcement of the Taylor Review and we are looking forward to inputting into this.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Over in parliament, Theresa May has hailed today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment figures, at Prime Minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Questions. May argues: The unemployment figures show the strength of the fundamental of our economy The employment rate has never been higher, and the unemployment rate is at its lowest in a decade. May also reminded the Commons that search giant Google has just announced it will create 3,000 new jobs, as it builds a new HQ in Kings Cross. Our Politics Live blog has full coverage: Several economists are concerned that British pay packets will be gnawed by inflation next year. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market report shows that total pay rose by 2.3% over the last year, unchanged on a month earlier. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than inflation, which fell to 0.9% in October. But inflation is likely to jump to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest forecasts, which would erode earnings growth. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, fears that bosses won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to provide inflation-busting pay rises: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Annual pay growth remained at 2.3% on a three-month average basis, suggesting that workers are in a weak position to offset what is likely to be a sizeable rise in inflation over the next year. Indeed, the capacity of employers to pay more will not be supported by continued weak productivity growth. Overall, prospects of the labour market taking a turn for the worse in the not-too distant future are looking more likely.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd TUC General Secretary Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady is also worried that real pay growth is stalling, as inflation picks up \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Real pay growth is the slowest it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been since early 2015. Wages are not growing fast enough to withstand the rise in inflation expected next year. Without swift action from the government, working people could soon by paying the price for Brexit with another fall in living standards. The jobless rate in Wales has inched up to 4.4%, from 4.3% a month ago, due to a 3,000 increase in unemployment. But more encouragingly, 19,000 more people were in work than three months earlier. Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones argues that the principality is outperforming the rest of the country. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Year on year, Wales has outperformed the rest of the UK when it comes to improvements in employment, unemployment and economic inactivity. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unemployment in Wales, at 4.4%, is lower than in England, Scotland or Northern Ireland and remains well below the UK average. Meanwhile the employment rate remains close to its record high, with 41,000 more people in work across Wales than at this same time last year. Unemployment amongst 18 to 24 year-olds in Wales is down 9.1% on the year and there are also 19,000 fewer people economically inactive than a year ago. This graph, from the BBC, shows how Wales jobless rate dipped to just 4.1% over the summer: Professor Geraint Johnes, director of research at The Work Foundation, has delved into the labour market report to find some interesting details: The labour market statistics indicate that the labour market remains remarkably stable. The rolling three month measure of unemployment shows a fall of some 37,000 over the most recent quarter, with the rate of unemployment now at 4.8%. The unemployment fall has been widely distributed across the country, though there were increases in both the North West and the East. For the UK as a whole, both full-time and part-time employee numbers increased by 31000. The large gains in employment have all been in the service sector \u00e2\u20ac\u201c notably in the retail, hospitality and professional/scientific/technical areas. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public sector has continued to shrink, to its smallest size in at least 17 years. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures show that there were 5.33 million people employed in the public sector in June, 13,000 fewer than in March. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the lowest since comparable records began in 1999 John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, also fears that unemployment will rise in 2017, even though there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no sign of a Brexit shock yet: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unemployment tends to be a lagging indicator, and we could yet see a modest rise in the jobless total next year as uncertainty around the Brexit negotiations dampens business investment and slows overall economic growth. But we do not expect the UK economy to go into recession, so would not expect any large increases in unemployment. Several City experts are concerned that the number of Britons signing on for unemployment benefit jumped by almost 10,000 last month. Duncan Weldon of Resolution Group says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcearly warning sign\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of problems ahead. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, fears that UK unemployment will rise in the next few months: The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market continues to surprise with its resilience to the Brexit shock. The unemployment rate fell unexpectedly to a new 11-year low of 4.8% in the three months to September. This is yet more evidence that the labour market and the wider economy have fared better than expected since June\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum. However, there could be storm clouds gathering on the horizon. The claimant count \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which in a quirk of the data is a more recent figure than the unemployment rate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c jumped by 9,800 in October, with September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figure revised upwards from 700 to 5,600. All in all, it does seem likely that unemployment could tick up somewhat during the coming months, though dire predictions made in the immediate aftermath of the vote appear wide of the mark. David Cheetham of trading firm XTB.com is also concerned: The rise in the claimant count change - which is a fairer representation of the current environment as this data point covers the period until the end of last month - takes the shine off the good news at the very least and possibly even usurps it. In rising to 9.8k, this indicator came in at its highest level since November 2012 and when you also consider the upward revision of the prior print (to 5.6k from 0.7k) this could be taken as a warning sign that everything may not be quite as rosy as it appears for the labour market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ONS statistician David Freeman has sounded an important note of caution. He points out that employment growth is slowing; just 49,000 people found work in the July-September quarter, which is the slowest rate since March. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unemployment is at its lowest for more than ten years, and the employment rate remains at a record high. Nonetheless, there are signs that the labour market might be cooling, with employment growth slowing. Freedman also points out that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no sign that the Brexit vote has cut the number of EU workers in Britain: \u00e2\u20ac\ufffdThe Labour Force Survey also includes information on the nationality and country of birth of workers. That limited evidence suggests the referendum outcome and subsequent devaluation of sterling has had little impact so far on the number of EU workers in the UK labour force. As this chart shows, the number of workers from other EU countries in Britain rose by 221,000 in the last year, to 2.26m, while the number of nationals from non-EU nations rose by 20,000 to 1.23 million. Employment minister Damian Hinds has hailed the news that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate has hit its lowest rate since July to September 2005. Hinds says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yet again we have a strong set of figures, with employment continuing to run at a record high and unemployment falling to an 11-year low. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Growth is being fuelled by full-time professional jobs while wages are continuing to perform strongly, which underlines the resilience of the UK labour market. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The measures we have taken have put our economy in a position of strength, and we will work to ensure more people can benefit from these opportunities as we build a country that works for everyone.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment report shows that the number of people in work rose in the last quarter, and the number of people out of work fell. That kept the employment rate at a record high, but There were 31.80 million people in work, 49,000 more than for April to June 2016 and 461,000 more than for a year earlier. There were 23.24 million people working full-time, 350,000 more than for a year earlier. There were 8.56 million people working part-time, 110,000 more than for a year earlier. The employment rate was 74.5%, the joint highest since comparable records began in 1971. There were 1.60 million unemployed people, 37,000 fewer than for April to June 2016 and 146,000 fewer than for a year earlier. The unemployment rate was 4.8%, down from 5.3% for a year earlier and the lowest since July to September 2005. There were 803,300 people claiming unemployment-related benefits in October, up from 793,00 in September. Both men and women benefitted from the drop in unemployment, as this chart shows: There are now 876,000 men classed as unemployed men, 15,000 fewer than for April to June 2016 and 82,000 fewer than for a year earlier. And there are 728,000 unemployed women, 22,000 fewer than for April to June 2016 and 64,000 fewer than for a year earlier. We have a small, and welcome, rise in average earnings too. Average pay, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.4% annually in the July-September quarter, up from 2.3%. But pay including bonuses rose by 2.3%, matching last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures. The number of people signing on for unemployment benefit has jumped, by much more than economists expected. The claimant count rose by 9,800 in October, the ONS reports. And September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s number has been revised up too; 5,600 people signed on for benefits, not the 700 first reported. Breaking: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate has fallen to 4.8% in the three months to September. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a new 11-year low, down from 4.9% a month earlier. More to follow... Barratt Development have sent a shiver through the UK property market this morning by revealing it has cut the price of some high-end London properties, worth over \u00c2\u00a31m. Barratt CEO David Thomas told shareholders that. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Market conditions in London at higher selling prices remain more challenging. To mitigate these risks we have taken pricing action on a number of our sites in London.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Thomas explains that prices have been cut by 5% to 10% on a few of its most expensive, centrally located London sites in zones one and two. The company has 385 sites in the UK, about 20 of which are in London, with six or seven classed as higher-end in the capital. The wider market, though, is still performing well since the Brexit vote, Barratt said, with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153consumer demand is strong supported by good mortgage availability\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But the City isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed; Barratt shares have fallen over 2% this morning, with rival builders Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey shedding over 1%. One of the big threats facing Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market is the risk that City banks start to shift operations across to Europe, following the EU referendum. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s encouraging that Swiss bank UBS isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t poised to flee London. Chairman Axel Weber told a conference this morning that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are not planning to change anything any time soon and we will wait and see where the dust settles\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Weber (who used to run Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank) also predicted that the Brexit process will be volatile, with the key decisions only made at the climax of negotiations. Over in Athens, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting ready to welcome US president Barack Obama to the historic Acropolis site - by imposing a massive security clampdown in the area. Obama will then give a speech to the Greek people, which will probably cover Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s migration crisis, and Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own financial crisis. Last night, there were clashes in Athens as groups of protestors demonstrated against Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visit: Ocado\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price is getting an early morning drubbing, down almost 5%. The online supermarket is suffering because Morrisons have just announced a new deal with Amazon, to deliver shopping to its Prime customers within two hours (in parts of London and Hertfordshire anyway). Morrisons\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 shares jumped over 1% at the open, with ETX analyst Neil Wilson calling it a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153potential game-changing tie-up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pure profit for the supermarket - the scheme is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153capital light\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and will contribute to a \u00c2\u00a350m-\u00c2\u00a3100m incremental profit opportunity outlined in the 2015/16 preliminary results. This is a big money-spinner for Morrisons and gives it a massive edge over Tesco and Sainsbury in the home delivery market. With prices being slashed and competition fierce, this is the kind of deal that will make a big difference to the bottom line. Retail analyst Mark Brumby says the service could be another blow to Ocado (which also has a delivery deal with Morrisons). There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no drama in the financial markets this morning. The pound is bobbing around the $1.247 mark this morning, up a measly 0.1%, while the FTSE 100 index has dipped by just 7 points to 6785. Everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s waiting for the jobs report at 9.30am, says Conner Campbell of Spreadex, even though it may not be too dramatic Both the unemployment rate and wage growth readings are forecast to remain unchanged at 2.3% (though it could creep a bit higher to 2.4%) and 4.9% respectively; the jobless claims figure, on the other hand, is set to see a bit more movement, rising to 1,900 from the 700 seen the month previous. RBC Capital Markets believe Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unemployment rate may have actually fallen in the July-September quarter to 4.8%, a new 11-year low. That would cause much celebration on Downing Street, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure. But it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that next year won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be tough, RBC say: The unemployment rate could actually fall this month to 4.8% from 4.9%. The headline rate is the average of the last three single-month estimates and with the last two months both printing at 4.7% it looks highly likely that we see a tick down by one-tenth. This does though feel more like a short-term quirk than reflective of the outlook where a more challenging macroeconomic outlook in 2017 should put some modest upward pressure on unemployment. Accordingly our expectation for the range of employment gains over the last three months is 60-100k as a central case. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect many fireworks at 9.30am, though, predicting that: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for unemployment and wage growth both to be pretty unchanged, which wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide any obvious support for the pound. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s labour market has been surprisingly resilient to the shock of the EU referendum, with the unemployment rate remaining low but wage growth somewhat modest. So the big news this morning should be the latest jobs report, due at 9.30am. It will show if this trend continued into the Autumn, or if there are signs that Brexit is now hurting Economists predict that the unemployment rate remained at 4.9% in the three months to September. That would match last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 11-year low, and reassure the City about the state of the UK economy. The more timely claimant count report is expected to show that 2,000 more people signed on for unemployment benefit in October; any rise might indicate that firms are starting to cut jobs. But the real story could come in the earnings figures. Average wages over the last year may have risen by 2.4% (both including and excluding bonuses), up from 2.3%. We saw yesterday that inflation has dipped to 0.9%, but economists still expect it to rise over 2% in 2017. If wages don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keep pace, households face another real wage squeeze soon. Also coming up.... Barack Obama is due to give a speech in Athens, and tour the Acropolis, as his final tour of Europe continues. Yesterday, the outgoing US president put more pressure on Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creditors to offer meaningful debt relief -- an issue which may not be top of his successor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agenda. And in the corporate world, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting results from housebuilder Barratt, engine-maker Rolls-Royce, commercial property firm British Land and City broker ICAP.",

If it becomes difficult for them to live here in the future, whether legally or because they feel they are unwanted, the cheap pound won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shaw warns that an atmosphere of uncertainty around the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negotiation stance with Brussels has not helped inward investment to the UK, despite Theresa May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s insistence that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brexit means Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have heard that some investors have been holding back until there is clarity around what \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBrexit means Brexit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 means.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But recent events in other countries have left Britain looking like a comparatively safe investment opportunity. Speaking as Google confirmed the new London campus last week, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said the capital welcomed all comers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and unlike Canada, which was inundated with migration queries following the election of Donald Trump, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153our website is not going to crash\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Khan told the Guardian that Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commitment was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an example of people still having confidence in London\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. When asked directly whether Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election would help attract talent to the capital, he demurred. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had a special relationship with the US, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had presidents in the past who have been very familiar with the prime minister, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll wait and see about the relationship between the president elect and Theresa May. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The key thing is, American businesses have great relationships with British businesses, and Americans have great relationships with Brits. Google making a big announcement in London, I think, bodes well.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s London office is the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest engineering base outside the US, and houses the team behind Workplace, a product that lets businesses build their own internal Facebooks for employee communication. Intended to compete with Silicon Valley darling Slack, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of the first Facebook products that charges users directly: fees start at $1 per employee. Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campus won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be the largest, but it will contain the first Google owned and designed building outside America. It will also host one of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest tech successes of recent years, DeepMind: Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s world-leading AI research outfit. Co-founded by three Brits, Demis Hassabis, Shane Legg, and Mustafa Suleyman, DeepMind was bought by Google for \u00c2\u00a3400m in 2014. The fear among tech professionals is that a post-Brexit Britain will frighten away the skills and the money needed to ensure that more companies such as DeepMind emerge. For now, however, Google and Facebook are indicating that this will not be the case.",

This is partly because more retailers opted to spread out their deals over a longer period, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also because of the growth of online and mobile shopping. Black Friday has still captured the attention of shoppers this year and it seems the appetite for a bargain is still there \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but how consumers shop for those bargains is changing.</p> <p>People don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to wait until the stores open. Instead, they can search for deals at home or on their way to work \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the online trading figures for the early hours of Black Friday seem to show this was the case more than ever this year. </p> </blockquote> <p>The lack of crowds reminded one reader of the launch of the iPhone 7 at Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Viborg store in Denmark: </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmrlqyvselQ\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GmrlqyvselQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it for today.

                "bodyText":"As Black Friday sales continue across the UK, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to close up for the day. We haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t had the unseemly shop-floor scenes of 2014, as people scrapped to get their hands on the best deals. Guardian reporters hit the shops early this morning to find much calmer scenes, and small or no queues. However, retailers are reporting a big surge in online sales, as people shop on their mobile phones to get the best deals. Andy Brian, partner at retail specialist law firm Gordons, explains: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no surprise that we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have people queuing to get into stores like in previous years. This is partly because more retailers opted to spread out their deals over a longer period, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also because of the growth of online and mobile shopping. Black Friday has still captured the attention of shoppers this year and it seems the appetite for a bargain is still there \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but how consumers shop for those bargains is changing. People don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to wait until the stores open. Instead, they can search for deals at home or on their way to work \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the online trading figures for the early hours of Black Friday seem to show this was the case more than ever this year. The lack of crowds reminded one reader of the launch of the iPhone 7 at Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Viborg store in Denmark: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it for today. Thank you for reading the blog and for all your comments. Have a great weekend. AM appliancesdirect.co.uk says customers are taking advantage of Black Friday to make savings on big ticket items. Since midnight it has sold more than 4,000 blenders, over 2,000 washing machines, and 1,000 4K HD televisions. Mark Kelly, marketing manager, says demand has been strong as consumers want to buy big ticket items now before consumer prices start to pick up next year: We anticipated strong sales, but the popularity in cut price home appliances this year has surpassed our expectations. Shoppers have taken full advantage of thousands of pounds of savings on big ticket items in anticipation of price rises in technology early next year as a result of the exchange rate changes following the referendum result. Amazon reported brisk online sales as a result of its latest deals, as part of its extended Black Friday sale which started on 14 November and with new offers launched every day since. The top deals running today include discounts on bestselling Alexa \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchands-free\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 devices Amazon Echo and Echo Dot, with Echo available for just \u00c2\u00a3119.99, and Echo Dot available for just \u00c2\u00a339.99. Doug Gurr, Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK country manager, commented: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had a very positive customer response to the thousands of deals during our extended 12 day Black Friday Sale and customers have been snapping up lots of our great deals on offer since midnight. From the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Peterborough distribution warehouse Paul Firth, Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of music, said health and beauty products and toys were also doing well. Three of the top five best-selling items in its sports section were Fitbit Flex activity trackers (up to 50% off) while electric tootbrushes (up to 76% off) accounted for three of the top five beauty items. Star Wars toys and games were also snapped up, alongside the Disney Rapunzel doll with glowing hair. Like other retailers Amazon has completely sold out of this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s must-have toy, Hatchimals. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People are also buying practical and essential things such as PC memory cards and wi-fi extenders\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Firth said. Last year in the UK Amazon sold 7.4 million items on Black Friday - 86 items every second. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too early to tell what the picture is\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Firth added. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But it certainly all looks very busy. Busy, but ordered\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd At Peterborough, the 1,000 staff had been bolstered by another 2,000 to ensure no hitches with picking and packing during this key trading period. Football clubs are embracing Black Friday, with many offering 20% off kit and other merchandise in their shops and online. Leicester City, reigning Premier League champions, have got their own twist: Some more Black Friday stats, this time from Very.co.uk: 15 consoles sold every minute A smartwatch sold every 12 seconds 21 bottles of perfume every minute A set of curling tongs sold every 8 seconds Currys PC World says it had more than half a million visitors to its website before 6am. The two most popular products have been the Google Chromecast and the JVC 32C660 32\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Smart LED TV. Stuart Ramage, e-commerce director at Dixons Carphone: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been preparing for today for almost a year now to ensure the best deals for our customers. We continue to break records with orders already up 40% year-on-year since 2015, and as we predicted, shoppers are making the most of our stores being open early, but also placing orders by mobile devices with our highest ever mobile traffic share since Black Friday began. Argos says its busiest hour so far was between 8am and 9am, when it received about 700,000 web visits (80% of which were on mobiles and tablets). Popular products include iPads, PS4, xbox, Dyson vacuum cleaners and Beats headphones. It also expects TVs and toys to among the best sellers. Lunchtime is expected to mark another peak, and then 5pm to 7pm as people make their way home from work. Catherine Shuttleworth, chief executive at retail marketing agency, Savvy, is at the Argos distribution centre in Barton. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been here since 5.30am where there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sense of great calm and slick organisation despite this being the biggest and busiest day of the year for Argos. With 800-plus staff on site during this peak week they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expecting to pick over two million items and over 330,000 today. With business operating 24/7 the Barton distribution centre will process 15,000 parcels an hour alone. Not all retailers are slashing prices today, with some taking a different approach to the US-inspired discount day. The Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sarah Butler reports: Outdoor brands Patagonia and Braintree, as well as fashion chain FatFace, will be donating proceeds from the day to charity while Jigsaw and Next have both announced they will not be offering discounts. Meanwhile Berghaus is encouraging its customers to head outdoors as an alternative to the shopping frenzy. Patagonia will be donating its entire global sales income from its own website and stores on 25 November to 80 grassroots environmental organisations around the world, including Surfers against Sewage and London Waterkeeper in the UK. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As people think generously about family and friends, we also want to help our customers show love to the planet, which badly needs a gift or two,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the company said. Full story here: It may be Black Friday but for some, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all about Giving Tuesday. Giving Tuesday (this year on 29 November) began five years ago in the US as an antidote to the consumerism of Black Friday and Cyber Monday. The Charities Aid Foundation (CAF) brought it to the UK for the first time 2014, and is today calling on Black Friday shoppers to support a cause they care about next Tuesday. Hannah Terrey, head of policy and campaigns at CAF, says: After the frenzy of festive consumerism, #givingtuesday is a day for everyone to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdo good stuff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for a cause they care about, whether that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s donating money, volunteering time or simply talking about their favourite charities. Just like Black Friday and Cyber Monday, #givingtuesday has now firmly established itself as a regular fixture in the festive calendar. It is great to see that even more people are planning to take some time over Christmas to give something back to a good cause. Shoppers heading into Poundland expecting some Black Friday bargains for less than \u00c2\u00a31 are in for a shock. Poundland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprises include - for the first time - a range of products with price tags exceeding the standard \u00c2\u00a31. The discount retailer says it is the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153perfect destination to snap up a bargain this Black Friday\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which include up to 65% on perfumes and fragrances, including a 50 ml bottle of Eau de Gaga which can be snapped up for just \u00c2\u00a38, compared with the RRP of \u00c2\u00a332. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Markit, says the positive survey from the CBI suggests the economy is holding up in the fourth quarter, following growth of 0.5% in the third. He does, however, add a note of caution: A buoyant November CBI Distributive Trades survey points to consumers still splashing out in the fourth quarter, thereby boosting hopes that GDP growth will hold up well. Retailers will certainly be hoping that consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 willingness to spend holds up over the vital Christmas shopping period. The major problem facing the economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and retailers in particular - is that it looks inevitable that the fundamentals for consumers will progressively weaken over the coming months with inflation rising markedly due to the weakened pound and companies likely increasingly looking to hold down pay to limit their total costs. The labour market also looks likely to come under mounting pressure despite its current resilience. In the near-term, there is the possibility that some consumers will bring forward purchases of big-ticket items in the belief that their prices are likely to rise appreciably over the coming months. Retail sales picked up pace in November and were stronger than expected according to the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest snapshot. Volumes increased at the fastest rate in more than a year in the 12 months to November, driven higher by sales of items including clothing, hardware and DIY. The distributive trades survey found that 42% of retailers reported a rise in sales compared with a year ago, while 16% said they were down. The resulting balance of +26% was the strongest since September 2015, and far stronger than the +26% forecast by City economists. Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief economist, said November was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153buoyant\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd month for sales. With the later onset of cold weather, shoppers stocking up their winter wardrobe has helped to boost high street sales. While we expect to see decent growth in the near term, retailers are keeping a close eye on price rises coming down the track and the impact on consumer spending.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd John Lewis says it has seen strong demand from shoppers so far today. The busiest period was between 8am and 8.30am, as people shopped on their way into work. The department store chain is taking five orders every second online. There was a particular spike in transactions completed on mobile phones, up 21% between 8am and 9am. Best-selling products: The Sonos Play 1 is the biggest technology seller, selling one every ten seconds The Lego Simpsons house is the top seller by value Marc Jacobs perfume is the strongest seller by number Sophie Conran crockery is the best seller in John Lewis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s home department Home Dino Rocos, lead director and operations director at John Lewis, said online sales had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exceeded expectations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Back to Black Friday. Jo Causon, chief executive of the Institute of Customer Service, comments on how the event is changing: Black Friday in its original form \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the manic one-day, in-store shopping experience \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has already changed significantly over the past three years. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing the continuation of that evolution in 2016 with retailers extending their sales either side of Black Friday, and the term \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBlack Fiveday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 becoming more commonplace, as well as a continuation of the trend towards online. Little movement in Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major markets this morning. With thin trading expected in the US following Thanksgiving, investors elsewhere appear to be taking a bit of a breather: FTSE 100: flat at 6,831 Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX: flat at 10,690 France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAC: +0.1% at 4,547 Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IBEX: -0.1% at 8,646 Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FTSE MIB: +0.2% at 16,531 Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s STOXX 600: +0.1% at 342 Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK: With US markets likely to be in a thin post-Thanksgiving mood there appears to be little in the way of positive drivers for European markets this morning. This lack of interest has seen markets in Europe trading listlessly, weighed down on the one hand by weakness in the banking sector and a decline in oil prices ahead of next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s OPEC meeting in Vienna. James Knightley, senior UK economist at ING, says the second half of 2016 should prove rosy overall, but come 2017 the economy is likely to take a turn for the worse. This is a firm growth story that again shows the economy has weathered the Brexit storm very well so far. The data flow so far suggests that the fourth quarter should also post a decent growth rate, but we still expect a substantial slowdown in 2017. Our main concern relates to a squeeze on household spending power brought about by a sharp pick-up in inflation that isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matched by wage increases. We also expect a slowdown in hiring and investment by businesses as Brexit uncertainty kicks in and the political pressure rises once Article 50 is triggered. Here is a breakdown of how different parts of the economy performed in the third quarter, compared with the second. It grew by 0.5% overall (and 2.3% annually). Services sector output: +0.8% Industrial production: -0.5% Construction output: -1.1% Household spending: +0.7% Business investment: +0.9% Government spending: +0.4% Exports: +0.7% Imports: -1.5% The ONS has said there is no clear evidence yet to suggest the Brexit vote has had an impact on the economy. Darren Morgan, head of GDP at the ONS, has commented on this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second estimate of growth. He makes the point that although business investment grew in Q3, most of those spending decisions will have been taken before the referendum, when the UK was expected to vote to remain in the EU: Investment by businesses held up well in the immediate aftermath of the EU referendum, though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely most of those investment decisions were taken before polling day. That, coupled with growing consumer spending fuelled by rising household income, and a strong performance in the dominant service industries, kept the economy expanding broadly in line with its historic average.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Office for National Statistics has just published its second estimate of third-quarter growth, confirming a 0.5% increase in GDP. Business investment grew more than expected, by 0.9% over the quarter compared with expectations of 0.6%. It was a slight dip compared with business investment growth of 1% in the second quarter. More soon. Black Friday is also a thing in Brazil apparently. Photo evidence from S\u00c3\u00a3o Paulo: In other news, we have a couple of bits of interesting data coming up in the UK this morning. At 9.30 the Office for National Statistics will publish its second estimate of GDP in the third quarter. It is expected to confirm that the economy grew 0.5% between July and September, unchanged from the first estimate. The ONS is also expected to confirm an annual rate of growth of 2.3% in the third quarter. The second estimate will reveal new data on the spending side of the economy, and will offer a glimpse on firms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 willingness to spend in the months following the June Brexit vote. Business investment is expected to rise by 0.6% in the third quarter. At 11am the CBI will release its distributive trades survey for November. It is expected to show a slowdown in retail sales growth compared with October. Nick Bubb, independent retail analyst, gives his view on Black Friday: Well, it remains to be seen how busy the high street will be today, but the much-dreaded \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Black Friday\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sale promotions this week will undoubtedly pull a lot of business forward from December, at lower margins, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tempting to agree with the comment to the BBC by Peter Ruis, the boss of fashion chain Jigsaw, that Black Friday is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153complete and utter deception\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our latest news story: Retailers have shifted their approach to Black Friday since it arrived here in 2010 (thanks to Amazon). This year many BF discounts are not single-day offers but promotions that spread over days and weeks, with a bigger focus online. PCA Predict says there have been record breaking online transactions this morning, up 21% on last year between midnight and 7am. East London is home to the savviest shoppers, with the highest number of online transactions before breakfast, followed by Croydon and Birmingham. Mobiles have been the most popular device for deal-hunters so far but PCA Predict expect this could change to desktops over the day as consumers head into work. The top five busiest online shopping regions according to PCA: East London Croydon Birmingham Leicester Rotherham Back here in 2016, Black Friday appears to have moved online: My colleague Rupert Neate captured some of the madness of 2014 in this short video. Well worth a watch: Black Friday today is a far cry from the scenes we saw in stores in 2014, when there was an unseemly scramble for bargains such as televisions. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reminder from two years ago: Guardian reporters have been out and about since the early hours, joining the Black Friday bargain hunters. My colleague Sarah Butler says its been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more of a saunter than a scramble\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at Tesco Extra in Streatham: While online retailers were busy, stores were off to a slow start. At the Tesco Extra in Streatham, south London, there were only 11 people in the queue when the supermarket opened at 5am - not many more than the number of security guards. Some of those queuing had been there since 4.30am and were surprised how few people had turned up compared to last year. Tony was queuing up for a Hatchimal after being unable to get one for his kids online. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll either go home a hero of If they haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t got one I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be home in bed in half an hour.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Most of those in the queue were planning to pick up a TV from the large pile just inside the door. But it was more of a saunter than a scramble once the doors opened. Michael, who bought two TVs, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is quiet, very calm. Last year at Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it was crazy. I thought it would be a real rabble again.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He said he was buying himself a TV for the second year in a row as the one he got last year broke. Martin, the store manager at Tesco in Streatham, said he was expecting sales to build through the day into the afternoon. He said hundreds more TVs would be delivered over the weekend. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It will give us additional spend later on when people come in to do their normal shop,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. John Rogers, the new chief executive officer of Argos, told BBC Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today programme that there had been 500,000 visits to the retailer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website in the first hour of online trading between midnight and 1pm - up 50% on last year. He expects peak traffic between 7am and 10am as people shop on their mobile phones on their way to work. Rogers - the former finance director at Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s which has taken over the business - was speaking from Argos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s distribution warehouse in Burton-on-Trent, as part of a whistlestop \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnational tour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of its stores and facilities in the run-up to Christmas. For Black Friday itself, Argos has set up three \u00e2\u20ac\u0153war rooms\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. One will monitor and tweak deals, one will oversee systems \u00e2\u20ac\u201c standing ready to tackle any technical glitches - and the third will oversee communications with shoppers. Rogers predicts that Argos will take 70% or more of its orders online on that day, compared with 50% during normal trading, and that the company is better prepared for Black Friday than last year after rigorously testing its systems. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Black Friday is here again, but this time without the shop-floor stampedes. Retailers are instead reporting a surge in online traffic as shoppers seek out the best bargains at the discount event that began in the US but has been adopted by the UK in recent years. Argos said there were half a million visitors to its website in the first hour of Black Friday trading. So far we haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen the queues and chaos in shops that characterised Black Friday in 2014. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much more orderly this year. We will be bringing you updates on this, and other developments, as they happen.",

When the economy showed signs of resilience, there was a second prediction: the unexpected strength was driven by consumer spending and a different picture would be painted when figures for investment came in. Figures for investment were published last week. It was up in the third quarter. There has been another retreat to a new fallback position. Yes, the IMF and the OECD admit, we were taken by surprise by the strength of the economy in the months after the Brexit vote and we have been forced to revise up our growth forecasts for 2016. But, take it from us, the outlook for the UK is still grim. The downturn is coming \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is simply a matter of time. As such, the OECD expects the UK economy to slow from 2% this year to 1.2% in 2017 and 1% in 2018 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a markedly gloomier forecast than that produced by the Office for Budget Responsibility for last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s autumn statement (1.4% and 1.7% respectively for the same time periods). Despite the recent announcements from Google, Facebook, Apple, Jaguar Land Rover and Tata, the OECD is particularly concerned about the outlook for foreign direct investment into the UK. Who knows, the Paris-based thinktank could be right. The Brexit divorce negotiations have yet to begin, after all. For the time being, however, the OECD should not be surprised if it is the target for the old joke: there are three sorts of economists \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the ones who can count and the ones who can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t.",

The oil price has slumped by 3.5% tonight, as the markets prepare for tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Opec meeting. 3) Investors are bracing for volatility as Italy heads to the polls on Sunday to vote on PM Matteo Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s constitutional reforms. ECB sources have hinted that they would use their QE programme to stabilise the markets on Monday, if the public vote No -- a move that could prompt Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation. Adam Chester, head of economics for commercial banking at Lloyds Bank, predicts turbulence if Renzi loses (as seems likely): Italy is being asked whether to accept a broad package of measures aimed at making the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gridlocked political system more efficient and its government more stable. It has had more than 60 governments since the Second World War, so one might think that measures to improve stability would be strongly welcomed. But a key implication of the proposed changes is that incumbents would have far more power, which is strongly resisted by opposition parties, and there is a clear risk that the people will vote against the government, particularly given the weakness of Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy. If the referendum is not passed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the polls suggest a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcNo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 win \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Prime Minister Renzi could step down, leading to early elections and boosting the anti-EU Five Star Movement (M5S), which has pledged a referendum on whether Italy should stay in the euro. If Italy votes \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcNo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, the euro is likely to come under immediate downward pressure and contagion could also see government bond and credit spreads across much of Europe rise. 4) Companies have been teaming up with charities for Giving Tuesday: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably all for today. Tomorrow will be extra-busy, with Bank of England stress test results released at 7am GMT, and Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting running through the day. See you then. Goodnight! GW Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market has defied worries about Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum to close 2% higher. The FTSE MIB index outperformed the rest of Europe, helped by that Reuters report that the ECB would step in to stabilise the markets next week, if needed. The German, French, and Spanish indices also finished the day higher, But the FTSE 100 lost 27 point, or 0.4%, to finish at 6772 - dragged down by energy companies including BP (-2.1%) and Shell (-2%). City traders haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been impressed by the lack of progress at Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting in Vienna today: Joshua Mahoney of IG says: Despite an initial consensus, a deal feels as far away as ever, with members continuing to conduct an intricate game of political poker, utilising the media to further their cause. It is becoming increasingly evident that some of the more prominent OPEC members care more about holding on to market share than helping raise the price of oil. Hence despite agreeing to a production cut, we have seen the likes of Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran all continue to raise production. In another signal that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy is solid, sales of recreational vehicles are on track to hit their highest level in four decades. Shipments of new RVs are expected to hit 419,500 this year, industry figures say, up 12% on last year. These whopping motorhomes and trailers are, apparently, popular with Millennials who want to get into the Great Outdoors in some comfort. But....these things don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come cheap. A typical RV will cost six-figures,. You could even splash out one million dollars if, say, you want large beds, flat screen TVs and space for your own sports car.... Meanwhile in Greece... Athens has received an unexpected boost ahead of next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting of eurozone finance ministers (the eurogroup). Our correspondent Helena Smith reports. The Dutch finance minister and eurogroup head Jeroen Dijsselbloem has not always batted for Greece but today he came out firmly in favour of Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 longstanding argument that primary surplus targets set by international creditors in the years ahead are simply unachievable. Addressing the European Parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic affairs committee, the Dutchman suggested it would be counter-productive if Greece was given unrealistic fiscal targets once its current bailout program expires in 2018. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need to be realistic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said adding that it would be a big ask if Athens was made to pull off the herculean task of achieving a 3.5% primary surplus when its fiscal adjustment program was finally completed. Djisselbloem\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments come in the wake of similar optimism expressed by visiting European Economic Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici. Conducting a two-day visit to Athens ahead of next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s euro group, the Frenchman also voiced support for the leftist-led government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bid to secure debt relief saying reprofiling of the unustainable load should also begin by year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s end. At over \u00e2\u201a\u00ac300bn, or 180% of GDP, Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt burden is the biggest in Europe and widely viewed as the root of its financial woes. But demands for more austerity still loom large and could threaten to overturn economic progress in the months ahead. Back in Vienna, the UAE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil minister has told energy reporters that Opec could still achieve a deal to cut output tomorrow. Suhail Mohamed Faraj Al Mazrouei said it was premature to assume that the cartel would fail, despite the clashes between Saudi Arabia and Iran behind the scenes. Amena Bakr of Energy Intelligence has the details (again): After the excesses of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, British business has been showing its charitable side today. For the third year running, voluntary bodies have been working with companies to encourage people to give money, or time, to good causes - from cancer charities to Syrian aid. Some 1,500 UK-based businesses and charities are taking part this year, including BT - which hosted an event at its iconic Tower this morning - Royal Mail, Royal Bank of Scotland, and several retailers including Morrisons, Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, and the Co-op. The idea started in the 2012 in America, and last year, it raised over $45m worldwide. The Charities Aid Foundation is co-ordinating it in the UK. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve sent some details over: A choir of MPs singing Christmas carols on College Green to raise money to support the work of doctors in Aleppo, as part of the Singing for Syrians appeal. MPs taking part included Victoria Prentis, Will Quince, Robert Buckland, Andrea Jenkyns and Eilidh Whiteford. Pictures are available on request.

CAF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hannah Terrey has written about it for us here: And there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a new-fangled Twitter Moment too.... An Opec source has now told Reuters that Iran want Saudi Arabia to cut its output to 9.5m barrels per day, from around 10.5m today. That means Saudi would be taking the entire one million barrel per day cut which was provisionally agreed in September in Algeria. That may be unacceptable to Riyadh -- both economically and politically.... The Opec situation in a brisk nutshell: These latest comments out of Vienna show that Iraq and Iran are at odds with Saudi Arabia over the proposed Opec output cut. The hardline stance from Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Zangenah shows that Tehran is not willing to curb its own output. The situation is complicated; there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no real agreement on how much Iran is actually pumping today! So Saudi Arabia are effectively being challenged to swallow the output cut themselves, while other cartel members would simply benefit from the resulting higher prices. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reuters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 latest dispatch from the Opec HQ: OPEC sources told Reuters a meeting of experts in Vienna on Monday failed to bridge differences between OPEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s de factol eader, Saudi Arabia, and the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second- and third-largest producers over the mechanics of output cuts. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will leave the level of production (where) we decided in Algeria,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh told reporters upon arrival in Vienna, effectively signalling he was not prepared to reduce output. OPEC, which accounts for a third of global oil production, agreed in September to cap output at around 32.5-33.0 million barrels per day versus the current 33.64 million bpd to prop up oil prices, which have halved since mid-2014. OPEC said it would exempt Iran, Libya and Nigeria from cutsas their output has been crimped by unrest and sanctions. The deal was seen as a victory for Iran. Tehran has long argued it wants to raise production to regain market share lost under Western sanctions, when its political arch-rival SaudiArabia increased output. In recent weeks, Riyadh offered to cut its own output by 500,000 barrels per day, according to OPEC sources, and suggested Iran limit production at around 3.8 million bpd - in line with or slightly above the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current output. But Tehran has sent mixed signals including that it wanted to produce 4.2 million bpd. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a video clip of the scrum (or possibly rolling maul) which greeted Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil minister, Bijan Namdar Zanganeh, as he arrived in Vienna. Listen out for the breaking vase! There is high drama in Vienna, where Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil minister has declared that his country will NOT cut oil production. Bijan Namdar Zanganeh told a heaving throng of oil reporters that Iran would stick to the production levels set earlier this year, and would not accept any output cuts. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a blow to Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chances of finalising a deal to cut production levels at tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official meeting in Vienna. And Bloomberg is now reporting that Saudi will reject a deal, unless Iran and Iraq agree to a compromise These comments have sent the Brent crude oil price plunging by over 3% to 46.51 per barrel, down over 1.5 dollars. The press scrum also sent a vase flying to the floor of Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hotel foyer -- the second broken vase in as many days! As we covered earlier, Indonesia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil minister had also told reporters that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not optimistic about a deal this week. FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga says traders aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t confident either: Reports of Russia not attending the OPEC gathering has dented hopes of a meaningful deal while concerns of Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia failing to bridge their differences continues to encourage sellers to attack oil. The US Federal Reserve is now even more likely to hike interest rates next month, says Ian Kernohan, Economist at Royal London Asset Management: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Robust US GDP growth in the third quarter, driven by household demand, was a marked improvement on the first half of the year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This should bolster the case for a rise in US interest rates in December. We think the Fed will wait until they see the scale and timing of any Trumpflation fiscal boost, before altering their language about gradual rate hikes.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth figures are a sign that America has recovered from a slow start to 2016, says the FT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Adam Samson. The data released on Tuesday confirm that the economy expanded in the third quarter at the fastest rate in two years, representing a sharp pick-up from the 0.8 per cent and 1.4 per cent pace logged in the first and second quarters, respectively. Consumption growth, a key element of US economic output, was revised higher to a 2.8 per cent pace, from the previous reading of 2.1 per cent. FT: US GDP revision confirms strengthening recovery The Wall Street Journal is impressed by the pick-up in corporate profits: Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report also showed that a key measure of U.S. corporate profits increased for the third consecutive quarter. Profits after tax, without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments, rose 3.5% from the second quarter to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.694 trillion in the third quarter. Compared with a year earlier, after-tax profits rose 5.2% last quarter, the strongest annual reading since the fourth quarter of 2012. WSJ: US GDP Growth Revised Up to Strongest Expansion in Two Years Christopher Vecchio of DailyFX reckons growth will continue to accelerate in the current quarter. Breaking! America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy grew even faster than expected in the last three months. US GDP rose by an annualised rate of 3.2% in the July to September quarter, up from the first estimate of 2.9%, according to new data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). This is the fastest growth rate since the third quarter of 2014, thanks to stronger consumer spending, exports (especially soybeans!) and federal government spending. That equates to a quarterly expansion of around 0.8% - which means America comfortably outpaced Britain, which only grew by 0.5%, and Germany and France (which both grew by a mere 0.2%). The Commerce Department says: The acceleration in real GDP in the third quarter primarily reflected an upturn in private inventory investment, an acceleration in exports, an upturn in federal government spending, and smaller decreases in state and local government spending and residential fixed investment, that were partly offset by a deceleration in PCE (personal consumption), an acceleration in imports, and a deceleration in nonresidential fixed investment. Italian government bonds are strengthening, on the back of that report that the ECB would step in if the public reject Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s constitutional changes on Sunday. The yield, or interest rate, on its 10-year debt has dropped to 1.97%, down from 2.06% earlier. That means investors see the bonds as less risky. And bank stocks are pushing higher too; up 2.4%. Eric Lascelles, chief economist at RBC Global Asset Management, argues that Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t trigger a major crisis. While there is the possibility of a slippery slope involving a snap election, a victory by the Eurosceptic Five Star Movement and then very real questions about Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ongoing membership in the Eurozone, it is more likely that an election is averted, with a good chance that Renzi will be reappointed as Prime Minister. Even in the context of an election, it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t clear that the Five Star Movement would be able to govern by itself. In the less likely scenario that the referendum passes, this would enable the Italian government to move more briskly on many much-needed structural economic reforms. Insiders at the European Central Bank have told Reuters that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d step in and buy more Italian bonds, if Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum leads to short-term market volatility. The ECB could use \u00e2\u20ac\u0153flexibility\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in its existing quantitative easing scheme to mop up extra Italian debt and prevent prices slumping, as investors digest the result of the vote. However, if Italy requires longer-term help, it will have to seek a formal bailout. Reuters says: The ECB could use its 80-billion-euro ($84.8 billion) monthly bond-buying programme to counter any immediate, further spike in bond yields after the vote, smoothing market moves and supporting bonds, according to four euro zone central bank sources who asked not to be named. The sources added the scheme was flexible enough to allow for a temporary increase in Italian purchases and that such a move would not necessarily need to be rubber-stamped by the ECB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Governing Council, which is due to meet on December 8 to decide on whether to keep buying bonds after March. But they stressed this would be limited to days or weeks, to counter any immediate market volatility, because the asset-purchase programme was designed to shore up inflation and economic growth in the entire euro zone and was not intended to fight crises in individual countries. Newsflash from America: Jewellery chain Tiffany &amp; Co has admitted that its flagship store in New York has suffered from being sited next to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headquarters. Tiffany has told shareholders that it has suffered \u00e2\u20ac\u0153some adverse effect on traffic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, due to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153recent election-related activity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd near its New York store. That store is on the corner of 5th Avenue and 57th Street, adjacent to Trump Tower, meaning access has been affected by the protests against the president-elect. Tiffany also warns that it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide any assurance that sales won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t suffer in the crucial Christmas period, or beyond. However, it also emphasises that the store provides less than 10% of its net sales. Tiffany describes its New York shop as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153simply the most famous store there is\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd -- partly thanks to the exploits of Ms Holly Golightly. But it now finds itself right next to a massive security operation. Concrete barriers have been erected outside Trump Tower, and armed police are posted outside, at a reported cost of $1m per day. Security is likely to be extremely tight on 5th Avenue throughout Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tenure as president, depending how much time he spends at the Tower. His wife Melania, and son Barron, are expected to stay there until at least the end of the school year, and will require constant protection. The New York Daily News reported two weeks ago that the US secret service wants to close 5th Avenue down when the president is in situ, which would clearly be bad news for local shops. And the New York Post reports that local restaurants have suffered from falling sales. Willie Degel, founder of Uncle Jack\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Steakhouse on 56th Street and Sixth Avenue, fumed: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It has been a complete nightmare. Pedestrian foot traffic is down tremendously. Everybody in the area is suffering.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The good news for Tiffany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is that worldwide net sales increased 1% in the last three months. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its third-quarter results. Austria could also contribute to eurozone worries this weekend, when voters head to the polls to choose a new president. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a straight fight between far-right candidate Nobert Hofer, of the Freedom Party, and Alexander Van der Bellen, a former leader of the Greens Party. Van der Bellen is running on a pro-EU platform, saying voters have a choice between \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a co-operative and an authoritarian style.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still in 2016, this may be tempting fate.... This vote was originally due to take place in September, but was postposed when the glue on some postal votes failed (very 2016!). Carlo Alberto de Casa, Chief Analyst at ActivTrades, says traders will be watching events closely: We are seeing a weight of pressure on the euro due to the Italian Referendum and the re-run of the Austrian presidential vote, both taking place this weekend. They could impact the euro significantly. The oil price is sliding as Opec members struggle to reach an accord before Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s make-or-break meeting. Indonesia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy minister has sparked the selloff, by telling reporters in Vienna that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not optimistic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that the cartel will agree a supply cuts deal tomorrow. Brent crude is currently down almost one dollar per barrel at $47.37, a 1.8% decline. Indonesia are only a small player, but traders are clearly desperate for any smoke signals from the Opec HQ. The success, or failure, of Opec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting appears to depend on Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq. Analysts reckon that the authorities in Tehran and Baghdad has hoped that Riyadh would swallow the proposed output cuts itself, allowing them to keep pumping. But Saudi are taking a harder line -- even though their economy is suffering badly from the low oil price. Veteran Opec analyst Yasser Elguindi of Medley Global Advisors dubs it a poker game: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The stakes are extremely high, and everyone seems to be upping the ante. The thing with poker though is you can win even if you have a weak hand. But right now its hard to know who is bluffing and who is holding aces.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s farming industry is facing a labour shortage as foreign fruit and veg pickers leave the UK following the EU referendum. The Financial Times reports that half the firms who supply workers to the horticulture sector couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find enough labour in the July-September quarter. And the National Farmers Union is getting worried, the FT says: In a letter to Robert Goodwill, the immigration minister, dated November 10 and seen by the FT, Minette Batters, the NFU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy president, warned: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is a clear emerging labour crisis in the industry\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a very real risk that British fruit and vegetables will be left to rot unpicked in British fields in 2017\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Rural areas saw solid support for Leaving the EU in June -- but perhaps farmers didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctaking back control\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to mean \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno-one wants to pick our carrots\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Tax lawyer Jo Maugham points out that the slump in the pound means workers from the eurozone now earn almost 20% less. Anyone who likes a spot of Christmas pud faces further heartache -- the sugar, raisins and butter are now much pricier. The euro has dipped back below \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.06 this morning, down 0.2%. Caxton FX analyst Alexandra Russell-Oliver blamed \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpolitical risks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: The euro may have received some initial support as Fillon won France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Republican Party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential nomination, before coming under renewed pressure. Political risks remain a downwards pressure on the euro; attention at the moment has largely been on Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s constitutional referendum on 4 December. Boom! UK consumers are running up credit at the fastest rate in over a decade, before the credit crunch And people are taking out more mortgages too, in another signal that Brexit uncertainty isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hurting consumer confidence yet. Reuters has the details: Consumer credit increased last month by \u00c2\u00a31.62bn, up from \u00c2\u00a31.48bn in September and taking the annual growth rate to 10.5%- the strongest since October 2005, Bank of England data showed on Tuesday. Mortgage approvals for house purchases increased to 67,518 in October from 63,594 in September. Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast 65,000 mortgage approvals were made in October. Over in France, statistics body INSEE has confirmed that the economy grew by a lacklustre 0.2% in the third quarter of 2016. That matches the provisional reading; we now also know that consumer spending was flat, investment crept up by 0.2%. Economists believe consumer spending will pick up in the run-up to Christmas -- that could be crucial, with the French presidential election due next spring. After a slow start, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking shares have now rallied by 2% today. That may mean investors are a little more hopeful that Italy can ride out this crisis. Erik Nielsen, chief economist at Unicredit, says there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no chance that the Italian referendum could trigger a Lehman Brothers-style collapse. Speaking on Bloomberg, Nielsen explains that thee Italian banks are too small, and they also have the European Central Bank waiting in the wings to help if needed. Nielsen says investors are anticipating defeat for Renzi on Sunday. Nobody really expects a yes vote, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a question about how close it will be and if those opinion polls from way back are right or wrong. But whatever happens, Italy needs to tackle the under-performing loans that are clogging up its financial sector. As Nielsen puts it: The big, big question is, whichever scenario comes though, can Italy address the question of the medium-sized banks which everyone knows they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been dragging their feet on for too long. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too early to assume that the Italian people will reject Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to reform the Senate, says Deutsche Bank. They point out that many voters were undecided last week (before we entered a polling black0out period). They might yet fall behind Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drive to concentrate political power in the lower house, making it easier to get legislation into law. True... but as Deutsche\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chart shows, the No campaign has been widening its lead for since the summer: Now this is interesting.... Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera is reporting that Matteo Renzi is considering resigning as prime minister even if he wins on Sunday. Under this strategy, Renzi would look to be re-appointed as prime minister with a new government, and broader support in the current parliament. Then he could push through more constitutional reforms, before holding general elections in 2017 and 2018. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Correire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s piece. And here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take: Most European stock markets have fallen in early trading, extending yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drops, as Italian referendum fears give traders an extra chill. However, the Italian FTSE MIB has actually risen a little after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% slide (it may only be a cattus mortuus bounce, as the index has lost 28% in the last year). Kit Juckes of Societe Generale predicts nervousness until the weekend: Since we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll hear no more about the Italian referendum until the event itself, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure what is supposed to provide clear direction in Europe today. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more a case of angst, which probably will, at some point, turn into nervousness sufficient to take the Euro back down. Writing in the Daily Telegraph today, Ambrose Evans-Pritchard warns that Italy could need a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac40bn bailout to patch up its banks. He says markets are bracing for Renzi to be defeated on Sunday, triggering months of political turmoil. Sources in Rome say the Italian government may have to turn to the European Stability Mechanism for a bank rescue, a humiliating and painful course that must be approved by the German Bundestag. It would amount to a partial \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Troika\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdadministration under terms dictated by the EU. One senior Italian banker said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We think the banks will have to raise \u00e2\u201a\u00ac40bn in fresh capital. This is going to need an ESM bail-out. The problems in the banks are becoming an excuse to put Italy under an EU programme. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen under Renzi because he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be there any longer after a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcNo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 vote. What we expect is a technocrat government that pushes this through.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More here: Global investors are becoming more concerned that the eurozone could break up, as fears over Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future grow. German research form Sentix reports that almost 20% of investors expect Italy to leave the eurozone in the next 12 months - the highest level since they started polling four years ago. Investors are worried that Matteo Renzi will lose Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referendum, and concerned about the financial health of the Italian banking sector, says Julien Muller of Sentix. Overall, the chances that a single country leaving the eurozone has risen to 24.1%, well below the peaks over 70% seen at the height of the 2012 crisis. Global stock markets could be rocked next week if the Italian people reject Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reform plan, says Kathleen Brooks of City Index. She says: A no vote on Sunday is a major event risk for the European financial sector. Up to 8 Italian banks could fail, as Matteo Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bank bailout programme is likely to be scrapped if he resigns. It is not known what would replace it, or if the European authorities would step in to save the Italian financial system. If not, then the creditworthiness of some of the larger more systemic banks, such as Deutsche Bank, could be at risk. DB has plenty of risks of its own, if the European authorities don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t save Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banking sector, then how could it justify saving Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest bank? Thus, we could see further declines in DB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock price before the week is out. Brooks also points out that referendum opinion polling has been suspended since November 18, creating extra uncertainty: This is likely to increase the tension and nervousness around this referendum, and could keep market volatility high for the rest of this week. The Vix, Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fear gauge, started to rise on Monday, and we could see further advances in volatility in the coming days, putting pressure on stocks and causing safe havens like the yen and US Treasuries to rally. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Eurozone crisis jitters are returning to the City this morning, as investors worry that the smouldering problems in Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy are about to burst into life. On Sunday, Italian votes head to the polls to vote on constitutional reforms - and many observers believe they will slap down prime minister Mattio Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to curb the power of the Senate. That could trigger Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation, and potentially pave the way for radical, anti-Euro Five Star Movement to take power. That could scupper efforts to recapitalise Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks, which are weighed down by bad loans, and possibly require a full-blown bailout from the European Central Bank. As Laurent Frings, head of credit research at Aberdeen Asset Management, put it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banks are at a critical stage in trying to rebuild their finances and, if Renzi loses the referendum and quits, then those efforts are going to be in deep trouble.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Renzi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t guaranteed, even if he loses his referendum. He could potentially stay on as caretaker PM, but even this would leave Italy looking less stable. Renzi has insisted that political power needs to be more concentrated in the lower house of parliament, and the government, transforming the Senate from a directly elected upper house into a more consultative body representing Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cities and regions. Italian bank shares slid by almost 4% on Monday, dragged down by referendum worries and fears that financial firm Monti Dei Paschi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rescue plan might falter. Also coming up today... Things are getting frostier, literally and metaphorically, in Vienna ahead of tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting of the Opec oil cartel. Yesterday, technical talks between Opec members failed to reach a deal on how to cut production. (non-Opec member) Russia has helpfully weighed in, with Vladimir Putin saying it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important that Opec stabilises the market. In the UK, prime minister Theresa May will announce a crackdown on excessive pay at privately owned companies, to bring them into line with firms floated on the stock market. The announcement is due around lunchtime. Our City editor Jill Treanor has the story: Theresa May is to promise a crackdown on boardroom excess at large privately owned businesses as she unveils proposals intended to hold corporate Britain to account. The prime minister said the government would look at ways to bring privately owned companies under a regime that could mimic the one imposed on major stock market companies. While many private companies were performing well, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we have, however, seen an irresponsible minority of privately held companies acting carelessly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c leaving employees, customers and pension fund beneficiaries to suffer when things go wrong. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So we will explore ways to improve and extend good governance across big business so that everybody plays by the same rules and we create an economy that works for everyone, not just the privileged few.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We get a new healthcheck on the French and American economies today. 7.45am GMT: Second estimate of France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP for the third quarter of 2016 (first estimate was 0.2% growth) 1.36pm GMT: Second estimate of US economic growth in Q3 (first estimate was 3.0% annualised growth) Plus, entertainment group Merlin and sausage maker Cranswick are reporting results. And telecoms regulator Ofcom has announced it is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153proceeding with a formal notification\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to force BT to legally separate its Openreach arm, having been disappointed with progress to date. More on all that shortly...",
