                "bodyText":"Waitrose has taken a leaf out of sister brand John Lewis\u2019s Christmas TV ad playbook with a heart-tugging festive campaign that tells the story of an arduous epic journey home of a young robin. The ad, like John Lewis\u2019s trampoline bouncing Buster the boxer, uses hi-tech special effects to create the robin\u2019s transcontinental Christmas migration in what Waitrose says is the \u201cmost creatively sophisticated\u201d ad it has ever made. The TV ad tells the tale of the real-life migration of a young Scandinavian robin across mountains and seas to reach his home in a UK garden to be reunited with his mate to enjoy a festive treat, a Waitrose mince pie left each year by a young girl. The 90-second commercial \u2013 made by adam&amp;eveDDB, the agency best known for making a string of famous commercials for John Lewis \u2013 has a hint of the touching epic trip concept used for John Lewis\u2019s 2012 festive tear-jerker The Journey. \u201cComing home is a central theme at Christmas when welcoming, hosting and providing a special meal for loved ones is at the heart of celebrations,\u201d said Rupert Thomas, marketing director at Waitrose, which is part of the John Lewis Partnership. \u201cIt\u2019s a story of love, courage and the importance of enjoyment with family and friends.\u201d The ad marks a new creative direction for Waitrose bearing little resemblance to its 2015 Christmas campaign, which featured a cameo from brand ambassador Heston Blumenthal and was set to Cab Calloway\u2019s 1948 jazz classic Everybody Eats When They Come To My House. Waitrose\u2019s ad, which will air for the first time on ITV during the X Factor results show on Sunday night, features an adaptation of \u201cCambridge, 1963\u201d by Icelandic composer J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson from his score of film The Theory of Everything. Waitrose said every element story of the star character of the Robin, a CGI creation by special effects house The Mill, has been fact-checked to make sure it is as \u201cclose to reality and factually correct as possible\u201d. The supermarket, which spent \u00a313m on advertising in the final quarter run-up to Christmas last year, is hoping the robin might become something of a festive hit. The supermarket says there will be \u201cvarious robin-related products\u201d made available in stores, including kitchenware, clothing, toys and wrapping paper. There will also be a game, developed by the supermarket\u2019s media agency MG OMD, which will give social media followers an \u201cinteractive experience\u201d, of the robin\u2019s journey home. Waitrose is making sure all the multimedia bases are covered by also launching a book telling the story of the robin\u2019s journey in the advert is due to hit book shops from 14 November. \u201cWe\u2019re really proud of the plucky little fella and his plight to get home for Christmas,\u201d said Richard Brim, executive creative director at adam&amp;eveDDB. \u201cIt\u2019s a warming story that speaks to the spirit of togetherness in the festive season and the joy of just coming home. It feels like a great way to wrap up a great year for Waitrose.\u201d Last year, Sainsbury\u2019s released a book by Judith Kerr on the adventures of Mog the calamitous cat, the star of its Christmas TV campaign, which topped bestseller lists and raised more than \u00a31.5m for Save the Children. John Lewis sold more than \u00a32.5m of Monty merchandise, the star of its 2014 Christmas campaign, including 48,000 soft toys, some of which went for as much as \u00a3500 on eBay as stores sold out. Sainsbury\u2019s, one of the last major supermarkets still to launch its Christmas campaign, will debut this year\u2019s follow-up to the hugely popular Mog the cat ad on Monday.",

They range from cheap Christmas tree lights, electric toothbrushes and thermal socks to expensive laptops, iPads, music keyboards, violins and pingpong tables.</p> <p>In some cases, VAT fraudsters offer unbeatable prices.

UK shoppers will have spent \u00a36.77bn on the web in a seven-day shopping binge that peaked on Black Friday, according to online retail association <a href=\"https://www.imrg.org/media-and-comment/press-releases/imrg-black-friday-online-retail-forecast-2016/\">IMRG</a>. The number of parcels ordered online will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/20/road-safety-risk-tired-black-friday-delivery-drivers-health-and-safety-executive\">up 12% on last year, it estimates</a>.</p> <p>The market for many goods is now dominated by overseas sellers. On eBay, for example, 40% of UK sales of Android phones are to firms registered in China. Meanwhile, Chinese-based companies account for more than 60% of sales of Christmas tree fairy lights on eBay.co.uk.</p> <p>There is no suggestion that Amazon or eBay have themselves evaded tax, but critics claim they could make some basic changes \u2013 such as requiring sellers to display valid VAT numbers \u2013 that would help to stop their websites being used by many overseas companies as a platform for industrial-scale fraud.</p> <p>Both eBay and Amazon insist that it is not their responsibility to police tax compliance among sellers. VAT rules are complex but the tax generally applies to most goods supplied from locations in the UK even if the seller company is incorporated overseas. Shoppers typically see prices that include VAT, charged on most goods at the standard rate of 20%.</p> <p>Amazon told the Guardian: \u201cMarketplace sellers are independent businesses responsible for complying with their own VAT obligations.\u201d It added that Amazon does offer tools sellers can use to help with tax compliance, but \u201cwe don\u2019t have the authority to review their tax affairs\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef40b8699b6e36df8232f3ca3e5c58deb34c136e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef40b8699b6e36df8232f3ca3e5c58deb34c136e/0_138_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"EBay said it \u2018continually reminds\u2019 sellers of their need to comply with the law.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">EBay said it \u2018continually reminds\u2019 sellers of their need to comply with the law.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: eBay/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>EBay said it would pass information from the Guardian\u2019s investigation to HMRC: \u201cIf we are informed by HMRC that a seller is not complying with requirements then we will take appropriate action.\u201d A spokesperson said eBay \u201ccontinually reminds\u201d sellers of their need to comply with the law and had recently warned overseas firms of the UK government\u2019s efforts to deal with VAT fraud.</p> <p>After the Guardian first highlighted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/01/uk-losing-millions-vat-non-eu-sellers-amazon-ebay\">rife VAT evasion on online shopping</a> sites, HMRC launched a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jan/14/tax-inspectors-raid-warehouse-containing-500000-of-illegal-goods\">series of warehouse raids</a>, seizing \u00a3500,000 of goods. Months later, the then chancellor George Osborne gave tax inspectors new powers which <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/508193/HMT_Budget_2016_Web_Accessible.pdf\">he said demonstrated \u201cfirm action to protect the UK market from unfair online competition</a> [from overseas VAT evaders]\u201d.</p> <p>Under the new rules, HMRC now has the power to issue Amazon and eBay with warning notices about suspected VAT fraudsters using their sites.

                "bodyText":"Huge numbers of VAT fraudsters are illegally selling goods tax-free to British shoppers on Amazon and eBay this Christmas, despite new government efforts to crack down on this ballooning \u00a31bn VAT evasion crisis. A Guardian investigation found a wide variety of popular goods being illegally sold without VAT on Britain\u2019s leading shopping sites. They range from cheap Christmas tree lights, electric toothbrushes and thermal socks to expensive laptops, iPads, music keyboards, violins and pingpong tables. In some cases, VAT fraudsters offer unbeatable prices. Mostly, however, their prices remain in line with law-abiding competitors and the proceeds of evasion disappear overseas, often to China. Guardian investigations found many tax-evading sellers were trading without displaying VAT numbers on Amazon or eBay. Others were showing made up numbers, or numbers cloned, without authorisation, from unsuspecting legitimate businesses. Several sellers purported to be operating through UK trading companies, but checks showed these firms had been dissolved, sometimes years earlier. None responded to questions about VAT. HMRC estimates the explosion in VAT fraud on Britain\u2019s shopping websites will cost \u00a31bn to \u00a31.5bn in lost VAT revenues this year, with much of it going missing in the current festive period. By the end of \u201cCyber Monday\u201d. UK shoppers will have spent \u00a36.77bn on the web in a seven-day shopping binge that peaked on Black Friday, according to online retail association IMRG. The number of parcels ordered online will be up 12% on last year, it estimates. The market for many goods is now dominated by overseas sellers. On eBay, for example, 40% of UK sales of Android phones are to firms registered in China. Meanwhile, Chinese-based companies account for more than 60% of sales of Christmas tree fairy lights on eBay.co.uk. There is no suggestion that Amazon or eBay have themselves evaded tax, but critics claim they could make some basic changes \u2013 such as requiring sellers to display valid VAT numbers \u2013 that would help to stop their websites being used by many overseas companies as a platform for industrial-scale fraud. Both eBay and Amazon insist that it is not their responsibility to police tax compliance among sellers. VAT rules are complex but the tax generally applies to most goods supplied from locations in the UK even if the seller company is incorporated overseas. Shoppers typically see prices that include VAT, charged on most goods at the standard rate of 20%. Amazon told the Guardian: \u201cMarketplace sellers are independent businesses responsible for complying with their own VAT obligations.\u201d It added that Amazon does offer tools sellers can use to help with tax compliance, but \u201cwe don\u2019t have the authority to review their tax affairs\u201d. EBay said it would pass information from the Guardian\u2019s investigation to HMRC: \u201cIf we are informed by HMRC that a seller is not complying with requirements then we will take appropriate action.\u201d A spokesperson said eBay \u201ccontinually reminds\u201d sellers of their need to comply with the law and had recently warned overseas firms of the UK government\u2019s efforts to deal with VAT fraud. After the Guardian first highlighted rife VAT evasion on online shopping sites, HMRC launched a series of warehouse raids, seizing \u00a3500,000 of goods. Months later, the then chancellor George Osborne gave tax inspectors new powers which he said demonstrated \u201cfirm action to protect the UK market from unfair online competition [from overseas VAT evaders]\u201d. Under the new rules, HMRC now has the power to issue Amazon and eBay with warning notices about suspected VAT fraudsters using their sites. If they then fail to take action, Amazon and eBay can be held liable for any VAT that later goes missing. In reality, however, these changes have had little impact and VAT evasion remains widespread. A spokesperson for VATfraud.org, a campaign group set up by UK-based sellers, said: \u201cDespite the new laws, HMRC have shown a woeful lack of action. There are many fraudsters who were reported to HMRC years ago but are still trading, and evading VAT, today.\u201d Guardian investigations found Amazon even offering extensive support services at its British warehouses to overseas sellers that were doing little to mask their VAT evasion. As well as advertising these sellers\u2019 goods on Amazon.co.uk, it holds items in Amazon UK warehouses, arranges delivery to addresses across Britain, and deals with complaints and returned goods. Amazon warehouse staff even offer gift-wrapping services on behalf of the fraudster sellers. There is no suggestion Amazon or eBay knowingly facilitate specific fraudulent VAT-free sales, but the two US groups are nevertheless well aware that evasion in online shopping is a major problem. Meanwhile, the sellers themselves are often based overseas, with little or nothing known about their UK sales activities by HMRC. One such seller, a company based in Dubai, offered an iPad Air 2 for sale on Amazon.co.uk. The iPad was sold at \u00a3456.68, which was a similar price to that on offer at Apple\u2019s own online store. However, the Apple store price included a \u00a378.17 VAT charge while the Dubai-based Amazon seller charged no VAT at all. Asked for a VAT receipt, the iPad seller said in an email: \u201cWe don\u2019t supply UK VAT receipt, sorry.\u201d Many sellers contacted by the Guardian were similarly open about not charging VAT. \u201cThank you for your letter and sorry to tell you we do not have UK VAT receipt. We are located in China,\u201d said one. \u201cOur VAT is still in the application,\u201d said another. A third seller even offered to cut a deal, offering to share part of the proceeds of the VAT fraud. \u201cIf you want the VAT receipt, it will be after your purchase a week later. Otherwise, we will offer some discount to you directly,\u201d the seller said in an email. \u201cLooking forward to your reply.\u201d",

                "bodyText":"OK, time for a brisk recap. 1) America\u2019s economy is performing even better than expected; growth in the last quarter has been revised up to a 3.2% annual rate, from 2.9%. Consumer spending, investment and exports all helped to push GDP up. Analysts say the figures show the US is in fairly robust shape, making a December interest rate rise even more likely. 2) There\u2019s deadlock in Vienna tonight, as Opec ministers struggle to make headway towards a deal to cut production. Iran has thrown down the gauntlet, saying it will not reduce its output and suggesting Saudi Arabia takes the hit itself. The oil price has slumped by 3.5% tonight, as the markets prepare for tomorrow\u2019s Opec meeting. 3) Investors are bracing for volatility as Italy heads to the polls on Sunday to vote on PM Matteo Renzi\u2019s constitutional reforms. ECB sources have hinted that they would use their QE programme to stabilise the markets on Monday, if the public vote No -- a move that could prompt Renzi\u2019s resignation. Adam Chester, head of economics for commercial banking at Lloyds Bank, predicts turbulence if Renzi loses (as seems likely): Italy is being asked whether to accept a broad package of measures aimed at making the country\u2019s gridlocked political system more efficient and its government more stable. It has had more than 60 governments since the Second World War, so one might think that measures to improve stability would be strongly welcomed. But a key implication of the proposed changes is that incumbents would have far more power, which is strongly resisted by opposition parties, and there is a clear risk that the people will vote against the government, particularly given the weakness of Italy\u2019s economy. If the referendum is not passed \u2013 and the polls suggest a \u2018No\u2019 win \u2013 Prime Minister Renzi could step down, leading to early elections and boosting the anti-EU Five Star Movement (M5S), which has pledged a referendum on whether Italy should stay in the euro. If Italy votes \u2018No\u2019, the euro is likely to come under immediate downward pressure and contagion could also see government bond and credit spreads across much of Europe rise. 4) Companies have been teaming up with charities for Giving Tuesday: That\u2019s probably all for today. Tomorrow will be extra-busy, with Bank of England stress test results released at 7am GMT, and Opec\u2019s meeting running through the day. See you then. Goodnight! GW Italy\u2019s stock market has defied worries about Sunday\u2019s referendum to close 2% higher. The FTSE MIB index outperformed the rest of Europe, helped by that Reuters report that the ECB would step in to stabilise the markets next week, if needed. The German, French, and Spanish indices also finished the day higher, But the FTSE 100 lost 27 point, or 0.4%, to finish at 6772 - dragged down by energy companies including BP (-2.1%) and Shell (-2%). City traders haven\u2019t been impressed by the lack of progress at Opec\u2019s meeting in Vienna today: Joshua Mahoney of IG says: Despite an initial consensus, a deal feels as far away as ever, with members continuing to conduct an intricate game of political poker, utilising the media to further their cause. It is becoming increasingly evident that some of the more prominent OPEC members care more about holding on to market share than helping raise the price of oil. Hence despite agreeing to a production cut, we have seen the likes of Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran all continue to raise production. In another signal that America\u2019s economy is solid, sales of recreational vehicles are on track to hit their highest level in four decades. Shipments of new RVs are expected to hit 419,500 this year, industry figures say, up 12% on last year. These whopping motorhomes and trailers are, apparently, popular with Millennials who want to get into the Great Outdoors in some comfort. But....these things don\u2019t come cheap. A typical RV will cost six-figures,. You could even splash out one million dollars if, say, you want large beds, flat screen TVs and space for your own sports car.... Meanwhile in Greece... Athens has received an unexpected boost ahead of next week\u2019s meeting of eurozone finance ministers (the eurogroup). Our correspondent Helena Smith reports. The Dutch finance minister and eurogroup head Jeroen Dijsselbloem has not always batted for Greece but today he came out firmly in favour of Athens\u2019 longstanding argument that primary surplus targets set by international creditors in the years ahead are simply unachievable. Addressing the European Parliament\u2019s economic affairs committee, the Dutchman suggested it would be counter-productive if Greece was given unrealistic fiscal targets once its current bailout program expires in 2018. \u201cWe need to be realistic\u201d he said adding that it would be a big ask if Athens was made to pull off the herculean task of achieving a 3.5% primary surplus when its fiscal adjustment program was finally completed. Djisselbloem\u2019s comments come in the wake of similar optimism expressed by visiting European Economic Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici. Conducting a two-day visit to Athens ahead of next week\u2019s euro group, the Frenchman also voiced support for the leftist-led government\u2019s bid to secure debt relief saying reprofiling of the unustainable load should also begin by year\u2019s end. At over \u20ac300bn, or 180% of GDP, Greece\u2019s debt burden is the biggest in Europe and widely viewed as the root of its financial woes. But demands for more austerity still loom large and could threaten to overturn economic progress in the months ahead. Back in Vienna, the UAE\u2019s oil minister has told energy reporters that Opec could still achieve a deal to cut output tomorrow. Suhail Mohamed Faraj Al Mazrouei said it was premature to assume that the cartel would fail, despite the clashes between Saudi Arabia and Iran behind the scenes. Amena Bakr of Energy Intelligence has the details (again): After the excesses of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, British business has been showing its charitable side today. For the third year running, voluntary bodies have been working with companies to encourage people to give money, or time, to good causes - from cancer charities to Syrian aid. Some 1,500 UK-based businesses and charities are taking part this year, including BT - which hosted an event at its iconic Tower this morning - Royal Mail, Royal Bank of Scotland, and several retailers including Morrisons, Sainsbury\u2019s, and the Co-op. The idea started in the 2012 in America, and last year, it raised over $45m worldwide. The Charities Aid Foundation is co-ordinating it in the UK. They\u2019ve sent some details over: A choir of MPs singing Christmas carols on College Green to raise money to support the work of doctors in Aleppo, as part of the Singing for Syrians appeal. MPs taking part included Victoria Prentis, Will Quince, Robert Buckland, Andrea Jenkyns and Eilidh Whiteford. Pictures are available on request.

CAF\u2019s Hannah Terrey has written about it for us here: And there\u2019s a new-fangled Twitter Moment too.... An Opec source has now told Reuters that Iran want Saudi Arabia to cut its output to 9.5m barrels per day, from around 10.5m today. That means Saudi would be taking the entire one million barrel per day cut which was provisionally agreed in September in Algeria. That may be unacceptable to Riyadh -- both economically and politically.... The Opec situation in a brisk nutshell: These latest comments out of Vienna show that Iraq and Iran are at odds with Saudi Arabia over the proposed Opec output cut. The hardline stance from Iran\u2019s Zangenah shows that Tehran is not willing to curb its own output. The situation is complicated; there\u2019s no real agreement on how much Iran is actually pumping today! So Saudi Arabia are effectively being challenged to swallow the output cut themselves, while other cartel members would simply benefit from the resulting higher prices. Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 latest dispatch from the Opec HQ: OPEC sources told Reuters a meeting of experts in Vienna on Monday failed to bridge differences between OPEC\u2019s de factol eader, Saudi Arabia, and the group\u2019s second- and third-largest producers over the mechanics of output cuts. \u201cWe will leave the level of production (where) we decided in Algeria,\u201d Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh told reporters upon arrival in Vienna, effectively signalling he was not prepared to reduce output. OPEC, which accounts for a third of global oil production, agreed in September to cap output at around 32.5-33.0 million barrels per day versus the current 33.64 million bpd to prop up oil prices, which have halved since mid-2014. OPEC said it would exempt Iran, Libya and Nigeria from cutsas their output has been crimped by unrest and sanctions. The deal was seen as a victory for Iran. Tehran has long argued it wants to raise production to regain market share lost under Western sanctions, when its political arch-rival SaudiArabia increased output. In recent weeks, Riyadh offered to cut its own output by 500,000 barrels per day, according to OPEC sources, and suggested Iran limit production at around 3.8 million bpd - in line with or slightly above the country\u2019s current output. But Tehran has sent mixed signals including that it wanted to produce 4.2 million bpd. Here\u2019s a video clip of the scrum (or possibly rolling maul) which greeted Iran\u2019s oil minister, Bijan Namdar Zanganeh, as he arrived in Vienna. Listen out for the breaking vase! There is high drama in Vienna, where Iran\u2019s oil minister has declared that his country will NOT cut oil production. Bijan Namdar Zanganeh told a heaving throng of oil reporters that Iran would stick to the production levels set earlier this year, and would not accept any output cuts. That\u2019s a blow to Opec\u2019s chances of finalising a deal to cut production levels at tomorrow\u2019s official meeting in Vienna. And Bloomberg is now reporting that Saudi will reject a deal, unless Iran and Iraq agree to a compromise These comments have sent the Brent crude oil price plunging by over 3% to 46.51 per barrel, down over 1.5 dollars. The press scrum also sent a vase flying to the floor of Opec\u2019s hotel foyer -- the second broken vase in as many days! As we covered earlier, Indonesia\u2019s oil minister had also told reporters that he\u2019s not optimistic about a deal this week. FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga says traders aren\u2019t confident either: Reports of Russia not attending the OPEC gathering has dented hopes of a meaningful deal while concerns of Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia failing to bridge their differences continues to encourage sellers to attack oil. The US Federal Reserve is now even more likely to hike interest rates next month, says Ian Kernohan, Economist at Royal London Asset Management: \u201cRobust US GDP growth in the third quarter, driven by household demand, was a marked improvement on the first half of the year. \u201cThis should bolster the case for a rise in US interest rates in December. We think the Fed will wait until they see the scale and timing of any Trumpflation fiscal boost, before altering their language about gradual rate hikes.\u201d Today\u2019s growth figures are a sign that America has recovered from a slow start to 2016, says the FT\u2019s Adam Samson. The data released on Tuesday confirm that the economy expanded in the third quarter at the fastest rate in two years, representing a sharp pick-up from the 0.8 per cent and 1.4 per cent pace logged in the first and second quarters, respectively. Consumption growth, a key element of US economic output, was revised higher to a 2.8 per cent pace, from the previous reading of 2.1 per cent. FT: US GDP revision confirms strengthening recovery The Wall Street Journal is impressed by the pick-up in corporate profits: Tuesday\u2019s report also showed that a key measure of U.S. corporate profits increased for the third consecutive quarter. Profits after tax, without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments, rose 3.5% from the second quarter to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.694 trillion in the third quarter. Compared with a year earlier, after-tax profits rose 5.2% last quarter, the strongest annual reading since the fourth quarter of 2012. WSJ: US GDP Growth Revised Up to Strongest Expansion in Two Years Christopher Vecchio of DailyFX reckons growth will continue to accelerate in the current quarter. Breaking! America\u2019s economy grew even faster than expected in the last three months. US GDP rose by an annualised rate of 3.2% in the July to September quarter, up from the first estimate of 2.9%, according to new data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). This is the fastest growth rate since the third quarter of 2014, thanks to stronger consumer spending, exports (especially soybeans!) and federal government spending. That equates to a quarterly expansion of around 0.8% - which means America comfortably outpaced Britain, which only grew by 0.5%, and Germany and France (which both grew by a mere 0.2%). The Commerce Department says: The acceleration in real GDP in the third quarter primarily reflected an upturn in private inventory investment, an acceleration in exports, an upturn in federal government spending, and smaller decreases in state and local government spending and residential fixed investment, that were partly offset by a deceleration in PCE (personal consumption), an acceleration in imports, and a deceleration in nonresidential fixed investment. Italian government bonds are strengthening, on the back of that report that the ECB would step in if the public reject Renzi\u2019s constitutional changes on Sunday. The yield, or interest rate, on its 10-year debt has dropped to 1.97%, down from 2.06% earlier. That means investors see the bonds as less risky. And bank stocks are pushing higher too; up 2.4%. Eric Lascelles, chief economist at RBC Global Asset Management, argues that Sunday\u2019s vote won\u2019t trigger a major crisis. While there is the possibility of a slippery slope involving a snap election, a victory by the Eurosceptic Five Star Movement and then very real questions about Italy\u2019s ongoing membership in the Eurozone, it is more likely that an election is averted, with a good chance that Renzi will be reappointed as Prime Minister. Even in the context of an election, it isn\u2019t clear that the Five Star Movement would be able to govern by itself. In the less likely scenario that the referendum passes, this would enable the Italian government to move more briskly on many much-needed structural economic reforms. Insiders at the European Central Bank have told Reuters that they\u2019d step in and buy more Italian bonds, if Sunday\u2019s referendum leads to short-term market volatility. The ECB could use \u201cflexibility\u201d in its existing quantitative easing scheme to mop up extra Italian debt and prevent prices slumping, as investors digest the result of the vote. However, if Italy requires longer-term help, it will have to seek a formal bailout. Reuters says: The ECB could use its 80-billion-euro ($84.8 billion) monthly bond-buying programme to counter any immediate, further spike in bond yields after the vote, smoothing market moves and supporting bonds, according to four euro zone central bank sources who asked not to be named. The sources added the scheme was flexible enough to allow for a temporary increase in Italian purchases and that such a move would not necessarily need to be rubber-stamped by the ECB\u2019s Governing Council, which is due to meet on December 8 to decide on whether to keep buying bonds after March. But they stressed this would be limited to days or weeks, to counter any immediate market volatility, because the asset-purchase programme was designed to shore up inflation and economic growth in the entire euro zone and was not intended to fight crises in individual countries. Newsflash from America: Jewellery chain Tiffany &amp; Co has admitted that its flagship store in New York has suffered from being sited next to Donald Trump\u2019s headquarters. Tiffany has told shareholders that it has suffered \u201csome adverse effect on traffic\u201d, due to \u201crecent election-related activity\u201d near its New York store. That store is on the corner of 5th Avenue and 57th Street, adjacent to Trump Tower, meaning access has been affected by the protests against the president-elect. Tiffany also warns that it can\u2019t provide any assurance that sales won\u2019t suffer in the crucial Christmas period, or beyond. However, it also emphasises that the store provides less than 10% of its net sales. Tiffany describes its New York shop as \u201csimply the most famous store there is\u201d -- partly thanks to the exploits of Ms Holly Golightly. But it now finds itself right next to a massive security operation. Concrete barriers have been erected outside Trump Tower, and armed police are posted outside, at a reported cost of $1m per day. Security is likely to be extremely tight on 5th Avenue throughout Trump\u2019s tenure as president, depending how much time he spends at the Tower. His wife Melania, and son Barron, are expected to stay there until at least the end of the school year, and will require constant protection. The New York Daily News reported two weeks ago that the US secret service wants to close 5th Avenue down when the president is in situ, which would clearly be bad news for local shops. And the New York Post reports that local restaurants have suffered from falling sales. Willie Degel, founder of Uncle Jack\u2019s Steakhouse on 56th Street and Sixth Avenue, fumed: \u201cIt has been a complete nightmare. Pedestrian foot traffic is down tremendously. Everybody in the area is suffering.\u201d The good news for Tiffany\u2019s is that worldwide net sales increased 1% in the last three months. Here\u2019s its third-quarter results. Austria could also contribute to eurozone worries this weekend, when voters head to the polls to choose a new president. It\u2019s a straight fight between far-right candidate Nobert Hofer, of the Freedom Party, and Alexander Van der Bellen, a former leader of the Greens Party. Van der Bellen is running on a pro-EU platform, saying voters have a choice between \u201ca co-operative and an authoritarian style.\u201d As we\u2019re still in 2016, this may be tempting fate.... This vote was originally due to take place in September, but was postposed when the glue on some postal votes failed (very 2016!). Carlo Alberto de Casa, Chief Analyst at ActivTrades, says traders will be watching events closely: We are seeing a weight of pressure on the euro due to the Italian Referendum and the re-run of the Austrian presidential vote, both taking place this weekend. They could impact the euro significantly. The oil price is sliding as Opec members struggle to reach an accord before Wednesday\u2019s make-or-break meeting. Indonesia\u2019s energy minister has sparked the selloff, by telling reporters in Vienna that he\u2019s \u201cnot optimistic\u201d that the cartel will agree a supply cuts deal tomorrow. Brent crude is currently down almost one dollar per barrel at $47.37, a 1.8% decline. Indonesia are only a small player, but traders are clearly desperate for any smoke signals from the Opec HQ. The success, or failure, of Opec\u2019s meeting appears to depend on Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq. Analysts reckon that the authorities in Tehran and Baghdad has hoped that Riyadh would swallow the proposed output cuts itself, allowing them to keep pumping. But Saudi are taking a harder line -- even though their economy is suffering badly from the low oil price. Veteran Opec analyst Yasser Elguindi of Medley Global Advisors dubs it a poker game: \u201cThe stakes are extremely high, and everyone seems to be upping the ante. The thing with poker though is you can win even if you have a weak hand. But right now its hard to know who is bluffing and who is holding aces.\u201d Britain\u2019s farming industry is facing a labour shortage as foreign fruit and veg pickers leave the UK following the EU referendum. The Financial Times reports that half the firms who supply workers to the horticulture sector couldn\u2019t find enough labour in the July-September quarter. And the National Farmers Union is getting worried, the FT says: In a letter to Robert Goodwill, the immigration minister, dated November 10 and seen by the FT, Minette Batters, the NFU\u2019s deputy president, warned: \u201cThere is a clear emerging labour crisis in the industry\u201d and \u201ca very real risk that British fruit and vegetables will be left to rot unpicked in British fields in 2017\u201d. Rural areas saw solid support for Leaving the EU in June -- but perhaps farmers didn\u2019t expect \u2018taking back control\u2019 to mean \u2018no-one wants to pick our carrots\u2019. Tax lawyer Jo Maugham points out that the slump in the pound means workers from the eurozone now earn almost 20% less. Anyone who likes a spot of Christmas pud faces further heartache -- the sugar, raisins and butter are now much pricier. The euro has dipped back below \u20ac1.06 this morning, down 0.2%. Caxton FX analyst Alexandra Russell-Oliver blamed \u2018political risks\u2019: The euro may have received some initial support as Fillon won France\u2019s Republican Party\u2019s presidential nomination, before coming under renewed pressure. Political risks remain a downwards pressure on the euro; attention at the moment has largely been on Italy\u2019s constitutional referendum on 4 December. Boom! UK consumers are running up credit at the fastest rate in over a decade, before the credit crunch And people are taking out more mortgages too, in another signal that Brexit uncertainty isn\u2019t hurting consumer confidence yet. Reuters has the details: Consumer credit increased last month by \u00a31.62bn, up from \u00a31.48bn in September and taking the annual growth rate to 10.5%- the strongest since October 2005, Bank of England data showed on Tuesday. Mortgage approvals for house purchases increased to 67,518 in October from 63,594 in September. Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast 65,000 mortgage approvals were made in October. Over in France, statistics body INSEE has confirmed that the economy grew by a lacklustre 0.2% in the third quarter of 2016. That matches the provisional reading; we now also know that consumer spending was flat, investment crept up by 0.2%. Economists believe consumer spending will pick up in the run-up to Christmas -- that could be crucial, with the French presidential election due next spring. After a slow start, Italy\u2019s banking shares have now rallied by 2% today. That may mean investors are a little more hopeful that Italy can ride out this crisis. Erik Nielsen, chief economist at Unicredit, says there\u2019s no chance that the Italian referendum could trigger a Lehman Brothers-style collapse. Speaking on Bloomberg, Nielsen explains that thee Italian banks are too small, and they also have the European Central Bank waiting in the wings to help if needed. Nielsen says investors are anticipating defeat for Renzi on Sunday. Nobody really expects a yes vote, so it\u2019s a question about how close it will be and if those opinion polls from way back are right or wrong. But whatever happens, Italy needs to tackle the under-performing loans that are clogging up its financial sector. As Nielsen puts it: The big, big question is, whichever scenario comes though, can Italy address the question of the medium-sized banks which everyone knows they\u2019ve been dragging their feet on for too long. It\u2019s too early to assume that the Italian people will reject Renzi\u2019s attempts to reform the Senate, says Deutsche Bank. They point out that many voters were undecided last week (before we entered a polling black0out period). They might yet fall behind Renzi\u2019s drive to concentrate political power in the lower house, making it easier to get legislation into law. True... but as Deutsche\u2019s chart shows, the No campaign has been widening its lead for since the summer: Now this is interesting.... Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera is reporting that Matteo Renzi is considering resigning as prime minister even if he wins on Sunday. Under this strategy, Renzi would look to be re-appointed as prime minister with a new government, and broader support in the current parliament. Then he could push through more constitutional reforms, before holding general elections in 2017 and 2018. Here\u2019s Correire\u2019s piece. And here\u2019s Bloomberg\u2019s take: Most European stock markets have fallen in early trading, extending yesterday\u2019s drops, as Italian referendum fears give traders an extra chill. However, the Italian FTSE MIB has actually risen a little after yesterday\u2019s 2% slide (it may only be a cattus mortuus bounce, as the index has lost 28% in the last year). Kit Juckes of Societe Generale predicts nervousness until the weekend: Since we\u2019ll hear no more about the Italian referendum until the event itself, I\u2019m not sure what is supposed to provide clear direction in Europe today. It\u2019s more a case of angst, which probably will, at some point, turn into nervousness sufficient to take the Euro back down. Writing in the Daily Telegraph today, Ambrose Evans-Pritchard warns that Italy could need a \u20ac40bn bailout to patch up its banks. He says markets are bracing for Renzi to be defeated on Sunday, triggering months of political turmoil. Sources in Rome say the Italian government may have to turn to the European Stability Mechanism for a bank rescue, a humiliating and painful course that must be approved by the German Bundestag. It would amount to a partial \u201cTroika\u201dadministration under terms dictated by the EU. One senior Italian banker said: \u201cWe think the banks will have to raise \u20ac40bn in fresh capital. This is going to need an ESM bail-out. The problems in the banks are becoming an excuse to put Italy under an EU programme. \u201cIt won\u2019t happen under Renzi because he won\u2019t be there any longer after a \u2018No\u2019 vote. What we expect is a technocrat government that pushes this through.\u201d More here: Global investors are becoming more concerned that the eurozone could break up, as fears over Italy\u2019s future grow. German research form Sentix reports that almost 20% of investors expect Italy to leave the eurozone in the next 12 months - the highest level since they started polling four years ago. Investors are worried that Matteo Renzi will lose Sunday\u2019s referendum, and concerned about the financial health of the Italian banking sector, says Julien Muller of Sentix. Overall, the chances that a single country leaving the eurozone has risen to 24.1%, well below the peaks over 70% seen at the height of the 2012 crisis. Global stock markets could be rocked next week if the Italian people reject Renzi\u2019s reform plan, says Kathleen Brooks of City Index. She says: A no vote on Sunday is a major event risk for the European financial sector. Up to 8 Italian banks could fail, as Matteo Renzi\u2019s bank bailout programme is likely to be scrapped if he resigns. It is not known what would replace it, or if the European authorities would step in to save the Italian financial system. If not, then the creditworthiness of some of the larger more systemic banks, such as Deutsche Bank, could be at risk. DB has plenty of risks of its own, if the European authorities don\u2019t save Italy\u2019s banking sector, then how could it justify saving Germany\u2019s largest bank? Thus, we could see further declines in DB\u2019s stock price before the week is out. Brooks also points out that referendum opinion polling has been suspended since November 18, creating extra uncertainty: This is likely to increase the tension and nervousness around this referendum, and could keep market volatility high for the rest of this week. The Vix, Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, started to rise on Monday, and we could see further advances in volatility in the coming days, putting pressure on stocks and causing safe havens like the yen and US Treasuries to rally. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Eurozone crisis jitters are returning to the City this morning, as investors worry that the smouldering problems in Italy\u2019s economy are about to burst into life. On Sunday, Italian votes head to the polls to vote on constitutional reforms - and many observers believe they will slap down prime minister Mattio Renzi\u2019s attempts to curb the power of the Senate. That could trigger Renzi\u2019s resignation, and potentially pave the way for radical, anti-Euro Five Star Movement to take power. That could scupper efforts to recapitalise Italy\u2019s banks, which are weighed down by bad loans, and possibly require a full-blown bailout from the European Central Bank. As Laurent Frings, head of credit research at Aberdeen Asset Management, put it: \u201cItaly\u2019s banks are at a critical stage in trying to rebuild their finances and, if Renzi loses the referendum and quits, then those efforts are going to be in deep trouble.\u201d Renzi\u2019s departure isn\u2019t guaranteed, even if he loses his referendum. He could potentially stay on as caretaker PM, but even this would leave Italy looking less stable. Renzi has insisted that political power needs to be more concentrated in the lower house of parliament, and the government, transforming the Senate from a directly elected upper house into a more consultative body representing Italy\u2019s cities and regions. Italian bank shares slid by almost 4% on Monday, dragged down by referendum worries and fears that financial firm Monti Dei Paschi\u2019s rescue plan might falter. Also coming up today... Things are getting frostier, literally and metaphorically, in Vienna ahead of tomorrow\u2019s meeting of the Opec oil cartel. Yesterday, technical talks between Opec members failed to reach a deal on how to cut production. (non-Opec member) Russia has helpfully weighed in, with Vladimir Putin saying it\u2019s important that Opec stabilises the market. In the UK, prime minister Theresa May will announce a crackdown on excessive pay at privately owned companies, to bring them into line with firms floated on the stock market. The announcement is due around lunchtime. Our City editor Jill Treanor has the story: Theresa May is to promise a crackdown on boardroom excess at large privately owned businesses as she unveils proposals intended to hold corporate Britain to account. The prime minister said the government would look at ways to bring privately owned companies under a regime that could mimic the one imposed on major stock market companies. While many private companies were performing well, \u201cwe have, however, seen an irresponsible minority of privately held companies acting carelessly \u2013 leaving employees, customers and pension fund beneficiaries to suffer when things go wrong. \u201cSo we will explore ways to improve and extend good governance across big business so that everybody plays by the same rules and we create an economy that works for everyone, not just the privileged few.\u201d We get a new healthcheck on the French and American economies today. 7.45am GMT: Second estimate of France\u2019s GDP for the third quarter of 2016 (first estimate was 0.2% growth) 1.36pm GMT: Second estimate of US economic growth in Q3 (first estimate was 3.0% annualised growth) Plus, entertainment group Merlin and sausage maker Cranswick are reporting results. And telecoms regulator Ofcom has announced it is \u201cproceeding with a formal notification\u201d to force BT to legally separate its Openreach arm, having been disappointed with progress to date. More on all that shortly...",

The move comes as Europe\u2019s airports, rail freight terminals, and shipping container ports are deluged by record numbers of parcels ordered by Christmas shoppers on sites such as Amazon and eBay. The boom in overseas firms selling goods to Europe has been accompanied by an explosion in VAT fraud. In total, the European commission estimates \u20ac5bn a year is now lost in tax revenues \u2013 a figure that is rising annually at 15-20%. Many import firms are illegally underdeclaring the value of goods as they arrive in the EU, knowing that customs officers are overwhelmed and unable to make proper checks. A study published in May by Copenhagen Economics estimated that more than 60% of goods arriving into the EU with some postal carriers were failing to comply with VAT declaration rules. As well as fraudulent underdeclarations, some importers are able to legitimately avoid VAT if their goods are of low value (\u00a315 or less in the UK). There are about 150m such parcels arriving in Europe each year, all of them purporting to qualify for this low-value VAT exemption. Of these, however, many are believed to be fraudulently declared of low value. On Thursday, the commission will promise to bring this heavily exploited VAT exemption to an end.
